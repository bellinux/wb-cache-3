In this paper an {{algorithm is proposed}} for buffer cache management with prefetching. The buffer cache contains two units, the main cache unit and <b>prefetch</b> <b>unit.</b> The sizes of both the units are fixed. The total sizes of both the units are a constant. Blocks are fetched in one block look ahead prefetch principle. The block placement and replacement policies are defined.

40|$|As {{the speed}} of {{microprocessors}} increases at a breath-taking rate, the gap between processor and memory system performance is getting worse. To alleviate this problem, all modern processors contain caches, but even using caches, processors cannot achieve their peak performance. We propose a mechanism, smart caching, which extends the power of conventional memory subsystems by including a <b>prefetch</b> <b>unit.</b> This <b>prefetch</b> <b>unit</b> is responsible for efficiently using the available memory bandwidth by fetching memory data before they are actually needed. Prefetching allows high-level application knowledge to increase memory performance, which is currently constraining the performance of most systems. While prefetching does not reduce the latency of memory accesses, it hides this latency by overlapping memory access and instruction execution. 1 Introduction In recent years, the memory system has been starting to constrain overall system performance, as new architecture styles were intro [...] ...|$|E

For best performance, hardware <b>prefetching</b> <b>units</b> of processors should be complemented with software prefetch instructions. A cache simulation enhanced with a hardware prefetcher is presented to run code for a 3 D multigrid solver. Thus, cache misses not predicted can be handled via insertion of prefetch instructions. Additionally, Interleaved Block Prefetching (IBPF), is presented. Measurements show its potential. ...|$|R
40|$|Linked data {{structures}} (LDSs), such as {{lists and}} trees, are easy and useful programming tools and are abundant in many modem applications. Unfortunately, {{they use a}} lot of memory and are difficult to prefetch. With the current trend of memory access being the main bottleneck in microprocessors, it has become increasingly important to develop a more cache-effective architecture to support LDS usage. Most prior research in LDS prefetching is based around compiler- or software-based techniques. This thesis presents a new approach to prefetching linked data structures involving a hardware <b>prefetching</b> <b>unit</b> in-between the level 1 (L 1) and level 2 (L 2) data caches and a physical address pointer cache. One goal is to show that making nodes and pointers an intrinsic type understood by the hardware can improve prefetching effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an instruction cache prefetching mechanism capable of prefetching past branches in multiple-issue processors. Such processors at high clock rates often use small instruction caches which have significant miss rates. Prefetching from secondary cache can hide the instruction cache miss penalties {{but only if}} initiated sufficiently {{far ahead of the}} current program counter. Existing instruction cache prefetching methods are strictly sequential and cannot do that due to their inability to prefetch past branches. By keeping branch history and branch target addresses we predict a future PC several branches past the current branch. We describe a possible prefetching architecture and evaluate its accuracy, the impact of the instruction prefetching on performance, and its interaction with sequential prefetching. For a 4 issue processor and a cache architecture patterned after the DEC Alpha- 21164 we show that our <b>prefetching</b> <b>unit</b> can be more effective than sequential prefetching [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the control circuit for an asynchronousfrom the earlier AMULET processors. Most notable among the changes are {{the use of a}} Harvard {{architecture}} to increase memory bandwidth and the inclusion of a reorder buffer to handle data forwarding and memory faults. To cope with the former change, the instruction <b>prefetch</b> <b>unit</b> and the data interface are decoupled, whereas they were combined in the com-plex single address unit in AMULET 2 e. This paper is confined to describing asynchronous control circuit design in the instruction prefetch unit; readers having interests in other aspects of AMULET 3 are referred to a related paper [11]. As in the previous AMULET processors, the architectural design is based on an asyn-chronous Micropipeline [7] structure using four-phase [8] control signals.

30|$|The {{instruction}} fetching {{is often}} decoupled {{from the main}} memory or the instruction cache by a <b>prefetch</b> <b>unit.</b> This unit fills the prefetch queue with instructions independently of the main pipeline. This form of prefetching {{is especially important for}} a variable length instruction set as the x 86 ISA or the bytecode instructions of the Java virtual machine (JVM). The fill status of the prefetch queue depends {{on the history of the}} instruction stream. The possible length of this history is unbounded. To model this queue for a WCET tool, we need to cut the maximum history and assume an empty queue at such a cut point.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cache {{optimizations}} typically include code transformations {{to increase}} the locality of memory accesses. An orthogonal approach is to enable for latency hiding by introducing prefetching techniques. With software prefetching, cache load instructions have to be inserted into the program code. To overcome this complexity for the programmer, modern processers are equipped with hardware <b>prefetching</b> <b>units</b> which predict future memory accesses in order to automatically load data into cache before its use. For optimal performance, it seems advantageous to combine both prefetching approaches. In this contribution, we first use a cache simulation enhanced with a simple hardware prefetcher to run code for a 3 D multigrid solver. Cache misses which are not predicted by the prefetcher can be located in simulation results, and selectively, software prefetch instructions can be inserted. However, when performance of a code section is limited by available bandwidth to main memory, this simple strategy will fail. Thus, we use Block Prefetching, {{an extension of the}} standard blocking strategy. Meassurements show its potential. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{technique for}} alleviating the memory bottleneck is data prefetching. Data prefetching solutions ranging from pure software approach by inserting prefetch instructions through program analysis to purely hardware mechanisms have been proposed. The {{degrees of success}} of those techniques are dependent {{on the nature of}} the applications. The need for innovative approach is rapidly growing with the introduction of applications such as object-oriented applications that show dynamically changing memory access behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the use of data prefetchers that are trained off-line using smart learning algorithms to produce prediction models which captures hidden memory access patterns. Once built, those prediction models are loaded into a data <b>prefetching</b> <b>unit</b> in the CPU at the appropriate point during the runtime to drive the prefetching. On average by using table size of about 8 KB size, we were able to achieve prediction accuracy of about 68 % through our own proposed learning method and performance was boosted about 37 % on average on the benchmarks we tested. Furthermore, we believe our proposed framework is amenable to other predictors and can be done as a phase of the profiling-optimizing-compiler...|$|R

40|$|We present two VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) designs. The {{first one}} in this thesis is the digital Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) design, and the second one is the <b>prefetch</b> <b>unit</b> of ARM processor. The {{improvement}} of CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon) process technology makes the VLSI system operate {{at a very high}} speed in recent years. In high-speed synchronous systems, the clock skews may make the system clock asynchronous among storage elements and thus affect the system operation. As a result, clock alignment circuits are necessary. DLL is a good clock alignment circuit that synchronizes the clocks inside and outside a chip in a synchronous system. It can be implemented in analog or digital circuit. Digital DLLs are preferred over analog ones because they are easy to design and portable over various processes. In this thesis we present an all-digital DLL design that can operate at 400 MHz. There are two advantages of this design. First, it is all-digital, and there are no analog devices in the circuit. Second, its structure is simpler, and thus the final silicon area will be smaller. The <b>prefetch</b> <b>unit</b> is used to predict and fetch instructions before they are actually used so that the idle cycles due to instruction fetch can be reduced. The architecture and implementation of an ARM <b>prefetch</b> <b>unit</b> is presented {{in the second part of}} this thesis. 本論文分為兩個主題：第一部分是數位延遲鎖定迴路的研究與實作，第二部分是ARM微處理器的預先讀取單元之設計。 CMOS半導體製程技術的快速成長使得超大型積體電路之運作時脈頻率快速增加。在高速運作的同步系統中，時脈偏斜所造成時脈不同步的現象嚴重威脅系統運作的正確性。因此，時脈校正電路是必要的。 延遲鎖定迴路是解決同步系統中電路內部時脈與外部時脈不同步的一種時脈校正電路。電路設計方法可採類比式設計也可採數位式設計。數位式延遲鎖定迴路的優點為易於設計，且可移植到不同的製程。本篇論文提出一個全數位式可於時脈頻率為 400 MHz的同步系統下校正時脈的全數位式延遲鎖定迴路。相較於以前提出的延遲鎖定迴路，本方法的優點為：（ 1 ）全數位式電路，無任何類比元件；（ 2 ）結構簡單，故面積較小。 預先讀取單元是用來預先讀取連續的指令以減少微處理機閒置的時間。在本論文中我們詳述了此單元的微架構及實作，其邏輯閘層亦驗證無誤。第一章 簡介……………………………………………………………… [...] … 1 1. 1 研究動機……………………………………………………………… [...] 1 1. 2 內容大綱……………………………………………………………… [...] 2 第二章 背景知識……………………………… [...] …… [...] ………… [...] ……… [...] . 3 2. 1 系統時序……………………………………………………………… [...] 3 2. 2 延遲鎖定迴路之概念………………………………………………… [...] 7 2. 3 文獻中相關之研究…………………………………………………… [...] 8 第三章 系統架構分析…………………………………………… [...] ………. 11 3. 1 延遲路徑……………………………………………………………… 12 3. 1. 1 延遲線元件………………………………………………………. 12 3. 1. 2 相位攪拌器………………………………………………………. 14 3. 1. 3 多工器與時脈樹…………………………………………………. 19 3. 2 相位偵測器…………………………………………………………… 20 3. 3 鎖定控制電路………………………………………………………… 21 第四章 實驗結果分析…………………………………. … [...] ……………. 24 4. 1 延遲路徑之模擬……………………………………………………… 24 4. 1. 1 延遲線元件之模擬………………………………………………. 24 4. 1. 2 相位攪拌器之模擬………………………………………………. 26 4. 1. 3 多工器之模擬……………………………………………………. 28 4. 2 相位偵測器之模擬…………………………………………………… 30 4. 3 鎖定控制電路與整體之模擬………………………………………… 32 第五章 ARM 8 核心處理器之預先讀取單元………………… [...] … [...] … [...] . 40 5. 1 電路微架構描述……………………………………………………… 40 5. 1. 1 預測分支策略……………………………………………………. 40 5. 1. 2 訊號描述…………………………………………………………. 41 5. 2 電路內部描述………………………………………………………… 43 5. 2. 1 電路內部方塊描述………………………………………………. 43 5. 2. 2 Branch FSM & Fetch方塊之描述……………………………. …. 46 5. 2. 3 緩衝區控制電路………………………………………………. … 49 5. 3 實作………………………………………………………………… [...] 51 第六章 結論與未來工作………………………………………………… [...] 52 參考文獻…………………………………………………………………… [...] 5...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{computing}} systems gain {{performance by}} several means such as increased parallelism through using Chip-level Multiprocessor (CMP) systems. Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) systems use uniform processing cores {{to form a}} CMP in which all cores are identical in every aspect. Conversely, Asymmetric Multiprocessor (AMP) systems consist of processing cores with variable configurations such as different cache configurations, co-processors, and cache sizes. AMP systems coupled with such smart scheduling algorithms can improve resource utilization while maintaining overall system performance because real-time profiling in a computing system using light-weight hardware profilers can help smart scheduling algorithms make meaningful decisions. In other words, the vision into an application’s behavior helps in the decision making process on how to allocate available resources for different applications without penalizing the performance by putting too much overhead on the system. Currently, there is no AMP research framework available {{that allows us to}} look into asymmetry in processing systems.

The cache and <b>prefetch</b> <b>unit</b> generates the order of first occurrence of each memory block for a given set of image warping parameters online. This order is stored locally and subsequently used to fill the cache blocks optimally. Additionally, the total number of pixel accesses for each block is generated whenever a new set of parameters is loaded and stored in a lookup table. During operation, the current number of pixel accesses is counted for each of the currently used cache blocks. If the number of current pixel accesses matches the predetermined total number of accesses, this cache block can be updated with a new memory block. If the cache memory is configured to hold enough lines, no memory block needs to be read more than once using this caching strategy. To be able to read four values from cache in parallel, we subdivide the cache into four parallel cache blocks and store values column and row interleaved, since the bilinear interpolation always requires 2 -by- 2 blocks.|$|E
