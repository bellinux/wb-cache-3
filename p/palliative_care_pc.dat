40|$|Context: A Consumer Quality Index (CQ-index) is a {{questionnaire}} assessing the actual care experiences {{and how important}} the recipient finds certain care aspects, {{as well as the}} priorities for improving quality. A CQ-index <b>Palliative</b> <b>Care</b> (CQ-index <b>PC)</b> for bereaved relatives was developed to measure the quality of <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Objectives: This article provides insight into the development and psychometric characteristics of this questionnaire, as well as quality improvement priorities. Methods: The content of the CQ-index PC was based on existing questionnaires, literature, and interviews and focus group discussions with relatives, patients, and caregivers. The questionnaire was tested in 31 <b>care</b> facilities providing <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Close relatives/contact persons of patients who died non-suddenly six weeks to six months earlier were eligible for inclusion. Psychometric analyses were performed to shorten the questionnaire and to assess its reliability. "Need for improvement scores" also were computed to identify care aspects with the highest priority for quality improvement. Results: Three hundred ninety-two bereaved relatives were eligible for inclusion. The net response was 52 % (n = 204). Psychometric analyses resulted in six scales (Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0. 71 to 0. 90). The quality aspects relatives considered most important were dying peacefully, getting help in good time in acute situations, and personal attention. Aftercare was the aspect with the highest priority for quality improvement. Conclusion: The CQ-index PC for relatives can be used to assess the quality of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> from the perspective of bereaved relatives. This instrument gives health care professionals insight into care aspects with the highest priority for quality improvement. © 2013 U. S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee. Published by Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background: <b>Palliative</b> <b>care</b> is {{a support}} system to help people live {{actively}} until they die. Current policy aims to integrate rehabilitation and goal setting as mechanisms to help professionals to support patients to do this, {{but there is little}} agreement about what this means in practice. No theory based framework currently exists to help <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> professionals consistently work with patients to identify and work towards goals. This thesis describes how a framework for goal setting and action planning in <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> (G-AP <b>PC)</b> was developed and implemented systematically in one hospice. Research aims: 1. 	To synthesise published literature regarding goal setting in <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> settings. 2. 	To investigate current goal setting practice in one hospice setting. 3. 	To develop and evaluate a theory and evidence-based goal setting intervention for <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> settings. Study design This study is placed in the ‘development and feasibility’ phases of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions. The intervention (G-AP PC) was systematically developed. Firstly a rigorous investigation of current practice was conducted by synthesising the literature on the subject, and investigating current goal setting practice in one hospice setting. These findings informed the development of a theory-based Goal setting and Action Planning practice framework (G-AP PC) which was then implemented and evaluated in one hospice in-patient unit. Normalization Process Theory (NPT) was used to structure the development and evaluation of the intervention. Findings: Goal setting with patients is recognised as important within <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> but is poorly conceptualised and lacks a theory and evidence-base for its practice. G-AP PC was successfully developed, implemented and evaluated in one hospice setting. Findings demonstrate that G-AP PC is acceptable and feasible for use by professionals and patients alike. It helped professionals to work as a team; shift their attention from symptoms/problems/risk to patient’s goals; act on what patients wanted to achieve, within short timescales and document patients goals appropriately. Patients reported that use of G-AP PC allowed them to focus on goals that were important to them. There was also evidence that goal setting helped increase patients’ motivation and self-efficacy. Conclusions: G-AP PC is a feasible and acceptable intervention. The study has demonstrated that the interventions can increase patient centred goal setting and motivates both patients and staff to work towards and achieve patient goals that are not only about controlling symptoms but also about engaging in meaningful activities, enabling patients to live actively until they die...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Consumer Quality Index <b>Palliative</b> <b>Care</b> (CQ-index <b>PC)</b> is a {{structured}} questionnaire {{for measuring the}} quality of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> {{from the perspective of}} care users. CQ-indices assess which care aspects need quality improvement by relating answers about actual care experiences to answers about the importance of certain aspects of care. Methods: To improve the chance that the new instrument has good content validity, a literature study and individual and group discussions were performed, and a steering committee was consulted to establish the instrument’s face and content validity. The questionnaire was administered to patients with a life expectancy of 6 months or less and/or who were receiving palliative treatment. Descriptive analyses were carried out on the items about actual care experiences and the importance of care aspects, and on ‘need for improvement’ scores. Results: 15 care organisations participated. 133 patients met the inclusion criteria (net response n= 85). Patients considered the following aspects the most important: ‘offering help in good time in acute situations’, ‘caregivers having the necessary expertise’ and ‘caregivers taking the patient seriously’. The three care aspects with the highest ‘need for improvement’ scores were: ‘support when the patient feels depressed’, ‘support when the patient is anxious’ and ‘support when the patient has shortness of breath’. Conclusions: The CQ-index PC provides opportunities for care organisations to assess which care aspects have the highest priority for quality improvement within their organisation. Further research is needed to assess whether the instrument has enough discriminative power to assess differences between organisations. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The CQ-index (Consumer Quality-index) is a {{standardized}} approach {{for measuring the}} quality of care from the perspective of care users. A CQ-index always combines 1. questions on actual care experiences and 2. questions on how important certain quality aspects are for respondents. The CQ-index <b>Palliative</b> <b>Care</b> (CQ-index <b>PC)</b> has one version for patients and one for relatives. This presentation will focus on data collected among patients and the main aim is to discuss which quality aspects have high priority for improvement according to patients. Methods: The content of the CQ-index PC was based on literature, three focus groups with care givers and relatives and three individual interviews with patients. The CQ-index PC was administered to patients in various settings (e. g. hospices, at home, hospitals, nursing homes). Inclusion criteria were having a life expectancy of six months or less, or receiving palliative treatment. Descriptive analyses were conducted. Quality improvement scores were analysed using the formula: proportion negative score on experience importance score. Results: 35 care organizations were involved in the study and 133 patients met the inclusion criteria in the inclusion period of 2. 5 months. Eighty-five questionnaires could be used for the analyses (response rate 64 %). The care aspects with the three highest improvement scores were: professional support for depressed mood, anxiety, and dyspnoea. The relatively high improvement scores indicate that <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> providers have to pay most attention to these aspects. In contrast, politeness of care providers, respect for the patient’s life stance, as well as the timely provision of practical aids had relatively low ‘‘improvement scores’’. Conclusion: From a patient perspective, priorities for improvement concern the support of patients with a depressed mood, anxiety and dyspnoea. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{demand for}} hospice <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> (HPC) {{services}} {{is expected to}} grow due to the increasing number of seniors living into advanced old age, the changing nature of death, and the changing family structure. HPC is a philosophy of care that aims to relieve suffering and {{improve the quality of life}} for clients with life-threatening illnesses or end of life issues. The goals of HPC are not only to ameliorate clients’ symptoms but also to reduce unneeded or unwanted medical interventions such as emergency room visits or hospitalizations (ERVH). Hospitals are considered a setting ill-prepared for end of life issues. Therefore, use of such acute care services has to be considered an indicator of poor quality end of life care. It is important to understand the factors that contribute to ERVH in order to determine how to minimize the number of avoidable hospital visits. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to report the proportion of <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> clients with ERVH, describe the characteristics of clients with ERVH, and identify the predisposing, enabling, and need-for-care variables associated with ERVH. Methods: Analysis of secondary data was performed on a <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> dataset from the Hamilton Community Care Access Centre (CCAC). All <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> clients receiving services from the Hamilton branch were assessed using the interRAI <b>Palliative</b> <b>Care</b> (interRAI <b>PC),</b> which is a comprehensive, standardized instrument. One assessment for each client assessed between April 2008 and July 2010 was used, for a final sample size of 764. Results: Half of the <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> clients had one or more ERVH. Visits to the emergency department by time of the day and day of the week were relatively stable. Logistic regression and Cox regression analyses showed that wish to die at home and advance care directives are protective against ERVH. Unstable health, identified by a Changes in Health End stage disease and Signs and Symptoms scale (CHESS) score of 3 or higher, was associated with reduced odds of ERVH, while infections such as prior pneumonia and prior urinary tract infections increased odds of ERVH. Conclusions: Predisposing characteristics (i. e., wish to die at home and advance care directives) are nearly as important as need variables (i. e., CHESS and prior urinary tract infection) in determining ERVH among <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> clients, which challenges the assumption that need variables are the most important determinants of ERVH. There was a lack of significant association between many assessed needs and ERVH, perhaps due to the fluctuating health status among such clients and the stability of measurements. Ongoing assessment of <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> clients is essential in reducing ERVH, as reassessments at specified intervals will allow care and service plans to be adjusted with clients’ changing health needs and end of life preferences...|$|R

Methods: Postal survey of 356 London-based GPs, assessing attitudes towards <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> provision, district nursing and specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> services, and priorities for future service development. Results: Currently, 65 % of GPs were providing <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> to patients on their list; 72 % {{agreed or strongly agreed}} <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> was a central part of their role; and 27 % wanted to hand care over to specialists. Most GPs (66 %) disagreed with the statement that 'palliative care is mainly district nursing (DN) work'. Many were unaware of out-of-hours DN and specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> services. Multi-variable analysis found four GP characteristics - larger practice size, more years experience as a GP, receipt of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> education, and current provision of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> - were associated with agreement that <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> was central to a GP's role.

40|$|BACKGROUND: According to EU policy, {{anyone in}} need of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> {{should be able to}} have access to it. It is {{therefore}} important to investigate which <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> topics are subject to legislation and regulations in Europe and how these are implemented in (national) health care plans. This paper aims to deliver a structured overview of the legislation, existing regulations and the different health <b>care</b> policies regarding <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> in seven European countries. METHODS: In 2008 an inventory of the organisation of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> was developed by the researchers of the Europall project. Included were two open questions about legislation, regulations, and health policy in <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> This questionnaire was completed using <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> experts selected from Belgium, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Additionally, (grey) literature on <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> health policy and regulations from the participating countries was collected to complete the inventory. Comparative analysis of country specific information was performed afterwards. RESULTS: In all countries <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> regulations and policies existed (either in laws, royal decrees, or national policies). An explicit right to <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> was mentioned in the Belgium, French and German law. In addition, access to <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> was mentioned by all countries, varying from explicit regulations to policy intentions in national plans. Also, all countries had a national policy on <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> although sometimes mainly related to national cancer plans.

40|$|Summary: This study {{describes}} {{the role of}} acute hospital <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> nurse consultants and makes recommendations about future directions for the role development of this role. While the <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> nurse consultant role is accepted in the acute setting {{there is little evidence}} or literature about what contributes to the success of this role. A three-phase study was undertaken to describe the role of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> nurse consultants in acute hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. The first phase of the three-phase study, involving in-depth qualitative interviews with the <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> nurse consultants, is reported in this article. Using openended semi-structured questions, 10 <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> nurse consultants were interviewed using open-ended questions about aspects of their role and the interviews were thematically analysed. Four main themes were identified that clarified the role; being the internal link; being the lynch pin; being responsive and being challenged. The <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> nurse consultants were the first point of introduction to <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> and thus they saw a significant role in introducing the concept of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> to those requiring <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> their families and others. They are an important link between the settings of care required by people accessing palliative care—–acute, in-patient <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> and community <b>care.</b> The <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> nurse consultants saw themselves in leadership positions that in some ways defy boundaries, because of the inherent complexity and diversity of the role. The <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> nurse consultants’ role appears to be pivotal in providing expert advice to staff and people requiring <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> and connecting <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> services both within the hospital and to external service...|$|R
40|$|Background: Children {{dying of}} a life {{threatening}} disease suffer a great deal {{at the end of}} life. Symptom control is often unsatisfactory, partly because many caregivers are simply not familiar with paediatric <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> To ensure that a child with a life-threatening condition receives high quality <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> clinical practice guidelines are needed. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> for children by making high quality care recommendations to recognize and relieve symptoms in paediatric <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Methods: An extensive search was performed for guidelines and systematic reviews on paediatric <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> up to year 2011. An expert panel combined the evidence with consensus to form recommendations on the treatment of symptoms in paediatric <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Results: We appraised 21 guidelines and identified 693 potentially eligible articles of which four met our inclusion criteria. None gave recommendations on the treatment of symptoms in paediatric <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Two textbooks and an adult <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> website were eventually our main sources of evidence. Conclusion: Hardly any evidence is available for the treatment of symptoms in paediatric <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> By combining evidence for adult <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> and the sparse evidence for paediatric <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> with expert opinion we defined a unique set of high quality care recommendations to relieve symptoms and lessen the suffering of children in <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> These results are an important tool to educate caregivers on how to relieve symptoms in children in paediatric <b>palliative</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R
