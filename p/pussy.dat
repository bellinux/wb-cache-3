5|$|Some critics {{made little}} or no {{distinction}} between <b>Pussy</b> Riot and Voina, incorrectly attributing past actions of Voina to <b>Pussy</b> Riot. In particular, a notorious performance by Voina in St. Petersburg, {{in which a woman}} stole a chicken from a supermarket by stuffing it in her vagina, is sometimes cited by detractors of <b>Pussy</b> Riot. However, {{there is no evidence that}} members of Moscow-based <b>Pussy</b> Riot participated in this action.|$|E
5|$|The media {{tended to}} {{overlook}} the meaning behind <b>Pussy</b> Riot's feminism; the cultural context of it is vastly {{different from that of}} Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, <b>Pussy</b> Riot's feminism focused on the repression of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life. <b>Pussy</b> Riot strove {{to make it clear that}} feminism in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E

5|$|<b>Pussy</b> Riot's {{performances}} {{can either}} be called dissident art or political action that engages art forms.
