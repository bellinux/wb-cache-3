30|$|De- and re-levering betas is {{important}} to obtain discount rates for assets that are not publicly traded. A de- and re-levering <b>procedure</b> is around <b>for</b> the case of risk-free <b>debt.</b> The <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> risky <b>debt</b> is much less clear even under very simplifying assumptions. In this paper, I concretize and extend the <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> de- and re-levering of betas for companies with risky <b>debt.</b> I derive <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> different assumptions on the taxation of a cancellation of <b>debt</b> (COD) and <b>for</b> different assumptions regarding the distribution of losses on interest and principal payments. With a tax on the COD I obtain known results. However, without taxes on a COD, the distribution of losses on interest and principal payments matters and equations differ markedly for different assumptions on the assignment of losses to interest and principal payments. Furthermore, using a procedure that does not fit the COD treatment is {{likely to lead to}} substantial deviations for de- and re-levered betas from their correct values.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis {{is the issue}} of procedure of social security insurance and allowance for state employment policy collection, <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>debt</b> recovery and securing of claims by all available legal means and evaluation of impacts on social situation of individuals. Social security insurance is, in addition to taxes, fees and custom duties, a revenue of state budget. It is based on the solidarity principle: young people help with their payments to the elderly, healthy people help ill people and people in a difficult life situation. The solidarity principle works reliably in all developed countries of the world. By collecting social security insurance, the State creates financial resources for implementation of fundamental social rights, which are guaranteed by international conventions and the Constitution of the Czech Republic, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. The main objective of this thesis is, based on interviews with payers of insurance premiums and document analysis, in the first part to make a survey of impact of recovery of claims in conducted execution proceedings into social situation of clients of District Social Security Administration Office in Strakonice and in the second part to determine to what extent the forced recovery of lawful duty has a share in deterioration of life situation of individuals. To achieve the defined goal I have chosen a method of document analysis, content analysis technique and secondary data analysis. As an additional method I used interviewing, the method of semi-structured interview. In order to obtain as much information about this topic as possible, I used qualitative research to collect primary data. The target group consisted of payers or former payers of insurance premiums who are also debtors of District Social Security Administration Office in Strakonice and whose insurance premium debt and penalty was recovered by administrative or judicial enforcement. Objective of the thesis has been achieved. Results of the research will raise awareness of the studied issues and may be used in practice during operation of executions in the district Social Security Administration offices...|$|R
40|$|The aim of my diploma {{thesis is}} to analyze {{legislation}} of the insolvency procedure's {{impact on the}} joint assets and how this legislation was changed by the amendment to the Insolvency Act No. 294 / 2013. This amendment is effective from January 1, 2014 and it brings to the Insolvency Act, inter alia, establishment of a common <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> a <b>debt</b> relief in a marriage, which was previously only inferred from the case law. Also, there occures a certain refilling and refinement of some provisions of the Insolvency Act {{in accordance with the}} case law. This diploma thesis consists of four main chapters. The first chapter deals with the insolvency procedure generally, it presents the necessary conditions for the event, and explains the basic concepts with which it is linked. The second chapter is devoted to general explanations of the joint assets. It defines its content, form in which the joint assets may be located, when and how it arises, and also describes how the joint assets is settled. The third chapter deals with the underlying assets. It is a summary of property that arises for the purposes of insolvency proceedings and from which are the creditors satisfied. This chapter defines the property, which is included in the underlying assets, and also the way to exclude the property from it. There is [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Between 1842 and 1852, eleven states adopted new constitutions, simultane-ously {{creating}} <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> issuing government <b>debt</b> and <b>for</b> chartering corpo-rations through general incorporation acts. Why simultaneously? Voters wanted geographically specific infrastructure investments but opposed geographically widespread taxation. States {{resolved the}} dilemma by developing several innova-tive public finance schemes. One, “taxless finance, ” used borrowed funds and special corporate privileges without raising current taxes. Another scheme, “benefit taxation, ” coordinated {{the incidence of}} taxes with the geographic bene-fits of investments through the property tax. After the fiscal crisis of the early 1840 s, states changed their constitutions to eliminate taxless finance in the future. etween 1790 and 1860 the United States population moved west over the Appalachians and across the Gulf plains, creating new states as they went.

Where private creditors use short-term debt to check sovereign debtor’s moral hazard, there is the risk of self-fulfilling crises. In this context, we conclude that the proposal of the Meltzer Commission—for unconditional financial support, but only to states that pre-qualify—could be the source of increased instability. After discussing analogies with private sector arrangements, we compare the operations of the existing Paris Club with proposed Chapter 11 style procedures.

Supreme Court {{partially}} {{settled a}} long-running controversy {{about the concept}} and extent of common bond limits on credit union membership, interpreting the Federal Credit Union Act as limiting membership to individuals sharing a single common bond.

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on sovereign debt that deals with the issues of a country’s ability-to-pay, its willingness-to-pay, and the policy responses to the debt crisis of the 1980 s. The existence of an ability-to-pay problem suggests a need <b>for</b> <b>debt</b> reduction, but plans <b>for</b> <b>debt</b> relief face potential incentive problems, and sovereign debt repurchases are not always a welfare maximizing method of debt restructuring. The paper synthesizes the main conclusions on these issues. With a willingness-to-pay problem, the potential penalties <b>for</b> <b>debt</b> repudiation are important in the endogenous determination of the repayment outcome. Penalties that are intertemporal in nature have different implications <b>for</b> <b>debt</b> repudiation than do intratemporal penalties. In addition, the asymmetric distribution {{of the costs of}} default can lead to a recurrent cycle of debt accumulation and default. ...|$|R
