5000|$|Automatic vs. manual {{operation}} - Selection of a manual sump pump means that one will turn the pump {{on and off}} when appropriate. Selecting an automatic sump pump means that a switch is wired to the sump pump {{to turn it on}} or off at appropriate water levels. Automatic switches include <b>pressure</b> <b>switches,</b> low level <b>pressure</b> <b>switches,</b> float switches, and a solid state water sensor called field-effect.|$|E

5000|$|Differential <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> can {{be placed}} on a filter to {{determine}} if it is dirty or otherwise not performing.|$|E
40|$|In-place {{calibration}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> {{is provided}} by a system of radially oriented flexing arms which, when rotated at a known velocity, convert the centrifugal force of the arms to a linear force along the shaft. The linear force, when applied to a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> diaphragm, can then be calculated...|$|R
50|$|The {{contacts}} of the <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> may {{be rated}} a few tenths of an ampere to around 15 amperes, with smaller ratings found on more sensitive <b>switches.</b> Often a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> will operate a relay or other control device, but some types can directly control small electric motors or other loads.|$|R
50|$|In {{dust control}} systems (bag filter), a <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>switch</b> {{is mounted on}} the header which will raise an alarm when air pressure in the header is less than necessary. A differential <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> may be installed across a filter element to sense increased pressure drop, indicating the need for filter cleaning or replacement.|$|R
5000|$|Colored blocks, {{which can}} by {{pushed by the}} robot and can {{activate}} special square-shaped <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> of the same color.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> use a Bourdon {{tube and}} a mercury switch. The small force {{generated}} by the tube reliably operates the switch.|$|E
50|$|Honeywell Sensing and Control (Honeywell S&C) {{produces}} over 50,000 {{products ranging}} from snap action, limit, toggle and <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> to position, speed and airflow sensors.|$|E
50|$|Turning {{the mode}} switch does not {{turn on the}} lasers. A {{recessed}} button {{on top of the}} device is tapped once to briefly turn on the lasers or tapped twice to turn the lasers on until deactivated, either by pressing a third time or by turning the mode switch to off. Additionally, an extra <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> can be plugged into the rear of the device and then placed virtually anywhere, limited only by the length of the <b>pressure</b> <b>switch's</b> cord; typically one to two feet. This <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> operates {{the same way as the}} recessed button.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> can be {{designed}} to exhibit hysteresis, with pressure set-points substituted for temperature thresholds.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the operational controls, separate high pressure and low <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> are normally utilised to provide secondary protection to the compressors and other components of the system from operating outside of safe parameters.|$|E
5000|$|Water level sensing switch type - <b>Pressure</b> <b>switches</b> {{are fully}} enclosed, usually inside the pump body, making them immune to {{obstructions}} or floating debris in the sump basin. Float switches, particularly the types {{attached to the}} end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. <b>Pressure</b> <b>switches</b> are typically factory set and not adjustable, while float switches can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. There is a solid state switch utilizing field-effect technology, which will turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug.|$|E
5000|$|... a. Means {{of control}} for {{multiple}} fixed delivery volume, low cost low complexity pumps; to provide variable flow {{as required by}} small (say +or - 10 psi) pressure increase or decrease of a system. b.

50|$|A {{method for}} very rapid {{charging}} called in-cell charge control involves an internal <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> in the cell, which disconnects the charging current {{in the event}} of overpressure.|$|R
50|$|The pressure-sensing {{element of}} a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> may be {{arranged}} {{to respond to the}} difference of two <b>pressures.</b> Such <b>switches</b> are useful when the difference is significant, for example, to detect a clogged filter in a water supply system. The switches must be designed to respond only to the difference and not to false-operate for changes in the common mode pressure.|$|R
50|$|Some vehicle engines have an oil <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> that {{switches}} {{a warning}} light on at low oil pressure. Some vehicles have an {{oil pressure gauge}} in the dashboard or instrument cluster.|$|R
50|$|A {{pressure}} switch {{is a form}} of switch that closes an electrical contact when a certain set fluid pressure has been reached on its input. The switch may be designed to make contact either on pressure rise or on pressure fall. <b>Pressure</b> <b>switches</b> are widely used in industry to automatically supervise and control systems that use pressurized fluids.|$|E
50|$|Logic {{controllers}} {{may respond}} to switches, light sensors, <b>pressure</b> <b>switches,</b> etc., {{and can cause}} the machinery to start and stop various operations. Logic systems are used to sequence mechanical operations in many applications. PLC software can be written {{in many different ways}} - ladder diagrams, SFC - sequential function charts or in language terms known as statement lists.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>switches</b> have various uses in automobiles, for example, to warn if the engineÂ´s {{oil pressure}} falls below a safe level, or to control automatic transmission torque converter lock-up. Prior to the 1960s, a pressure switch {{was used in}} the hydraulic braking circuit to control power to the brake lights; more recent automobiles use a switch directly activated by the brake pedal.|$|E
50|$|A <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>switch</b> for sensing {{fluid pressure}} contains a capsule, bellows, Bourdon tube, diaphragm or piston element that deforms or displaces proportionally to the applied pressure. The resulting motion is applied, {{either directly or}} through amplifying levers, {{to a set of}} <b>switch</b> contacts. Since <b>pressure</b> may be changing slowly and contacts should operate quickly, some kind of over-center mechanism such as a miniature snap-action switch is used to ensure quick operation of the contacts. One sensitive type of <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> uses mercury switches mounted on a Bourdon tube; the shifting weight of the mercury provides a useful over-center characteristic.|$|R
50|$|Lego {{pneumatic}} projects usually {{include a}} compressor {{made from a}} combination of a lego electric motor and pneumatic pump, together with a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> which will activate the motor when greater pressure is required.|$|R
50|$|Another type of <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> detects {{mechanical}} force; for example, a pressure-sensitive mat is used {{to automatically}} open doors on commercial buildings. Such sensors are also used in security alarm applications such as pressure sensitive floors.|$|R
5000|$|Even the {{tabletop}} appliance {{will have a}} control switch or at least an over temperature cut out to prevent fire if the appliance is started with no water in it. Larger installations have more elaborate controls to ensure that sufficient water supply is available to prevent burn out of the heating elements. These may include interlocks, <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> or other measures.|$|E
50|$|Gems Sensors Inc. {{designs and}} {{manufactures}} liquid level, flow switches and <b>pressure</b> <b>switches,</b> miniature solenoid valves, and pre-assembled fluidic systems. The {{company is also}} into manufacturing customized level sensors, pressure sensors, proximity switches, solenoid valves, fluidic systems, flow sensors, and Warrick controls. It offers its products to different markets like alternative energy, semiconductor manufacturing, process tank gauging, waste water procession and other marine and industrial applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} switch may be adjustable, {{by moving the}} contacts or adjusting tension in a counterbalance spring. Industrial <b>pressure</b> <b>switches</b> may have a calibrated scale and pointer to show the set point of the switch. A {{pressure switch}} will have a differential range around its setpoint in which small changes of pressure do not change {{the state of the}} contacts. Some types allow adjustment of the differential.|$|E
50|$|The {{telemetry}} package {{included a}} transmitter (operating on 403 MHz), blocking oscillator, <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> and battery. A multivibrator switched {{the temperature and}} humidity sensors into the circuit, while a baroswitch over-rode the multivibrator to transmit pressure readings.|$|R
5000|$|It can be {{activated}} by oil pressure running into a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch,</b> and therefore runs while {{the engine is}} running. Many rental aircraft use this method to remove the incentive to fly with the master electrical switch off.|$|R
50|$|An {{electronic}} <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> incorporates some {{variety of}} pressure transducer (strain gauge, capacitive element, or other) and an internal circuit {{to compare the}} measured pressure to a set point. Such devices may provide improved repeatability, accuracy and precision over a mechanical switch.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>switches</b> {{are also}} used to {{indicate}} blower failure. The differential pressure trip {{is connected to the}} inlet and the outlet of the main filter of the air blower. Failure is indicated by a decrease in the differential pressure. The low pressure trip connects to the main filter outlet. If the pressure drops below a pre-set level, the trip relay operates.These two pressure trips act to indicate three statuses: ...|$|E
50|$|Sauter {{produces}} {{hardware and}} software for regulation, control and building management systems for applications {{in the fields of}} heating, ventilation and air conditioning. The product range includes room sensors, transducers, thermostats, <b>pressure</b> <b>switches,</b> electrical actuators, pneumatic actuators, valves, mixing valves, and dampers. On the management level, Sauter develops various software solutions for building management, as well as systems and room automation stations for individual room control and room management. Development and production takes place at the factory in Basel.|$|E
5000|$|Switches, {{including}} flip switches, {{which must}} by activated by the robot, and <b>pressure</b> <b>switches,</b> which are only active when an object rests {{on top of}} them. These manipulate objects of the same color when activated. Gray objects are always active and cannot be affected by switches. Switches can activate Laser guns, which when activated fire beams in a straight line. The beam can destroy the robot, pick-up items, ice blocks, flip switches, magnets, and other laser guns.|$|E
50|$|The {{charge control}} {{consists}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> built into the cell, which disconnects the charging current when the internal cell pressure rises above a certain limit (usually 200 to 300 psi or 1.4 to 2.1 MPa). This prevents overcharging and damage to the cell.|$|R
50|$|Once the <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> {{monitoring}} {{main supply}} line pressure indicates a preset {{pressure in the}} line has been reached, the system is hydraulically closed. The controller shuts off the pump and signals a changeover valve to redirect lubricant to the second main supply line.|$|R
