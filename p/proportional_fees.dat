40|$|We {{analyze the}} nature of the dynamic fund {{protection}} which provides an investment fund with a floor level of protection against a reference stock index (or stock price). The dynamic protection feature entitles the investor the right to reset the value of his investment fund to that of the reference stock index. The reset may occur automatically whenever the investment fund value falls below that of the reference stock index, or only allowed at pre-determined time instants. The protected funds may allow a finite number of resets throughout the life of the fund, where the reset times are chosen optimally by the investor. We examine the relation between the finite-reset funds and automatic-reset funds. We also analyze the premium and the associated exercise policy of the embedded withdrawal right in protected funds, where the investor has the right to withdraw the fund prematurely. The impact of <b>proportional</b> <b>fees</b> on the optimal withdrawal policies is also analyzed. The holder should optimally withdraw at a lower critical fund value when the rate of <b>proportional</b> <b>fees</b> increases. Under the assumption that the fund value and index value follow the Geometric Brownian processes, we compute the grant-date and mid-contract valuation of these protected funds. Pricing properties of the protected fund value and the cost to the sponsor are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{implications}} of the widely used fixed fraction of funds fees on a mutual fund manager’s portfolio decisions. In our model, a log utility investor is allowed to dynamically allocate capital between an actively managed mutual fund and a locally riskless bond. The optimal fund portfolio is shown to be the one that maximizes the market value of the fees received, and is independent of the manager’s utility function. The presence of dynamic flows induces “flow hedging ” portfolio distortions {{on the part of the}} fund, even though the investor is myopic. We predict a positive relationship between a fund’s <b>proportional</b> <b>fee</b> rate and its volatility. This is a consequence of higher fee funds holding more extreme equity positions. However, the overall dollar amount of equity held by a fund can be independent of the fee rate. While both the fund portfolio and the investor’s trading strategy depend on the <b>proportional</b> <b>fee</b> rate, the equilibrium value functions do not. Implications related to the measured performance-fundflow relationship and its dependence on the fee rate are derived. Finally, we show that our results hold even if in addition to trading the fund and the bond the investor is allowed to directly trade some of the risky securities, but not all...|$|R

We discuss different platform tariff systems to analyze this hold-up problem. We find that <b>proportional</b> <b>fees</b> (which are observed in many relevant real-world examples) mitigate the problem, unlike classical two-part tariffs (which most {{of the literature on}} two-sided markets examines).

40|$|We {{consider}} the pricing of variable annuities with the Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) under the Vasicek stochastic interest rate framework. The holder of the variable annuity contract pays an initial purchase payment {{to the insurance}} company, which is then invested in a portfolio of risky assets. Under the GMWB, the holder can withdraw a specified amount periodically over the term of the contract such that {{the return of the}} entire initial investment is guaranteed, regardless of the market performance of the underlying asset portfolio. The investors have the equity participation in the reference investment portfolio with protection on the downside risk. The guarantee is financed by paying annual <b>proportional</b> <b>fees.</b> Under the assumption of deterministic withdrawal rates, we develop the pricing formulation of the value function of a variable annuity with the GMWB. In particular, we derive the analytic approximation solutions to the fair value of the GMWB under both equity and interest rate risks, obtaining both the lower and upper bounds on the price functions. The pricing behavior of the embedded GMWB under various model parameter values is also examined...|$|E

If a portfolio of closed-end index funds yields greater volatility of returns to investors than open-end index funds, and charges the same fees, the closed-end funds need to trade at a discount in equilibrium to attract buyers.

In this case excess volatility is a sufficient condition for closed-end fund discounts. It is unnecessary for discount risk to be systematic. Closed-end fund, discount, excess volatility...|$|R

Deferred proportional funding is an alternative to reduce problems from the difficulty in modeling salary behavior, because the deferred <b>proportional</b> <b>fee</b> {{is found to be}} affected less by the salary behavior than the up-front guarantee value. Moreover, if the lapse is possible, then the time value of a longer contract is diluted by a greater expected lapse loss and therefore the guarantee is not necessarily more valuable for a younger individual.

40|$|We {{consider}} a complete financial market with deterministic parameters where an investor and a fund manager have mean-variance preferences.

Her own portfolio is a proportion of the amount the investor holds in the fund. The equilibrium optimal strategies are independent of the fee rate although the portfolio of each agent depends on it. An optimal fund weight is obtained by the numer-ical solution of a nonlinear equation and is not unique in general. In one-dimensional case, the investor’s risk is inversely proportional to the weight of the risky asset in the fund.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters that investigate the index premium and its underlying economics both theoretically and empirically. The first chapter presents our empirical findings about the index premium and its properties. First, {{we find that the}} index premia for both the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 have been growing over time, reaching levels of about 15 % and 10 %, respectively, in 2000. The premia arise somewhat gradually between the announcement and effective days and do not reverse at least in the next few weeks. Second, we find that the index premium is related to the idiosyncratic risk and market equity of a firm with economic and statistical significance. Third, we introduce a new concept that we label the index turnover cost, which represents a cost borne by index funds due to the index premium. We illustrate this cost and estimate it as 70 - 85 bp annually for the S&P 500 and 110 - 211 bp annually for the Russell 2000. The second chapter develops the first theoretical explanation in the literature for downward-sloping demand curves. In traditional multi-asset models such as the CAPM, demand curves for stocks are almost perfectly horizontal, because a representative investor who is sufficiently risk-tolerant to hold the entire market portfolio has to be almost indifferent to idiosyncratic risk. We start with the basic CAPM setting, but we further assume that there is a fixed cost to actively managing a stock portfolio and that individuals pay the cost through an institution as a <b>proportional</b> <b>fee.</b> In equilibrium, the <b>proportional</b> <b>fee</b> can entirely determine the cross-sectional pricing of stocks, while the risk aversion of individual investors still determines the aggregate market risk premium. (cont.) In contrast to any representative agent models, this allows demand curves for stocks to be sufficiently steep to have economic significance, also implying that stocks will be priced only approximately around their fundamental values. Our explanation can account for several empirically observed puzzles such as the magnitude of the S&P 500 index premium. The third chapter focuses on index investors for whom the index premium creates a recurring cost: as the index is updated, they need to buy stocks with the premium and sell stocks without the premium. Different index rules can produce different index premia due to the different frequency and criteria of updating. We build a model to investigate the behavior of the index turnover cost and the portfolio performance of a mechanical index fund under a market-cap rule, an exogenous random rule, and a deterministic rule. We find that the rational anticipation of future index composition reflected in prices today eliminates any first-order differences in index fund performance across the three index rules. As the index investors become {{a large part of the}} market, the non-index investors become less diversified, and this induces hedging motives which hurt the index investors especially under a market-cap rule. by Antti Petäjistö.

40|$|Segregated {{funds have}} been an {{extremely}} popular Canadian investment vehicle {{during the past few}} years. These instruments provide long term maturity guarantees and often include extremely complex option features. One heavily debated feature is the reset feature; the ability to lock in market gains. In typical cases, investors have the ability to do this two or four times per year. The valuation of this embedded optionality has been controversial. Recently, regulators have announced that firms offering these products will be subject to new capital requirements. In this paper we discuss the effects of market parameters, such as volatility and interest rates, on the cost of providing a segregated fund guarantee. We also demonstrate how the level of optimality in investors' use of the reset feature affects the cost of providing such a guarantee. For each scenario, we provide the appropriate management expense ratio (M. E. R.) which should be charged as well as demonstrating the current liability using a given fixed M. E. R. Further, we explore ways of modifying standard contracts so as to reduce the required hedging costs. We also {{take a closer look at}} some intuitive reasons why the reset feature requires such a dramatic increase in the hedging costs. Finally, we present an approximate method for handling the reset feature which can be computed very efficiently.

First, introducing vertical differentiation among both users and developers, we show that the optimal platform pricing structure continues to shift towards making {{a larger share of}} profits on developers relative to users when the latter have a stronger preference for product variety. Also, when developers are vertically differentiated, a two-sided proprietary platform may induce socially excessive product variety, a scenario which never occurs in the horizontal differentiation model. Second, we introduce developer investment in product quality and show that a two-sided proprietary platform may be more socially efficient than an open platform in terms of the product quality it induces, even when it is less efficient with respect to the level of product variety. In this context we also determine the profit-maximizing <b>proportional</b> variable <b>fee</b> charged by a proprietary platform to developers and show that it is is increasing in the degree of developer risk-aversion and is used by the platform to trade product variety for product quality when developers' marginal cost of quality provision increases. ...|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, entry-based {{cordon pricing}} {{is not completely}} equitable {{in a sense that}} it does not consider the real externalities imposed by vehicles to the whole network. In this strategy, every vehicle is charged with the same toll while passing certain points at the cordon boundary, regardless of what the route of the travel is. On the other side, applying the distance-based pricing inside a cordoned area may cause unwanted congestion within the cordon around the boundary. These drawbacks limit the applicability and performance of this policy. In this paper, a hybrid entry- and distance-based strategy is proposed to circumvent these issues. In the hybrid layout, the toll consists of two parts: (1) a certain amount of charge for entering the cordon, and (2) a <b>fee</b> <b>proportional</b> to the distance travelled within the cordoned area. The first part prevents unnecessary trips into the cordoned area, while the second part provides more equity to the users traveling inside. This is further to note that the vehicle traveling outside the cordon line is free of charge.|$|R
40|$|A {{fund manager}} invests both the fund's assets and own private wealth in {{separate}} but potentially correlated risky assets, aiming to maximize expected utility from private {{wealth in the}} long run. If relative risk aversion and investment opportunities are constant, {{we find that the}} fund's portfolio depends only on the fund's investment opportunities, and the private portfolio only on private opportunities. This conclusion is valid both for a hedge fund manager, who is paid performance fees with a high-water mark provision, and for a mutual fund manager, who is paid management <b>fees</b> <b>proportional</b> to the fund's assets. The manager invests earned fees in the safe asset, allocating remaining private wealth in a constant-proportion portfolio, while the fund is managed as another constant-proportion portfolio.

Our results suggest that current regulatory restrictions on asymmetric performance-based fees in mutual fund advisory contracts may be costly. (JEL G 11, G 12, D 82, D 86) When investors delegate the portfolio management decision to a professional manager, they are faced with the classic problem of designing management-fee contracts. Neither the manager’s information nor the effort expended is directly observable by investors. Consequently, the appropriate contract should motivate the manager to exert costly effort to gather information relevant to security payoffs. The contract should also induce the manager to use this in-formation subsequently in choosing a portfolio with the desirable risk charac-teristics. Importantly, as recognized by Stoughton (1993), the effort incentives and the risk-taking incentives interact in a particular way in the delegated port-folio management setting, and therefore the solutions offered by the generic principal-agent literature are not readily applicable. For example, Stoughton shows that due to the feedback effect of risk incentives on the effort incentive, contracts in which the management fee is linearly related to portfolio returns lead to an underinvestment in effort expended by the manager, and such a...|$|R
40|$|Measuring the {{incidence}} of public spending in education requires an intergenerational framework distinguishing between what current and future generations - that is, parents and children - give and receive. In standard distributional incidence analysis, households are assumed to receive a benefit equal to what is spent on their children enrolled in the public schooling system and, implicitly, to pay a <b>fee</b> <b>proportional</b> to their income. This paper shows that, in an intergenerational framework, this is equivalent to assuming perfectly altruistic individuals, {{in the sense of}} the dynastic model, and perfect capital markets. But in practice, credit markets are imperfect and poor households cannot borrow against the future income of their children. The authors show that under such circumstances, standard distributional incidence analysis may greatly over-estimate the progressivity of public spending in education: educational improvements that are progressive in the long-run steady state may actually be regressive for the current generation of poor adults. This is especially true where service delivery in education is highly inefficient - as it is in poor districts of many developing countries - so that the educational benefits received are relatively low in comparison with the cost of public spending.

The goal is to provide boosting technologies to allow the new generations of mobile devices (phones and PDAs) to better exploit the available bandwidth and to achieve a reasonable cost/quality trade-off in remote access to long-lasting live events, such as sport competitions. Although the available bandwidth for mobile communication has increased thanks to new telecommunication standards such as GPRSand UMTS, it is still insufficient for high quality video transmission. The limited resources of low-cost terminals and {{the high costs of}} data transfer hinder de-facto many possible multimedia services. First, the quality is limited by the small display size and memory available on many mobile devices. Second, the limited bandwidthmay affect user satisfaction either because of the time spent waiting for the download or the latency in streaming a live video. Moreover, even if the user is willing to wait for the download or accepts frame dropping, a reduction of data to send would be unavoidable in order to bring down the costs of the service. As a matter of fact, most telecommunication companies charge a <b>fee</b> <b>proportional</b> to the number of bytes transferred.

The present value of the expected future profits from managing a collection of funds is equal to the value of the assets under management multiplied by the profit margin, assuming that the managed funds will remain in business forever, and that there will be zero asset flow {{into and out of the}} funds, zero excess returns net of trading costs, a fixed management <b>fee</b> <b>proportional</b> to the assets under management and a fixed profit margin for the management company.

In some instances, demand charges can constitute more than 50 % of a commercial customer's monthly electricity cost. While installation of behind-the-meter solar power generation decreases energy costs, its variability makes it likely to leave the peak load [...] and thereby demand charges [...] unaffected. This then makes demand charges an even larger fraction of remaining electricity costs. Adding controllable behind-the-meter energy storage can more predictably affect building peak demand, thus reducing electricity costs.

An optimal peak load reduction control algorithm for energy storage systems will be introduced and applied to historic solar power data and meter load data from multiple facilities for a broad range of energy storage system configurations.

40|$|Increasing {{resource}} prices, ever-higher {{complexity of}} products, {{recent developments in}} legislation {{and the importance of}} a green brand image have resulted in an increased interest of original equipment manufacturers to facilitate a disassembly based end-of-life treatment for their products. The main reason is that precious metals, rare earth elements and plastics can be recovered with the highest yield and purity in a disassembly based treatment. However, original equipment manufacturers currently face several issues for the implementation of design for disassembly. To overcome these issues, first of all an in-depth analysis of design-for-disassembly opportunities and challenges is presented. Taking into account the results of this analysis, innovative low-cost elastomer-based fasteners have been developed, which can be simultaneously released by applying a sufficiently high force over a period of time. In addition, an experimental validation method was developed and adopted to demonstrate that the developed fasteners allow reducing the disassembly time by 70 %– 90 % for the housing of LCD TVs without compromising product robustness. The presented calculations indicate that the implementation of the developed fasteners is profitable from an overall perspective in regions with a labor cost higher than 7 €/h. However, original equipment manufacturers currently lack incentives to adopt design for disassembly for products sold in a Business-to-Consumer market, which are jointly collected and treated at end-of-life. Therefore, a differentiation in recycling <b>fees</b> <b>proportional</b> to the reduction in disassembly time is proposed to provide economic stimuli for original equipment manufacturers to implement these fasteners. Such a differentiation scheme, combined with the presented insights on opportunities to facilitate disassembly processes and the required resistance of fasteners to forces in function of time, will stimulate and enable the development of products which can be disassembled in an economically viable manner, resulting in improved material recovery from end-of-life products in industrialized regions.
