50|$|Photochromism is the {{phenomenon}} {{that produces a}} change of colour in a substance by incident radiation. In other words, Photochromism is a light induced change of colour of a chemical substance. The spiropyrans {{are one of the}} <b>photochromatic</b> molecules that have raised more interest lately. These molecules consist of two heterocyclic functional groups in orthogonal planes bound by a carbon atom. Spiropyrans are one of the oldest families of photochromism. As solids, the spiropyrans do not present photochromism. It is possible in solution and in the dry state that radiation between 250 nm and 380 nm (approximately) is able to, by breaking the C-O binding, transform the spiropyrans into its colour emitting merocyanin-form. The structure of the colourless molecules, the substrate of the reaction (N), is more thermodynamically stable than the product - depending on the solvent in which it is stored. For example in NMP the equilibrium could be switched more toward the merocyanin form (solvatochromic effects). The photoisomers of the spiropyrans have a structure similar to cyanines, even though it is not symmetric about the center of the polymethine chain, and it is classified as a merocyanine (Figure 2).|$|E

It is shown that the maximum increase of the relative diffraction efficiency {{with the increase of}} the angle between the reference and object waves is observed for thin holograms.

30|$|Transition {{metal oxides}} have been {{attracted}} extensive attention {{due to their}} unique thermoelectric properties provided by the high temperature stability and tunable electronic and photon transport properties [1]. In addition, they have emerged as a promising area of research and attracted wide attention {{in the field of}} the nanotechnology for their vast applications as catalysts [2], sensors, and <b>photochromatic</b> devices [3, 4]. Metal oxides are extensively used for tribological applications [5, 6, 7]. Nanotechnology provides a vast area of research and assures excellent tribological properties [8]. Among these materials Molybdenum tri Oxide (MoO 3), n-type semiconductor with a wide band gap (> 2.7  eV) is attractive due to its structural and optical properties [9, 10]. Molybdenum (VI) oxide (MoO 3) has distinctive electrochromic, thermochromic and photochromic properties, widely used as catalysts [11], sensors [12, 13] and lubricants [14]. In general, molybdenum (IV) oxide exists in three different phase structures as thermodynamically stable normal orthorhombic (α-MoO 3) [15, 16], monoclinic (β-MoO 3) and hexagonal (h-MoO 3) [17, 18]. Cupric oxide (CuO) is a p-type semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.2 – 1.5  eV [19]. CuO nanoparticles can also be used as solid lubricants due to their appreciable friction reduction properties [20, 21].|$|E
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} devoted to {{multicolour}} photochromic effect in nanocomposite material Ag-TiO 2, which {{is caused by a}} spectrally selective photoinduced decrease in extinction. The Thesis introduces briefly the theory of particle plasmons which are of fundamental significance for the investigated phenomenon. A short summary of the models and results published on photochromic effect in Ag-TiO 2 is than given. The core of thesis deals with the optimization of this nanocomposite material towards a high <b>photochromatic</b> response. The influence of concentration of the TiO 2 solution and of the speed of its spin coating deposition on a substrate was measured. Also the effect of AgNO 3 quality used for sample preparation was monitored. A change in the extinction was found to depend on parameters of the excitation laser beam too. As a part of the optimization process, also the alternative TiO 2 matrixes produced on basis of lamellar micelles were tested. The photochromic effect was monitored by measurements of the light extinction and scattering in dependence on the sample photoexposition. The properties of a set of the high-quality samples were studied using photoluminescence spectroscopy.

Penetration assessment - ten premolars were sealed with each material, isolated (except for the sealed surface) and immersed in 0. 2 &#x 0025; Rhodamine B. The teeth were serially sectioned in a mesiodistal direction. The images of the sections were digitized and analyzed (ImageLab). The distance between the most superficial and the deepest points on the occlusal central groove was calculated to determine the groove&#x 2032;s total depth. The length of the central groove filled with the sealant was divided by its total depth to obtain the percentage of sealing of the occlusal groove. Retention assessment - 30 premolars were sealed, their occlusal surfaces were photographed and the area occupied by the sealing materials was demarcated (ImageLab). The teeth were submitted to different treatments: thermocycled, stored in artificial saliva and immersed in acetic acid and saliva (10 cycles/day protocol for 30 days). New photographs were taken to assess the final area occupied by the materials. The difference between the final and initial area was calculated to obtain the material loss.

40|$|The {{diffusivity}} of electrolytically introduced H in WO 3 thin layers {{was measured}} optically using a 1 pm resolution power micro-densitometer. The diffusion coefficient was found‘to {{decrease with increasing}} H content. The observations were described by a modified percolation model. Hydrogen diffusion in solid phase {{is thought to be}} one of the rate determining factors in the electrochromatic processes of WO 3. Earlier the determination of the diffusion coefficient was tackled by the NMR technique (ref. 11 and through chronoamperometry (ref. 21, the first method resulted in an order-of-magnitude estimate whereas the second one offered indirect information only. The aim of the present work was the direct experimental determination of the diffusivity of H in WO 3. In order to measure lateral diffusion part of a thin WO 3 film on an Sn 02 /glass substrate was covered with an insulating photo-resist layer then the wafer was immersed in acid solution to sa-turate the uncovered portion with H under potentiostatic condi-tions. Indicated by blue coloration a H concentration profile was formed which was homogeneous in depth and width and showed the shape of a step function perpendicular to the edge of the insulat-ing layer. The spread of this profile was measured optically by making use of a microdensitometer. The analysing light was kept as low as possible to avoid <b>photochromatic</b> effect and thermal decom-position. The lateral resolution of the method was about 1 urn, the long time stability of the apparatus in the order of 0. 1 %/hour. The typical duration of a run was about 8 hours. The asymmetric shape of the time dependent lateral concentra-tion distribution, c(z,t>, indicated some concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient, D(c). This suggested the advisability of using Boltzmann's transformation (ref. 3).

40|$|Even though KTiOPO 4 (KTP) is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best nonlinear materials for quasi phase matched (QPM) frequency conversion in the visible and the near-infrared spectral regions, its use is often limited by poor material homogeneity, high ionic conductivity, a considerable linear absorption and <b>photochromatic</b> damage. On the other hand, the improved material homogeneity and the lower ionic conductivity of bulk Rb-doped KTP (RKTP) make this material an ideal alternative for fabrication of fine-pitch QPM gratings, while the arsenate isomorph KTiOAsO 4 (KTA) promises a better performance in the green spectral region and adds the advantage of a wider transparency window in the infrared. Unfortunately, the available studies on these materials are limited and unable to answer the question whether RKTP and KTA are feasible alternatives to KTP in terms of periodic poling and optical performance. The optical performance of the QPM devices depends on the periodic poling quality, therefore, a detailed comprehension of domain-grating formation in the KTP isomorphs is highly desired. The goals of this thesis were to gain a better understanding of the periodic poling process in the KTP isomorphs, in order to study the specifics of ferroelectric domain engineering in KTA and RKTP, and to evaluate the optical performance of these isomorphs. Fine-pitch periodically poled structures were engineered both in KTA and RKTP crystals. It was demonstrated that QPM gratings with excellent quality and with periods as short as 8. 49 μm can be fabricated in KTA crystals. Comparative transmission studies have shown that periodically poled KTA (PPKTA) crystals can be superior to KTP for QPM second harmonic generation in the visible spectral region due to lower linear absorption. It was also demonstrated that RKTP is a superior alternative to KTP for high-quality QPM grating fabrication. A consistent room-temperature periodic poling of 5 mm thick RKTP crystals with a period of 38. 86 μm has been achieved. The obtained large aperture periodically poled RKTP (PPRKTP) crystals showed an outstanding QPM grating uniformity and excellent optical performance in optical parametric oscillator (OPO) applications. Moreover, it was shown that RKTP is less susceptible to blue-induced infrared absorption than KTP. Finally, a novel and a relatively simple method for self-assembling quasi-periodic sub-μm scale ferroelectric domain structure in RKTP crystals has been presented. It was shown that, after treatment in aqueous KOH/KNO 3 solution, periodic poling of RKTP with planar electrodes resulted in one-dimensional ferroelectric domain structure with an average periodicity of 650 ± 200 nm, extending over the whole 1 mm thick crystal. Such self-assembled structures in RKTP were used to demonstrate 5 th order non-collinear QPM backward second harmonic generation. QC 20140114 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} produced annually is exponential in growth. Currently available magneto-optical materials have reached their storage buffer due to physical limitations imposed by the superparamagnetic effect {{and will not be}} able to meet future storage requirements. The simple fact is that present optical storage technology suffers from an absence of functional organic materials that apply to the next generation of commercially available laser diodes (Nichia blue lasers, 400 - 500 nm). Although 'Blu-Ray' DVD technology has arrived with storage capacities ranging from 27 - 54 GB(operating at 405 nm with 0. 85 NA), the materials are still to be optimised. Higher storage densities of up to 80 GB may be achieved by depositing several layers of a material which is not ideal due to loss of resolution. An ideal material is yet to be realised. In addition, the future will demand a shift to even shorter wavelengths such as UV so that even higher capacities may be managed. Moreover cost is the main area of concern and it is necessary to further develop the materials in this direction. In recent years, a field of research that is growing steadily is that of photo induced phenomenon, in which the incident light itself brings about molecular ordering/ disordering of the liquid- crystalline system. This particular aspect of photonics, in which light can be controlled by light as a stimulus, is being proposed as the future technology for high-speed information processing [1 - 2]. Azobenzene undergoes trans → cis isomerization when irradiated with light tuned to an appropriate wavelength. The reverse cis → trans isomerization can be driven by light or occurs thermally in the dark. Azobenzene's <b>photochromatic</b> properties make it an ideal component of numerous molecular devices and functional materials. Despite the abundance of application-driven research, azobenzene photochemistry and the isomerization mechanism remain topics of investigation[3]. In this report photoisomerization studies were performed on in house prepared anisotropic molecule exhibiting bent core system. It is showing liquid crystalline phases, namely nematic and smectic phase. The photo-switching property of bent core was investigated in chloroform using UV/visible spectroscopy in the absence and in the presence of UV light illumination with 365 nm wavelength passing through heat filter to avoid possible heat raditation which might cause the changes in the system. Compound was illuminated which leads to the E isomer being transformed into the Z isomer. After ∼ 20 s illumination, there is no change in the absorption spectrum which confirms the photosaturation of the E/Z isomerization process, The reverse transformation from Z to E can be brought by two methods, one by keeping the solution in dark and other by shining white light of higher wavelength. The earlier process is well known as thermal back relaxation...|$|E
