40|$|This thesis {{documents}} the fabrication {{and use of}} the ‘Bamboo Test-Kit-in-a-Backpack’. The ‘kit’ is intended for rapid in-the-field assessment of bamboo material properties. Presently the kit supports full-culm compression, longitudinal shear (‘bowtie’ test), edge bearing, and culm flexural tests. Additionally, it could be further adapted for <b>pin</b> <b>shear</b> tests and a number of small clear specimen tests. The thesis documents proof of concept and validation testing ensuring that results from the test kit are comparable to those of a standard testing machine. A key objective of this work is to endure that tests and sample preparation are practical and simple to conduct on a remote construction site. One critical issue of test specimen tolerance – permitted out-of-squareness of specimen ends is also addressed...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} presented into the improvement to the delamination fatigue resistant properties of z-pinned carbon fibre-epoxy composite under mixed-mode I/II cyclic interlaminar loading. Delamination fatigue tests are performed on unpinned and z-pinned composites under different mixed-mode ratios spanning mode I to mode II interlaminar cyclic conditions. The fatigue resistance and fatigue strengthening mechanisms {{induced by the}} z-pins {{is dependent on the}} cyclic mixed-mode ratio. The threshold critical strain energy release rate needed to initiate delamination growth in the z-pinned composite increases with the G I -to-G II ratio. The fatigue crack growth rate slows considerably and the critical strain energy release rate for fast fatigue fracture increases with the G I -to-G II ratio. The delamination fatigue strengthening induced by the z-pins increases with the G I -to-G II ratio due to a transition in the crack bridging toughening process from pin pull-out under mode I dominated loads to combined tensile and shear fracture under mixed-mode loads to <b>pin</b> <b>shear</b> rupture under mode II dominated loads. It is also found that the effect of the G I -to-G II ratio on the fatigue properties is greater for the z-pinned composite compared to the unpinned laminate due to the high fatigue sensitivity of z-pins to the mixed-mode ratio...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of timber}} pins in {{connecting}} timber elements {{is a valid}} alternative to the employment of metallic devices, and apart from being quite spread in prefabricated timber frames, {{it could be an}} efficient solution in the field of restoring timber structures. The design rules for pinned joints are universally based on Johansen’s theory, (European Yield Model), but their application to timber pegged connections still shows some unsolved problems, linked to: 1) dowel-bearing strength; 2) bending strength of the pin; 3) shear strength of the pin; 4) the feasibility of the fourth failure Mode of EYM. Many studies analysing one or more of those aspects can be found in literature, but there isn’t yet an analytical formulation alternative to this on which the EYM is based. Authors are carrying on an extended experimental research, trying to better understand the complex mode of failure of timber joints connected by timber pegs, and consequently improving design rules. A first phase has involved double shear plane joints of glulam fir connected by ash pins, varying thickness of jointed board, pointing out the role of bending strength. In a second step the role of dowel-bearing strength has been investigated, choosing as base material three wood essences with quite different densities. Now the final step of the whole research is presented: first of all, the role of <b>pin</b> <b>shear</b> strength has been studied; then all obtained results are employed in analyzing the behaviour of double shear plane joints with varying timber essences and its transposition in using design rules...|$|E
40|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>pins</b> {{are used}} to attach C-SCOUT's fins to their {{actuating}} motors, so if something impacts the fins, the <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> will break and the fins will fall off, thereby protecting the motors from damage. An analysis {{of the strength of}} the existing Garolite <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> showed that they will fail during normal operation. It is possible for the fins to break off when the vehicle speed exceeds 2 m/s. Exact failure speeds depend on the angle of attack of the fins. To fix the problem, re-design of the <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> was attempted, basing the new <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> strength on the load required to damage an actuator. It was found that the bearings in the actuator's gearbox will be damaged during normal operation, at speeds exceeding 1. 3 m/s. Therefore, the motor will be damaged before the <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> break, so creating stronger <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> is not a solution that will protect the motors. Stronger fin actuators should be purchased. The potential for damage to the motors due to operational and impact loads should be considered when selecting a motor. Once new motors are selected, the method described in this report can be used to design appropriate <b>shear</b> <b>pins.</b> Until new actuators and <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> are installed, C-SCOUT testing can proceed under a 2 m/s speed limit.

40|$|A {{design for}} the {{fail-safe}} mechanism of a guide vane in a Francis-type hydro turbine is proposed and analyzed. The mechanism {{that is based on}} a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> as a sacrificial component was designed to remain simple. Unlike the requirements of conventional designs, a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> must be able to withstand static and dynamic loads but must fail under a certain overload that could damage a guide vane. An accurate load determination and selection of the <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> material were demonstrated. The static load for various opening angles of the guide vane were calculated using the computational fluid dynamics Fluent and finite element method Ansys programs. Furthermore, simulations for overload and dynamic load due to the waterhammer phenomenon were also conducted. The results of load calculations were used to select an appropriate <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> material. Quasi-static <b>shear</b> tests were performed for two <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> of aluminum alloy Al 2024 subjected to different aging treatments (i. e. artificial and natural aging).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of Z-pinning on the {{delamination}} performance in opening and shear loading modes in woven fabric reinforced / epoxy composite materials, as well as {{the effects of}} friction between specimen crack faces and the Z-pin failure mechanisms involved in mode II delamination. Mode I and mode II delamination tests are carried out on Z-pinned unidirectional (UD) and woven laminates. Both UD and woven laminates exhibit enhanced delamination resistance and crack propagation stability through Z-pinning. The effects of various structural and Z-pin parameters on the mode I and mode II delamination behaviour are separately assessed. The 4 ENF testing configuration is deemed as the appropriate mode II configuration for the testing of Z-pinned laminates. A new basic friction rig is used to measure the friction coefficient between crack faces in woven laminates. An additional friction effect attributed to fibre architecture is identified. A specially designed delamination specimen is used to overcome the difficulty of accurately measuring crack propagation in Z-pinned woven fabric materials and aid data reduction using the available analytical methods. The failure mechanisms involved in the mode II delamination of Z-pinned laminates have been investigated with the implementation of a new test. Z-pins fail under shear loading through a combination of resin crushing, laminate fibre breakage, <b>pin</b> <b>shear,</b> pin bending and pin pullout. The balance of the failure mechanisms is shown to be a function of the crack opening constraint, material type, stacking sequence, Z-pin angle and insertion depth to Z-pin diameter ratio. Z-pin and material parameters influencing Z-pinning quality are identified, categorised and quantified. The importance of controlling Z-pin insertion depth is underlined and updated manufacturing procedures are proposed. Partial pinning appears as an advantageous alternative. A reduction in in-plane stiffness and in-plane strength in UD and woven fabric composites is measured, whilst no significant change of in-plane shear stiffness of UD materials is observed. A reduction in the fibre volume fraction {{is the single most important}} parameter affecting the in-plane stiffness. The performance of a Z-pinned sub-structural component is investigated. Enhanced loading carrying capacity and damage tolerance is achieved through Z-pinning. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

50|$|The {{material}} of a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> is selected and treated {{so that it}} is relatively resistant to fatigue (material). That is, when subjected to small forces, each one insufficient to break the pin, the pin does not retain damage. If material fatigue were to weaken a <b>shear</b> <b>pin,</b> the pin could potentially be broken by a force smaller than the original threshold force causing the mechanism to operate unintentionally, or a safety <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> to break during normal operation of the machinery it protects.|$|R
50|$|In {{the role}} as a {{conditional}} operator, a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> {{will be used to}} prevent a mechanical device from operating before the criteria for operation are met. A <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> gives a distinct threshold for the force required for operation. It is very cheap and easy to produce delivering a very high reliability and predictable tolerance. They are almost maintenance-free and can remain ready for operation for years with little to no decrease in reliability. <b>Shear</b> <b>pins</b> are only useful for a single operating cycle, after each operation they have to be replaced.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{mathematical}} modelling {{work has been}} carried out to investigate the potential of the use of <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> within London Underground Switch and Crossing electric point machine drives to protect against run-through derailments. The review is based on a need to minimise the risks of derailment and to better understand the risks associated with run-through. The study has been accomplished in two stages: analytical modelling to establish the stiffness of the switch blade followed by vehicle dynamics modelling to analyse the wheel climb-out events and the resultant loadings on the <b>shear</b> <b>pins.</b> A range of <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> strengths and vehicle-track parameters has been considered. A post-processing routine has been developed to enable a thorough study on the relationship between vehicle-track parameters, strength of <b>shear</b> <b>pins,</b> failure rates and the risk of vehicle derailment. A good agreement between the modelling results and the current shear pin’s ability to protect against derailments has been found. Ultimately, the potential to increase the strength of <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> has been analysed {{in order to protect the}} vehicles against fatigue failure...|$|R

In this device, <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> are frequently used {{to connect the}} [...] "head" [...] of the towbar - the portion that attaches to the aircraft - to the main shaft of the towbar. In this way, {{the failure of the}} <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> will physically separate the aircraft and the tractor.

50|$|Their high {{reliability}} and low cost make them very popular {{for use in}} weapons. A typical example is using <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> in an explosive device. A <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> can here hold a striker pin in place, preventing the striker pin from striking an initiator (primer) unless the correct force is applied. That force can be the acceleration of a rifle grenade being launched. The force would snap the <b>shear</b> <b>pin,</b> allowing the striker pin to move backwards onto a primer, which in turn ignites a pyrotechnic delay composition for auto destruction. In this use <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> prevent the striker pin from hitting the primer during handling or if the grenade was dropped by accident. Additionally, shear-pins are frequently used in anti-tank mine fuzes, {{to prevent them from}} being triggered by much lighter, non-target vehicles such as motorcycles. Typically, the shear-pin in an anti-tank mine is designed to snap (and release the spring-loaded firing pin) when a weight in excess of 150 kilograms is applied to the pressure plate.|$|R
50|$|It {{may also}} be a plain metal rod {{inserted}} through a hub and axle; the diameter of the rod, alloy and tempering of the metal, are all carefully chosen to allow the <b>pin</b> to <b>shear</b> only when the predetermined threshold force or shock is reached.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{complexity}} of hip reconstruction {{has been and}} continues to be a perplexing problem with restoring leg length, femoral offset, joint stability and overall hip implant fixation. These were contributing factors that lead {{to the development of a}} novel proximal femoral component design “Apex Modular Stem” (Omni, Raynham, MA). The basic stem geometry features a straight stem with a metaphyseal fit and fill cone, a medial triangle and a modular neck junction that allows for version and offset adjustment. In recent years, there has been great concern with the use of modularity in total hip arthroplasty. The goals of this study are (1) to identify complications with the use of a proximal modular design and (2) demonstrated factors that have eliminated those complications. Methods: This is a retrospective study of a single surgeon series (Design A and Design B) of using the same cementless stem and proximal modular neck body (Apex Modular Stem and Omni Mod Hip Stem) from 2000 to 2016 totaling 2, 125 stems. 483 stems were the Design A and 1, 642 stems, were of the Design B style. Results: Design A, 483 stems were implanted between 2000 and 2004. 31 alignment <b>pins</b> <b>sheared</b> resulting in a revision rate of 6. 4 %. Design B, 1, 642 stems have been implanted between 2004 and 2016 all by the same surgeon, with no failures of the modular junction. Conclusion: All implant devices entail a multitude of risks and benefits. The Apex Modular Stem (Design A), provided excellent fixation, minimal risk of modular junction  corrosion, and simple control of anteversion and femoral offset. The limitation was found to be the risk of the alignment <b>pin</b> <b>shearing</b> (6. 4 %). The pin was enlarged to make it 225 % stronger in torsional resistance, and in a subsequent series of over 1, 600 femoral stems in a single surgeon series, there were no pin failures over a  12 year duration...|$|R
40|$|A piloted {{simulator}} experiment, {{designed to}} evaluate and optimize certain backup control system (BUCS) engagement parameters and to provide pilot familiarization with aircraft response prior to flight test of the BUCS in the YAH- 64 Advanced Attack Helicopter, is described. Key elements of the simulation were the representation of a control system jam, the pilot's breaking of a <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> in the jammed control, and the resultant BUCS engagement. To minimize the excursions in aircraft motion which could result from the pilot's control inputs after <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> breakage, the BUCS control function is blended in gradually. The experiment's results indicate that optimum time to full control authority after <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> breakage is three seconds in all axes for certain critical tasks.

50|$|Sprockets {{are used}} in the {{conveyor}} system to drive the chain. Conveyor sprockets typically have an odd number of teeth although sprockets with an even number have become more prevalent over the last thirty years. Most sprockets are made from fabricated steel and are parallel or taper keyed to a through shaft. Conveyor sprockets are also available in double pitch and <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> varieties. Double pitch sprockets wear evenly and offer a longer service life than standard sprockets. <b>Shear</b> <b>pin</b> sprockets break when overloaded, stopping the conveyor and saving considerable expense and downtime.|$|R
50|$|The PMN-2 fuze {{features}} an arming delay of approximately 60 seconds.

5000|$|The way {{the steam}} {{catapult}} works is at launch, a release bar holds the aircraft {{in place as}} steam pressure builds up, then breaks (or [...] "releases"; older models used a <b>pin</b> that <b>sheared),</b> freeing the piston to pull the aircraft along the deck at high speed.

After locating the sliding sleeve, the operator jars downward to set the lock, then pulls upward to close the isolation plug in the separation tool. As this happens, a garter spring in the isolation plug moves a steel <b>shear</b> <b>pin</b> into a groove on the sealing prong, and an O-ring on the internal prong seals to isolate the tubing below the sliding sleeve. The running prong that is pinned {{to the top of the}} internal prong is then sheared, and the slickline toolstring may be withdrawn from the well.|$|R
40|$|Coaracy Nunes was {{the first}} {{hydroelectric}} power plant in the Amazon region, being located in Araguari River, Amapa State, Brazil. The plant operates since 1976, presenting now a nominal capacity of 78 MW. The <b>shear</b> <b>pins,</b> which are installed in the turbine hydraulic arms to control the wicket gate and regulate the water flow into the turbine blades, suffered several breakdowns since 2004. These <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> are made of an ASTM 410 stainless steel and were designed to break by a shear overload of 120 kN. Fractographic investigation of the pins, however, revealed two types of fracture topographies: a region of stable crack propagation area, with non-pronounced striation and secondary cracks; and a region of unstable propagation, featuring elongated dimples. These {{results indicated that the}} stable crack propagation occurred by fatigue (bidirectional bending), which was nucleated at machining marks under high nominal load. Finite element analysis was carried out using two loading conditions (pure shear and a combination of shear and bending) and the results indicated that the presence of a bending stress strongly increased the stress concentration factor (85 % rise in the shear stress and 130 % rise in the Von Mises stress). Misalignment during <b>shear</b> <b>pins</b> assembly associated with vibration might have promoted the premature failure of the shear by bending fatigue. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
