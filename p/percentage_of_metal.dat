50|$|Mineral {{processing}} {{begins with}} beneficiation, consisting of initially {{breaking down the}} ore to required sizes depending on the concentration process to be followed, by crushing, grinding, sieving etc. Thereafter, the ore is physically separated from any unwanted impurity, depending on the form of occurrence and/or further process involved. Separation processes take advantage of physical properties of the materials. These physical properties can include density, particle size and shape, electrical and magnetic properties, and surface properties. Major physical and chemical methods include magnetic separation, froth flotation, leaching etc., whereby the impurities and unwanted materials are removed from the ore and the base ore of the metal is concentrated, meaning the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> in the ore is increased. This concentrate is then either processed to remove moisture or else used as is for extraction of the metal or made into shapes and forms that can undergo further processing, with ease of handling.|$|E

The ion-exchange process was used to load the metal ions in zeolite A samples. The methane conversion efficiency by the samples was studied under various parameters including the amount <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> loading (7. 3 - 19. 4 wt%), reaction temperature (25 - 500 °C), space velocity (8400 - 41 900 h- 1), and methane concentration (0. 5 - 3. 2 vol %). At 500 °C, the original commercial-grade zeolite A catalyzed 3 % of the methane only, whereas the addition <b>of</b> different <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in the sample enhanced the methane conversion efficiency by 40 - 85 %.
