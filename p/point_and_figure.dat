50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> charts were {{automated}} in the UK in {{the early}} 1980s by the Indexia company run by Jeremy Du Plessis. This automation increased the popularity and usage of <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> charts because hundreds of charts could be viewed and altered quickly and easily. At {{the same time a}} method of log scaling <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> charts was devised, where the value of the Xs and Os was set to a percentage rather than a price. This allowed the sensitivity of <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Figure</b> charts to remain constant no matter what the price level.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technique}} is over 100 years old. [...] "Hoyle" [...] {{was the first}} to write about it and showed charts in his 1898 book, The Game in Wall Street. [...] The first book/manual dedicated to <b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Figure</b> was written by Victor Devilliers in 1933. Chartcraft Inc, in the USA, popularized the system in the 1940s. Cohen founded Chartcraft and wrote on <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> charting in 1947. Chartcraft published further pioneering books on P&F charting, namely those by Burke, Aby and Zieg. Chartcraft Inc is still running today, providing daily <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> services for the US market under the name of Investors Intelligence. Veteran Mike Burke still works for Chartcraft, having started back in 1962 under the guidance of Cohen. Burke went on to train other <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> gurus, such as Thomas Dorsey who would go on to write authoritative texts on the subject.|$|E

The figure {{maintenance}} control {{system is designed}} to counter the optical elements translational and rotational changes induced by long-term thermal drifts that the support structure may experience. The pointing system applies optical truss to telescope pointing; a laser metrology system is used to transfer pointing informaton from an external fine guidance sensor to the telescope optical boresight, defined by the primary mirror, secondary mirror, and focal plane assembly...|$|R
5000|$|The {{addition}} of architectural elements {{allowed for the}} incorporation of linear perspective to the scene, which in turn brings attention to the important focal <b>points</b> <b>and</b> <b>figures.</b> Donatello was inspired by his contemporary Filippo Brunelleschi’s exploration into a linear perspective system involving orthogonals (diagonal lines that meet at a central vanishing <b>point)</b> <b>and</b> transversals (the lines crossing these orthogonals) which work together to draw the eye to the vanishing <b>point</b> <b>and</b> create an illusion of space on a two-dimensional surface. [...] Donatello manipulated this system slightly, by having the focal point lead to a “V” of open space, encouraging the eye to move across the panel to the two separate groupings, {{rather than focusing on}} any one element. The inclusion of linear perspective would later become a standard element in Renaissance painting and sculpture, after being described by Leon Battista Alberti in his 1435 treatise Della Pictura.|$|R

5000|$|The primary {{functional}} {{differences between}} a Ludlow Typograph and a Linotype {{is that the}} latter uses a keyboard to compose each line of type, whereas Ludlow uses hand-set mats, and that an ordinary Linotype was limited to faces smaller than twenty-four point, whereas Ludlow made whole alphabets up to 96 <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figures</b> as large as 240 point. [...] The machine is much simpler and takes up less floor space, and the initial investment in the machine and mats is more affordable for a small print shop than a Linotype, primarily used by larger printers and formerly in newspapers. (Neither the Ludlow Typograph nor the Linotype is currently made; however, both machines can still be serviced, and parts and mats are readily available.) ...|$|R

50|$|Du Plessis {{describes}} the historical {{development of these}} charts from a price recording system to a charting method. Traders kept track of prices by writing them down in columns. They noticed patterns in their price record and started referring to them first as ‘fluctuation charts’ and then as ‘figure charts’. They started using Xs instead of numbers and these charts became known as ‘point charts’. Traders used both point charts and figure charts together and referred to them as their <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> charts, which is where Du Plessis suggests the name <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> came from. Modern <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> charts are drawn with Xs and Os where columns of Xs are rising prices and columns of Os are falling prices, although many traditionalists such as David Fuller and Louise Yamada still use the Xs only point method of plotting.|$|E
50|$|The {{correct way}} {{to draw a}} <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> chart is to plot every price change but {{practicality}} has rendered this difficult {{to do for a}} large quantity of stocks so many <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> chartists use the summary prices {{at the end of each}} day. Some prefer to use the day’s closing price and some prefer to use the day’s high or low depending on the direction of the last column. The high/low method was invented by A.W. Cohen in his 1947 book, 'How to Use the Three-Point Reversal Method of Point & Figure Stock Market Timing' and has a large following.|$|E

50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>and</b> <b>Figure</b> charts {{are based}} {{primarily}} on price action, not time. If there are no significant price moves over time, P&F charts will show no new data.

50|$|The hikkake pattern, or hikkake, is a {{technical}} analysis pattern used for determining market turning-points and continuations. It {{is a simple}} pattern that {{can be observed in}} market price data, using traditional bar charts, <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> charts, or Japanese candlestick charts. The pattern does not belong to the collection of traditional candlestick chart patterns.|$|E
50|$|The charts are {{constructed}} by deciding {{on the value}} represented by each X and O. Any price change below this value is ignored so <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> acts as a filter to filter out the smaller price changes. The charts change column when the price changes direction by {{the value of a}} certain number of Xs or Os. Traditionally this was one and is called a 1 box reversal chart. More common is three, called a 3 box reversal chart.|$|E
50|$|The {{principles}} of technical analysis {{are derived from}} hundreds of years of financial market data. Some aspects of technical analysis {{began to appear in}} Amsterdam-based businessman Joseph de la Vega's accounts of the Dutch financial markets in the 17th century. In Asia, technical analysis {{is said to be a}} method developed by Homma Munehisa during the early 18th century which evolved into the use of candlestick techniques, and is today a technical analysis charting tool. In the 1920s and 1930s Richard W. Schabacker published several books which continued the work of Charles Dow and William Peter Hamilton in their books Stock Market Theory and Practice and Technical Market Analysis. In 1948 Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published Technical Analysis of Stock Trends which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline. It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts, because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>figure</b> chart analysis.|$|E
40|$|Satellite links are {{increasingly}} used for Internet/Intranet applications, which are predominantly based on TCP. Unfortunately, TCP exhibits marginal performance and excessive resource consumption in a satellite environment. The causes for TCP’s performance issues are presented, {{as well as}} some issues related to the usage of HTTP over satellite links, and the implications of carrying a large number of concurrent connections over a satellite link. Various solutions are surveyed, and it is shown that throughput gains of 100 %- 500 % and bandwidth savings of 30 %- 50 % are achievable. It is illustrated that these solutions may be integrated into existing networks without requiring a wholesale replacement of TCP in the end nodes, and a cost justification model is presented, illustrating the practicality and feasibility of these solutions.
