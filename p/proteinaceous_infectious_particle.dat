40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies affect {{humans and}} other animals. Clinically, the {{diseases}} involve severe, progressive neurodegeneration with an invariably fatal outcome. The TSEs are linked by the unusual {{nature of their}} causative agent, which {{is believed to be}} a transmissible protein devoid of nucleic acid. This protein, known as a prion (a pseudoabbreviation for <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particle),</b> is a hallmark feature and purported pathogen of human and other animal TSEs. 1 For many years, the natural transmission of TSEs appeared to be almost exclusively relegated to their respective phylogenic and species lineages; however, the association in the mid- 1990 s between a TSE of cattle (BSE) and a human TSE (vCJD) brought TSEs into the realm of zoonotic diseases.

40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} fatal and incurable neurodegenerative disorders of mammals. They uniquely manifest as sporadic, genetic, and infectious maladies. The agent responsible for prion diseases is the prion. A prion {{is defined as a}} <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particle,</b> which is solely constituted by an alternately folded form of the prion protein (PrP) (Prusiner 1982). In diseased animals and humans, PrP exists in two forms, the physiological, cel- lular form of PrP, PrPC, and the pathological prion form denoted as PrPSc. The mech- anism whereby nascent PrPSc is generated is currently unknown. Structural studies of either isoform are of great importance for understanding the biology of prion diseases since they may clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for these pathologies. In this chapter, we present an overview of the studies into PrPC as well as structures of prions...|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{transmission}} from man to animals of Creutzfeld-jacob disease (CJD) led Prusiner {{to identify a}} <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particle</b> lacking nucleic acid, which was called prion.

One of the still enigmatic aspects regarding prion diseases is actually how, where, and when the transformation PrPc/PrPsc is occurring, this being due to the result of a large extent to the fact that so far most studies have been dedicated to the formation and transmission of PrPsc, whereas the understanding of physiologic roles of PrPc are in their infancy. In this review, we hope to identify the most reliable hypotheses for future experiments on PrPc. This is relevant not only for the understanding of PrPc functions but also to unravel the enigmatic nature of PrPc/PrPsc conversion...|$|E
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that occur either spontaneously or genetically or {{are caused by}} infection. Spontaneously occurring prion {{diseases are}} age related.

We analyzed PrP preparations immunochemically {{to determine if they}} contain AGE-modified PrP. We also studied the influence of AGE modifications on the PrP aggregation process in vitro...|$|R

Transmission studies in {{transmissible spongiform encephalopathies}} (TSEs) have currently become an even more important area of study due to the possible transmis-sion of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to humans resulting in “new variant ” Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).

40|$|In 1982, {{the term}} “prions” (<b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particles)</b> was coined to specify a new {{principle}} of infection. A misfolded isoform of a cellular protein {{has been described}} as the causative agent of a fatal neurodegenerative disease. At the beginning of prion research scientists assumed that the infectious agent causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) was a virus, but some unconventional properties of these pathogens were difficult to bring in line with the prevailing viral model. The discovery that prions (obviously devoid of any coding nucleic acid) can store and transmit information similarly to DNA was initially even denoted as being “heretical” but is nowadays mainly accepted by the scientific community. This review describes, from a historical point of view, how the “protein-only hypothesis” expands the Central Dogma. Definition of both, the prion principle and the Central Dogma, have been essential steps to understand information storage and transfer within and among cells and organisms. Furthermore, the current understanding of the infectivity of prion-proteins after misfolding is summarized succinctly. Finally, prion-like amyloids and functional amyloids, as found in yeast and bacteria, will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Scrapie {{of sheep}} and goats as well as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of humans are {{neurologic}} disorders caused by slow infectious pathogens. The novel molecular properties of the pathogen causing scrapie have prompted introduction of the term "prion" to denote a small <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particle</b> that resists inactivation by nucleic acid-modifying procedures. Antiserum to the major hamster scrapie prion protein (PrP 27 - 30) was found to cross-react with murine CJD proteins. The CJD proteins had molecular weights similar to those observed for scrapie prion proteins as determined by NaDodSO 4 gel electrophoresis. In addition, the CJD proteins were resistant to digestion by proteinase K and appear to polymerize into rod-shaped particles. The purification procedure developed for scrapie prions {{was found to be}} useful in purifying the CJD agent. Purification of the two infectious pathogens by virtually identical procedures provided further evidence for similarities in their molecular structures. We conclude that the molecular and biologic properties of the CJD agent are sufficiently {{similar to those of the}} scrapie prion protein that CJD should be classified as a prion disease...|$|E
40|$|Viroids {{are small}} "naked" {{infectious}} RNA molecules that are pathogens of higher plants. The {{potato spindle tuber viroid}} (PSTV) {{is composed of}} a covalently closed circular RNA molecule containing 359 ribonucleotides. The properties of PSTV were compared with those of the scrapie agent, which causes a degenerative neurological disease in animals. PSTV was inactivated by ribonuclease digestion, psoralen photoadduct formation, Zn 2 + -catalyzed hydrolysis, and chemical modification with NH 2 OH. The scrapie agent resisted inactivation by these procedures, which modify nucleic acids. The scrapie agent was inactivated by proteinase K and trypsin digestion, chemical modification with diethylpyrocarbonate, and by exposure to phenol, NaDodSO 4, KSCN, or urea. PSTV resisted inactivation by these procedures, which modify proteins. Earlier evidence suggested that the scrapie agent is smaller than PSTV. Its small size seems to preclude the presence of a genome coding for the protein(s) of a putative capsid. The properties of the scrapie agent distinguish it from both viroids and viruses and have prompted the introduction of the term "prion" to denote a small <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particle</b> that resists inactivation by procedures that modify nucleic acids...|$|E
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} transmissible, invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect both humans and animals. According to the protein-only hypothesis, the infectious agent is a prion (<b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particle)</b> that is composed primarily of PrPSc, the disease-associated isoform of the cellular prion protein, PrP. PrPSc arises from the conformational change of the normal, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored protein, PrPC. The mechanism by which this process occurs, however, remains enigmatic. Rabbits are one of {{a small number of}} mammalian species reported to be resistant to prion infection. Sequence analysis of rabbit PrP revealed that its C-terminal amino acids differ from those of PrP from other mammals and may affect the anchoring of rabbit PrP through its GPI anchor. Using a cell culture model, this study investigated the effect of the rabbit PrP-specific C-terminal amino acids on the addition of the GPI anchor to PrPC, PrPC localization, and PrPSc formation. The incorporation of rabbit-specific C-terminal PrP residues into mouse PrP did not affect the addition of a GPI anchor or the localization of PrP. However, these residues did inhibit PrPSc formation, suggesting that these rabbit-specific residues interfere with a C-terminal PrPSc interaction site...|$|E
40|$|<b>Proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particles,</b> termed 'prions' are self-perpetuating protein isoforms that {{transmit}} neurodegenerative {{diseases in}} mammals and phenotypic traits in yeast. Each conformational variant of a prion protein is faithfully propagated to a homologous protein {{in the same}} cell environment. However, {{a reduction in the}} efficiency of prion transmission between different species is often observed and is termed "species barrier". Prion transmission to a heterologous protein may, in some cases, permanently change the structure of the prion variant, and divergent proteins may interfere with prion propagation in a species-specific manner. To identify the importance of both protein sequence and the cell environment on prion interference and cross-species transmission, we employed heterologous Sup 35 proteins from three Saccharomyces sensu stricto species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), Saccharomyces paradoxus (Sp), and Saccharomyces bayanus (Sb). We performed our experiments in two different cell environments (Sc and Sp). Our data show that Sup 35 from one species can form a prion in another, and we employed a transfection procedure to perform cross-species transfer of the prion. Using a shuffle procedure, we demonstrate that the specificity of prion transmission is determined by the protein itself rather than the cell environment. Interestingly, we noted that variant-specific prion patterns can be altered irreversibly during cross-species transmission through S. bayanus module II. We further show that prion interference does not always correlate with cross-species prion transmission, and the identity of particular regions or even a specific amino acid, rather than the overall level of PrD homology is crucial for determining cross-species transmission and interference. Lastly we provide evidence to suggest that prion interference is specific to the cell environment. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|The term prion (<b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particles)</b> {{was first}} coined by Stanley Prusiner while naming the causative agent {{responsible}} {{for a group of}} invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases collectively termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). A breakthrough in prion research came with the studies which revealed that yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains proteins that have the ability to form prions. Sup 35 is a S. cerevisiae protein involved in termination of translation. In a prion state referred to as [PSI+], {{a significant portion of the}} Sup 35 protein in the cell coalesces into non-functional, self-propagating, amyloid-like polymers. Thus, yeast strains that are [PSI+] show increased levels of nonsense suppression. Once present, [PSI+] propagates by recruitment of the soluble form of Sup 35 into the aggregate in a manner analogous to that of mammalian prions. A search for genetic factors affecting propagation and maintenance of [PSI+] has identified an essential role for molecular chaperones, namely Hsp 70 and Hsp 104. The Hsp 70 chaperone family and its associated co-chaperones are highly conserved from yeast to mammals. A major function of Hsp 70 is to prevent the aggregation of denatured proteins by binding to exposed hydrophobic regions and preventing the accumulation of amorphous aggregates. In the model eukaryotic S. cerevisiae, to efficiently carry out such functions Hsp 70 works in concert with a number of co-chaperones to regulate ATPase hydrolysis cycle of Hsp 70, which in-turn dictates the peptide-binding status of Hsp 70. While much data has accrued in relation to the ATPase and substrate binding cycles of Hsp 70 there is a distinct lack of information regarding the regulation of this important chaperone at the post-translational level. Recent global proteomic studies have demonstrated that in vivo Hsp 70 is phosphorylated. Using a simplified yeast system this study systematically assessed a variety of non-phosphorylateable and phosphomimetic Hsp 70 mutants for phenotypic alterations in Hsp 70 functions. It was found that alteration of Hsp 70 phosphorylation status in vivo can impair prion propagation, alter both basal and acquired thermotolerance and in some cases render cells inviable. By looking at analogous mutants in closely related cytosolic Hsp 70 s this study identified functional similarities and differences between highly homologous Hsp 70 species. This study shows a clear link between Hsp 70 phosphorylation status and in vivo function. Given Hsp 70 s central role in a variety of important cellular metabolic pathways and the conservation of these phosphorylatable sites in higher eukaryotes, these findings have far reaching implications...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by the slow onset of neurodegeneration leading to dementia in many elderly people. The pathological hallmarks of AD are: the extracellular β-amyloid deposition in the senile plaques; the β-amyloid deposition in cerebral blood vessel walls especially in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (HCHWA-D); the intracellular neurofibrillary tangle formation composed of paired helical filaments (PHF), the principal component of which is a hyperphosphorylated form of the microtubule-binding protein, tau; and neurological dysfuction and neuronal cell death in limited regions and pathways of the central nervous system. Note that β-amyloid is a truncated form of a cell surface integral membrane glycoprotein: amyloid precursor protein (APP). Despite these hallmarks, the pathogenesis of AD has been poorly understood. In the present paper, a theory of aging is proposed to give a coherent account of the origins and causes of neurodegeneration common to the diverse neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and prion (<b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particles)</b> diseases in comparison with the pathogenesis of cancers. Surprisingly, the self-aggregation of denatured proteins – such as β-amyloid, PHF and prions – responsible for neuronal cell death resembles, in many respects, the development (or the clonal evolution) of malignant cells {{at the expense of the}} entire organism harboring them. Although neurodegenerative disorders and cancers apparently differe in pathology, they nevertheless seem to follow the same priciples regardless of the level and scale of the biological organization. It is the general principles of heritable variations and natural selection as well as the general principles of self-organization that operate, not only on different molecules, but also at different hierarchical levels and scales of the biological organizaiton, independent of the details of diseases. Traditionally, natural selection, along with self-organization, has been thought to underlie `creative' aspects of biological phenomena such as the origin of life, adaptive evolution of viruses, immune recognition and brain function. It therefore must be surprising to find that the same principles will also underlie `non-creative' aspects, for example, the development of cancer and the aging of complex organisms. Although self-organization has extensively been studied in nonliving things such as chemical reactions and laser physics, it is undoubtedly true that the similar sources of the order are available to living things at different levels and scales. Several paradigm shifts are, however, required to realize how the general principles of natural selection can be extensible to non-DNA molecules which do not possess the intrinsic nature of self-reproduction. One of them is, from the traditional, genetic inheritance view that DNA (or RNA) molecules are the ultimate unit of heritable variations and natural selection at any organization level, to the epigenetic (nongenetic) inheritance view that any non-DNA molecule can be the target of heritable variations and molecular selection to accumulate in certain biochemical environment. Because they are all enriched with a β-sheet content, ready to mostly interact with one another, different denatured proteins like β-amyloid, PHF and prions can individually undergo self-templating or self-aggregating processes out of gene control. Other paradigm shifts requisite for a break-through in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders will be discussed. As it is based on the scale-invariant principles, the present theory also predicts plausible mechanisms underlying quite different classes of disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), atherosclerosis, senile cataract and many other symptoms of aging. The present theory, thus, provides the consistent and comprehensive account to the origin of aging by means of natural selection and self-organization...|$|R
40|$|Prion diseases, or {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), are a {{group of}} neurodegenerative disorders affecting both humans and animals. Prion diseases are unique in {{that they can be}} inherited, can occur sporadically, or be infectious. Stanley Prusiner introduced the term prion- (<b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particle)</b> and proposed that the infectious agent in prion diseases is composed mainly or entirely of an abnormal conformation of an otherwise normal host-encoded glycoprotein called the prion protein (PrP) 1. This hypothesis was initially greeted with great skepticism in the scientific community but then later was widely acknowledged to be true. Prusiner was awarded the 1998 Noble Prize for Science for his ground breaking research. Prion diseases typically have long incubation periods and are rapidly progressive once clinical symptoms begin. They are invariably fatal, with no effective form of treatment. Currently, however, increased understanding of their pathogenesis has led to the promise of effective therapeutic interventions in the near future. Etiopathology and Genetics (Table 1) Prion protein (PrPc) is a normal protein coded for by a gene- the human PRNP gene (PRNP) located on chromosome 20.

40|$|Background: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (C-JD) {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} characterized with rapidly progressive mental decline, myoclonic jerk {{and finally}} death. The transmissible pathogen for this disease is a <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particle</b> termed prion. The prion protein is encoded by a gene (designated as PRNP) on the short arm chromosome 20. This disorder is diagnosed based on clinical findings, course of disease, EEG, MRI and confirmed with brain biopsy. Case report: A 56 - year- old woman presented with confusion, disorientation, hyper somnolence, psychiatric problems such as hallucination, progressive mental deterioration and myoclonic jerks.

40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) {{are also}} known as prion diseases. The unusual {{infectious}} agent is composed largely, if not entirely, of a proteinase resistant aberrantly folded isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc). PrPSc, through an unknown mechanism, is believed to impose its aberrant conformation onto the host-encoded cellular prion protein, PrPC. The infectious particle is designated a "prion", an acronym for <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>particle,</b> to distinguish it from conventional pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. The essential role of PrPC in the pathogenesis of prion diseases motivated the detailed study of the cellular processing, turnover and release of bovine PrPC (boPrPC) performed in this thesis. BoPrPC {{was found to be}} subjected to two distinct proteolytic cleavage events, generating an N-terminal and a C-terminal boPrPC fragment. Both PrP fragments were released from the cell. Moreover, in normal bovine brain a C-terminal fragment was found, suggesting that similar proteolytic processing events occur in vivo. The finding that boPrPC in addition to a protease-mediated release also was released in association with exosomes, provide important information in relation to functional aspects of PrPC and possible roles of exosome-associated PrP in pathogenesis of prion diseases. Taken together, these results indicate that release of boPrPC from cells represent an important step in the normal cellular processing of boPrPC. Nor 98 is a recently recognised prion disease in sheep. The molecular characterization of the Nor 98 prion showed that the unique PK-resistant PrP fragments present in Nor 98 -affected sheep display striking similarities to those reported from individuals affected by the human prion disorder Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS). Interestingly, GSS is always associated with amino acid substitutions in the PrP. Differently, no disease-causing changes in the PrP of Nor 98 -affected sheep have been found in the affected sheep in Sweden. These findings together with observations of a distinct epidemiology, suggest that Nor 98 could be the result of a spontaneous conversion of PrPC into PrPSc, similar to that proposed for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and sporadic fatal insomnia...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder {{which affects}} widespread {{areas of the}} brainstem, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. A number of proteins are known to accumulate in parkinsonian brains including ubiquitin and α-synuclein. Prion diseases are sporadic, genetic or infectious disorders with various clinical and histopathological features caused by prion proteins as <b>infectious</b> <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>particles</b> transmitting a misfolded protein configuration through brain tissue. The most important form is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which {{is associated with a}} self-propagating pathological precursor form of the prion protein that is physiologically widely distributed in the central nervous system. Discussion It has recently been found that α-synuclein may behave similarly to the prion precursor and propagate between cells. The post-mortem proof of α-synuclein containing Lewy bodies in embryonic dopamine cells transplants in PD patient suggests that the misfolded protein might be transmitted from the diseased host to donor neurons reminiscent of prion behavior. The involvement of the basal ganglia and brainstem in the degenerative process are other congruencies between Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. However, a number of issues advise caution before categorizing Parkinson's disease as a prion disorder, because clinical appearance, brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid and neuropathological findings exhibit fundamental differences between both disease entities. Most of all, infectiousness, a crucial hallmark of prion diseases, has never been observed in PD so far. Moreover, the cellular propagation of the prion protein has not been clearly defined and it is, therefore, difficult to assess the molecular similarities between the two disease entities. Summary At the current state of knowledge, the molecular pathways of transmissible pathogenic proteins are not yet fully understood. Their exact involvement in the pathophysiology of prion disorders and neurodegenerative diseases has to be further investigated in order to elucidate a possible overlap between both disease categories that are currently regarded as distinct entities. </p...|$|R

To further investigate the functions of NS 2 - 3 and NS 4 A in the pestivirus life cycle, we established T 7 RNA polymerase-dependent trans-complementation for p 7 -NS 2 - 3 - 4 A of classical swine fever virus (CSFV).

The replicons were efficiently encapsidated into <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> after expression in trans of homologous HCV envelope proteins {{under the control}} of an adenoviral vector. Interestingly, expression in trans of core or core, p 7 and NS 2 with envelope proteins did not enhance trans-encapsidation. Expression of heterologous envelope proteins, in {{the presence or absence of}} heterologous core, p 7 and NS 2, did not rescue single-round <b>infectious</b> <b>particle</b> production. To increase the titre of homologous, single-round <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> in our system, successive cycles of trans-encapsidation and infection were performed. Four cycles resulted in a 100 -fold increase in the yield of particles. Sequence analysis revealed a total of 16 potential adaptive mutations in two independent experiments. Except for a core mutation in one experiment, all the mutations were located in non-structural regions mainly in NS 5 A (four in domain III and two near the junction with the NS 5 B gene). Reverse genetics studies suggested that D 2437 A and S 2443 T adaptive mutations, which are located at the NS 5 A-B cleavage site did not affect viral replication, but enhanced the single-round <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> assembly only in transencapsidation model. In conclusion, our trans-encapsidation system enables the production of HCV single-round <b>infectious</b> <b>particles.</b> This system is adaptable and can positively select variants.

40|$|A central {{feature of}} {{pathogen}} genomics is that different <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> (virions, bacterial cells, etc.) within an infected individual may be genetically distinct, with patterns of relatedness amongst <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> being {{the result of}} both within-host evolution and transmission from one host to the next. Here we present a new software tool, phyloscanner, which analyses pathogen diversity from multiple infected hosts. phyloscanner provides unprecedented resolution into the transmission process, allowing inference of the direction of transmission from sequence data alone. Multiply infected individuals are also identified, as they harbour subpopulations of <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> that are not connected by within-host evolution, except where recombinant types emerge. Low-level contamination is flagged and removed. We illustrate phyloscanner on both viral and bacterial pathogens, namely HIV- 1 sequenced on Illumina and Roche 454 platforms, HCV sequenced with the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform, and Streptococcus pneumoniae with sequences from multiple colonies per individual. phyloscanner is available from [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Seligman, Stephen J. (University of California, Los Angeles), and M. Ray Mickey. Estimation of {{the number}} of {{infectious}} bacterial or viral particles by the dilution method. J. Bacteriol. 88 : 31 – 36. 1964. —For viral or bacterial systems in which discrete foci of infection are not obtainable, it is possible to obtain an estimate {{of the number}} of <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> by use of the quantal response if the assay system is such that one <b>infectious</b> <b>particle</b> can elicit the response. Unfortunately, the maximum likelihood estimate is difficult to calculate, but, by the use of a modification of Haldane's approximation, it is possible to construct a table which facilitates calculation of both the average number of <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> and its relative error. Additional advantages of the method are that the number of test units per dilution can be varied, the dilutions need not bear any fixed relation to each other, and the one-particle hypothesis can be readily tested...|$|R
40|$|Prions are unusual <b>proteinaceous</b> <b>infectious</b> {{agents that}} are {{typically}} associated with a class of fatal degenerative diseases of the mammalian brain. However, the discovery of fungal prions, which are not associated with disease, suggests that we must now consider {{the effect of these}} factors on basic cellular physiology in a different light. Fungal prions are epigenetic determinants that can alter a range of cellular processes, including metabolism and gene expression pathways, and these changes can lead to a range of prion-associated phenotypes. The mechanistic similarities between prion propagation in mammals and fungi suggest that prions are not a biological anomaly but instead could be a newly appreciated and perhaps ubiquitous regulatory mechanism...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} spatiotemporal {{mathematical}} model of chlamydial infection, host immune response and spatial movement of <b>infectious</b> <b>particles.</b> The re- sulting partial differential equations model both {{the dynamics of}} the infection and changes in infection profile observed spatially {{along the length of the}} host genital tract. This model advances previous chlamydia modelling by incorporating spatial change, which we also demonstrate to be essential when the timescale for movement of <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> is equal to, or shorter than, the developmental cycle timescale. Numerical solutions and model analysis are carried out, and we present a hypothesis regarding the potential for treatment and prevention of infection by increasing chlamydial particle motility...|$|R
40|$|Amphipathic α-helices of {{exchangeable}} apolipoproteins {{have shown}} to play crucial {{roles in the}} formation of infectious hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles through the interaction with viral particles. Among the Flaviviridae members, pestivirus and flavivirus possess a viral structural protein Erns or a non-structural protein 1 (NS 1) as secretory glycoproteins, respectively, while Hepacivirus including HCV has no secretory glycoprotein. In case of pestivirus replication, the C-terminal long amphipathic α-helices of Erns are important for anchoring to viral membrane. Here we show that host-derived apolipoproteins play functional roles similar to those of virally encoded Erns and NS 1 {{in the formation of}} <b>infectious</b> <b>particles.</b> We examined whether Erns and NS 1 could compensate for the role of apolipoproteins in particle formation of HCV in apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and ApoE double-knockout Huh 7 (BE-KO), and non-hepatic 293 T cells. We found that exogenous expression of either Erns or NS 1 rescued <b>infectious</b> <b>particle</b> formation of HCV in the BE-KO and 293 T cells. In addition, expression of apolipoproteins or NS 1 partially rescued the production of <b>infectious</b> pestivirus <b>particles</b> in cells upon electroporation with an Erns-deleted non-infectious RNA. As with exchangeable apolipoproteins, the C-terminal amphipathic α-helices of Erns play the functional roles in the formation of infectious HCV or pestivirus particles. These results strongly suggest that the host- and virus-derived secretory glycoproteins have overlapping roles in the viral life cycle of Flaviviridae, especially in the maturation of <b>infectious</b> <b>particles,</b> while Erns and NS 1 also participate in replication complex formation and viral entry, respectively. Considering the abundant hepatic expression and liver-specific propagation of these apolipoproteins, HCV might have evolved to utilize them in the formation of <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> through deletion of a secretory viral glycoprotein gene...|$|R
40|$|Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and ApoE {{have been}} shown to {{participate}} in the particle formation and the tissue tropism of hepatitis C virus (HCV), but their precise roles remain uncertain. Here we show that amphipathic α-helices in the apolipoproteins participate in the HCV particle formation by using zinc finger nucleases-mediated apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and/or ApoE gene knockout Huh 7 cells. Although Huh 7 cells deficient in either ApoB or ApoE gene exhibited slight reduction of particles formation, knockout of both ApoB and ApoE genes in Huh 7 (DKO) cells severely impaired the formation of <b>infectious</b> HCV <b>particles,</b> suggesting that ApoB and ApoE have redundant roles in the formation of <b>infectious</b> HCV <b>particles.</b> cDNA microarray analyses revealed that ApoB and ApoE are dominantly expressed in Huh 7 cells, in contrast to the high level expression of all of the exchangeable apolipoproteins, including ApoA 1, ApoA 2, ApoC 1, ApoC 2 and ApoC 3 in human liver tissues. The exogenous expression of not only ApoE, but also other exchangeable apolipoproteins rescued the <b>infectious</b> <b>particle</b> formation of HCV in DKO cells. In addition, expression of these apolipoproteins facilitated the formation of <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> of genotype 1 b and 3 a chimeric viruses. Furthermore, expression of amphipathic α-helices in the exchangeable apolipoproteins facilitated the particle formation in DKO cells through an interaction with viral particles. These results suggest that amphipathic α-helices in the exchangeable apolipoproteins play crucial roles in the <b>infectious</b> <b>particle</b> formation of HCV and provide clues to the understanding of life cycle of HCV and the development of novel anti-HCV therapeutics targeting for viral assembly...|$|R
50|$|In {{fact the}} {{infectivity}} {{of the virus}} or bacteria in question will alter this relationship. One way around this {{is to use a}} functional definition of <b>infectious</b> <b>particles</b> rather than a strict count, such as a plaque forming unit for viruses.|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} {{shown that the}} Epstein Barr virus (EBV) incorporates the autophagic membrane label LC 3 B-II into mature virus particles. Upon EBV production, autophagic membranes are stabilized and <b>infectious</b> viral <b>particle</b> production is dependent on these, because ATG protein-deficiency dampens, whereas rapamycin induces, <b>infectious</b> <b>particle</b> production. Moreover, viral DNA accumulates in the cytosol when macroautophagy is impaired. We therefore conclude that EBV needs autophagic membranes for efficient enveloping during <b>infectious</b> viral <b>particle</b> production. Here, we discuss how EBV might incorporate lipidated LC 3 B (LC 3 B-II) into the viral envelope and how other viruses as well as cellular processes customize the macroautophagy machinery for exocytosis {{in the context of}} unconventional secretion...|$|R
