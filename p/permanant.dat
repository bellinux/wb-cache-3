40|$|A circuit {{capable of}} {{measuring}} nanoampere currents while floating at voltages up {{to at least}} 25 kV is described. The circuit relays its output to ground potential via an optical fiber. We particularly emphasize the design and construction techniques which allow robust operation {{in the presence of}} high voltage spikes and discharges. It is occasionally necessary to measure nanoamp or smaller currents flowing in a part of a circuit at high voltage. It is often easiest to do so by making a measurement of the ground return current of the high voltage supply [1], but occasionally this is inconvenient. Our particular application stems from an experiment to measure the <b>permanant</b> electric dipole moment of the electron [2] [3], in which voltages of up to Â± 12 kV are applied to electric field plates in order to polarize a beam of YbF molecules. A leakage current larger than about 10 nA between the field plates is a source of systematic error in the experiment. It is desirable to measure directly this plate leakag...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{patients}} with anal incontinence due to neurologic disease {{or failure of}} previous incontinence surgery underwent implantation of an artificial anal sphincter. The system used was a modification of the AMS 800 artificial urinary sphincter. In two patients, infection necessitated removal of the system, and in four patients, eight revisional procedures had to be performed because of mechanical failure. After various modifications of the system, especially reinforcement of the closing mechanism of the cuff, only one case of mechanical failure has occurred. Erosion through the anal canal did not occur. Among 10 {{patients with}} the system in function for more than 6 months, the result was considered excellent in 5, with only occasional leakage of flatus, good in 3, who occasionally leaked liquid feces and flatus, and acceptable in 2, in whom the cuff obstructed defecation. It is concluded that implantation of an artificial anal sphincter is a valid alternative to <b>permanant</b> colostomy in patients with anal incontinence due to neurologic disorders and in patients in whom other types of incontinence surgery have failed...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} essay {{tries to}} turn a thorough reading of Adorno's analyses and reflections on aesthetics - and on music aesthetics in particular - to good account for a sufficient understanding and aesthetically productive assimilation of the "end of art"-thesis. I have endeavored to show in part I that a thesis concerning the "end of art", which in this context implies advancement modernism (Fortschrittsmoderne), is very conspicuous in Adorno's works, where advancement modernism is {{to be understood as}} modernism negating tradition (in an abstract sense), ousting especially the expressive music of the nineteenth century and insisting on <b>permanant</b> innovation. Using Adorno's interpretation of Mahler and Berg as a point of departure, I have demonstrated in part II that Adorno's work does feature a concept of modernism which incorporates the two fundamental postulates of postmodernism - integration of tradition and popular art -, simultaneously submitting them to severe criticism (part III). To conclude, availing myself of the concept "generative-destructive aesthetics" gained from a perusal of Adorno's works, I have ventured to provide evidence for the relevance of Adorno's approach to a productive understanding of the "end of art"-thesis today...|$|E
40|$|In 2005 {{a dental}} {{survey of the}} {{prevalence}} of caries among 6 - and 12 -year-old schoolchildren in The Hague was carried out. In {{the case of the}} 12 -year-olds, the prevalence of dental erosion was also studied. The sample consisted of 814 students in twelve primary schools in The Hague. The results reveal that since the previous study, in 2002, the trend in the direction of an increasing percentage of children with deciduous caries-free teeth and permanent caries-free teeth had continued. In the case of the children who were not caries-free, it was noticeable that, in general, the number of new dental caries (dmfs- and DMFS-score) had not changed in the period 1996 - 2005, while the number of restorations among the 6 - and 12 -year olds had decreased. The mean restorative index in the deciduous dentition of 6 -year-olds decreased from approximately 40 % in 1996 to approximately 20 % in 2005; with respect to <b>permanant</b> dentition among 12 -year-olds, the percentage decreased from more than 90 % to 60 %. The percentage of 12 -year-olds with dental erosion in 2005 remained unchanged as compared with 2002 : 24 %. The research revealed that there was no increase in dental caries or dental erosion among the 6 - and 12 -year-old school children in The Hague...|$|E
40|$|The Hieracium flora of westernmost Dalarna, {{comprising}} the southern {{fringe of the}} Scandes alps (central Scandinavia), is extremely rich in species. The area is dominated by species-poor coniferous sub-alpine and taiga forest, but within this matrix there are small and isolated sites with high species richness of both Hieracium and other plants. Both steep mountain slopes with outcrops of base-rich bedrock and moving ground water, and old seasonal or <b>permanant</b> human settlements constitute such biodiversity hotspots. However, today the former are threatened by modern forestry practices and/or exploitation for winter tourism and the latter are commonly abandoned and subjected to severe overgrowth or dramatically changed land-use. The area was thorougly surveyed in 1897 - 1921. In 2007, the same region and partly the same sites, were revisited. In 1897 - 1921, 15 Hieracium species were on average recorded from each site, but when the same sites were revisited in 2007 significantly fewer, only about 6 (40 %) species per site, were refound. As far as the total species pool {{of the study area}} is concerned, it consisted of 168 species in 1897 - 1921, whereof only 117 (67 %) were found in 2007. This remarkable reduction in species richness at both the local and the regional scale is attributable to both modern forestry practices and to the cessation of traditional agricultural practices like hay-making on semi-natural grasslands and extensive cattle-grazing in the forests. It is concluded that to reduce the on-going severe loss of biodiversity in the sub-alpine and taiga regions, conservation efforts in these areas ought to be enhanced and concentrated not only on saving what still remains of old-growth forest but also on managing remnants of grasslands and formerly grazed or mowed open forests around former settlements...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityBACKGROUND: Lead dust {{in homes}} {{is the primary}} route of lead {{ingestion}} for children. More and more evidence concludes that levels of lead < 10 !g/dl, which once {{was thought to be}} safe, can cause <b>permanant</b> neurological effects and damage. Lead exposure and toxicity is hard to treat because of the negative side effects of the chelating agents. The focus should be on prevention. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a study to see if window replacements and/or window repairs will significantly decrease the lead levels in low income housing homes. This study is collaboration between HUD, weatherization groups, and public health departments. DESIGN/METHODS: We performed statistical analyses of lead loading result data that was collected on the field. Compared the lead loading results for each sample location in each unit before and after window repair (Cohort 2), window replacement (Cohort 1), and no treatment for the control group (Cohort 3). The analyses were completed using a two sample matched pair z test and a significance level of 0. 05. The control group was used to measure variance and to see if the difference is statistically significant. RESULTS: There appears to be a statistically significant reduction in the mean loading results in the Window Repair Cohort 2 across both Phase 1 to 2 (z=- 2. 63) and Phase 1 to 3 (z= - 3. 10). There was not a statitistically significant reduction in the mean loading result of the samples in the Window Replacement Cohort 1 across Phase 1 to 3 (z=- 1. 3), and there surprisingly appears to be an increase in mean loading result of the samples across Phase 1 to Phase 2 (z= 1. 65). There was a significant decrease in loading results throughout Phase 1 to 2 and Phase 1 to 3 for the Control Group Cohort 3. CONCLUSIONS: There is sufficient evidence to suggest that window repair will decrease lead dust levels in homes. According to our preliminary results window replacement decreases the average lead loading results by 43. 6 %, while window repairs decreased the average lead loading result by 97. 4 %. While this supports our hypothesis, the increase in lead loading results after a short time window replacement is unexpected. Further studies should be implemented to prevent high lead levels directly after weatherization and provide regulations...|$|E
