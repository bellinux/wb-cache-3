5|$|On December19, a {{tropical}} depression formed near St. Brandon. With {{an area of}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> the southeast, the depression moved to the northeast and was named Clera, after a Dvorak rating of 2.5. It only achieved winds of 50km/h (30mph) before weakening.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Dyson swarm, the {{constructs}} {{making it up}} are not in orbit around the star, but would be statites—satellites suspended by use of enormous light sails using radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs {{would not be in}} danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of radiation <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.|$|E
5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce {{the sound of the}} original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. Pressing a key harder allows the head to come into contact under greater <b>pressure,</b> <b>to</b> the extent that the Mellotron responds to aftertouch.|$|E
5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
40|$|Branding {{of higher}} {{education}} institutions (HEIs) is an expanding area of research. The existing literature mainly draws on the strategic management perspective that argues that HEIs are <b>pressured</b> <b>to</b> develop brands which differentiate them from their competitors. Past studies, however, do insufficiently {{take into account that}} most HEIs are positioned in systems that contain both competitive <b>pressures</b> (<b>to</b> differentiate) and institutional <b>pressures</b> (<b>to</b> meet taken-for-granted expectations), where neither of the pressures is clearly dominant. Our multiple case study of the five Flemish universities finds that branding can simultaneously address competitive and institutional pressures and that the universities studied combine aspects of distinctiveness with elements of similarity...|$|R

5|$|As Josephine {{continued}} east-northeastward, it had weakened {{back into}} a tropical storm. Under the influence of an area of high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> the north and a nearby area of low pressure, Josephine began executing a cyclonic loop to the north while approaching Atlantic Canada. During the cyclonic loop, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October18. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Josephine merged with a broad mid-latitude trough. The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the cyclonic loop on October19. The system eventually curved to the east-northeastward and moved in that direction until it became unidentifiable on October21.|$|E
5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in late 1933 and {{escalating}} {{throughout the}} first half of 1934, American Roman Catholics launched a campaign against what they deemed the immorality of American cinema. This, plus a potential government takeover of film censorship and social research seeming to indicate that movies which were seen to be immoral could promote bad behavior, was enough <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> force the studios to capitulate to greater oversight.|$|E

5|$|By resubmitting the discredited treaty {{through a}} House-sponsored bill, the Tyler {{administration}} reignited sectional hostilities over Texas admission. Both northern Democratic and southern Whig Congressmen had been bewildered by local political agitation {{in their home}} states during the 1844 presidential campaigns. Now, northern Democrats found themselves vulnerable to charges of appeasement of their southern wing if they capitulated to Tyler's slavery expansion provisions. On the other hand, Manifest Destiny enthusiasm in the north placed politicians under <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> admit Texas immediately to the Union.|$|E

5|$|Divorce was legalized by a {{law passed}} in 1987. The church opposed it, {{but it had}} huge popular support that {{included}} even Catholic factions, who reasoned that marital separation already existed, and divorce simply made it explicit. The church opposed Alfonsín after that point. The church successfully exerted <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> prevent the abolition of religious education. In line with the teachings of Pope John Paul II, the Church criticized what it perceived as an increase in drugs, terrorism, abortion and pornography.|$|E

5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing.

Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.|$|E
