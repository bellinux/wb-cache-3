Examples of ‘low input’ {{pig production}} systems are “Iberico” in Spain, “Neuland” pigs in Germany, “Scharrelvarkens” in The Netherlands, “Natura Farm” in Switzerland, “Label Rouge” in France and “Freedom Food” in United Kingdom. Organic pig production systems have similar characteristics to those described for ‘low input systems’ above. However, organic farming standards prescribe e. g. low stocking densities, access to outdoor runs, restrict the level of ‘bought in, non-organic’ feeds etc, which usually results in higher management and feed costs and more limited dietary composition choices than in other ‘low input’ systems...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{non-slip}} surfaces during {{loading and}} unloading of weaned pigs {{plays an important role}} in animal welfare and economics of the pork industry. Currently, the guidelines available only suggest the use of ramps below 20 ° to load and unload pigs. Three ramp angles (0 °, 10 ° or 20 °), five bedding materials (nothing, sand, feed, wood shavings or wheat straw hay), two moistures (dry or wet bedding; > 50 % moisture) over two seasons (> 23. 9 °C summer, < 23. 9 °C winter) were assessed for slips/falls/vocalizations (n = 6, 000 pig observations). “Score” was calculated by the sum of slips, falls, and vocalizations. With the exception of using feed as a bedding, all beddings provided some protection against elevated slips, falls, and vocalizations (P < 0. 01). Providing bedding reduced (P < 0. 05) scores regardless of whether the bedding was dry or wet.

40|$|The {{effect of}} housing on animal {{environment}} and behavior {{have been studied}} in a comparative trial with three deep-bedded hoop structures and one totally, environmentally- controlled slatted-floor building. In order to assess animal welfare, behavior indicative of both poor and rich welfare were quantified. Behavior indicative of poor welfare {{were considered to be}} the performance of aberrant behavior, stereotypical behavior and excessive fighting. Behaviors indicative of rich behavior were the performance of normal maintenance behaviors and play behavior. Hoop structures experienced lower winter air temperatures than did the confinement building (mean, 4. 8 0 vs. 18. 1 0 C), but effective temperatures for the animals were enhanced in the hoop structure by heat generated by the decomposing bedded pack (ranging from approximately – 1. 1 0 C to 47 0 C). The confinement building maintained a higher ammonia level than did the hoop structures. Pigs raised in the confinement system which did use bedding were found to be resting more often (P 3 ̆c. 03); however, they were also found to perform more aberrant and stereotypical behavior in addition to more frequent fighting (P 3 ̆c. 03). Pigs raised in the hoop structure were found to perform more play behavior than confinement raised pigs (P 3 ̆c. 03).

40|$|Weather-related {{stressors}} are a well-recognized opponent {{to animal}} welfare and can have important ramifications for animal performance. Sound animal husbandry practices historically {{have attempted to}} diminish the effects of deleterious environmental factors. Providing aid to animals when temperatures are above or below their thermal neutral zone (TNZ) can improve animal welfare and/or performance. Because most breeds of cattle are not well {{equipped to deal with}} heat, the temperatures at which heat stress can begin to affect cattle can be surprisingly low. The onset of mild heat stress can occur at a temperature humidity index (THI 1) value of 75, which can correspond to an ambient temperature as low as 78 °F. Aside from food, water, and shelter, arguably the most widely used intervention to counteract the elements is the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>bedding</b> material during times of cold weather or during events for which the stress of cold may prove too difficult for animals to compensate (i. e., calving, illness, etc.). By providing a layer of insulation as bedding for animals, heat exchange via conduction from their body to the earth is decreased, allowing them to maintain body temperature at a much lower cost to their metabolism. This basic principle of insulation also may be applied in times of heat stress. In an attempt to decrease the effects of heat stress in feedlot cattle, some producers apply wheat straw or grass hay as bedding material, hypothesizing that bedding acts as an insulator from the pen floor, which otherwise serves as a reservoir and conductor of heat. Bedding materials normally are lighter in color than the pen surface, and therefore have less solar heat gain. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted {{to examine the effects of}} these bedding materials on the temperature of the pen surface. Additionally, determining the effects of varying thicknesses of manure on pen surface temperatures may provide useful information for management decisions regarding pen cleaning and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Emergency rest centres (ERC) are {{premises}} {{that are}} used for the temporary accommodation of evacuees during an emergency situation. They form {{an important part of}} emergency response, by providing a focal point for receiving people and providing food, shelter, information and support. The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 creates a legislative right for ‘reasonable’ access to goods and services for disabled people. This legislation does not differentiate between emergency and non emergency situations which means that those with a responsibility for emergency planning need to consider the accessibility of ERCs. This article examines ERC provision and reviews access for disabled people. It focuses on a study of three ERCs that were established in different local authority areas within the Yorkshire and Humber region in the UK during a flooding event on 25 th June 2007. While uncovering many instances of good practise, the results from the research also identified a number of lessons to be learnt, in particular it was noted that the main barriers to access were encountered with: •	Facilities and elements that did not comprise part of the buildings normal operation, such as the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>bedding,</b> medical assistance and effective communication; and •	Facilities that would not normally be expected to be used to the extent, or duration, whilst the emergency rest centre was in operation, such as the provision of adequate welfare facilities. The research also noted that Civil Protection Legislation within the UK contains limited instruction or guidance to those with responsibility for Emergency Rest Centre provision. This provides little impetus for Emergency Planners to consider the needs of disabled people. This research has broad implications for local authorities and national government representatives. It identifies a need for those with responsibility for emergency planning and response to strengthen their knowledge of disabled people, and to adopt a more holistic approach to the provision of emergency planning and response...|$|E
40|$|Ascaris suum is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} parasitic helminth in pig production systems worldwide. In most industrialized countries production systems are highly intensive and fully in-doors (low prevalence of parasites) {{but there is a}} growing market for pigs produced out-door or under organic pig farming conditions (high prevalence of parasites). In organic pig production there is a number of factors related to housing and management practices that predispose for A. suum infections. These practices include restricted use of anthelmintics, late weaning of piglets (after min seven weeks of age) and access to outdoor runs. <b>Provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>bedding</b> material, which might be conducive for development and survival of free-living stages of helminths, is mandatory in organic production systems but the amount and type of bedding material vary between farm and housing systems. The differences in A. suum egg development in different housing systems have been poorly described. Biodegradation of organic matter in deep litter housing systems produces physico-chemical conditions which may affect the development and survival of A. suum eggs, but little is known about such effects. Understanding the ecology and transmission dynamics of A. suum may help prevent infections in organic farming. Pig slurry is used to fertilize crops in organic as well as conventional farming and may be treated to inactivate a variety of pathogens present in it before application. To achieve adequate pathogen inactivation, slurry may need to be stored for around one year which may not be ideal logistically and economically. Chemical treatment of slurry may reduce storage time needed to adequately inactivate pathogens. The eggs of A. suum are commonly used as a conservative indicator in estimating pathogen inactivation during slurry treatment as they are more resistant to environmental stress than bacterial and viral pathogens. The eggs of the poultry ascarid, Ascaridia galli are ubiquitous, resistant and available even in places where the eggs of A. suum cannot be found, e. g., areas without pig keeping, but {{little is known about the}} suitability of A. galli eggs as a conservative hygiene indicator. Currently, viability of A. suum eggs is estimated by their ability to embryonate which takes up to six weeks depending on temperature. There is a need to develop more rapid viability tests and in addition, embryonation cannot be used as a viability criterion for already embryonated eggs. A quantitative egg hatch test may thus be helpful for already embryonated eggs. The present Ph. D. project therefore addressed the above issues by investigating in six separate studies, the ecology and transmission of A. suum eggs in organic pig farms, including determination of conditions under which A. suum eggs are inactivated. ...|$|E

The study also reports the general professional controversy which surrounds the definition and measurement of standards of care in long-stay facilities for the care of the elderly, but, since it is only a pilot study, does not contain any evidence of the effects of different forms or standards of care on changes in the state of health of patients.

METHODS: Aggregation of health and aged care service indicators by Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) region including: public and private acute and subacute (rehabilitation and geriatric evaluation and management) hospital beds, flexible and mainstream aged care places as at 30 June 2006. RESULTS: There was marked variation in the distribution of acute and subacute hospital beds among the 79 ACAT regions. Aged care places were more evenly distributed. However, the distribution of transition care places was uneven. Rural areas had poorer <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> all <b>beds.</b> There was no evidence of coordination in the allocation of hospital and aged care services between the Commonwealth and state/territory governments. There was a weak relationship between the allocation of transition care places and the distribution of health and aged care services. DISCUSSION: Overall, the distribution of services available to older persons is uneven across Australia. While the Transition Care Program is flexible and is providing rural communities with access to rehabilitation, it will not be adequate to address the increasing needs associated with the ageing of the Australian population. An integrated national plan for aged care and rehabilitation services should be considered. Lynne C Giles, Julie A Halbert, Len C Gray, Ian D Cameron and Maria Crott...|$|R

This paper describes methods developed to determine the degree of genetic variability of the virus both during individual epidemics and worldwide. It is necessary for these methods to be quick, easy and cheap so that large numbers of samples can be analysed readily. They are based on extraction of viral RNA directly from clinical samples or from viral cultures, reverse transcription of the viral RNA, and then amplification of selected regions of the genome by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR products are then analysed by restriction mapping, or, if necessary, direct nucleotide sequencing. In this way isolates of RSV have been shown to fall into a number of genotypes, with epidemics being made up of cocirculating genotypes whose relative proportions vary with each epidemic. An understanding of the molecular epidemiology of this important human pathogen will be of significance in the search for an effective vaccine...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the large}} ear size, English lops are {{slightly}} more vulnerable {{to a number of}} health problems, particularly ear infections, and it is advised that the ears should be checked periodically, especially for excess wax that can be accumulated on their deep ear canals and cleaned when appropriate. Ear blemishes can be kept to a minimum by keeping the toenails clipped, which can prevent injuries arising from the rabbit treading on its ears. The large surface area of its ears and body, and the absence of a dense undercoat can result in greater heat loss, which can become a problem for outdoor rabbits in cold climates and winters, and in the onset of these conditions, special measures should be taken to insulate the hutch, such as the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> increased <b>bedding</b> and hay, and draft excluders. In freezing conditions, an English Lop should never be given a water dish or crock, since wet ears will freeze. Accordingly, English Lops do better in heat than many other rabbit breeds, due to the cooling factor of their large ears. However, any temperature over 85 degrees is considered dangerously high and care should be made to ensure the rabbit has plenty of shade, fresh water, or cool surface to lie against. An English Lop can live in either a solid bottom hutch or cage with bedding provided, or an adequetly spaced wire bottom cage provided they have a thick resting board/pad to prevent injury to hocks.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the problem of}} allocating a binary treatment among a target population based on discrete and continuous observed covariates. The goal is to maximize the mean social utlity of an eventual outcome when a budget constraint limits what fraction of the population can be treated. We propose a treatment allocation procedure based on sample data from randomized treatment assignment. We examine this procedure {{in the light of}} statistical decision theory and derive asymptotic frequentist properties of the allocation rule and the welfare generated from it. The resulting distribution theory is used to conduct inference on the welfare loss resulting from restricted covariate choice and on the dual value, i. e. the minimum resources needed to attain aspecific average welfare via efficient treatment assignment. The methodology is applied to the optimal <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> anti-malaria <b>bed</b> net subsidies, using data from a randomized experiment conducted in western Kenya. We find that a government which can afford to distribute bed net subsidies to only 50 % of its target population can, with an efficient allocation rule based on multiple covariates, increase bed-net use by 8 percentage points (25 percent) relative to random allocation and by 4 percentage points (11 percent) relative to one based on wealth only. Our methods do not rely on functional form assumptions and can be extended to situations encompassing conditional cash transfers, imperfect treatment take-up and spillover effects on non-eligibles. ...|$|R

40|$|Practical relevance: Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{very common}} in the cat {{and in many cases}} is {{associated}} with significant long-term pain, which limits mobility and activity, and severely compromises the animal's quality of life. Clinical challenges: The treatment of chronic arthritic pain is a major challenge and many analgesic drugs used in other species are not licensed, not available or not tested for use in the cat. Many older cats with painful OA have some degree of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and many clinicians are reluctant to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in these animals because of the potential for nephrotoxicity. Evidence base: There are several publications that show that meloxicam is an effective NSAID for the cat and can be used long-term. It is easy to administer and there is published evidence that meloxicam can actually slow the progression of CKD in this species. Many other drugs are used to treat chronic pain in the cat but there is no documented evidence of their efficacy in OA. Unlike the dog, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of omega- 3 fatty acid-rich diets in managing feline OA and further work is required. There is no published data as yet for the usefulness or otherwise of nutraceuticals (glucosamine and chondroitin) in managing feline OA; studies in the authors' clinic suggest some pain-relieving effect. Research into environmental enrichment as a way of improving quality of life in cats with painful OA is lacking, but it is an approach worth using where possible. Modifications to the environment (eg, <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> comfortable <b>bedding</b> and ramps) are also important. </p...|$|R
