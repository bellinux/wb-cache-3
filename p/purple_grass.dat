60|$|The <b>Purple</b> <b>Grass</b> (Eragrostis pectinacea) {{is now in}} {{the height}} of its beauty. I {{remember}} still when I first noticed this grass particularly. Standing on a hillside near our river, I saw, thirty or forty rods off, a stripe of purple half a dozen rods long, under the edge of a wood, where the ground sloped toward a meadow. It was as high-colored and interesting, though not quite so bright, as the patches of Rhexia, being a darker purple, like a berry's stain laid on close and thick. On going to and examining it, I found it {{to be a kind of}} grass in bloom, hardly a foot high, with but few green blades, and a fine spreading panicle of purple flowers, a shallow, purplish mist trembling around me. Close at hand it appeared but a dull purple, and made little impression on the eye; it was even difficult to detect; and if you plucked a single plant, you were surprised to find how thin it was, and how little color it had. But viewed at a distance in a favorable light, it was of a fine lively purple, flower-like, enriching the earth. Such puny causes combine to produce these decided effects. I was the more surprised and charmed because grass is commonly of a sober and humble color.|$|E

40|$|Evaporation from a cutover {{raised bog}} in The Netherlands was {{modelled}} using a detailed, physically based evaporation model for heterogeneous vegetation and unsaturated soil water flow "SWAPS". The model enables a quantification {{of the role}} of heterogeneity on evaporation. Micro-meteorological measurements above a vegetation of Molinia caerulea (<b>purple</b> moor <b>grass)</b> in the cutover raised bog "Engbertsdijksvenen" are used for calibration and validation of the model. In the present study, it is investigated how small scale heterogeneity affects the prediction of evaporation. Therefore, two hypothetical variants, which represent two possible types of small scale heterogeneity in peatlands, are evaluated: (1) peatland in which drainage has resulted in a vegetation cover of 50 % <b>purple</b> moor <b>grass</b> and 50 % birch, (2) peatland in which after rewetting the vegetation consists of 50 % <b>purple</b> moor <b>grass</b> and 50 % Sphagnum mosses. The results show that characteristics of the evaporation from <b>purple</b> moor <b>grass</b> in the two variants are dissimilar. The evaporation from <b>purple</b> moor <b>grass,</b> forming the lower components of a vegetation stand (variant 1), can be accurately predicted via radiation based models. In case <b>purple</b> moor <b>grass</b> is the exposed part of the vegetation (variant 2), such models are not likely to predict the evaporation from <b>purple</b> moor <b>grass</b> correctly. An exposed, aerodynamically rough vegetation requires a model that accounts for the vapour pressure deficit as well...|$|R

Randomization tests were applied to assess the relationship between the presence of reptile species and habitat. Highest numbers of reptiles were found in habitats with a combination of common heather and <b>purple</b> moor <b>grass,</b> whereas habitats with common rush scored the lowest.
