40|$|BACKGROUND Sperm {{heterogeneity}} in the human, as {{observed in}} oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT), {{is associated with}} hypospermatogenesis. METHODS The chromatin of sperm from OAT and normospermic males was characterized with antibodies specific for nucleosomes, the histone H 3. 1 /H 3. 2 isoform, histone TH 2 B, apoptosis-associated H 4 acetylation (KM- 2) and protamines. Subsequently, sperm samples were stained with the thiol-specific fluorochrome monobromobimane (mBBr) before and after reduction with dithiotreitol (DTT) as most thiol groups reside in the cysteine-rich protamines. We also used fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) for sperm histograms and sorting for high or low free and total thiol levels. These fractions were further analysed for DNA damage with the TdT-UTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay. RESULTS OAT sperm nuclei stained higher for nucleosomes and KM 2 -epitopes, and lower for TH 2 B. For free, and total, thiol groups, OAT sperm were characterized by biphasic distributions, reflecting incomplete thiol oxidation as well as overoxidation, and possibly reduced protamine contents. The TUNEL assay on sperm subfractions, for both control and OAT sperm, revealed that {{a lower level of}} free thiol groups is associated with a higher TUNEL incidence, and this relationship was also found for total thiol levels. Hence, both overoxidation and a low total number of thiol groups <b>predestine</b> <b>for</b> sperm apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS Chromatin characteristics reflecting an incomplete nucleosome to protamine remodelling were found in subfertile males. Sperm apoptosis is related to both incomplete remodelling and protamine overoxidation...|$|R

The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the sacraments, while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God.

40|$|Modern robotic {{systems with}} a large number of {{actuated}} degrees of freedom can be utilized to perform several tasks at the same time while following a given order of priority. The most frequently used method is to apply null space projections to realize such a strict hierarchy, where lower-priority tasks are executed {{as long as they do}} not interfere with any higher-priority objectives. However, introducing null space projectors inevitably destroys the beneficial and safety-relevant feature of passivity. Here, two controllers are proposed to restore the passivity: one with local energy tanks on each hierarchy level and one with a global tank for the entire system. The formal proofs of passivity show that no energy is generated by these controllers. Once the tanks are empty, passivity is still guaranteed at the cost of some control performance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Anthracyclines, such as {{pegylated}} liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and epirubicin (EP), {{are effective}} {{for the treatment}} of malignant tumors. Unfortunately, their implementation in therapy is limited due to severe side-effects such as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: As the exact pathogenesis of PPE still remains unclear, laser scanning microscopy was utilized to detect PLD, EP and their metabolites in and on the skin surface of patients. RESULTS: It was shown that PLD was significantly more frequently detectable on the skin than was EP (p< 0. 05), whereas both substances were most frequently seen in the palms and soles. Additionally, it has been visualized that the substances reach the skin surface via sweat, where they distribute and then penetrate back into the skin. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that a high density of sweat glands and a thick stratum corneum might represent important <b>predestined</b> factors <b>for</b> the development of PPE.

Most important, CDI is an extremely fast measurement technique: A measurement on a 100 x 100 mm" 2 wafer under low-level injection conditions can be performed on a timescale of seconds whereas a standard MW-PCD map needs about 2 hours for a measurement with identical resolution even if high injection conditions are chosen. The combination of a spatially resolved and fast measurement <b>predestines</b> CDI <b>for</b> in-line process control.
