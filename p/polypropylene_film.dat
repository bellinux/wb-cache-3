25|$|The {{double-sided}} metallized film is electrostatically field-free {{because the}} electrodes {{have the same}} voltage potential {{on both sides of}} the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor. This film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a <b>polypropylene</b> <b>film</b> capacitor with double-sided metallization on a polyester film carrier makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the thinner polyester foil improves the volumetric efficiency of the capacitor. Film capacitors with a double-sided metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher surge current handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.|$|E

These changes were investigated using especially in-situ FT-IR and dichroism as well as XRD and Raman spectroscopy. For this purpose, an in-situ variable temperature set-up is developed and adapted for FT-IR studies. Accordingly, the changes in the peaks related to the amorphous and crystalline contents of the films as well as the peaks reflecting the orientation of the films were investigated over the temperature range from 120 - 170 o C. Temperature cycle was also applied. Moreover, the films were investigated after application of additional stress at 120 o C for various durations. The crystallinity and orientation of the films are affected significantly when the films were analyzed at higher temperature (> 150 o C). The crystallinity content of the film recovers after returning back to room temperature whereas orientational loss are permenant. Türkçü, Harun NezihM. S...|$|R
