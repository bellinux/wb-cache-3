50|$|For AC-operated devices (e.g. coaxial cable, loudspeakers), {{there may}} be even be two power ratings, a maximum (peak) <b>power</b> <b>rating</b> and an average <b>power</b> <b>rating.</b> For such devices, the peak <b>power</b> <b>rating</b> usually {{specifies}} the low frequency or pulse energy, while the average <b>power</b> <b>rating</b> limits high-frequency operation. Average <b>power</b> calculation <b>rating</b> depends on some assumptions how the device {{is going to be}} used. For example, the EIA rating method for loudspeakers uses a shaped noise signal that simulates music and allows peak excursion of 6dB, so an EIA rating of 50 Watts corresponds to 200 Watts peak rating.|$|R

50|$|Like carbon, lithium {{is also a}} good energy conductor. It's also {{already in}} use in {{commercial}} lithium-ion batteries. Lithium makes a good energy conductor because it allows ions to transfer faster than other elements and is also able to hold on to that energy longer. Research has shown that coating a phosphate particle with a layer of LiFePO4(Lithium iron Phosphate) allows for an even faster rate of ion transferral. Lithium iron phosphate was made by solid-state reaction using Li2CO3(lithium carbonate), FeC2O4(Iron(II) Oxalate), and NH4H2PO4(ammonium dihydrogen phosphate). The compounds were then placed in acetone and ball-milled(grinding materials together in a special cylindrical device) before being heated at 350 °C for 10 hours and then being allowed to cool to room temperature The mixture was then pelletized under 10,000 pounds of pressure before being heated again at 600 °C for 10 hours under argon. Each nanoball created measured around 50 nm(nanometers) in diameter. Under normal circumstances, electrochemical systems (eg, batteries) can only achieve high power rates with supercapacitors. Supercapacitors achieve a high <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> by storing energy through surface adsorption reactions of charged species on an electrode. However, this results in low energy density. Instead of just storing charge on the surface of a material, Lithium iron phosphate can achieve a high <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> and high energy density by storing charge in the bulk of itself (the interior of the carbon nanoballs). This is possible because lithium iron phosphate has high lithium bulk mobility. Creating a fast ion-conducting surface phase through controlled off-stoichiometry (controlling the mole to mole ratio of the reactants and products in the molecular equation) enabled an ultrafast discharge rate.|$|E

50|$|In January 2005, Alcoa {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding with the government to develop an integrated aluminum industry in Ghana that would include bauxite mining, alumina refining, aluminum production, and rail transportation infrastructure upgrades. The MOU called for the restart {{of three of the}} five existing potlines at the idled Valco smelter, which would produce about 120,000 metric tonnes per year (t/yr) of aluminum; the designed capacity of the plant is 200,000 t/yr. The government and Alcoa planned to restart the Valco smelter as soon as an interim <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> agreement is reached with the Volta River Authority. The government (90%) was to be the managing owner of the smelter and Alcoa (10%), through its subsidiary, Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals joint venture between Alcoa Inc.

The government had acquired Kaiser Aluminum Corp.’s 90% interest in Valco in 2004. Kaiser closed the Valco plant in 2003 after struggling with fluctuating operating levels for several years and dealing with restricted power allocations from the Volta River Authority.|$|E
50|$|Implantable {{medical devices}} require {{batteries}} that can deliver a steady, reliable power source {{for as long}} as possible. These applications call for a battery that has a low self-discharge rate, for when it’s not in use, and a high <b>power</b> <b>rate,</b> for when it needs to be used, {{especially in the case of}} an implantable defibrillator. Also, users of the product will want a battery that can go through many cycles, so these devices will not have to be replaced or serviced often. Thin film lithium ion batteries have the ability to meet these requirements. The advancement from a liquid to a solid electrolyte has allowed these batteries to take almost any shape without the worry of leaking, and it has been shown that certain types of thin film rechargeable lithium batteries can last for around 50,000 cycles. Another advantage to these thin film batteries is that they can be arranged in series to give a larger voltage equal to the sum of the individual battery voltages. This fact can be used in reducing the “footprint” of the battery, or the size of the space needed for the battery, in the design of a device.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{continuing}} evolution of both threats and computer technology, the Phalanx system has, like most military systems, been developed {{through a number of}} different configurations. The basic (original) style is the Block 0, equipped with first-generation, solid-state electronics and with marginal capability against surface targets. The Block 1 (1988) upgrade offered various improvements in radar, ammunition, computing <b>power,</b> <b>rate</b> of fire, and an increase in maximum engagement elevation to +70 degrees. These improvements were intended to increase the system's capability against emerging Russian supersonic anti-ship missiles. Block 1A introduced a new computer system to counter more maneuverable targets. The Block 1B PSuM (Phalanx Surface Mode, 1999) adds a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor to make the weapon effective against surface targets. This addition was developed to provide ship defense against small vessel threats and other [...] "floaters" [...] in littoral waters and to improve the weapon's performance against slower low-flying aircraft. The FLIR's capability is also of use against low-observability missiles and can be linked with the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) system to increase RAM engagement range and accuracy. The Block 1B also allows for an operator to visually identify and target threats.|$|E
5000|$|Greenwood County, via the Greenwood County Electric Power Commission, {{a special}} purpose {{directed}} created by Act of the S.C. General Assembly, operated the Buzzards Roost Project until the mid-1960s. At that time, Duke Power {{made an offer}} to purchase the county's electric distribution network and customer base for $10,000,000, {{as well as to}} lease the hydroelectric facility from Greenwood County, for a period of 40 years, at an annual rental of $250,000 per year. Some local residents favored the sale. Others opposed the sale. Articles published in the local Greenwood newspaper, the Index Journal, present a wealth of information about different views of the proposed sale. The S.C. General Assembly ultimately decided to put the matter to a referendum before the voters in Greenwood County. Greenwood state Senator Frances B. Nicholson opposed the sale, and Greenwood state Representative John W. Drummond supported the sale. Drummond simultaneously challenged Nicholson in his bid for re-election to the senate seat. The referendum was passed by the voters, and Drummond defeated Nicholson {{in the race for the}} Greenwood senate seat. However, Senator Nicholson, fearing that local officials might spend the purchase money unwisely, had caused a provision to be inserted into the South Carolina Constitution stating that the proceeds from the sale could never be spent, but instead, had to be invested so that Greenwood County could only receive the interest. Section 13 of Article XVII of the S.C. Constitution is unique to the state constitution, and it can only be amended by a statewide vote, among other requirements. In addition, Senator Nicholson added the requirement that Duke Power pay all costs of repairs during the lease as well as pay all costs of re-licensing with FERC in 1985. An additional provision, ironically suggested by an employee of Duke Power, was that all customers of Greenwood County at the time of the sale would continue to keep their existing county power rates forever, unless one of a couple of triggers occurred, at which point the customers would be switched to the Duke power rates. It has been estimated that about 9,000 properties fell under those provisions at the time of the sale. For a period of time, Duke power rates fell below the county <b>power</b> <b>rate,</b> and many owners elected to give up their grandfathered status. However, after the inflationary increases in the cost of electricity in the early 1970s, all customers who were still receiving the old county rate at that time effectively had their rates locked in forever (still subject to a few possible triggers). Duke Power attempted to avoid having to honor that provision of its agreement, but the S.C. Supreme Court rejected all of Duke's arguments. In the early 2000s, it was estimated that approximately 3,000 properties in Greenwood County still had the old county rate for electricity and that the net cost to Duke was approximately $1,000,000 a year in lost profits for those customers.|$|E

This paper, therefore, makes efforts to investigate the effect of multicollinearity on the power rates of the OLS estimator. A regression model with constant term (&# 946; 0) and two independent variables (with (&# 946; 1 and (&# 946; 2 as their respective regression coefficients) that exhibit multicollinearity was considered. A Monte Carlo study of 1000 trials was conducted at eight levels of multicollinearity (0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 7, 0. 75, 0. 8, 0. 9 and 0. 99) and sample sizes (10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 150, 250 and 500).

Results show that at each hypothesized value of &# 946; 0 the <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> is the same at all the levels of multicollinearity at a specified sample size and that the error rate decreases asymptotically.

40|$|Abstract — Given a {{wireless}} ad hoc network and an end-to-end traffic pattern, the <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> function {{refers to the}} minimum total power required to support different throughput under a simplified layered model of wireless networks. A critical notion of the layered model is the sup-ported (realizable) capacity graphs, which describe possible bit-rate provisions on the links by the physical and link layers. Under the layered model, the problem of finding the <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> function can be transformed into finding the minimum-power supported capacity graph that can provide a given throughput. We introduce a usage conflict graph to represent the conflicts among different uses of the wireless medium. Testing the realizability of a given capacity graph can be transformed into finding the (vertex) chromatic number, i. e., the minimum number of colors required in a proper vertex-coloring, of the associated usage conflict graph. Based on an upper bound of the chromatic number, we propose a linear program that outputs an upper bound of the <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> function. A lower bound of the chromatic number is the clique number. We propose a systematic way of identifying cliques based on a geometric analysis of the space sharing among active links. This leads to another linear program, which yields a lower bound of the <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> function. We further apply greedy vertex-coloring to fine tune the bounds. Simulations results demonstrate that the obtained bounds are tight in the low power and low rate regime. I...|$|E
