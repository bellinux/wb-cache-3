25|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{much has been}} {{discovered}} about amusia. However, there remains {{a great deal more}} to learn. While a method of treatment for people with amusia has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying. However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if this would be a viable treatment option for people with amusia. Additional research can also serve to indicate which <b>processing</b> <b>component</b> in the brain is essential for normal music development. Also, it would be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to amusia since this could provide valuable insights into other forms of learning disabilities such as dysphasia and dyslexia.|$|E

50|$|TeLQAS {{includes}} three main subsystems: an online subsystem, an offline subsystem, and an ontology. The online subsystem answers questions submitted by users in real time. During the online process, TeLQAS processes the question using a natural language <b>processing</b> <b>component</b> that implements part-of-speech tagging and simple syntactic parsing. The online subsystem also utilizes an inference engine {{in order to}} carry out necessary inference on small elements of knowledge. The offline subsystem automatically indexes documents collected by a focused web crawler from the web. An ontology server along with its API is used for knowledge representation. The main concepts and classes of the ontology are created by domain experts. Some of these classes, however, can be instantiated automatically by the offline components.|$|E

40|$|Many {{emerging}} on-line {{data analysis}} applications require applying continuous query operations such as correlation, aggregation, and filtering to data streams in real-time. Distributed stream processing systems allow in-network stream processing to achieve better scalability and quality-of-service (QoS) provision. In this paper we present Synergy, a distributed stream processing middleware that provides sharing-aware component composition. Synergy enables efficient reuse of both data streams and <b>processing</b> <b>components,</b> while composing distributed stream processing applications with QoS demands. Synergy provides {{a set of}} fully distributed algorithms to discover and evaluate the reusability of available data streams and <b>processing</b> <b>components</b> when instantiating new stream applications. For QoS provision, Synergy performs QoS impact projection to examine whether the shared processing can cause QoS violations on currently running applications. We have implemented a prototype of the Synergy middleware and evaluated its performance on both PlanetLab and simulation testbeds. The experimental results show that Synergy can achieve much better resource utilization and QoS provision than previously proposed schemes, by judiciously sharing streams and <b>processing</b> <b>components</b> during application composition...|$|R

50|$|In {{computer}} {{music and}} professional audio creation, a DirectX plugin is a software <b>processing</b> <b>component</b> {{that can be}} loaded as a plugin into host applications to allow real-time processing, audio effects, mixing audio or act as virtual synthesizers. DirectX plugins allow the replacement of traditional recording studio hardware and rack units used in professional studios with software-based counterparts that can be connected together in a modular way. This allows host manufacturers {{to focus on the}} conviviality and efficiency of their products while specialized manufacturers can focus on the digital signal processing aspect. For example, there are plugins for effects boxes, such as reverbs and delays, effects pedals, like guitar distortion, flange and chorus, and for mixing and mastering processors such as compressors, limiters, exciters, sub bass enhancers, stereo imagers and many more.|$|E

50|$|The current {{invocation}} of the Selsius legacy is Cisco Unified Communications Manager and the IP phones which still use (among other protocols) the original protocol created by Selsius engineers to facilitate voice over IP, the Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP). Analog gateways, which used the Skinny Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP), {{have since been}} end-of-lifed by Cisco. Cisco Unified Communications Manager is the call <b>processing</b> <b>component</b> of the Cisco Unified Communications System. As of 2005, Cisco Unified Communications Manager and related communications products are responsible for approximately $1 billion revenue for Cisco. Pull-through revenue, i.e. revenue generated on other equipment such as switches and routers {{as a consequence of}} selling Cisco Unified Communications Manager to Cisco (from enterprise switches, routers and other network infrastructure components) has been estimated by some to be as high as three times the Cisco Unified Communications Manager-related revenue. In its first year of operation, Selsius sold about 3,000 IP phones. In 2006, Cisco sold 3,000 of its IP phones - an extension of the Selsius legacy - every eight hours.|$|E

40|$|Remarkably, microRNA <b>processing</b> <b>components,</b> such as dicer, P 2 P-R, Ago 1 / 2, DGCR- 8, are {{regulated}} by p 53, p 73, and p 63. By regulating the miRNA <b>processing</b> <b>components,</b> they could function as regulators of miRNA/siRNA biogenesis. Therefore, these {{studies suggest that}} the guardians of the genome p 53, p 73 and p 63 are in control of the biogenesis of miRNAs as well. Taken together, &#x 201 c;the guardians of the genome integrity,&#x 201 d; p 53, TA-p 73 and TA-p 63 are not only in control of its protein coding targets, but also non-coding tumor suppressor microRNAs and thereby they enlarge their tumor suppressor network to inhibit tumorigenesis. |$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{multimedia}} metacomputing involves {{the formation of}} a large scale loosely coupled multiprocessing environment capable of performing complex transformations on media objects. The transformations are provided in the form of operations integrated in special media <b>processing</b> <b>components.</b> The components are described by signatures that denote the runtime environments required for component deployment, the types of media objects the component operations accept and emit and a formal description of transformations they perform. The multiprocessing environment also connects a set of heterogeneous processing resources in which the components are dynamically deployed in order to carry out the transformations. The existing Internet infrastructure is used to connect storages of media <b>processing</b> <b>components,</b> available <b>processing</b> resources and the system controlling the transformation process. By such an environment, we try to realize the concept of delivering global media data without the need to generate specially adapted materialization of the media data in advance. An open "plugable" environment provides the possibilities for both vendors of media <b>processing</b> <b>components</b> as well as providers of processing resources to exploit the potential of the business model involved in offering and providing multimedia services using the existing Internet infrastructure. ...|$|R
50|$|With {{the closure}} of the Nanango and Kingaroy butter {{factories}} in 1977, all cream supplies were diverted to Murgon factory, the last remaining dairy factory in the South Burnett. 1978 saw the opening of new milk processing facilities, followed by the manufacture of skim milk from 1979, and later, the production of flavoured milk drinks. In 1983, 2.7 million litres of milk was processed through the Murgon plant, and 813 tonnes of cheese and 250 tonnes of butter were manufactured on-site. During 1989-90 the milk <b>processing</b> <b>component</b> of the operation was sold to Queensland United Foods (QUF), resulting in local milk supplies being sent to Nambour. The SBCDA (later changed to Burnett Valley Ltd) were able to procure milk from QUF, which allowed for Murgon cheese to be continued to be manufactured, albeit in a much reduced capacity. By 1995 butter production had ceased, and a decline in demand for the cheddar cheese forced {{the closure of}} the Murgon factory, marking the end of dairy processing at the site.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of iconic memory begins at birth and continues as {{development of}} the primary and secondary visual system occurs. By 6 months of age, infants' iconic memory capacity approaches adults'. By 5 years of age, children have developed the same unlimited capacity of iconic memory that adults possess. The duration of informational persistence however increases from approximately 200 ms at age 5, to an asymptotic level of 1000 ms as an adult (>11 years). A small decrease in visual persistence occurs with age. A decrease of approximately 20 ms has been observed when comparing individuals in their early 20s to those in their late 60s. Throughout one's lifetime, mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) may develop such as errors in episodic memory (autobiographical memory about people, places, and their contex), and working memory (the active <b>processing</b> <b>component</b> of STM) due to damage in hippocampal and association cortical areas. Episodic memories are autobiographical events that a person can discuss. Individuals with MCIs have be found to show decreased iconic memory capacity and duration. Iconic memory impairment in those with MCIs {{may be used as}} a predictor for the development of more severe deficits such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia later in life.|$|E
5000|$|In {{many cases}} the 2PC {{protocol}} is distributed in a computer network. It is easily distributed by implementing multiple dedicated 2PC components similar to each other, typically named Transaction managers (TMs; {{also referred to as}} 2PC agents or Transaction Processing Monitors), that carry out the protocol's execution for each transaction (e.g., The Open Group's X/Open XA). The databases involved with a distributed transaction, the participants, both the coordinator and cohorts, register to close TMs (typically residing on respective same network nodes as the participants) for terminating that transaction using 2PC. Each distributed transaction has an ad hoc set of TMs, the TMs to which the transaction participants register. A leader, the coordinator TM, exists for each transaction to coordinate 2PC for it, typically the TM of the coordinator database. However, the coordinator role can be transferred to another TM for performance or reliability reasons. Rather than exchanging 2PC messages among themselves, the participants exchange the messages with their respective TMs. The relevant TMs communicate among themselves to execute the 2PC protocol schema above, [...] "representing" [...] the respective participants, for terminating that transaction. With this architecture the protocol is fully distributed (does not need any central <b>processing</b> <b>component</b> or data structure), and scales up with number of network nodes (network size) effectively.|$|E
30|$|Functions The {{message queue}} has two functions—(1) notify the {{subscription}} service when new data has been {{received from the}} factory, and (2) persist the received data in a queue {{so it may be}} read by data <b>processing</b> <b>components</b> in the data pipeline.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simulator}} is {{a discrete}} event simulator (based on the POSE system) which is trace driven and uses POSE's Charm++ base.

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that, within these stages, there are more {{specific}} processes that take place to complete the different <b>processing</b> <b>components.</b> In addition, other existing models propose integrative hierarchies (top-down and bottom-up), as well as parallel processing, as opposed to this general bottom-up hierarchy.|$|R
