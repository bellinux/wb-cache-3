Although it {{is the most}} {{effective}} in comparison to other metrics, the <b>Power</b> <b>Usage</b> <b>Effectiveness</b> comes with its share of flaws. This is the most frequently used metric for operators, facility technicians, and building architects to determine how energy efficient their data center buildings are.

Naturally, it is not a surprise that in some cases an operator may “accidentally” not count the energy used for lighting, resulting in lower <b>Power</b> <b>Usage</b> <b>Effectiveness.</b> This problem is more linked to a human mistake, rather than an issue with the <b>Power</b> <b>Usage</b> <b>Effectiveness</b> metric system itself.|$|E

As the lighting technologies advance, many types of new lighting devices {{have been developed for}} roadway lightings. The most promising new lighting technologies for roadway lighting include light emitting diode, induction, plasma, and metal halide lighting systems. A study was conducted to compare the new systems with the conventional high pressure sodium systems that are currently used on the Indiana roadway systems. In this study, the engineering issues, were analyzed such as illuminance, color rendering, <b>power</b> <b>usage,</b> cost <b>effectiveness,</b> and approval procedures for new roadway lighting systems. This paper, however, presents only the study findings related to cost effectiveness of the evaluated roadway lighting systems. Illustrated in this paper are the main features of the roadway lighting systems under evaluations, installations of the new lighting systems, measurements of power consumptions, and life cycle cost analyses of the lighting systems. Through this study, experience and knowledge have been obtained on the installations, power measurements, and cost effectiveness of the new types of the roadway lighting devices. The actual power values of various luminaires were obtained by measuring the electric current with a multi-meter. It was found that the differences between the rated and measured power values could be significant. The results of the life cycle cost analysis indicate that the lower life cycle costs of some of the alternative lighting devices are attributed to their relatively lower electricity usages and longer lamp/emitter replacement cycles...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{researchers}} have proposed numerous advanced load scheduling algorithms for smart homes {{with the goal}} of reducing the grid’s peak <b>power</b> <b>usage.</b> In parallel, utilities have introduced variable rate pricing plans to incentivize residential consumers to shift more of their <b>power</b> <b>usage</b> to low-price, off-peak periods, also {{with the goal of}} reducing the grid’s peak <b>power</b> <b>usage.</b> In this pa-per, we argue that variable rate pricing plans do not incentivize consumers to adopt advanced load scheduling algorithms. While beneficial to the grid, these algorithms do not significantly lower a consumer’s electric bill. To address the problem, we propose flat-power pricing, which directly incentivizes consumers to flat-ten their own demand profile, rather than shift as much of their <b>power</b> <b>usage</b> as possible to low-cost, off-peak periods. Since most loads have only limited scheduling freedom, load scheduling algo-rithms often cannot shift much, if any, <b>power</b> <b>usage</b> to low-cost, off-peak periods, which are often many hours in the future. In con-trast, flat-power pricing encourages consumers to shift <b>power</b> <b>usage</b> even over short time intervals to flatten demand. We evaluate the benefits of advanced load scheduling algorithms using flat-power pricing, showing that consumers save up to 40 % on their electric bill, compared with 11 % using an existing time-of-use rate plan...|$|R

Demand response {{is a part of}} the Smart Grid, which is a technology being developed to use our electric power grids more efficiently. Demand response programs aim to move people’s <b>power</b> <b>usage</b> over different times of the day, for example to distribute the <b>power</b> <b>usage</b> more evenly throughout the day or to permit a larger share of renewable, intermittent power sources in the system without making the delivery of electric power less stable.   A distribution system operator (DSO) can encourage customers to shift their <b>power</b> <b>usage</b> between different hours by various tariffs, for example by using time-differentiated or power dependent tariffs.   In this thesis, the change in power losses and possible environmental impact of introducing due to a power shift is studied. Power input curves from a DSO, Sala-Heby Energi AB, are studied and modified to simulate a power shift with an evened out electric <b>power</b> <b>usage.</b> The studies made show that in the best-case scenario, that is a electric <b>power</b> <b>usage</b> evened out to 100 % each day, the power losses in the whole grid can be reduced with 2. 6 %. The environmental study shows that the result varies greatly with what method is chosen to do the calculations.
