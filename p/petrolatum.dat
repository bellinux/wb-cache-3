25|$|Petroleum jelly, <b>petrolatum</b> or soft {{paraffin}} is a semi-solid {{mixture of}} hydrocarbons originally promoted as a topical ointment for its healing properties. The raw material for petroleum jelly was discovered in 1859 by Robert Chesebrough, a chemist from New York. In 1870, this product was branded as Vaseline Petroleum Jelly.|$|E
25|$|The {{ammonium}} nitrate, needed {{either as}} fertilizer or an explosive, was manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa {{and shipped to}} Texas City by rail before being loaded on the Grandcamp. It was manufactured in a patented process, mixed with clay, <b>petrolatum,</b> rosin and paraffin wax to avoid moisture caking. It was also packaged in paper sacks, then transported and stored at temperatures that increased its chemical activity. Longshoremen reported the bags were warm to the touch before loading.|$|E
50|$|Occlusive {{dressings}} come {{in various}} forms, including <b>petrolatum</b> gauze, which {{sticks to the}} skin surrounding the wound using <b>petrolatum.</b>|$|E
5000|$|However, key {{industries}} that utilize <b>petrolatum,</b> {{such as the}} personal care, cosmetic, and candle industries, have pushed for more materials that are considered [...] "green" [...] and based on renewable resources. As an alternative, hybrid <b>petrolatum</b> can be used. Hybrid <b>petrolatum</b> utilizes a complex mixture of vegetable oils and waxes and combines them with petroleum, micro wax based technologies. This allows a formulator to incorporate higher percentages of renewable resources while maintaining the beneficial properties of the <b>petrolatum.</b>|$|E
50|$|Petroleum jelly, <b>petrolatum,</b> white <b>petrolatum,</b> soft paraffin/paraffin wax or multi-hydrocarbon, CAS number 8009-03-8, is a {{semi-solid}} {{mixture of}} hydrocarbons (with carbon numbers mainly higher than 25), originally promoted as a topical ointment for its healing properties.|$|E
5000|$|One 2006 {{clinical}} trial found {{no statistically significant}} change in hypertrophic scar appearance from products of this type compared to the standard <b>petrolatum</b> emollient, while a 1999 pilot trial found an onion extract gel less effective than the <b>petrolatum.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike Vaseline (100% <b>petrolatum),</b> {{which is}} occlusive, Aquaphor (41% <b>petrolatum)</b> forms a semi-occlusive barrier on the skin. This enables the {{transmission}} of water and oxygen, which is important for wound healing {{and the formation of}} a protective moist healing environment.|$|E
50|$|The barrier repair {{properties}} of lanolin {{have been reported}} to be superior to those produced by both <b>petrolatum</b> and glycerin. In a small clinical study conducted on volunteer subjects with terribly dry (xerotic) hands, lanolin was shown to be superior to <b>petrolatum</b> in reducing the signs and symptoms of dryness and scaling, cracks and abrasions, and pain and itch. In another study, a high purity grade of lanolin was found to be significantly superior to <b>petrolatum</b> in assisting the healing of superficial wounds.|$|E
5000|$|Placement of topical {{tetracycline}} in a <b>petrolatum</b> base into {{a surgical}} site.|$|E
50|$|Microcrystalline wax {{is also a}} key {{component}} {{in the manufacture of}} <b>petrolatum.</b> The branched structure of the carbon chain backbone allows oil molecules to be incorporated into the crystal lattice structure. The desired properties of the <b>petrolatum</b> can be modified by using microcrystalline wax bases of different congeal points (ASTM test D938) and needle penetration (ASTM D1321).|$|E
50|$|It {{reacts with}} <b>petrolatum,</b> nitromethane, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, and over 25Â° with carbon tetrachloride.|$|E

5000|$|Central {{centrifugal}} cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), {{also referred}} to as hot comb alopecia and follicular degeneration syndrome, is a type of alopecia first noticed in African Americans in the 1950s and reported by LoPresti et al. in 1968 as a result of application of <b>petrolatum</b> followed by a stove-heated iron comb. The original theory was that the hot <b>petrolatum</b> would travel down to the hair root, burn the follicle, and after repetitive injury scarring would result. Later CCCA was realized to affect men and women without a history significant for use of such styling techniques. Consequently, the terms [...] "follicular degeneration syndrome" [...] per Sperling and Sau in 1992 and then CCCA per Olsent et al. in 2003 were evolved. Plausible contributing factors may include other African-American styling techniques such as relaxers, tight braids, heavy extensions, certain oils, gels or pomades.|$|E
50|$|Clocortolone {{pivalate}} 0.1% is {{formulated in}} a cream that contains three ingredients which assist in stratum corneum permeability barrier integrity: white <b>petrolatum</b> (occlusive), mineral oil (humectant), and stearyl alcohol (long-chain fatty alcohol emollient).
