Silicone spiking studies followed by exposure to agitation stress or accelerated temperature conditions were used to check for incompatibilities of the mAb with silicone oil, a necessary product contact material in PFS. In addition, screening studies to compare various closure materials as well as syringe barrel processing methods were used to select the optimum closure materials as well as the correct syringe processing method. Results indicate that the model mAb formulation used was sensitive to high levels of silicone oil especially under accelerated temperature conditions resulting in formation of protein–silicone particles in the solution for samples that were spiked with the silicone oil. Agitation stress did not have any significant impact on the quality attributes tested. Samples stored in syringe barrels that were processed with sprayed-on silicone had higher levels of subvisible particles as compared to those that were processed with the baked-on process. The tip cap comparability study resulted in one tip cap material having superior compatibility among the three that were tested.

However, it is much important to prevent any operations of health care practitioners which may cause such accidents. In this study, we evaluated the risk involved with the injection of drugs in order to prevent medical accidents by the misuse of medical devices. First, a risk evaluation was performed. Next, the administration of drugs by 5 nurses and pharmacists was recorded by VTR in order to analyze the administration and length of time required. In addition, the ampule method was compared with the <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringe</b> (PFS) method. Regarding the risk evaluation, the patient risk and worker risk related to the PFS method was respectively about 1 / 4 lower and about 1 / 3 lower than with the ampule method.

This ready-to-use mixture will provide a more tolerable and accessible route of administration appropriate for widespread use. MethodsPhysical compatibility (pH, colour, and formation of precipitate) and chemical stability (maintaining > 90 % of initial concentrations) of mixtures of MgSO 4, using both commercially available MgSO 4 (50 %) and MgSO 4 reconstituted from salt (61 %), with lidocaine hydrochloride (2 %) were evaluated every 14 days over six months. The concentration of lidocaine was determined by a stability indicating high performance liquid chromatographic method, while the concentration of magnesium was determined by an automated chemistry analyzer. ResultsNo changes in pH, color or precipitates were observed for up to 6 months. The 95 % confidence interval of the slope of the curve relating concentration to time, determined by linear regression, indicated that only the admixtures of commercially-available magnesium sulfate and lidocaine as well as the 61 % magnesium sulfate solution (reconstituted from salt) maintained at least 90 % of the initial concentration of both drugs at 25 °C and 40 °C at 6 months. ConclusionsCommercially available MgSO 4 and lidocaine hydrochloride, when combined, are stable in a <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringe</b> for at least six months in high heat and humidity conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ukraine has {{the most}} severe HIV {{epidemic}} in Europe. There is an urgent need to improve {{the effectiveness of the}} preventive measures to stop further spread of the epidemic. PDI was implemented as an alternative to traditional outreach work in educating IDUs and reducing their injection and sexual risky practices. METHODS: The first wave of the intervention was implemented in 8 cities of Ukraine in November 2008 - June 2009, the second – in 2 cities of Ukraine in December 2009 - June 2010. The follow-up of both waves was conducted in August 2010 - January 2011. Two interviews (during the first/second wave and follow-up) with questions regarding sociodemographic information, drug use, risk-related behavior, knowledge about safer drug injection, overdose, sexual behavior, questions related to health and HIV-testing, and financial questions were performed with participants. After the interview, participants were educated about safer drug use practices and HIV. SPSS analysis was conducted to see whether participants’ risky injection and sexual practices changed to safer. Cross-tabulation and McNemar statistics test were used as a primary way of data analysis. RESULTS: Total number of 3054 participants were covered by first/second wave and follow-up (72. 9 % men). Both injection and sexual risky practices showed significant change between first (first/second wave) and second (follow-up) interviews: participants reported less using other’s previously used syringe (decrease from 15, 2 % to 11, 0 %), always filling syringe from the shared container (30, 6 % to 28, 4 %), always buying drug in <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringe</b> (10, 3 to 9, 2 %), never using condoms during sexual intercourse in previous 30 days (31, 9 % to 27, 7 %). CONCLUSION: The first analysis shows that those who participated in PDI were likely to report safer behavior after the follow-up period than during the first interview. Further analysis will be focused on the stratification participants by different factors to define which groups were affected more...|$|E

40|$|Pre-filled {{syringes}} {{are commonly}} used storage and delivery devices for protein therapeutics because of their convenience and ease of use. However, in a <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringe,</b> a protein molecule encounters several interfaces which may negatively impact its stability. In addition, protein formulations in pre-filled syringes may also be subject to agitation stresses during transportation. Exposure to interfaces and to agitation {{has been shown to}} promote aggregation and particle formation in protein formulations, and these stresses are hypothesized to work synergistically to cause more aggregation and particle generation than either stress alone. In this work, we investigated the synergistic effects of interfaces and agitation on protein formulations in pre-filled syringes, primarily using a monoclonal antibody. First, we characterized the adsorption of this antibody to the silicone oil-water interface and showed that the tertiary structure of the antibody was perturbed after adsorption. This perturbation promoted aggregation of the antibody when it was exposed to both silicone oil microdroplets and agitation. However, when the ionic strength of the formulation was increased, the antibody was not perturbed after adsorption, and less aggregation was observed after exposure to silicone oil microdroplets and agitation. When the antibody formulation was incubated in pre-filled syringes, the highest particle concentrations were observed in formulations that were agitated in siliconized syringes with an air bubble. From these results, we proposed an interfacial mechanism, wherein capillary forces at the three-phase contact line in the syringe pulled gelled protein aggregates and silicone oil droplets from the silicone oil-water interface into the bulk, to describe how air-water interfaces, silicone oil-water interfaces, and agitation worked synergistically to generate particles in pre-filled syringes. Furthermore, we proposed two ways to reduce particle generation in pre-filled syringes. First, silicone oil coatings which are strongly adhered to the glass syringe wall were less able to be removed from the wall and, therefore, resulted in less particles. Second, we observed that concentrations of polysorbate 20 above and below the CMC were able to inhibit gelation of the protein layer adsorbed at the silicone oil-water interface which minimized particle generation in agitated, siliconized syringes with an air bubble...|$|E
40|$|Capacity {{strategy}} has established methods {{of dealing with}} uncertainty in future demand. This project advances the concept of capacity strategy under conditions of uncertainty in cases where capacity is {{the primary source of}} uncertainty. Novartis Vaccines, one of five divisions of Novartis AG, produces nearly two dozen vaccines which are offered in syringes, vials, multi or single pack, and multi or single dose and delivered in language-specific packaging to countries all over the world. Bexsero is a new product in 2013. As demand for Bexsero and other products increases over the next ten years, the production lines used to package them will need to accommodate more and more volume. Capacity planning compares capacity gaps between future demand and current estimated capacity. Because of recurring shortfalls in production relative to planned capacity, current estimates of capacity are not trusted for long-term planning. Understanding how international product demand will be allocated to each production line and what drives current capacity limitations will help Novartis Vaccines prioritize investment to optimally develop this capacity over time. Thus, the purpose of this model is to establish baseline capacity estimates using historical data and allow for the simulation of new production scenarios in order to demonstrate the impact of production policy on mean and variance of capacity over a specified time horizon. Incorporating simulated results produces a mean and standard deviation of capacity we are likely to see. Long-term demand was assessed, capacity versus peak demand views were created, and production scenarios were simulated on a single line/product/format basis over the time horizon to determine expected capacity. Recommendations were made for each of the <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringe,</b> multi-format, and vial format lines and these results were used to shape an overall packaging capacity development plan. by Augusta Niles.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} increase in the number of injectable pharmaceutical products over the last decade that have been incorporated into unique delivery systems such as pen injectors, auto-injectors, or pre-filled syringes. The advancement of these delivery systems and the paradigm shift towards administration of injectables in the out-of-hospital or home setting have introduced variables that can affect the bioavailability of injectable drugs and potential pharmacologic outcomes. An approach that allows for the qualitative and quantitative dispersion assessment of an injectable at the moment of tissue deposition coupled with an assessment of systemic exposure parameters could provide substantial information to researchers developing new injectable formulations and associated delivery systems. 	The overall goal of this research project was to develop an approach for investigating various injection dynamics, more specifically, dispersion dynamics associated with the administration of parenteral pharmaceutical products utilizing delivery technologies designed to deliver drug below the dermis. This was accomplished by first evaluating the safety and usability of computed tomography (CT) scanning as a novel radioimaging approach to assess qualitative and quantitative dispersion parameters in a cadaver study followed by a randomized, controlled, clinical study to assess CT tissue dispersion and the systemic exposure of iohexol, administered subcutaneously by two delivery systems in human volunteers. 	The primary finding of this work was the demonstration that CT scanning may be combined with a systemic exposure assessment to provide an effective paradigm for investigating dynamics of injectable delivery impacted by a variety of factors, including the choice of delivery system. In this study, iohexol delivered subcutaneously by an auto-injector resulted in notable qualitative and quantitative dispersion differences, including a higher rate of iohexol loss from the extravascular tissue, as well as differences in early plasma exposure as compared to a <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringe</b> delivery system. The injections and CT scanning were well tolerated with adverse events limited to mild injection site reactions resolving without intervention.

The emotional burden on the staff experiencing this occupational injury is well reported, however there is insufficient data to support storing <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringes,</b> out of the manufacturer’s pack for longer than for immediate administration. Aim: The aim {{was to investigate the}} stability and sterility of zuclopenthixol acetate and haloperidol in <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringes</b> to allow their use as an alternative to drawing the dose from an ampoule or vial prior to administration. Method: Two of the commonly used products in rapid tranquilisation were aseptically drawn in suitable syringes and tested for stability and sterility to establish shelf-life. Ten invited medical and nursing staff involved in rapid tranquilisation were invited to a focus group for feedback on the product practicality of use, cost and logistics of stock management.

Methods 400 participants (200 physicians, 200 patients) were included from 6 countries. Physicians (99 primary care physicians [PCPs]; 101 specialists) had mean practice experience of 17. 8 years and an average of 797 hypercholesterolemic patients. Participating patients had LDL-C levels above their goal {{and at least one}} of the following: familial hypercholesterolemia, statin intolerance, high cardiovascular risk, and/or diabetes. Mean patient age was 58. 5 years, 51 % were female, and 25. 5 % had injectable medication experience. Following device instruction and demonstration, participants tested either a pre-filled pen or <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringe,</b> using both 75 and 150 mg doses of single-blinded placebo into a prosthetic pad. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaire. FindingsParticipant acceptance of both devices was positive, with 83 - 100 % agreeing with ease-of-use statements. After testing, physicians estimated that 66 % (pen) and 58 % (syringe) of their patients would be willing to self-inject using the device (relative increases from pre-testing of 22 % and 16 %, respectively; both P< 0. 05). Specialist estimates were higher than PCP estimates: for the pen, 60 % versus 47 % (pre-testing), respectively, and 72 % versus 61 % (post-testing); for the syringe, 57 % versus 43 % (pre-testing), 63 % versus 54 % (post-testing; all P< 0. 05, specialist vs PCP). After testing, 72 % (pen) and 63 % (syringe) of patient-participants were very willing to self-inject (relative increases from pre-testing of 26 % [P< 0. 05] and 11 %, respectively); 96 % (pen) and 93 % (syringe) were either very willing or somewhat willing to self-inject. The proportion of patients aged < 60 years who were very willing to self-inject with either device was numerically (but not statistically) higher compared with those ≥ 60 years. Initially, patients with injectable medication experience were generally more willing to use the pen than injection-naive patients; after testing there was no difference between groups. No significant differences were observed in responses to the 2 different doses. ImplicationsResponses from physicians and patients to pre-filled pen and syringe devices were positive. Devices were considered easy to operate, with most patients willing to use and accept self-injection. Patient willingness to self-inject increased after demonstration and testing. Results suggest that, in clinical practice, alirocumab administration by either pre-filled pen or syringe would not deter most physicians from prescribing or most patients from self-administering...|$|E
30|$|Anakinra (Kineret), a 100  mg per 0.67  ml <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringe</b> for {{subcutaneous}} administration, is {{the form}} of IL- 1 ra used in this study. IL- 1 ra microspheres were prepared by a double emulsion solvent extraction method as previously described (Butoescu et al. 2008). IL- 1 ra (5  mg; 33  μl) and 3  mg/ 100  μl of iron oxide dispersion were mixed together and bath sonicated for 30  s to get a uniform dispersion. This aqueous phase was emulsified with 1  ml of 100  mg/ml solution of PLGA: lactide: glycolide 85 : 15, MW 50, 000 – 75, 000 (Sigma Aldrich, USA) in ethyl acetate. The resultant emulsion was then dispersed in 2  ml of 2  % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution in distilled water by probe sonication for 15  s. This double emulsion was diluted with 10  ml of 0.3  % PVA solution in distilled water and stirred mechanically for 4  h to yield the particles. The resultant particles were magnetically separated and washed with distilled water and the lyophilized. Lyophilized particles were stored at 4  °C and were reconstituted as needed in PBS. Particle size distribution and surface charge were analyzed using 90 Plus particle size analyzer (Brookhaven Instrument Corporation, USA). Representative preparations were imaged using a scanning electron microscope. The incorporation efficiency of IL- 1 ra in PLGA microparticles was determined using lyophilized PLGA IL- 1 ra from 4 different preparations. A total of 1  mg of PLGA IL- 1 ra microparticles was reconstituted in 1  ml of 5  % SDS in 0.1  N NaOH and incubated for 15  h at room temperature, where by all powder dissolved. Total protein content was determined using the BCA colorimetric assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) and empty PLGA particles were processed {{in a similar manner}} and used as a blank. IL- 1 ra incorporation was expressed as a ratio of the total measured protein in microparticles to the total protein used in the formulation process. The data represents the average IL- 1 ra percent incorporation from the 4 preparations. The release of IL- 1 ra from the PLGA micrsopheres was evaluated using the equivalent of 5  mg of PLGA IL- 1 ra from 4 different preparations following reconstitution in 1  ml of PBS and incubation at room temperature with shaking. At 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72  h following reconstitution, particles were centrifuged at 10, 000  rpm and the supernatant was sampled. The IL- 1 ra concentration in the supernatant was quantified using a commercially available ELISA (R&D Systems, USA) and was expressed as the ratio of IL- 1 ra content in the supernatant to the total expected amount of incorporated IL- 1 ra. Data represents the average IL- 1 ra percent release from the 4 preparations.|$|E
40|$|Highly {{concentrated}} protein therapeutics offer {{a convenient}} way for subcutaneous (sc) drug administration {{by the patient}} him-/herself or a healthcare professional. As the therapy e. g. with monoclonal antibodies requires quite high doses {{in the range of}} mg per kg body weight, the development of highly concentrated protein formulations is needed due to the limited injection volume, generally considered being 1 - 2 mL for sc administration. The development of highly concentrated formulations exceeding 50 - 100 mg/mL poses several challenges including chemical and physical stability (e. g. aggregation) as well as solution viscosity. Thereby, the increase in viscosity observed with higher protein concentration may cause severe limitations during product development as well as processing and drug administration. These limitations are defined by the flow rate/injection rate depending on the applied pressure which is needed during manufacture (fill-finish), in particular during filtration, and drug administration. The focus of this work was to investigate the rheological behavior of protein solutions at high protein concentrations. The main objective was to obtain a profound understanding of two critical, hydrodynamic processes for highly concentrated protein solutions, which were drug administration and filtration, and to elucidate the role of viscosity with regard to potential limitations. The current work provides a detailed overview on product characteristics of ten commercially available, highly concentrated protein therapeutics (Chapter 1). This technical overview summarizes formulation properties like viscosity and number of visible and sub-visible particles, physico-chemical properties like pH and osmolality as well as injection device characteristics, such as device dimensions. The analysis of marketed products revealed significant differences between the products. The current benchmark for maximum protein concentration and of viscosity was identified as a liquid formulation at a protein concentration of 200 mg/mL with a dynamic viscosity of 102 mPas (20 ? C). This product, which is provided in a <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringe,</b> also exhibits the largest inner needle diameter of 25 G compared to other commercial products using 27 G needle for the injection device. In the following (Chapter 2), advantages and limitations of different methods for viscosity determination of protein formulations are discussed. Moreover, a high-throughput method to measure viscosity was established. This method uses a capillary electrophoresis instrumentation without operation of the electrical field. The established method has the advantage of being automated offering the possibility for high-throughput by use of low sample amounts in the microliter range at the same time. (Allmendinger et al., J Pharm Biomed Anal, 99 (2014) 51 - 58) Based on these studies, the present work investigated and characterized the subcutaneous drug administration process of highly concentrated protein formulations providing quantitative in vitro (Chapter 3) and in vivo data (G¨ottingen minipigs) of injection forces (Chapter 4). Chapter 3 describes in detail the establishment of an in silico model to predict injection forces depending on syringe and needle dimensions, solution viscosity, and injection rate. Importantly, this model accounts for shear thinning behavior (non-Newtonian flow behavior) of highly concentrated protein olutions, which leads to lower effective injection forces than expected from current literature models. (Allmendinger et al., Eu J Pharm Biopharm, 87 (2014) 318 - 328) To address the in vivo situation, Chapter 4 investigates and quantifies the contribution of the subcutaneous tissue backpressure and specifically reports the additional influence of body temperature on injection forces, which was found to compensate the tissue backpressure to some parts. Overall, an extended model, which addresses the injection force as a function of viscosity, volumetric flow/injection rate, needle/device dimensions, shear-thinning behavior, sc backpressure, and body temperature, was developed to predict injection forces representative for the in vivo situation. This knowledge is of key importance for the development of combination products (e. g. autoinjectors or pre-filled syringes) as a detailed understanding of injection forces depending on various parameters is required. It may be also supportive for the definition of limits during the evaluation, planning, and design phase during the development of injection devices. (Allmendinger et al., submitted to Pharm Research, 2014) Besides drug administration, filtration was investigated as another critical hydrodynamic process for highly concentrated protein formulations, depending on formulation composition and filter material (Chapter 5). For both processes, filtration and drug administration, shear thinning behavior was found for some of the products depending on viscosity and protein concentration, shear rate, and formulation composition. Within the present work it was shown, that the two investigated hydrodynamic processes, filtration and drug administration by injection, are two highly complex processes which are influenced by various factors. Thereby, the final limiting parameter for the injection process is given by the user capability of the patient population. However, the needle inner diameter was shown to have major influence on injection forces. It is related to injection forces by the power of four compared to other parameters like viscosity, injection rate, and contribution of sc backpressure being directly proportional. For the filtration process, the final limiting parameter may be discussed controversially. The study showed that the filtration pressure is mainly defined by the pore size distribution of the filter material, which was furthermore found to trigger the rheological behavior at high protein concentrations dependent on filtration rate. Moreover, literature data reported that the influence of filtration pressure on product quality might not be the limiting parameter during filtration. For the formulations previously tested, the shear stress exposure during manufacture was not considered important for final product quality, however only tested up to a protein concentration of 100 mg/mL. More important causes of aggregation were suggested to be the presence of air-bubbles, adsorption to solid surfaces, or contamination by particulates. Nevertheless, the stability of formulations showing pronounced shear-thinning behavior at high shear rates, which is most likely only the case for higher protein concentrations than previously tested, needs further experiments and has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis dependent on product and process characteristics. (Allmendinger et al., submitted to J Pharm Sci, 2014) With respect to viscosity, the current work has demonstrated for both processes, drug administration and filtration, that the potential limitation defined by the proportional increase in pressure based on Newtonian flow behavior was overestimated due to the presence of shear-thinning behavior which was shown for highly concentrated protein formulations...|$|E

40|$|Background Syringes of {{ephedrine}} {{are usually}} prepared {{ahead of time}} {{in order to reduce the}} time to injection. Commercial <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringes</b> of ephedrine have been introduced to minimize the amount of waste. Our primary objective was to determine the economic impact of commercial syringes. We hypothesized that costs could be reduced compared to standard syringes. Methods Using data extracted from our medical records system, we retrospectively measured the total dose of ephedrine received per patient in 2013 to estimate the number of administered standard syringes. The proportion of administered standard syringes was calculated as the total number of administered standard syringes divided by the number of delivered ampoules in 2013. Thereafter, we calculated the annual cost difference as the difference between the cost for commercial syringes and the cost for standard syringes. Endpoints were calculated overall and for each operating room. Results At least one dose of ephedrine was given in 19, 422 patients (44, 943 administrations). The overall proportion of administered standard syringes was estimated to 52. 8...|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction Human growth hormone (hGH) is produced and excreted by the anterior pituitary gland to help fuel growth during childhood and to maintain tissues and organs throughout life [1]. In recent decades, recombin-ant hGH has been used to treat short stature or growth failure in children, including the following: 1) growth hormone deficiency, 2) born small for gestational age, 3) Prader-Willi syndrome, 4) Turner syndrome, 5) chronic renal insufficiency, and 6) idiopathic short stature. Most children receive injections daily and treatment usually is carried out over several years, until the child achieves an acceptable adult height or maximum growth [2]. In order to achieve optimal therapeutic results, adher-ence to long-term, continuous hGH administration is essential [3]. Ease of use is recognized by parents, physi-cians and nurses as a key feature in device acceptance [3] with potential to improve adherence. Injection devices, such as <b>pre-filled</b> <b>syringes</b> and manual injector pens, have been developed to make the process of pre-paring and administering hGH easier and more conveni-ent.
