40|$|The {{influence}} {{of damage to}} metal cans may result {{in an increase in}} the food/packaging interactions, resulting in food contamination by the metal present in the package. To simulate these reactions, three conditions of mechanical damage were introduced to metal cans of <b>peaches</b> <b>in</b> <b>syrup</b> in a controlled manner, to determine the evolution of the degree of internal oxidation of these cans as compared to undamaged cans, and to evaluate the possibility of exploiting the contents for consumption by the needy. The cans were classified according to the degree of damage and evaluated by a storage test for a period of 365 days under controlled temperature conditions, 35 °C ± 2 °C, with periodic evaluations of the visual internal appearance of the cans, the chromium, tin and iron concentrations in the product and the internal vacuum level of the can. During the storage period there was a reduction in internal vacuum, but the evaluations of the product showed there was no significant change in dissolution of the metals from the cans into the product, which remained in acceptable conditions, as also the appearance of the inner surface of the can.

Neste contexto, o objetivo do trabalho foi a implementa????o e valida????o de um sistema eficiente e eficaz de rastreabilidade, na produ????o integrada de p??ssegos (PIP) para ind??stria, assegurando a qualidade e inocuidade das frutas. A implementa????o da PIP e da rastreabilidade, na produ????o, foi realizada atrav??s de visitas mensais, a partir do in??cio do ciclo vegetativo at?? a p??s-colheita. Foram determinadas as parcelas nos pomares, por meio de {{receptor}} de dados GPS (Global Positioning System) e a identifica????o foi feita atrav??s dos registros no caderno de campo. Na colheita, as caixas foram identificadas com etiquetas, contendo produtor, parcela, cultivar, data e hor??rio da colheita. No recebimento na ind??stria, formaram-se lotes, considerando-se a homogeneidade, cultivar e quantidade de frutas. Cada lote entrou, individualmente, na linha de processamento, estabelecendo-se um intervalo entre os mesmos. Ap??s defini????o dos lotes, coletaram-se as informa????es contidas nas etiquetas das caixas, repassando para o banco de dados, atrav??s de leitor ??ptico, especificando o n??mero de caixas de cada produtor. Em cada lote, monitorou-se a qualidade do p??ssego em calda, atrav??s de an??lises f??sico-qu??micas, de acordo com o caderno de p??s-colheita xi da ind??stria da PIP. A partir das informa????es obtidas, identificaram-se os produtos com o c??digo de barras EAN/UCC- 128, com as seguintes informa????es: p??ssego/empresa; categoria; peso; data de fabrica????o e validade; hor??rio; variedade; n??mero do lote e a escrita rastreabilidade. Individualmente, nas latas, foram impressos: a data de fabrica????o/validade e o n??mero do lote. Foram avaliadas as condi????es de produ????o, transporte, armazenamento, para verificar o grau de conformidade ??s Normas PIP, atrav??s das listas de verifica????o para auditoria de ades??o e de acompanhamento. Estudaram-se as causas de n??o-conformidade e as limita????es para a ado????o da PIP e da rastreabilidade. A produ????o de p??ssego em calda rastreado das categorias extra e especial aumentou, progressivamente, e na safra 2004 / 05 a mesma foi de 1. 600. 000 latas. Os registros armazenados no rastreamento possibilitaram a manuten????o do hist??rico de cada lote produzido, especificando a proveni??ncia de todos os componentes, utilizados na fabrica????o do p??ssego em calda. As informa????es coletadas, na cadeia produtiva, foram transcritas para o aplicativo computacional, que armazena as informa????es e permite o acesso, pelos compradores ou consumidores, digitando o n??mero do lote impresso na lata, atrav??s de p??gina dispon??vel na Internet. A ado????o da PIP permite a obten????o de frutas com qualidade e a gera????o de registros que possibilitam acompanhar todas as pr??ticas culturais adotadas, viabilizando o rastreamento, a identifica????o da origem e o hist??rico da fruta. The related incidents {{with the}} contamination of foods had determined {{the necessity of}} guarantees of alimentary security, through the traceability, making possible the identification of risks and the adoption of efficient measures for the control. In this context, {{the aim of this}} work was the implementation and validation of an efficient and effective traceability system in the integrated production of peaches (IPP) for industry, assuring the quality and safety of fruits. The implementation of PIP and the traceability, in the production, was carried through mount visits, {{from the beginning of the}} vegetative cycle to the after-harvest. The parcels in the orchards were determined through a GPS data receiver (Global Positioning System), and the identification was made through registers in the field notebook. In the harvest, the boxes were identified with labels which contained producer, parcel, cultivar, date and time of the harvest. In act of receiving in the industry, lots had been formed, taking into account homogeneity, cultivar and amount of fruits. Each lot entered individually in the line of processing, establishing an interval between themselves. After definition of the lots, the information contained in labels of the boxes were captured through optic reader, conducting the information to the data base by specifying the number of boxes of each producer. In each lot, it was monitored quality of the <b>peach</b> <b>in</b> <b>syrup,</b> through physicochemical analyses, in agreement with the after-harvest notebook industry of the IPP. From the given informations, the products with the bar code EAN/UCC- 128 were identified, with the following xiii information: peach/industry; category; weight; date of manufacturing and validity; time; variety; number of the lot; and the written traceability. Individually in the cans they printed the matters: validity/manufacturing date and lot/number. The storage, production and transportation conditions were measured in order to verify the conformity level to the IPP rules by the examination lists to adhesion and attendance auditing The causes of no-conformity and limitations to IPP adoption and traceability were studied. The production of monitored <b>peach</b> <b>in</b> <b>syrup,</b> of the extra and special categories increased gradually and in 2004 / 05 cycle it was of 1. 600. 000 cans. The registers stored in the monitoring make possible the maintenance of the description of each produced lot, specifying the provenance of all the components used in manufacturing of the <b>peach</b> <b>in</b> <b>syrup.</b> The collected informations in the productive chain were transcribed to the software that stores them and allows the access to the purchasers or consumers by typing the number of the lot printed in the can, through available page in Internet. The adoption of the IPP results in obtaining fruits with quality and generating records which make possible to control all of the adopted cultura...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to apply Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to study the effect of particle orientation on fluid flow, temperature evolution, as well as microbial destruction, during thermal processing of still cans filled with <b>peach</b> halves <b>in</b> sugar <b>syrup.</b> A still metal can with four <b>peach</b> halves <b>in</b> 20 % sugar syrup was heated at 100 °C for 20 min and thereafter cooled at 20 °C. Infinite heat transfer coefficient between heating medium and external can wall was considered. Peach halves were orderly placed inside the can with the empty space originally occupied by the kernel facing, <b>in</b> all <b>peaches,</b> either towards the top or {{the bottom of the}} can. In a third situation, the can was placed horizontally. Simulations revealed differences on particle temperature profiles, as well as process F values and critical point location, based on their orientation. At their critical points, peach halves with the kernel space facing towards the top of the can heated considerably slower and cooled faster than the peaches having their kernel space facing towards the bottom of the can. The horizontal can case exhibited intermediate cooling but the fastest heating rates and the highest F process values among the three cases examined. The results of this study could be used in designing of thermal processes with optimal product quality...|$|R
