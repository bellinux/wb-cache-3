40|$|Abstract. A wet-chemical {{deposition}} {{method was}} developed to synthesize CeO 2 -mica <b>pearlescent</b> <b>pigment</b> using CeO 2 as the coating material and mica as the base material. The main factors affecting the synthesis processes were studied. The optimum conditions were obtained were as: the coating reaction temperature is 70 ~ 80 °C, cover ratio is 30 ~ 40 %, stirring velocity is about 170 r/min, pH value is 6. 50 ~ 7. 50, heating rate is 3 ~ 5 °C/min and heat treatment temperature is 800 °C. The crystal phases and the microstructure of the <b>pearlescent</b> <b>pigment</b> powders were also analyzed by DTA-TG, XRD and SEM...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The TiO 2 /mica <b>pearlescent</b> <b>pigments</b> were {{prepared}} by the hydrolysis of TiOCl 2 on the natural mica (muscovite) followed by a calcinations process. The phase transformation of anatase to rutile during calcination and their proportion in the TiO 2 thin layer have been analyzed by XRD measurements. The pH controlling during the initial stage of hydrolysis of TiOCl 2 showed a pronounced effect on the phase transformation of TiO 2 on the substrate. This result {{may be due to}} the fact that the pH controlling during the hydrolysis affects the crystal structure and size of TiO 2. The decrease in crystallinity and crystallite size of TiO 2 resulted in lowering the temperature of phase transformation from anatase to rutile...|$|R
40|$|Mica based <b>pearlescent</b> <b>pigments</b> {{are widely}} applied in plastics, cosmetics, {{automobiles}} coatings among others, {{but they seem}} not explored by the ceramic industry. In this work, the potential of two commercial special effect pigments (with gold and silver lustre respectively) in the decoration of ceramic tiles was appraised by testing them dispersed into several ceramic coatings fired {{in a wide range}} of temperatures (700 - 1150 ?C). The pigments were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, XRF and PSD, while their technological behavior was assessed determining phase composition (XRD) and colorimetric parameters (DRS) of ceramic materials, including a pearlescence index. Results indicate that titania mica pigments are stable into glassy coatings up to 900 ?C, being any deterioration of their optical properties due to anatase-to-rutile and muscovite-to-feldspar transformations occurring at higher temperatures or after long firing times. The pigment type with a gold shine is particularly suitable for third fire decoration of ceramic tiles, involving low temperatures and fast firing schedules, where it can replace expensive precious metals lustres. Moreover, a certain satin effect was appreciable in porcelain stoneware tiles, unexpectedly persistant after firing at 1200 ?...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation {{of certain}} food {{additives}} and contaminants Evaluation of certain food additives and contam inants This report represents {{the conclusions of}} a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee convened to evaluate the safety of various food additives and a food contaminant {{with a view to}} concluding as to safety concerns and to preparing specifications for identity and purity. The first part of the report contains a general discussion of the principles governing the toxicological evaluation of and assessment of dietary exposure to food additives. A summary follows of the Committee’s evaluations of technical, toxicological and dietary exposure data for seven food additives (advantame; glucoamylase from Trichoderma reesei expressed in Trichoderma reesei; glycerol ester of gum rosin; glycerol ester of tall oil rosin; glycerol ester of wood rosin; nisin; and octenyl succinic acid modified gum arabic) and an assessment of dietary exposure to cadmium from cocoa and cocoa products. Specifications for the following food additives were revised: annatto extracts (solvent-extracted bixin and solvent-extracted norbixin); Benzoe tonkinensis; food additives containing aluminium and/or silicon; mineral oil (medium viscosity); modified starches; paprika extract; phosphates (analytical methods for the determination of phosphorus and revision of specifications); 3 -phytase from Aspergillus niger expressed in Aspergillus niger; potassium aluminium silicate; and potassium aluminium silicate–based <b>pearlescent</b> <b>pigments.</b> Annexed to the report are tables summarizing the Committee’s recommendations for dietary exposures to and toxicological evaluations of the food additives and contaminant considered...|$|R
5000|$|Metallic paints contain {{aluminium}} flakes {{to create}} a sparkling and grainy effect, generally {{referred to as a}} metallic look. This paint is harder to manage than solid paints because of the extra dimensions to consider. Metallic and pearlescent paints must be applied evenly to ensure a consistent looking finish without light and dark spots which are often called [...] "mottling". Metallic basecoats are formulated so that the aluminium flake is parallel to the substrate. This maximises the [...] "flop". This is the difference in the brightness between looking perpendicularly at the paint and that at an acute angle. The [...] "flop" [...] is maximised if the basecoat increases in viscosity shortly after application so that the aluminium flake which is in a random orientation after spraying is locked into this position while there is still much solvent (or water) in the coating. Subsequent evaporation of the solvent (or water), leads to a reduction in the film thickness of the drying coating, causing the aluminium flake to be dragged into an orientation parallel to the substrate. This orientation then needs to be unaffected by the application of the clear coat solvents. The formulation of the clear coat needs to be carefully chosen so that it will not [...] "re-dissolve" [...] the basecoat and thus affect the orientation of the metallic flake but will still exhibit enough adhesion between the coatings so as to avoid delamination of the clear coat. A similar mode of action occurs with <b>pearlescent</b> <b>pigmented</b> basecoats.|$|R
50|$|The {{pigments}} can {{be applied}} with all painting techniques established for conventional <b>pearlescent</b> and interference <b>pigments.</b> Effect pigments based on alumina flakes may be applied in all substantial systems, i.e. in coatings, plastics, printing inks and cosmetic formulations. An additional surface treatment {{is applied to the}} pigment particles to adjust them to solvent-based and water-based coating systems. The pigments can be used in combination with many conventional pigments as well as with other effect pigments. Nearly unlimited styling possibilities are the result of these combinations.|$|R
