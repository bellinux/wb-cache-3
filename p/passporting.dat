5000|$|On 4 October 2016, the Financial Times {{assessed}} the potential effect of Brexit on banking. The City of London is world leading in financial services, especially in foreign exchange currency transactions, including euros. This position is enabled by the EU-wide [...] "passporting" [...] agreement for financial products. Should the <b>passporting</b> agreement expire {{in the event}} of a Brexit, the British financial service industry might lose up to 35,000 of its 1 million jobs, and the Treasury might lose 5 billion pounds annually in tax revenue. Indirect effects could increase these numbers to 71,000 job losses and 10 billion pounds of tax annually. The latter would correspond to about 2% of annual British tax revenue.|$|E
40|$|Financial {{services}} {{constitute an}} important net export for the UK economy, {{for which the}} rest of the EU is the largest market. This paper considers the likely consequences of Brexit for this sector. A ‘soft’ Brexit, whereby the UK leaves the EU but remains in the single market, would be a lower-risk option for the City than other Brexit options, because it would enable financial services firms to continue to rely on regulatory <b>passporting</b> rights. Under a ‘hard’ Brexit scenario, where the UK leaves the single market, the UK might in principle be able to benefit from the EU’s third country ‘equivalence’ frameworks for financial services, but these are cumbrous and incomplete alternatives to <b>passporting.</b> UK firms would find it considerably more costly to export to the EU. This would also be a loss to the EU 27, because the UK specializes in capital markets services for which the EU, over-reliant on banking, recognizes a need. However, much of this ‘UK’ activity is provided by subsidiaries of US-headquartered groups. In the event of hard Brexit, these firms may be able to compete just as effectively from New York as from London. If soft Brexit proves politically impossible, it seems highly desirable that the UK push for a transition period of continued EU membership pending at the very least completion of equivalence determinations and, more usefully, the conclusion of a suitable bilateral agreement...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} here a {{new method}} for large-scale scanning of microbial genomes on a {{quantitative and qualitative}} basis. To achieve this aim we propose to create NotI passports: databases containing NotI tags. We demonstrated that these tags comprising 19 bp of sequence information could be successfully generated using DNA isolated from intestinal or fecal samples. Such NotI passports allow the discrimination between closely related bacterial species and even strains. This procedure for generating restriction site tagged sequences (RSTS) is called <b>passporting</b> and {{can be adapted to}} any other rare cutting restriction enzyme. A comparison of 1312 tags from available sequenced Escherichia coli genomes, generated with the NotI, PmeI and SbfI restriction enzymes, revealed only 219 tags that were not unique. None of these tags matched human or rodent sequences. Therefore the approach allows analysis of complex microbial mixtures such as in human gut and identification with high accuracy of a particular bacterial strain on a quantitative and qualitative basis...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{stability}} {{remains a}} key theme globally {{in view of}} the Euro zone debt crisis. The latest strategy by Germany and France is to ring-fence the crisis among the PIIGS countries (Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain). In the United Kingdom, the big four major banks have all responded to the Independent Commission of Bankings interim report key recommendation: ring-fencing retail operations into a separate subsidiary of any bank that wishes to operate in the United Kingdom. The report has clearly discussed {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} various types of subsidiarisation. Retail ring-fencing is considered a compromise as full subsidiarisation is too costly and operational subsidiarisation is too minimal. The Independent Commission of Banking published its final report on 12 September 2011. They recommended ring-fencing retail banking and a 10 per cent equity baseline. This article focuses on structural reforms of UK banks. It aims to address the question of financial stability from a wider European perspective. The first question is whether cross-border retail banking in the European Economic Area (EEA) is best served by branches or subsidiaries? The second question concerns the legality of setting up subsidiaries in the European Union (EU). Although there are no legal problems for UK-based banks setting up subsidiaries for their retail activities, there might be a legal hurdle for requiring foreign banks setting up subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. The third question concerns EU cross-border banking regulation and supervision. Are the <b>passporting</b> system and the home country supervisory approach still applicable in this post-financial crisis era? Many factors influence the choice of setting up branches or subsidiaries. However, the general position is that branches are more suited for wholesale/investment activities because of ease of funds transfer. Subsidiaries are more suitable for retail banking because of the limited liability principle and extensive local network. Effective cross-border banking must be accompanied by effective supervision and resolution regimes. The <b>passporting</b> concept under EU law and home country dominance are somewhat dated post-financial crisis. Host country control should play a dominant part in financial regulation, especially in the light of the importance of subsidiaries and the limited liability principle associated with them. The Icelandic bank crisis and collapse of Lehman Brothers International Europe illustrate the importance of host country control. Finally, the author argues that requiring banks to hold its retail activities in the form of subsidiaries in another European country is necessary to achieve financial stability. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The thesis Welfare {{of cattle}} {{is focused on}} {{well-being}} of the dairy cattle, specifically from the professional expert perspective, representing these days {{one of the very}} actual quality of cattle breeding factor. The objective of the thesis was to summarise the newest expert findings in the area of dairy cattle welfare and to find out Czech Republic breeders opinion on the dairy cattle welfare assessment and on the suitability of criteria for such assessment. Cattle breeding represents one of the main sectors of the animal production, which serves as the primary source of milk, cheese and meat products. The quality of these products is directly dependant on the well-being of the cattle, which {{is at the same time}} essentially important for its complex good health condition, both physical and mental. In my thesis, I have focused on the animal welfare as such, and I analyse it in detail from different perspectives. The thesis also addresses the important evaluation project Welfare Quality, whose methodology could become a foundation for standardization of cattle well-being assessment and its certification by means of <b>passporting</b> products quality and origin. Further, the thesis elaborates on the alternatives of such products welfare passportisation, which could also provide for authentication of products quality and welfare of animals in the studs. I have used questionnaires for the empirical research, by means of which the dairy cattle breeders were interviewed. The questionnaires were composed of questions pertaining to basic information on concrete breeder and the stud, health condition of the animals, opinion of the breeder on animal welfare and suitable criteria for dairy cattle welfare assessment, and also questions addressing management and production characteristics of the stud. The thesis confirms the necessity of improvement of the awareness and knowledgeability of the breeders about the animals welfare, but also the need of animals life conditions improvement, and consequently the benefits of the introduction of welfare standardization and evaluation by means of all interested parties participation, and possibly also introduction of some form of certification of the quality and origin of the product, with respect to welfare...|$|E

40|$|The EU/UK {{negotiations}} on Brexit are now imminent following the formal notification by Prime Minister May of the UK’s intention {{to leave the}} EU in the ‘Article 50 letter’ delivered to European Council President Tusk on 29 March 2017. The treatment of financial services will be a critical element of these negotiations. Prime Minister May had previously indicated in her 17 January 2017 speech on the UK’s negotiating objectives that the UK is to leave the single market and confirmed this position in the Article 50 letter. Under current EU financial law the UK will accordingly become a ‘third country’ on Brexit. UK financial firms and actors will lose the ability to ‘passport’ into the single market in financial services from the UK – unless <b>passporting</b> rights are preserved under any new EU/UK arrangement, an outcome which is highly unlikely. This paper considers the risks to the EU from its oft-described ‘investment banker’ becoming a third country and explores the regulatory remedies which may be available and the preferences which may shape these remedies. The paper adopts a legal-institutionalist perspective, which draws on the insights of comparative/international political economy, to examine {{the implications of the}} UK’s future status as a ‘third country’ for the EU capital market and for its current flagship Capital Markets Union (CMU) agenda. The extent to which EU regulation is transformative is contested in relation {{to the development of the}} EU capital market. But the EU regulatory regime which governs third country access to the EU capital market is likely to be a significant determinant of the strength of the EU’s capacity to absorb the loss of the UK from the single EU capital market and to contain related stability, liquidity, and efficiency risks. Drawing on international experience with access arrangements and on EU preferences and incentives, the paper considers the likely future of the current third country regime and how it might be re-configured so that third country access is based on a more secure footing...|$|E
40|$|The British Government has {{announced}} that the entire body of EU law will be adopted into UK Law through the ‘Great Repeal Bill’ {{at the moment of}} withdrawal from the European Union (EU) with ‘unnecessary legislation’ then gradually repealed. However, many commentators have pointed out the enormity and complexity of this task as well as the political, economic and constitutional hurdles to legislative reform. For plant biosecurity, a crucial issue taken into account when shaping the current EU plant health regime through the Directive 2000 / 29 /EC ('Plant Health Directive') was the need to embrace the single market. Furthermore, the UK was influential in safeguarding plant health in the single market through the adoption of this Directive. The impact of Brexit on protection from invasive species damaging habitats and wildlife (EU Regulation 1143 / 2014) should also be considered. With the Brexit White Paper published and with the Article 50 Bill passing through Parliament, the following questions should be asked: •	Will Directives as well as EU Regulations be included in Great Repeal Bill? •	If so, will Directive 2000 / 29 /EC be regarded as 'unnecessary' given UK’s likely departure from the single market and what might replace it? •	Will existing rulings of the ECJ be taken into account in implementation of laws originating from the EU? •	Will risks of introduction of harmful organisms and invasive species increase or lessen if the UK’s borders retract to her national boundaries? •	What will happen with plant <b>passporting?</b> It will also be necessary {{to take into account the}} impact of Brexit on legislation on plant protection products/pesticides because plant health is a component of the EU Farm-to-Fork food safety strategy. Consequently, another question to be addressed is: •	Will the UK continue to implement the farm-to-fork strategy after Brexit strategy or will it be abandoned in favour of a narrower sectoral approach...|$|E
