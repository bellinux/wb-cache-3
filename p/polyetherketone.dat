Although all dumbbell-shaped samples are soluble in strong acids such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) and sulfuric acid, only phenoxy-terminated dumbbell shaped triblock copolymers (3 a and 3 b) were soluble in common polar aprotic solvents such as NMP, DMF, DMAc and DMSO. Their solubility in common organic solvents was apparently a consequence arising from the obstruction of the close packing of PBZT components by the bulky dendritic PEK ends. A very surprising and interesting observation was made when the 3 a and 3 b solutions in NMP were placed under room light for 24 h: all major absorption peaks became featureless and blue-shifted. This photochromism was investigated by static and dynamic UV-absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy under various conditions. Although the response time was quite long, it could be controlled {{as a function of}} excitation wavelength, light intensity, and solvent viscosity and/or polarity.

Good quality films could be cast from solutions. Alternatively, we could also process these copolymers by the compression molding technique. The block copolymer samples were simply heated above the transition temperatures of the coil components and pressed into articles with desired shapes. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction study of the selected solution-cast film exhibited a long-range ordering, which is indicative of microphase separation.

Several sidelines which have stemmed from this work are also described. A brief literature review and discussion of project objectives introduces the work. The mechanism of formation and the general characterisation of icosahedral carboranes is then discussed along {{with a description of}} various syntheses of C-carborane derivatives. Chapter 3 describes a series of model reactions performed to test the feasibility of the various routes available for the preparation of poly(carboranyletherketones). Electrophilic polyacylation in superacid solution was found to be the most convenient method. Hence monomers (suitably substituted derivatives of 1, 2 -diphenyl-ortho-carborane) were prepared for polymer synthesis Under these conditions. Chapter 4 outlines the preparation and characterisation of four poly(carboranyletherketones). These polymers are shown by NMR to have the expected structures. Their solution and calorimetric characteristics show the polymers to be totally amorphous, with the polymer chains being stiffened by the presence of the 1, 2 -diphenyl- ortho-carborane unit. The thermal % weight loss from these polymers both in air and in nitrogen is substantially less than that shown by parent poly (etherketones). Various C-hydroxy carboranes (R(0 H) C 2 BiqHi 0) and their trialkylammonium salts have been prepared and used {{to examine the effects of}} electron delocalisation into the carborane cage.

In this study, temperature ramped molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict two physical properties (i. e., glass transition temperature and thermal degradation temperature) of a previously synthesised and published telechelic benzoxazine. Plots of simulated density versus temperature show decreases in density within the same temperature range as experimental values for the thermal degradation. The predicted value for the thermal degradation temperature for the cured polybenzoxazine based on the telechelic <b>polyetherketone</b> (PEK) monomer was ca. 400 °C, {{in line with the}} experimental thermal degradation temperature range of 450 °C to 500 °C. Mechanical Properties of both the unmodified PEK and the telechelic benzoxazines are simulated and compared to experimental values (where available). The introduction of the benoxazine moieties are predicted to increase the elastic moduli in line with the increase of crosslinking in the system...|$|E
40|$|Nafion®- 117, {{sulfonated}} polysulfone (sPSF) and sulfonated <b>polyetherketone</b> (sPEK) {{are characterized}} using broadband dielectric spectroscopy {{in the frequency}} range of 10 MHz– 100 mHz. Overall, there are 4 - 5 relaxation processes in these sulfonated membranes and a comparison of their spectral features allows assigning the relaxation processes. At an optimum amplitude of ~ 100 mVrms, all the relaxations are clearly defined as the electrode polarization is minimized. At low temperatures (- 130 °C), these membranes show a broad relaxation peak in the mid-frequency region, which quickly shifts towards the high-frequency region as the temperature is increased to - 90 °C. This peak is observed in proton exchange membranes {{for the first time}} due to the use of low ac amplitude, and it is assigned to the relaxation of the confined water in the micro-pores. With all the membranes, the peak associated with -SO 3 H group relaxation is observed in the same frequency range at a temperature of ~- 80 °C...|$|E
