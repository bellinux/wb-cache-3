Some research proposes violent video game use correlates with a temporary increase in aggression and a decrease in <b>prosocial</b> <b>behavior</b> (caring about the welfare and rights of others), but these results have not been reproduced. Others theorise positive effects of playing video games including <b>prosocial</b> <b>behavior</b> in some contexts and argue that the video game industry has served as a scapegoat for more generalised problems affecting some communities.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooperative}} breeding hypothesis {{predicts that}} cotton-top tamarins engage with this young-rearing paradigm, {{and in turn}} naturally embrace patterns of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behavior.</b> These monkeys engage in such behavior by acting altruistically within their groups in caring for infants, vocalizing alarm calls, and in sharing food. Though some studies indicate that cotton-top tamarins have the psychological capacity to participate in reciprocally mediated altruism, {{it is unclear whether}} the cotton-top tamarin acts solely using judgements on reinforcement history.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{evidence}} for the associations of positive affect to <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and internalizing problems, relatively {{little is known about}} the underlying etiology. The sample comprised over 300 twin pairs at age 3. Positive affect, <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and internalizing problems were assessed using the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire (Goldsmith, 1996), the Revised Rutter Parent Scale for Preschool Children (Hogg, Rutter, & Richman, 1997), and the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 1. 5 - 5 (Achenbach, 1991), respectively. Positive affect correlated positively with <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and negatively with internalizing problems. <b>Prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> were negatively associated with internalizing problems. The relations of positive affect to <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and internalizing problems were due to environmental effects (shared and nonshared). In contrast, the link between <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and internalizing problems was entirely explained by genetic effects. The current study has moved beyond prior emphasis on negative affect and elucidated the less understood etiology underlying the associations between positive affect, <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and internalizing problems. This study could guide the development of programs for promoting <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and alleviating internalizing problems in children...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} immediate social companions in the <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> of children from two cultural communities from the USA and the Philippines. Materials for this study comprised behavioral observations drawn from the Six Cultures Study—with 612 five-minute observations of 23 children (12 girls, 11 boys) from Orchard Town, MA, and 570 observations of 24 children (12 girls, 12 boys) from Tarong, Philippines, {{ranging in age from}} 3 to 11 years. Data were coded for instances of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> as well as characteristics of social companions (age and relationship to actor). Results revealed several interesting findings. First, frequency of children’s behaviors varied {{as a function of the}} age of their social companions. Children generally directed the highest number of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> towards infants and toddlers, except for younger children’s <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> towards relatives which were directed mostly towards adults. Second, frequency of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> varied as a function of kinship, but differently for the community groups. Tarong children were generally more prosocial towards relatives, while Orchard Town children showed more <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> towards non-relatives. Results highlight the role of immediate contexts in <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> of children, and the value of using cross-cultural methodology to examine contextual factors in developmental processes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} children’s <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> in everyday contexts that represent {{varying degrees of}} strength of situational demands. Behavioral observations of children (N = 89) ages 2 to 10 years (M = 5. 25, SD = 2. 23)., collected in Ngecha, Kenya were coded for 3 types of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> (nurturant, responsible and prosocial dominant) and the contexts in which these behaviors emerged (childcare, self care, labor/chores, play, idle/ social). Mixed factorial ANOVAs showed age differences in <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> favoring older {{children as well as}} context effects. <b>Prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> occurred more frequently than in labor/chores than in play, idle/social or self-care contexts; and <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> occurred more frequently during play and idle/social contexts than in self-care contexts. Most nurturant behaviors were performed during childcare. Most responsible behaviors were performed during labor/chores. The contextual differences for responsible and nurturant behaviors were found mostly for the older age groups. Lastly, older children exhibited <b>prosocial</b> dominant <b>behaviors</b> more often than did younger children. Results suggest that both individual level and contextual variables are important in studying different types of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Implications for parents and educators are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Dominant pairs are {{the only}} {{breeding}} pair within their groups, and the female generally has authority over the breeding male. While nonbreeding group members can be the leading pair's offspring, immigrant adults may also live with and cooperate in these groups. This social grouping in cotton-top tamarins is hypothesized to arise from predation pressure. Cotton-top tamarins exhibit <b>prosocial</b> <b>behavior</b> that benefits {{other members of the}} group, and are well known for engaging in cooperative breeding whereby the group's subordinate adults help in rearing the offspring of the dominant pair. The dominant female is more likely to give birth to nonidentical twins than a singleton, so it would be too energetically expensive for just one pair to raise the young.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the core}} {{character}} deficits of highly psychopathic individuals {{are likely to}} be highly incorrigible to the currently available treatment methods, the antisocial and criminal behavior associated with it may be more amenable to management, the management of which being the main aim of therapy programs in correctional settings. It has been suggested that the treatments that may be most likely to be effective at reducing overt antisocial and criminal behavior are those that focus on self-interest, emphasizing the tangible, material value of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behavior,</b> with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the patient wants out of life in prosocial rather than antisocial ways. To this end, various therapies have been tried with the aim of reducing the criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy, with mixed success. As psychopathic individuals are insensitive to sanction, reward-based management, in which small privileges are granted in exchange for good behavior, has been suggested and used to manage their behavior in institutional settings.|$|E

40|$|Parental {{child rearing}} {{behaviors}} predict children's levels of prosociality (Eisenberg and Valiente, 2002; Hastings, Utendale, and Sullivan, 2007). Parents' daily hassles are continuous {{sources of stress}} that can cause difficulties in effective parenting (Belsky, 1984; Crnic and Greenberg, 1990), which can both directly and indirectly affect children's outcomes. Although stress {{has been linked to}} <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> (e. g., McGinley et al., 2010), studies on the relations between daily hassles and children's <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> are lacking. The present study was designed to examine the longitudinal relations between parents' daily hassles and young children's <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> as well as the mediating role of parenting practices in a sample of children from Turkey. The final sample was 159 middle class Turkish preschool children and their mothers. Overall, we found longitudinal evidence that parenting daily hassles, warmth, inductive reasoning, and physical punishment were significantly associated with children's <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> There was a direct link between parenting daily hassles and <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> three years later. Additionally, there was partial support for the expected indirect effect of parenting daily hassles on the children's <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> through parenting practices. The present findings show partial support to family stress model in predicting children's prosocial development, and extend our understanding of children's prosocial development to a non-Western, predominantly Muslim culture...|$|R

Three different trajectories of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> were identified for 686 Italian youths: high-increasing (18 %), medium-stable (48 %), and low-stable (34 %). An increasing pattern of change in <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> was predicted by filial self-efficacy at age 16 - 17, which in turn mediated longitudinal relations to civic engagement and civic values at age 22 - 23.

40|$|Although <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{have been}} widely studied across disciplines, the {{mechanisms}} underlying them are not fully understood. Evidence from psychology, biology and economics suggests that <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> can be driven {{by a variety of}} seemingly opposing factors: altruism or egoism, intuition or deliberation, inborn instincts or learned dispositions, and utility derived from actions or their outcomes. Here we propose a framework inspired by research on reinforcement learning and decision making that links these processes and explains characteristics of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> in different contexts. More specifically, we suggest that <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> inherit features of up to three decision-making systems employed to choose between self- and other- regarding acts: a goal-directed system that selects actions based on their predicted consequences, a habitual system that selects actions based on their reinforcement history, and a Pavlovian system that emits reflexive responses based on evolutionarily prescribed priors. This framework, initially described in the field of cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, provides insight into the potential neural circuits and computations shaping <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Furthermore, it identifies specific conditions in which each of these three systems should dominate and promote other- or self- regarding behavior...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Prosocial</b> <b>behavior</b> in {{childhood}} often begins {{with questions of}} sharing and fairness. From age 12-18 months, children begin to display <b>prosocial</b> <b>behavior</b> in presenting and giving their toys to their parents, without promoting or being reinforced by praise. The development of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behavior</b> continues throughout {{the second year of}} life, as children begin to gain a moral understanding of the world. As obedience to societal standards becomes important, children’s ability to exhibit <b>prosocial</b> <b>behavior</b> strengthens, with occurrence and diversity of these behaviors increasing with age and cognitive maturity. What is important developmentally is that the child has developed a belief that sharing is an obligatory part of a social relationship and involves a question of right and wrong. So, as children move through childhood, their reasoning changes from being hedonistic and needs-oriented to becoming more concerned with approval and more involved in complex cognitive forms of perspective taking and reciprocity reasoning. [...] Additionally, children's <b>prosocial</b> <b>behavior</b> is typically more centered around interest in friends and concern for approval, whereas adolescents begin to develop reasoning that is more concerned with abstract principles such as guilt and positive affect.|$|E
40|$|Presentation made at Latinos in the Heartland (12 th : 2014 : St. Louis, Mo.) and {{published}} in the annual conference proceedingStressful experiences are demanding and can weaken coping mechanisms and lead to maladjustment (Conger et al., 1993; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Mexican Americans face unique forms of stressors, including acculturative stress. Acculturative stress is defined as demands placed on the individual that result from adapting to a new culture (Alegria & Woo, 2009). Acculturative stress is multidimensional and can be conceptualized in different ways. Language is a salient component of everyday life and may contribute to acculturative stress among Mexican Americans. Specifically, language can be potentially stressful for emerging adults who speak English {{as a second language}} and have difficulty communicating with others. Additionally, emerging adults may feel that they have access to fewer opportunities than their European American peers because of their ethnicity. Emerging adults who believe that society excludes them based on their ethnicity may experience environmental stress, another dimension of acculturative stress. Acculturative stress has been linked to a variety of behavioral outcomes, including <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> which are positive actions intended to benefit others. Prior research has demonstrated that acculturative stress is positively associated with specific forms of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> but is negatively associated with other forms (McGinley et al., 2010). Furthermore, while researchers have examined different components of acculturative stress, it is unclear if these dimensions differentially impact different types of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The current study examined the relations between two dimensions of acculturative stress (language stress and environmental stress) and Mexican American emerging adults' <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> (dire, emotional, compliant, altruistic, anonymous, and public). Data was collected from Mexican American emerging adults in California and Texas. Participants were Mexican American college students (mean age= 23. 05 years, range 18 - 30 years; 66. 9 % female). Participants completed measures of their acculturative stress (Social, Attitudinal, Familial, and Environmental Acculturative Stress Scale; Mena, Padilla, & Maldonado, 1987). For the current study, the existing environmental stress subscale (10 items; alpha=. 85) was used to assess stress associated with perceptions of limited opportunities and social exclusion. A language stress subscale (3 items; alpha=. 73) was created to assess stress associated with communication. Regressions were conducted to examine the associations among language and environmental stress and six types of <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The results demonstrated that language stress positively predicted anonymous <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and negatively predicted altruistic <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Environmental stress positively predicted emotional, dire, compliant, and anonymous <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and negatively predicted altruistic <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Discussion will focus on the differential relations among language stress, environmental stress and specific <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors</b> and the implications of these findings for measurement and future research...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{developmental}} trajectory of a potential source of resilience, <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and its association with children’s peer victimization from third to sixth grade. Latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) was employed to explore first whether there were latent classes that emerged from these associations over time, and second, if there was a latent class indicating a potentially resilient pattern for victims. That is, a class with decreasing peer victimization and increasing or high-stable <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The current study examined 1091 children (540 females, 81. 4 % Caucasian) who were followed across several time points (birth to 9 th grade) as part of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care. Data from the third phase were used for the current study, with assessments included from third to sixth grade. Findings from a parallel process LGMM indicated three latent classes (labeled normative, at-risk, and resilient) emerged from the data supporting the proposed hypotheses. Characteristics of each class are as follows: the normative class indicated a slight decrease in victimization and high-stable <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> the at-risk class indicated increasing victimization and decreasing <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and, most notably, the resilient class indicated high initial, but dramatically decreasing victimization and high-stable <b>prosocial</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Follow-up analyses with covariates from the family, school, and individual levels further supported the labeling of these classes.
