40|$|AbstractWhen {{measurement}} {{rotating speed}} exceeds 0. 3 times natural frequency, the SNR of vibration signal will be enhanced obviously in dynamic unbalance measurement. The calibration method proposed by authors {{can reduce the}} dynamic unbalance measurement error due to different rotor's mass and different rotating speed along with enhancing vibration signal when rotating speed is above 0. 3 times natural frequency. The relation between unbalance mass and sensors’ signal is affected by several elements such as system damping, rotor's mass, rotating speed and so on. When rotating speed exceeds 0. 3 times natural frequency, these elements cannot be all ignored. Meanwhile increasing rotating speed can bring advantage of enhanced vibration signals. And in this situation calibration result at one fixed rotating speed cannot reach permanent effective in a wide speed range. Thus an improved calibration method is presented here based on Cubic B-spline interpolation method. Cubic B-spline's characteristics fit the systems very well based on physical model and can help in getting more accurate interpolation results. Finally, experiments on CAB 590 general balancing machine (SCHENCK, Germany) were set up and the improved <b>permanent</b> <b>calibration</b> method was proved effective and accurate enough...|$|E

Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricul-tural Research Service (ARS). Examples of sensor develop-ment include on-site development of sensors and platforms, participation in cooperative research and development agreements (CRADA) with commercial companies, and membership on NASA science teams. Examples of progress made in sensor radiometric correction suitable for agricul-ture are presented for both laboratory and field environ-ments. The direction of future sensor development includes integrated sensors and systems, sensor standardization, and new sensor technologies measuring fluorescence and soil electrical conductivity, and utilizing LIght Detection and Ranging (lidar), hyperspectral, and multiband thermal wavelengths. The upcoming challenges include definition of the core spectral regions for agriculture and the sensor specifications for a dedicated, orbiting agricultural sensor, determination of an operational approach for reflectance and temperature retrieval, and enhanced communication between image providers, research scientists, and users. This review concludes {{with a number of}} avenues through which USDA could promote sensor development and radio-metric correction for agricultural applications.

An {{airborne}} {{chemical ionization}} ion trap mass spectrometer instrument (CI-ITMS) {{has been developed}} for tropospheric and stratospheric fast in-situ measurements of PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate) and PPN (peroxypropionyl ni-trate). The first scientific deployment of the FASTPEX in-strument (FASTPEX = Fast Measurement of Peroxyacyl ni-trates) {{took place in the}} Arctic during 18 missions aboard the DLR research aircraft Falcon, {{within the framework of the}} POLARCAT-GRACE campaign in the summer of 2008. The FASTPEX instrument is described and characteristic properties of the employed ion trap mass spectrometer are discussed. Atmospheric data obtained at altitudes of up to ∼ 12 km are presented, from the boundary layer to the lower-most stratosphere. Data were sampled with a time resolution of 2 s and a 2 σ detection limit of 25 pmol mol− 1. An iso-topically labelled standard was used for a <b>permanent</b> on-line <b>calibration.</b> For this reason the accuracy of the PAN mea-surements is better than ± 10 % for mixing ratios greater than 200 pmol mol− 1. PAN mixing ratios in the summer Arctic troposphere were in the order of a few hundred pmol mol− 1 and generally correlated well with CO. In the Arctic bound-ary layer and lowermost stratosphere smaller PAN mixing ratios were observed due to a combination of missing local sources of PAN precursor gases and efficient removal pro-cesses (thermolysis/photolysis). PPN, the second most abun-dant PAN homologue, was measured simultaneously. Ob-served PPN/PAN ratios range between ∼ 0. 03 and 0. 3. ...|$|R
40|$|Since many years, space borne radar {{altimeters}} {{have brought}} a powerful contribution in monitoring the dynamic sea surface topography, and in understanding better the ocean circulation {{and its impact on}} the earth system. Today, altimetric satellites are observing the whole oceans, measuring the sea surface height with a rms precision of 3 - 4 cm at 1 Hz sampling, as demonstrated by TOPEX/POSEIDON, launched in 1992, by Jason- 1, launched in 2001 and by ENVISAT, launched in 2002. Such a high level error budget was achieved thanks to the tremendous improvements which have been obtained in radar performances as well as in precise orbit determination. Indeed, applications of altimetry in oceanography and geodesy requires very precise measurements of the satellite-sea level range, along with appropriate environmental corrections, but also an accurate knowledge of the satellite position with respect to the Earth reference. One campaign has also been made in June 2003 at the Ibiza island area (Martinez-Benjamin et al., 2003). The marine geoid has been used to relate the coastal tide gauge data from Ibiza and San Antonio harbours to off-shore altimetric data. A technical Spanish contribution to the calibration experience has been the design of GPS buoys and GPS catamaran taking in account the University of Colorado at Boulder and Senetosa/Capraia designs. We present a synthesis of the sea level results results obtained from the altimeter calibration campaign at Ibiza island on June 2003 using the direct measurements from GPS buoys and the derived marine geoid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Satellite radar {{altimetry}} plays {{a critical role}} in monitoring the global oceans for scientific uses as well as navigation. The extreme accuracy of Jason- 1 and Topex/Poseidon, and the additional global coverage of the European satellite Envisat, have created significant advances in geodetic, oceanic and climate studies. Altimeter calibration is essential to obtain an absolute measure of sea level, as are knowing the instrument’s drifts and bias. Specially designed tide gauges are necessary {{to improve the quality of}} altimetric data, preferably near the satellite track. Further, due to systematic differences among instruments onboard different satellites, several in-situ calibrations are essentials to tie their systematic differences. We present synthesis of the results obtained from Topex/Poseidon and the first results on Jason- 1 altimeter calibration using the measurements from a GPS Catamaran and the derived marine geoid. They agree relatively well with results obtained at Corsica, Harvest and Bass Strait <b>calibration</b> <b>permanent</b> sites. Moreover, the geodetic activities (e. g., GPS, levelling) has permitted to build a very accurate (few mm) local network linked to the European one, with a reference frame compatible with the satellite altimetry missions (ITRF 2000). The GPS kinematic data were processed using two different softwares allowing to check the consistency of the solutions. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the automated material handling systems (AMHS) performance in semiconductor manufacturing requires the extraction of time and location data of transportation processes simultaneously carried out. Furthermore, the variable number of transportation steps and a flexible grouping of source and destination locations as well as AMHS components are to be considered. The state-of-the-art analysis shows that so far no applicable method is known for the online data extraction and performance measurement of multi stage transportation processes that covers the specific requirements of material transportation in semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Existing approaches can be grouped in methods with direct or indirect measurement of performance data. The investigations lead {{to the conclusion that}} existing approaches in the area of performance measurement do neither consider the issue of missing data points due to failed transportation components nor the simultaneous tracking of multi stage transportation processes. Furthermore, the lack of free configurability of event based data extraction methods is seen. The approach for online data extraction and measurement developed here is based on a three model structure. The first model includes the performance evaluation metrics grouped on three levels. These levels summarize characteristic measures with regard to delivery performance, throughput performance and AMHS utilization performance. This model is fed by the second model which contains a data base for the storage of all extracted measures and the configuration of the AMHS. Finally, the third model is responsible for the data extraction of time and location data based on control communication events which are exchanged by the distributed controller units of the AMHS control software components. The fundamental gaps in existing approaches for online performance measurement and evaluation of AMHS can be closed by the developed model for the online data extraction. The data extraction process is based on the communication events exchanged between the distributed AMHS controller units. An object-oriented tracking of moving carriers and AMHS components is realized by the application of finite state machine technology within the data extraction model. The free configurable state machines allow for a flexible data extraction of relevant timestamps and location data in order to record the relevant information for the performance evaluation of the simultaneously running multi stage transportation processes. A functional library was developed for the user-friendly configuration of the input and output operations of the state machines. The object oriented approach for the event data extraction enables the storage of relevant location and timestamp data in software objects and its specified attributes. During the extraction process for each multi stage transportation process in the real world of the AMHS, a software object is generated and stores the extracted data in its attributes. As soon as the transportation process is completed, the recorded data of each software object is stored in a relational data base. The developed data table structure is built in such ways that the metrics for the online performance evaluation of the transportation processes can be calculated efficiently and without time consuming search operations in the data base. The here developed three model approach and the online performance measurement approach was tested in a real wafer fab manufacturing environment. By the integration of the three models in the manufacturing environment, a continuous online performance evaluation process was realized. The critical components of the AMHS could be identified easily and consequently the root cause of traffic congestion and bottlenecks are detectable. The systematic approach of the performance evaluation model ensures the evaluation of the global impact of local AMHS component configurations. Based on the approach for continuous performance data extraction and measurement developed here further research work is seen with regard to adaptive closed loop control mechanisms for a self configuration management of the automated transportation system. The online data extraction process which was developed in this thesis could also be used for a <b>permanent</b> self <b>calibration</b> and autonomous adaptation of planning models of automated transportation systems. Finally, the online data extraction method of the transport behaviour which was developed in this thesis could provide accurate data for a better and more accurate lot scheduling for the costly semiconductor process equipment.

Therefore, future research activities should focus on the evaluation of better lot scheduling under consideration of more accurate and up-to-date transport delay times to the particular destination locations in semiconductor fabs.

40|$|In Halbleiterfabriken ist derzeit eine Zunahme des automatisierten Lostransports zu Fertigungsgeräten und zwischen Fertigungsbereichen zu verzeichnen. Hierfür kommen reinraumtaugliche Deckenfördersysteme zum Einsatz, welche Fertigungslose über mehrstufige Transport-, Lager und Umhordeprozesse unter Berücksichtigung unterschiedlicher Reinheitsklassen befördern. Beim automatisierten Transport werden hohe Anforderungen an ein stabiles Durchsatz- und Lieferzeitverhalten gestellt. Dies erfordert im turbulenten Umfeld der Halbleiterfertigung mit sich verkürzenden Technologielebenszyklen und stark schwankenden Auftragsvolumina pro Halbleiterprodukt eine kontinuierliche Anpassung der Transportsysteme an sich lokal verändernde Transportintensitäten. Vor diesem Hintergrund gewinnt eine {{adaptive}} und kontinuierliche Leistungsbewertung von Transportprozessen zunehmend an Bedeutung. Eine sofortige Engpassdetektion im Transportprozess ist somit zwingend erforderlich, was durch ein modellbasiertes Verfahren zur Online-Leistungsbewertung möglich wird. Die heutige Situation in Halbleiterfabriken zeigt, dass keine kontinuierliche Extraktion von Leistungsdaten der mehrstufigen Transportprozesse erfolgt. Ebenso ist eine Bewertung für verschiedene Gruppierungsebenen von Transportsystemkomponenten aufgrund fehlender Zeit- und Ortsdaten zu den Transportprozessen derzeit nicht realisierbar. In der Halbleiterfertigung ist daher eine durchgängige Online-Leistungsbewertung nicht bekannt. Ansätze zur Leistungsbewertung von Materialfluss, Logistik oder Transportprozessen aus anderen Bereichen durch direkte oder indirekte Leistungsmessung erfüllen auch nicht die Kernanforderungen hinsichtlich einer frei konfigurierbaren und adaptiven Online-Erfassung von Zeit- und Ortsdaten zur lückenlosen Verfolgung von mehrstufigen Transportprozessen. Hauptbestandteil dieser Arbeit ist die Konzeption und Entwicklung eines modellbasierten Verfahrens zur Online-Leistungsbewertung von automatisierten Transportsystemen in Halbleiterfabriken. Im Kern der vorliegenden Dissertation steht die Erarbeitung eines Datenextraktionsmodells, welches eine Verfolgung von mehrstufigen Transportprozessen ermöglichen soll. Dafür werden aus den Kommunikationsereignissen der Transport- und Materialflusssteuerung die relevanten Zeit- und Ortsdaten der Transportprozesse online extrahiert sowie in ein Datenhaltungsmodell überführt. Ebenso werden Konfigurationsparameter der Transportsysteme online erfasst und im Datenhaltungsmodell abgelegt. Die Leistungsbewertung erfolgt in einem weiteren Modell basierend auf den extrahierten Leistungsdaten durch die Berechnung von zu entwickelnden Leistungskennzahlen auf unterschiedlichen Verdichtungsstufen von Einzelkomponenten bis zum Gesamtsystem der Transportautomatisierung. Zum Nachweis der Anwendbarkeit wurde das entwickelte modellbasierte Verfahren in die Steuerungsarchitektur einer Halbleiterfertigung integriert. Die Untersuchung hat gezeigt, dass durch das modellbasierte Verfahren eine operative Online-Leistungsbewertung der mehrstufigen Transportprozesse ermöglicht wurde. Durch Kennzahlen des Liefer-, Transport- und Auslastungsverhaltens über mehrstufige Transportprozesse konnte eine effiziente und schnelle Engpassdetektion am Transportsystem erreicht werden.
