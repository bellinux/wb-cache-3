40|$|Abstract—This work {{deals with}} {{problems}} of tool axis inclination angles in ball-end milling. Tool axis inclination angle contributes to improvement of functional surface properties (surface integrity-surface roughness, residual stress, micro hardness, etc.), decreasing cutting forces and improving production. By milling with ball-end milling tool, using standard way of cutting, when work piece and cutting tool contain right angle, we have zero cutting speed on edge. At this point cutting tool only pushes material {{into the work}} piece. Here we can observe the following undesirable effects- chip contraction, increasing of cutting temperature, increasing vibrations or creation of built-up edge. These effects have negative results – low quality of surface and decreasing of tool life (in the worse case even it is pinching out). These effects can be eliminated with the tilt of cutting tool or tilt of work piece. Very important is direction of feed. If the feed is designated as pulled, the tool runs silently, and also the surface of work piece improves, as opposed to pushed tool [5]. These two ways {{can be used with}} the tool axis inclination angle in feed direction and also in <b>pick</b> <b>feed</b> direction. Also using climb milling or conventional milling has big influence on surface quality and on tool life. Keywords—CAD/CAM system, tool axis inclination angle, ballend milling, surface roughness, cutting forces. I. MILLING BY MEANS OF THE TOLL AXIS INCLINATION ANGLE Thanks to tilt of cutting tool we can change effective diameter of cutting tool and with it also effective cutting speed. Effective tool diameter (without tilt of cutting tool) can be calculated according to this mathematical expression: d 2 (d- a) eff = ⋅ a [mm] (1) p p Where: ap axial depth of cut [mm], d tool diameter [mm], deff effective tool diameter [mm]. Effective diameter of pulled cutting tool is calculated according to this mathematical expression [2]: ⎡ ⎛ d- 2 a ⎤ p ⎞ d = d ⋅ sin ⎢arccos ⎟ + β eff f ⎥ [mm] ⎝ d ⎠ ⎥...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Generally, {{ball end}} mills {{are used for}} free-form surface {{machining}}. When machining curved surfaces with large curvature change using ball end mills, {{it is necessary to}} use tools with larger curvature of the cutting edges than the maximum curvature of the surface and minute <b>pick</b> <b>feeds</b> or to change tools for fitting the curvature of one part of the surface. However this causes poor machining efficiency. The curvature of the cutting edge of a flat end mill can be fitted to the curvature of a point on machined surfaces by adjusting the tool posture. Therefore, flat end mills can efficiently cut almost all curvature curved surfaces without tool change. This paper proposes two methods for deciding tool posture and tool path for 5 -axis control machining based on minimum cusp height. To decide the tool path, one method defines tool paths along isoparametric curved lines, while the other defines tool paths along curved lines along the minimum curvature direction. The basic system was constructed based on the proposed method, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified...|$|R

25|$|Crocodiles {{have the}} most acidic stomach of any vertebrate. They can easily digest bones, hooves and horns. The BBC TV {{reported}} that a Nile crocodile that has lurked a long time underwater to catch prey builds up a large oxygen debt. When it has caught and eaten that prey, it closes its right aortic arch and uses its left aortic arch to flush blood loaded with carbon dioxide from its muscles directly to its stomach; the resulting excess acidity in its blood supply makes it much easier for the stomach lining to secrete more stomach acid to quickly dissolve bulks of swallowed prey flesh and bone. Many large crocodilians swallow stones (called gastroliths or stomach stones), which may act as ballast to balance their bodies or assist in crushing food, similar to grit ingested by birds. Herodotus claimed that Nile crocodiles had a symbiotic relationship with certain birds, such as the Egyptian plover, which enter the crocodile's mouth and <b>pick</b> leeches <b>feeding</b> on the crocodile's blood; with no evidence of this interaction actually occurring in any crocodile species, it is most likely mythical or allegorical fiction.|$|R

The input parameters are divided into four categories: biological variables which include animal traits, managemental variables, nutritional variables and economic variables. These parameters assume typical indigenous chicken production in Kenya. However, the input parameters may be adjusted to suit specific situations and also assess the biological and economic performance of various production systems of other domestic avian species. The model`s ability to simulate live weight changes, feed intake of various chicken categories, revenues, cost and profitability of the three production systems is illustrated. The bio-economic models can be used to develop breeding goals and estimate economic values for the genetic improvement of indigenous chicken...|$|R

40|$|Dietary {{variability}} {{might have}} been {{a major factor in the}} dispersal and subsequent persistence of the genus Macaca in both tropical and temperate areas. Macaques are found from northern Africa to Japan, yet there have been few systematic attempts to compare diets between different modern populations. Here we have taken a direct approach and sampled museum-curated tissues (hair and bone) of Macaca mulatta (rhesus macaques) for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope dietary analyses. Samples from India, Vietnam, and Burma (Myanmar) were taken, representing both tropical and temperate populations. The δ 13 C values obtained from hair show that the temperate macaques, particularly those from Uttar Pradesh, have a δ 13 C signature that indicates at least some use of C 4 resources, while the tropical individuals have a C 3 -based diet. However, δ 13 C values from bone bioapatite indicate a C 3 -based diet for all specimens and they do not show the C 4 usage seen in the hair of some animals, possibly because bone represents a much longer turnover period than that of hair. The results of δ 15 N analyses grouped animals by geographic region of origin, which may be related to local soil nitrogen values. The greatest variation in δ 15 N values was seen in the specimens from Burma, which may be partly due to seasonality, as specimens were collected at different times of year. We also investigated the relationship between the hair, bone collagen, and bone bioapatite δ 13 C results, and found that they are highly correlated, and that one tissue can be used to extrapolate results for another. However, our results also suggest that hair may <b>pick</b> up discrete <b>feeding</b> traces (such as seasonal usage), which are lost when only bone collagen and bioapatite are examined. This has important implications for dietary reconstructions of archaeological and paleontological populations...|$|R

40|$|This thesis mainly {{studies the}} {{downlink}} of a wireless multiuser system, where the transmitter has limited {{knowledge about the}} communication channels of the users. Key techniques to improve the performance of such systems are, for instance, multiple antennas, multiuser diversity and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Common for these techniques is that, to exploit them fully, a cross-layer approach has to be adopted. This means that the scheduling and the signal designs are done jointly and based on parameters from several communication layers. Multiuser diversity {{can be used to}} significantly increase system throughput in wireless communication systems. The idea is to schedule users when they experience good channel conditions and let them wait when the channels are weak. In this thesis, several aspects of OFDMA systems that exploit multiuser diversity are investigated. An adaptive reduced feedback scheme for OFDMA is proposed. It significantly reduces the total feedback overhead while maintaining a multiuser diversity gain. The scheme uses clusters of sub-carriers as feedback units and feeds back information about the fading peaks only. It adapts to the number of users so that less feedback per user is required if there are many users in the system. With such a selective feedback scheme, there is a risk that the scheduler has no instantaneous channel quality information for some parts of the spectrum. Better uses for these sub-carriers are investigated. In addition, an alternative based on the the channel quality feedback of some uniformly spaced sub-carriers is proposed. The scheduler estimates the channel quality on the other sub-carriers. Channel-aware scheduling is necessary in order to exploit multiuser diversity. A modified proportional fair (PF) scheduler is proposed. It incorporates individual target bit-rates and delays and a tunable fairness level. An opportunistic beamforming scheme for clustered OFDMA is presented and evaluated. A key aspect of the opportunistic beamforming scheme is that it induces artificial frequency selectivity for users with relatively flat channels. Several aspects of the proposed system are evaluated by means of simulations. In the simulations, the clustered beamforming with the modified PF scheduler performs better than three comparison systems. The modified PF scheduler manages to divide the resources according to the user targets, {{while at the same time}} exploiting the multiuser diversity as well as the standard PF algorithm. In many scenarios, the largest gains from having multiple antennas at the basei station come from space-division multiple access (SDMA). In the downlink, this means that data is transmitted to several users simultaneously by using several beams. Opportunistic space-division OFDMA is proposed and evaluated. An enhancement that exploits temporal channel correlation is able to boost the throughput significantly. SDMA based on subspace packings is proposed and evaluated. A set of beamforming matrices (a subspace packing) is made a priori available at the base-station and at all users. In each block, one of the matrices is used for multi-beam transmission. The users <b>pick</b> and <b>feed</b> back the index of one preferred column (beam) from one of the matrices, and the corresponding SINR, which includes all potential inter-beam interference. This enables scheduling of spatially compatible users and accurate rate adaptation, with relatively little feedback. Three different subspace packings are considered and evaluated with simulations. For the i. i. d. Rayleigh fading channel, Grassmannian subspace packings were the best choice. Moreover, a method to further reduce the feedback for large packings is proposed and evaluated. It is based on the arrangement of beams in a graph and the feedback of a neighbor index. Numerical results show that the feedback can be significantly reduced with only small performance losses, even for relatively fast fading channels. QC 2010081...|$|R

About Anansi Masters: The Anansi Masters project is developed by Vista Far Reaching Visuals (Mr. Jean Hellwig) and partners. It is designed as a public digital platform at [URL] and opened in 2007. At the website one can find information about the story character of Nanzi (or Anansi or Kweku Ananse), with English and Dutch subtitled video recordings of storytelling in several countries in different languages, educational modules about storytelling for use at schools and academies, and digital issues of the Anansi Masters Journal published since the beginning of the project. All storytelling videos are also published on Youtube. The stories of the Anansi tradition originate in Africa and were exported to other parts of the world through slave trade and migration. In Anansi Masters, the similarities and differences between the stories and storytellers, who tell in their own language, can be found. Anansi Masters initiates different activities all over the world where stories from this oral tradition can be found.

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi {{investigar}} a biologia alimentar de Knodus moenkhausii (Eigenmann & Kennedy, 1903) em riachos do Alto rio Paraná no Estado de São Paulo. Em oito riachos (R 1 -R 8), K. moenkhausii se alimentou de 18 itens, dos quais algas, ninfas de efemerópteros e larvas de dípteros foram os itens autóctones mais freqüentes e dominantes; fragmentos de insetos terrestres, himenópteros e aranhas foram os itens alóctones mais freqüentes e dominantes. No riacho R 2, K. moenkhausii apresentou dieta distinta dos demais riachos, principalmente em função da profundidade, tipo de substrato e da presença de vegetação ripária. No riacho R 9, amostrado mensalmente durante um ano, foram identificados 15 itens, dos quais insetos terrestres predominaram ao longo do ano; larvas de dípteros e algas foram pouco expressivas nos períodos de dezembro-janeiro (período mais quente e chuvoso) e junho-julho (período mais frio e seco). No riacho R 9 foram realizadas observações subaquáticas durante mergulho livre, onde observamos a cata de itens na coluna d'água junto do substrato, da vegetação submersa e na superfície da água. A elevada variedade de itens consumidos - condicionada às variações do hábitat e sazonais - e a prática de diversas táticas nos permitem considerar K. moenkhausii uma espécie oportunista quanto ao uso dos recursos alimentares. Este oportunismo aparentemente se reflete na abundância da espécie, demonstrando boa capacidade em alocar parte significativa de sua energia à reprodução, mesmo em ambientes fisicamente impactados por ação antrópica. In {{the present}} investigation we studied the feeding biology of Knodus moenkhausii (Eigenmann & Kennedy, 1903) in streams of the Upper Paraná river system {{in the state of}} São Paulo. In eight streams (R 1 -R 8), K. moenkhausii consumed 18 items, of which algae, ephemeropteran nymphs, and dipteran larvae were the most frequent and dominant autochthonous items, as were terrestrial insects, hymenopterans, and spiders regarding allochthonous items. In the R 2 stream, K. moenkhausii showed distinct diet, mostly due to depth, substrate type, and presence of riparian vegetation. In the R 9 stream (monthly sampled for one year), 15 items were consumed, of which terrestrial insects predominated all year round; dipteran larvae and algae were least relevant during December-January (hot and wet period) and June-July (cold and dry period), respectively. During snorkeling observations in this stream, we recorded individuals performing drift <b>feeding,</b> <b>picking</b> at relatively small preys close to the substrate and submerged vegetation, and surface picking. The large diversity of consumed items - conditioned to habitat and seasonal variations - and the diversity of feeding tactics allow us to consider K. moenkhausii a rather opportunistic fish species. Such opportunism apparently reflects on the species abundance, showing its ability to allocate a significant part of its energy to reproduction, even in physically impacted habitats by human actions...|$|R
