We determined {{the correlation between}} green leaf area size (LA) and forage yield (Y) and compared plant utilization estimated by photographic technique (ULA) to actual <b>utilization</b> (UY) <b>values.</b> Shrub forage yield and utilization were deter-mined by hand plucking in five to eight increments. Before the first plucking, and after each subsequent plucking, we took two photos that were perpendicular to {{each other at the}} intersection of the shrub. Each photo was evaluated using image-processing software to produce red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color band images. Green leaf area was determined as follows: pixel = ([G-R] + [G-B]) / (G+R+G+B); Green leaf area, cm 2 = (Calibration [C], cm 2 ∙pixel- 1) × (LA, pixel). Green leaf area calculated from the photographic technique was strongly correlated (r 2 = 0. 83 - 0. 94, P < 0. 001) with forage yield for all three shrubs. A strong correlation (r 2 = 0. 95, n = 142) was detected between <b>utilization</b> <b>values</b> estimated through green leaf area size and actual <b>values.</b> <b>Utilization</b> estimated by LA did not differ (P = 0. 60, n = 142) from actual <b>utilization</b> <b>values.</b> In summary, our results indicate the photographic technique could be used once calibration curves are developed, to measure available browse yield and utilization of shrubs in a nondestructive approach...|$|R

40|$|Text in AfrikaansThe <b>utilization</b> <b>value</b> of the {{paradoxical}} theory {{of change in}} Gestalt Play Therapy with adolescents Adolescents undergo significant changes on physical, emotional, and cognitive levels during this development stage. These changes have a great influence on their self-awareness. Most adolescents experience great problems with {{who they are and}} who they should be according to the expectations of others. This causes a never-ending process of efforts to change. Change can only take place if the adolescent is who he is, but not if he tries to be what he is not. The consequence hereof is that change cannot take place in the adolescent, because he should first become aware of who he is. The awareness of who he is leads to change. The paradoxical theory of change is all about being who one is and not about trying to be what others expect one to be. The adolescent should be accompanied to become aware of who he is, by utilization of {{the paradoxical}} theory, {{in order to be able}} grow and change. The aim of this study was to explore and describe the <b>utilization</b> <b>value</b> of the paradoxical theory of change in Gestalt Play Therapy with adolescents. In order to achieve this goal, the research process was directed by qualitative research, and triangulation was utilized as a technique for gathering information.
