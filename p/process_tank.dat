5000|$|At {{the same}} time as it was {{developing}} the Isa <b>Process</b> <b>tank</b> house technology, MIM was starting the joint development, with the Australian government's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ("CSIRO"), of the energy-efficient ISASMELT™ smelting technology, based on the CSIRO's Sirosmelt lance. After laboratory testing of a potential lead smelting process at the CSIRO's Melbourne facilities, MIM moved to a 120 kg/h test rig in the Mount Isa lead smelter in 1980 and then to a five tonne per hour ("t/h") pilot plant in the lead smelter in 1983. This was followed by the development of a copper smelting process in the Mount Isa test rig and the construction of a 15 t/h copper ISASMELT™ demonstration plant in the copper smelter in 1987. With the success of lead pilot plant and the copper demonstration plant, both of which boosted MIM's metal output by being run by operations' personnel, MIM decided to market the ISASMELT™ technology. By 2013, there were 15 ISASMELT™ plants operating in 10 countries, including in the Mount Isa copper smelter.|$|E

The three cases considered in this work were fire in a room, loss of confinement from a <b>process</b> <b>tank,</b> and loss of confinement coupled with fire event. Based on these accident scenarios in a large and unventilated process room, the modeling calculations of the hydrogen migration were performed to estimate local transient concentrations of hydrogen due to the sudden leakage and release from a glovebox system associated with the <b>process</b> <b>tank.</b> The modeling domain represented the major features of the process room including the principal release or leakage source of gas storage system. The model was benchmarked against the literature results for key phenomena such as natural convection, turbulent behavior, gas mixing due to jet entrainment, and radiation cooling because these phenomena are closely related to the gas driving mechanisms within a large air space of the process room. The modeling results showed that {{at the corner of the}} process room, the gas concentrations migrated by the Case 2 and Case 3 scenarios reached the set-point value of high activity alarm in about 13 seconds, while the Case 1 scenario takes about 90 seconds to reach the concentration.

In this paper, system identification process is attempted for CSTH <b>tank</b> <b>process.</b> The CSTH <b>tank</b> <b>process</b> is a classic example of a highly nonlinear system. For nonlinear systems, System identification provides a better alternative to find their system transfer function. First principle modeling of level process is done with so much of assumption. System identification procedure gives accurate model. Inflow rate is taken as the input data and process level is taken as the output for CSTH tank. Collected data is fitted to transfer function model set. The simulation is performed in the MATLAB environment using System Identification coding and then worked on FOPID control toolbox. We have found practically the model of the CSTH tank using the MATLAB environment which gives the results almost identical to the ideal model of the plant. The system identification process is used here to identify the nature of the system using the inputs and the outputs available.

40|$|As a young child, {{my father}} {{once told me}} that it is {{impossible}} to know and understand everything. At first I did not believe him, but as I grew up, I realised why he said it. This realisation did not, however, dawn on me overnight. During my training many textbooks and lecturers painted the picture of a world that can be described by a few simple laws. When I finished my training and started to work as a water engineer, I realised that this was only an illusion. The difference between theory and practise was bigger than I thought. I eventually came to the realisation, through the wisdom of many others, that this gap between theory and reality is not only due to the limitations of science and technology, but also to beliefs. Often these beliefs are so intertwined with science and technology that the scientists and technologists themselves are not aware of it. This study attempts to explain why differences between theory and practise exist. The modelling of water treatment process tanks is used as a vehicle to demonstrate this. In the process it is shown that scientists and technologists cannot use models in a responsible manner without also considering the broader philosophical aspects. My personal most satisfying contribution was to demonstrate the influence of philosophical views on <b>process</b> <b>tank</b> design methods. The study also makes original contributions in the field of water treatment <b>process</b> <b>tank</b> modelling. Computational Fluid Dynamic models are used in an attempt to understand water treatment process tanks better. This modelling technique applies a combination of scientific, technological and modelling concepts. An appropriate question by many technical readers will be why a significant portion of this text includes philosophical concepts if the title of the study deals with <b>process</b> <b>tank</b> modelling? First the arguments presented and the process of argumentation, can assist many scientists and engineers to develop a much broader view of science, technology and models. A second reason for this inclusion is the background it gives to where theories originated and how they were developed. Most importantly, however, the realisation of the inherent shortcomings of theories came much later and this is the third reason for its inclusion. It deals with exposing invalid assumptions and misconceptions that are held in the design of some process tanks. These misconceptions often originate from a philosophical view rather than a scientific observation. The fourth reason is to demonstrate the importance of normative aspects in the practise of science and technology. Finally, it can also benefit philosophers in the sense that they can see how philosophy can be applied to very practical problems. A need that is unsatisfied in many scientific and technical fields.

40|$|Abstract — The {{control of}} liquid level in tanks and flow between tanks {{is a basic}} problem in the process {{industries}}. In vital industries such as petro-chemical industries, paper industries, water treatment industries have the interacting <b>tanks</b> which the <b>processes</b> of chemical or mixing treatment {{takes place in the}} <b>process</b> <b>tanks.</b> Hence, the level of fluid in the tanks and interaction between tanks must be controlled. It is essential for control system engineers to understand how interacting tanks control system works and how the level control problem is solved. The problem of level control in interacting <b>tank</b> <b>processes</b> are system dynamics and interacting characteristics. In interacting <b>process</b> dynamics of <b>tank</b> 1 affects the dynamics of tank 2 and vice versa because flow rate depends on the difference between the liquid levels. In this work, a real-time two-tank interacting level process is taken-up for study. The mathematical model of a two-tank interacting process is derived. The hydraulic resistances (R 1 and R 2) are obtained using Experimental data. The servo and regulatory responses are obtained with PI controller. To improve the performance of the closed loop a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is designed and implemented for a two-tank interacting process. The servo and regulatory responses are obtained with FLC. The performances of Fuzzy Logic Controller are compared with PI controller in simulation. The performance measures are tabulated. It is observed from the results that the FLC out performs with no overshoot, faster settling time, better set-point tracking and thereby producing minimum integral square error(ISE).
