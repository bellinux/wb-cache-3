25|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) damage is the <b>primary</b> <b>key</b> feature of any FASD diagnosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is {{classified}} as a teratogen, can damage the brain across a continuum of gross to subtle impairments, depending on the amount, timing, and frequency of the exposure as well as genetic predispositions of the fetus and mother. While functional abnormalities are the behavioral and cognitive expressions of the FASD disability, CNS damage can be assessed in three areas: structural, neurological, and functional impairments.|$|E
2500|$|When the DFT is {{used for}} signal {{spectral}} analysis, the [...] sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal , where t represents time. [...] The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying Fourier transform of x(t) into a discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called aliasing. [...] Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see Nyquist rate) {{is the key to}} minimizing that distortion. [...] Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a manageable size entails a type of distortion called leakage, which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT. [...] Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the <b>primary</b> <b>key</b> to minimizing that effect. [...] When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the desired frequency resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a spectrogram. [...] If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the variance of the spectrum (also called a periodogram in this context); two examples of such techniques are the Welch method and the Bartlett method; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called spectral estimation.|$|E
