This paper {{describes}} {{the basic principles}} of dipartition of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>area</b> and uses Voronoi diagram on the dipartition of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>area.</b> This paper put forward a model of improved Voronoi diagram based on the basic Voronoi diagram. Depending on the existing transformer substation’s capacity and <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>area</b> surrounding the spatial distribution of the load, we determine weights based on the main transformer capacity and the spatial distribution of the load. In the process of generating the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>area,</b> we adjust the weights depending on different regions ofthe spatial distribution of heavy load to generate the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>area</b> based on improved Voronoi diagram model. Then we adjust according to {{the basic principles of}} the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>area</b> and the result based on improved Voronoi diagram model to generate the final result. Compared to the traditional division based on artificial experience, it can reflect rationality of the power supply, improve the accuracy of the partition. Preface With the rapid development of China's urban power grid construction and transformation, the plan of urban network has become an important task [...] The necessity of the optimal partition of distribution network planning and its advantages is proposed in Paper[1].

30|$|The UK is a {{representative}} industrialized country. Its fixed assets investments, installed capacity and electricity sales are stable, {{while the number}} of employees is low, indicating the high human resources utilization. The asset management level of NG also ranks as top player. The total coal consumption of NG was 40.4 million tons in 2003 and 60.7 million tons in 2013, and this increase (50 %) was far lower than that in China during the same period [7, 8]. The methods and experience of NG are of great significance for management and construction of power grid in China. CSG ranked the 113 th among the Fortune 500 companies in 2015. It is serving five southern provinces, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou and Hainan. The <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>area</b> and population of CSG are 1 million km 2 and 230 million, respectively. Its maximum load and electricity consumption in 2015 were 142.0 GW and 962.8 Tera Watt Hour (TWh), respectively [9].

30|$|We {{present a}} {{directed}} graph-based method for distribution network reconfiguration considering distributed generation. Two reconfiguration situations are considered: operation mode adjustment {{with the objective}} of minimizing active power loss (situation I) and service restoration {{with the objective of}} maximizing loads restored (situation II). These two situations are modeled as a mixed integer quadratic programming problem and a mixed integer linear programming problem, respectively. The properties of the distribution network with distributed generation considered are reflected as the structure model and the constraints described by directed graph. More specifically, the concepts of “in-degree” and “out-degree” are presented to ensure the radial structure of the distribution network, and the concepts of “virtual node” and “virtual demand” are developed to ensure the connectivity of charged nodes in every independent <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>area.</b> The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by test results of an IEEE 33 -bus system and a 5 -feeder system.|$|E

In order to avoid the problem we proposed a new technique called Bio-Inspired mechanism for routing. ACO is one of the Bio-inspired mechanism. ACO is a dynamic and reliable protocol. It provides energy-aware, data gathering routing structure in wireless sensor network. It can avoid network congestion and fast consumption of energy of individual node. Then it can prolong the life cycle of the whole network. ACO algorithm reduces the energy consumption. It optimizes the routing paths, providing an effective multi-path data transmission to obtain reliable communications in the case of node faults. The main goal is to maintain the maximum lifetime of network, during data transmission in a efficient manner.

40|$|Renewable Energy is {{considered}} {{as an effective}} solution for relieving the energy crisis and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. It is also be recognized as an important energy resource for power supplying {{in the next generation}} power gridsmart grid system. For a long time, the unsustainable and unstable of renewable energy generation is the main challenge to the combination of the renewable energy and the smart grid. The short board on the utilities' remote control caused low-efficiency of power scheduling in the distribution power area, also increased the difficulty of the local generated renewable energy grid-connected process. Furthermore, with the rapid growth of the number of electrical vehicles and the widely established of the fast power charging stations in urban and rural area, the unpredictable power charging demand will become another challenge to the power grid in a few years. In this thesis we propose the corresponding solutions for the challenges enumerated in the above. Based on the architecture of terminal power consumer's residence, we introduce the local renewable energy system into the residential environment. The local renewable energy system can typically support part of the consumer's power demand, even more. In this case, we establish the architecture of the local smart grid community based on the structure of distribution network of the smart grid, includes terminal power consumer, secondary power substation, communication links and sub data management center. Communication links are employed as the data transmission channels in our scheme. Also the local power scheduling algorithm and the optimal path selection algorithm are created for power scheduling requirements and stable expansion of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>area.</b> Acknowledging the fact that the information flow of the smart grid needs appropriate communication technologies to be the communication standards, we explore the available communication technologies and the communication requirements and performance metrics in the smart grid networks. Also, the power saving mechanism of smart devices in the advanced metering infrastructure is proposed based on the two-state-switch scheduling algorithm and improved 802. 11 ah-based data transmission model. Renewable energy system can be employed in residential environment, but also can be deployed in public environment, like fast power charging station and public parking campus. Due to the current capacity of electrical vehicles (EV), the fast power charging station is required not just by the EV drivers, but also demanded by the related enterprises. We propose a upgraded fast power charging station with local deployed renewable energy system in public parking campus. Based on the queueing model, we explore and deliver a stochastic control model for the fast power charging station. A new status called "Service Jumped" is created to express the service state of the fast power charging station with and without the support from the local renewable energy in real-time...|$|E
