25|$|The simple {{structure}} of polynomial functions makes them quite useful in analyzing general functions using polynomial approximations. An important example in calculus is Taylor's theorem, which roughly states that every differentiable function locally {{looks like a}} <b>polynomial</b> <b>function,</b> and the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, which states that every continuous function defined on a compact interval of the real axis can be approximated on the whole interval as closely as desired by a <b>polynomial</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe authors’ {{previous}} {{results on}} the arity gap of functions of several variables are refined by considering <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions</b> over arbitrary fields. We explicitly describe the <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions</b> with arity gap at least 3, {{as well as the}} <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions</b> with arity gap equal to 2 for fields ofcharacteristic 0 or 2. These descriptions are given in the form of decomposition schemes of <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions.</b> Similar descriptions are givenfor arbitrary finite fields. However, we show that these descriptions do not extend to infinite fields of odd characteristic...|$|R
30|$|In many problems, {{utilizing}} <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions</b> {{can assist}} us in finding reasonable solutions. For example, in physics, engineering, and economics, {{we can find}} many computational methods applying <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions.</b> A list of <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions</b> and their applications {{can be found in}} [2]. In recent years, a great number of new families of polynomials are introduced, including q-analogue of Hermite polynomials [6], d-orthogonal polynomials by Cheikha and Romdhane [5], unified family of generalized Apostol-Bernoulli, and Euler and Genocchi polynomials by El-Desouky and Gomaa [7].|$|R

25|$|A {{polynomial}} is {{an expression}} that {{is the sum of}} a finite number of non-zero terms, each term consisting of the product of a constant and a finite number of variables raised to whole number powers. For example, x2 + 2x − 3 is a polynomial in the single variable x. A polynomial expression {{is an expression}} that may be rewritten as a polynomial, by using commutativity, associativity and distributivity of addition and multiplication. For example, (x − 1)(x + 3) is a polynomial expression, that, properly speaking, is not a polynomial. A <b>polynomial</b> <b>function</b> is a function that is defined by a polynomial, or, equivalently, by a polynomial expression. The two preceding examples define the same <b>polynomial</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
25|$|A non {{constant}} <b>polynomial</b> <b>function</b> {{tends to}} infinity when the variable increases indefinitely (in absolute value). If the degree {{is higher than}} one, the graph {{does not have any}} asymptote. It has two parabolic branches with vertical direction (one branch for positive x and one for negative x).|$|E
25|$|Since regular {{functions}} on V {{come from}} regular functions on An, {{there is a}} relationship between the coordinate rings. Specifically, if a regular function on V is the restriction of two functions f and g in k, then f'g is a <b>polynomial</b> <b>function</b> which is null on V and thus belongs to I(V). Thus k may be identified with k/I(V).|$|E

5000|$|Computing {{roots of}} <b>functions,</b> for example <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions,</b> {{frequently}} requires {{the use of}} specialised or approximation techniques (for example, Newton's method). However, some <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions,</b> including all those of degree no greater than 4, can have all their roots expressed algebraically in terms of their coefficients. (See algebraic solution.) ...|$|R
25|$|Over {{the field}} of real numbers, the set of {{singular}} n-by-n matrices, considered as a subset of Rn'n, is a null set, i.e., has Lebesgue measure zero. This is true because singular matrices are {{the roots of the}} <b>polynomial</b> <b>function</b> in the entries of the matrix given by the determinant. Thus in the language of measure theory, almost all n-by-n matrices are invertible.|$|E
25|$|Now {{suppose that}} a given problem in NP can be solved by the nondeterministic Turing machine M=(Q,Σ,s,F,δ), where Q is the set of states, Σ is the {{alphabet}} of tape symbols, s∈Q is the initial state, F⊆Q is the set of accepting states, and δ⊆((Q\F)×Σ)×(Q×Σ×{−1,+1}) is the transition relation. Suppose further that M accepts or rejects an instance {{of the problem in}} time p(n) where n is the size of the instance and p is a <b>polynomial</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
25|$|Odd cycle {{transversal}} is an NP-complete algorithmic {{problem that}} asks, given a graphG=(V,E) and a numberk, whether {{there exists a}} set ofk vertices whose removal fromG would cause the resulting graph to be bipartite. The problem is fixed-parameter tractable, meaning {{that there is an}} algorithm whose running time can be bounded by a <b>polynomial</b> <b>function</b> {{of the size of the}} graph multiplied by a larger function of k. More specifically, the time for this algorithm is O(3k'mn), although this was not stated in that paper.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} FORTRAN subroutines {{that can}} perform mathematical operations involving <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions</b> both in symbolic and in exact numerical modes. These subroutines {{may be used}} to perform operations including addition, multiplication, differentiation and integration of <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions.</b> An illustrative example performing various mathematical operations on polynomials has been demonstrated using these subroutines and the results obtained {{have been found to be}} highly accurate. The subroutines should be useful to analysts who require exact (or high precision) solutions to problems having a large number of mathematical operations of <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions,</b> such as in analyses of beam-column and plate structures...|$|R
25|$|Every {{rational}} function in one variable x, with real coefficients, {{can be written}} as the sum of a <b>polynomial</b> <b>function</b> with {{rational function}}s of the form a/(xnbsp&−nbsp&b)n (where n is a natural number, and a and b are real numbers), and rational functions of the form (axnbsp&+nbsp&b)/(x2nbsp&+nbsp&cxnbsp&+nbsp&d)n (where n is a natural number, and a, b, c, and d are real numbers such that c2nbsp&−nbsp&4dnbsp&<nbsp&0). A corollary {{of this is that}} every rational function in one variable and real coefficients has an elementary primitive.|$|E
25|$|Like B-splines, NURBS {{control points}} {{determine}} {{the shape of}} the curve. Each point of the curve is computed by taking a weighted sum of a number of control points. The weight of each point varies according to the governing parameter. For a curve of degree d, the influence of any control point is only nonzero in d+1 intervals (knot spans) of the parameter space. Within those intervals, the weight changes according to a <b>polynomial</b> <b>function</b> (basis functions) of degree d. At the boundaries of the intervals, the basis functions go smoothly to zero, the smoothness being determined by the degree of the polynomial.|$|E
500|$|Cauer in Germany {{grasped the}} {{importance}} of Foster's work and used it {{as the foundation of}} network synthesis. [...] Amongst Cauer's many innovations was the extension of Foster's work to all 2-element-kind networks after discovering an isomorphism between them. [...] Cauer was interested in finding the necessary and sufficient condition for realisability of a rational one-port network from its <b>polynomial</b> <b>function,</b> a condition now known to be a positive-real function, and the reverse problem of which networks were equivalent, that is, had the same <b>polynomial</b> <b>function.</b> [...] Both of these were important problems in network theory and filter design.

Three different response surface models {{are used in}} the optimization process: <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions,</b> radial basis neural networks (RBNN) and RBNN-enhanced polynomial-based response surfaces. The three approaches produce different results and the combination of RBNN and <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions</b> in the last approach is found to be the best as it enables construction of high order <b>polynomial</b> <b>functions</b> and the model's fit with the data is the best.

500|$|On {{the real}} line, every <b>polynomial</b> <b>function</b> is {{infinitely}} differentiable.

The vector space [...] may or may not possess an eigenbasis, a basis consisting of eigenvectors. This phenomenon is governed by the Jordan canonical form of the map. The set of all eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of [...] forms a vector space known as the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue (and [...] ) in question.
