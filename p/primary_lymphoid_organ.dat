50|$|TdT is {{expressed}} {{mostly in the}} <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs,</b> like the thymus and bone marrow. Regulation of its expression occurs via multiple pathways. These include protein-protein interactions, like those with TdIF1. TdIF1 is another protein that interacts with TdT to inhibit its function by masking the DNA binding region of the TdT polymerase. The regulation of TdT expression also exists at the transcriptional level, with regulation influenced by stage-specific factors, and occurs in a developmentally restrictive manner. Although expression is typically found {{to be in the}} <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs,</b> recent work has suggested that stimulation via antigen can result in secondary TdT expression along with other enzymes needed for gene rearrangement outside of the thymus for T-cells.|$|R

Ultimately, the T-cells differentiate and mature to become either T helper cells or T cytotoxic cells.

50|$|The red {{bone marrow}} {{is a key}} element of the lymphatic system, being one of the <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> that {{generate}} lymphocytes from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells.

50|$|B and T {{lymphocytes}} {{are tested}} for their affinity for self MHC/peptide complexes {{before leaving the}} <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> and entering into the periphery. If they demonstrate high affinity for self-antigen, one method of preventing autoimmunity is through clonal deletion. This is where the lymphocyte would receive apoptotic signals from antigen-presenting cell (APCs). It {{is important to note}} that not all lymphocytes expressing high affinity for self-antigen undergo clonal deletion. B lymphocytes can also participate in light chain receptor editing, VH gene replacement, or be released and later undergo negative selection in the periphery. T lymphocytes can instead undergo clonal arrest, clonal anergy, and clonal editing. If autoreactive cells escape clonal deletion in either the thymus or the bone marrow, there are mechanisms in the periphery involving T regulatory cells to prevent the host from obtaining an autoimmune disease. However, for both B and T cells in the <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs,</b> clonal deletion is the most common form of negative selection.|$|R

50|$|The initial {{diversification}} processes (somatic V(D)J recombination or {{gene conversion}} and nucleotide addition) {{occur in the}} <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organ</b> (thymus) and lead to very high diversity (> 1014) of TCRs, which are able to recognize almost any antigenic structure/sequence. The paradigm of adaptive immunity is that a single T cell is educated only in thymus and {{at the exit from}} thymus it can express only a single TCR with unique and definitive antigen specificity which cannot be modified. It is not correct since dual receptor T cells do exist in the periphery and the single receptor T cells can modify its specificity or regain a second TCR there. Those T cells recognizing self-structures (peptide/MHC complexes) are eliminated in the thymus immediately in a process of central tolerance, however it is not 100% effective again. As a result, there are many self-reactive T cells emigrating from thymus to the periphery and performing their effector functions there, including cytototoxic and helper activities, finally leading to autoimmunity. Peripheral tolerance is a mechanism controlling such autoreactive T cells in secondary lymphoid organs, blood circulation and all non-lymphoid tissues by different means. TCR revision process is generating much higher T cell plasticity {{in the development of the}} adaptive immune system than we have previously anticipated.|$|E

40|$|The {{immunosuppressive}} effect of chronic glucocorticoid treatment on 2 [125 I]iodomelatonin binding in the duck thymus was studied. Two-week-old ducks were injected intraperitoneally with either 1 mg of cortisol per day (experimental group) or an equivalent volume of vehicle (control group) {{in the middle}} of the light period for 7 days. 2 [125 I]Iodomelatonin binding assays were performed on thymic membranes. Cortisol injection reduced the body weight gain, size of the bursa of Fabricius and absolute weights of the <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> but had no effect on the spleen weights. The relative weights of the spleen were increased while those of the <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> were unchanged. The density of the thymus 2 [125 I]iodomelatonin binding sites was decreased while the affinity was not affected. The modulation of the thymic 2 [125 I]iodomelatonin binding sites by changes in the immune status of the duck suggests that these binding sites represent physiologically relevant melatonin receptors and that melatonin exerts its action on the lymphoid tissues directly. Our findings support the hypothesis that the thymus is the target site for the immunomodulatory interactions between the pineal melatonin and the adrenal steroids.

40|$|Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) {{infection}} {{is the cause}} of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). It has been speculated whether cell types permissive of replication are found in the primary lymphoid organs and whether infection of these tissues has {{an important role in the}} pathogenesis of PMWS. The aim of this study was to determine if <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organ</b> cells support viral replication during PCV 2 infection. This was done by histopathological examination of thymus and bone marrow from pigs experimentally inoculated with PCV 2 (n = 24), mock-infected pigs (n = 12), pigs naturally affected by PMWS (n = 33), and age-matched healthy control animals (n = 29). In situ hybridization (ISH) techniques were used to detect PCV 2 nucleic acid irrespective of replicative status (complementary probe, CP) or to detect only the replicative form of the virus (replicative form probe, RFP). PCV 2 was not detected in the experimentally PCV 2 -inoculated pigs or the control animals. Among the PMWS-affected pigs, 19 of 20 (95 %) thymuses were positive for PCV 2 by CP ISH, and 7 of 19 (37 %) of these also supported viral replication. By CP ISH, PCV 2 was detected in 16 of 33 (48 %) bone marrow samples, and 5 of 16 (31 %) of these also supported replication. The 2 ISH probes labeled the same cell types, which were histiocytes in both organs and lymphocytes in thymus. The RFP labeled fewer cells than the CP.

25|$|The {{generation}} of TCR diversity {{is similar to}} that for antibodies and B cell antigen receptors. It arises mainly from genetic recombination of the DNA encoded segments in individual somatic T cells by somatic V(D)J recombination using RAG1 and RAG2 recombinases. Unlike immunoglobulins, however, TCR genes do not undergo somatic hypermutation, and T cells do not express Activation-Induced (Cytidine) Deaminase (AID). The recombination process that creates diversity in BCR (antibodies) and TCR is unique to lymphocytes (T and B cells) during the early stages of their development in <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells).|$|R

In recent years, thymus-stimulatory, thymus-regenerative, and thymus-protective strategies have been developed to enhance and repair thymus function in the elderly and in individuals undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These strategies include the use of sex steroid ablation, the administration of growth and differentiation factors, the inhibition of p 53, and the transfer of T cell progenitors to alleviate the effects of thymus dysfunction and consequent T cell deficiency...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{role of the}} neuroendocrine {{system in}} {{influencing}} both immune development and function has become an area of active research within many model systems, including the chicken. It {{is now clear that}} the neuroendocrine system can exert immediate feedback regulation on the im-mune system as well as control specific aspects of immune differentiation and development. The <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> of avian species (i. e., the thymus and the bursa of Fabricius) are also known to function as endocrine organs. These produce hormonal products that influence the development of lymphoid cells and that may feed back on the neuroendocrine system. In conjunction with the endocrine activities of the <b>primary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs,</b> immune and accessory cells are known to produce a variety of secreted products or cytokines that have the potential not only for the regulation of immune function but also for mediating neuroendocrine activities. Finally, it has been demonstrated in a variety of species that leukocytes are capable of producing endocrine mediators previously believed to be produced only under the direct control of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Thus, there are numerous possibilities for bidirec-tional interactions between the immune and neuroendocrine systems. This discussion focuses primarily on these interactions with an emphasis on the means by which the hormonal mediators, growth hormone and thyroid hormone, may affect the thymus and the thymic microenvironment. The role of the adrenocorticoids and gonadal steroids in regulating immune function and their involvement in immune feedback circuits are also discussed.
