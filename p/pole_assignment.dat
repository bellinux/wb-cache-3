40|$|A robust output {{feedback}} <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> method, {{which seeks}} to achieve a robust solution {{in the sense that}} the assigned poles are as insensitive as possible to perturbations in the system parameters, is studied. In particular, this work is concerned with <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> in a specified region rather than assignment to exact positions, whereby the freedom to obtain a robust solution may be realized. The robust output feedback <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> problem is formulated as an optimization problem with a special structure in matrix form. Efficient optimization methods and numerical algorithms for solving such a problem are proposed by introducing a concept of the derivative of a matrix valued function. The homotopy method, which is known as a globally convergent method, is applied to solve the robust output feedback <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> problem to overcome possible difficulties with the choice of feasible starting point. A new algorithm based on the homotopy approach for solving the <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> problem is proposed. Numerical examples of the robust <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> problem demonstrate how the homotopy algorithm globally converges to optimal solutions regardless of initial starting points with an appropriately defined homotopy mapping. The proposed algorithms are illustrated using an aircraft case study. It is seen that the controllers obtained using robust <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> methods yield the robust flight control and maintain the closed-loop system properties closer to the nominal ones. They are shown to be more robust than those obtained by an alternative direct <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> method which is frequently used to develop aircraft control strategies without attempting to optimize any robustness criterion. Indeed, the robust output feedback <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> method proposed in this study is a method which can be applied for control system design to achieve one important design objective, robustness...|$|E

Using {{the principle of}} <b>poles</b> <b>assignment</b> method, the switching function is designed to guarantee Anti-synchronization of slide mode with nonlinearity terms. Using modified exponent hitting condition of sliding mode, a robust synchronization controller is proposed.

Therefore the computation is simple and the conservation is smaller. Finally, the simulation is put forward to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed methods...|$|R

The controller has the PID structure, with dual rate sampling, {{which means that}} the sampling rate for the PID controller is significantly higher than the sampling rate in the parameter estimator. The controller differs from conventional parametric adaptive controllers because it is based on estimation of transfer function properties. For normal industrial process control the adaptive controller can be used without any prior information about the process dynamics, such as sampling period, closed loop <b>pole</b> <b>assignments</b> etc. This is achieved by using a relay auto-tuner to initialize the controller.

The aim is to generate residual signals which, in the fault-free case, {{are supposed to be}} identical to zero.

In this work, the communication delays are described as a random Markov jump process and a fault isolation filter is developed.

40|$|The <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> {{problem has}} been subject for {{research}} for a long time. For single-input single-output systems this problem is well understood but for multi-input multi-output systems the <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> problem is more complex. In this thesis a parameterization of state feedback gains for <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> is characterized with respect to completeness, redundancy and existence. In {{order to make a}} systematic examination of this parameterization a number of classes are introduced. This parameterization depends on two matrices that can be regarded as design parameters. In the thesis it is shown how the degree of freedom in the <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> problem for multi-input systems is characterized by these two matrices. It turns out that the properties of the parameterization depends on whether the characteristic polynomials of the open and the closed loop systems are coprime or not. It is shown in the thesis that if the characteristic polynomials are coprime, every possible feedback gain can be parameterized in this way, and in this sense the parameterization is complete. If the characteristic polynomials have factors in common the parameterization is not complete. In the thesis the shortcomings of the parameterization for this case are characterized. The design parameters seem to offer a greater degree of freedom than what can be offered in the <b>pole</b> <b>assignment</b> problem. This indicates a certain degree of overparameterization. This redundancy in the design parameters is characterized in the thesis. The parameterization implies that a certain matrix is invertible. Necessary conditions for when this matrix is invertible are given in terms of the two design parameters. It is shown that this matrix is invertible for almost every value of the design parameters when the characteristic polynomials are coprime, and hence that the parameterized gains are generally applicable.
