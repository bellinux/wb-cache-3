The conquest of the Western Xia alarmed Tibetan rulers, who decided to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> to the Mongols. However, when they ceased to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> after Genghis Khan's death, his successor Ögedei Khan (r.1229–1241) launched an invasion into Tibet.|$|E

5|$|Pericles {{wanted to}} {{stabilize}} Athens' dominance over its alliance and {{to enforce its}} pre-eminence in Greece. The {{process by which the}} Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is generally considered to have begun well before Pericles' time, as various allies in the league chose to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> to Athens instead of manning ships for the league's fleet, but the transformation was speeded and brought to its conclusion by Pericles.|$|E

5|$|The main {{contemporary}} accounts {{relating to}} Krak des Chevaliers are of Muslim origin {{and tend to}} emphasize Muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the Crusaders although they suggest that the Knights Hospitaller forced the settlements of Hama and Homs to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> to the Order. This situation lasted as long as Saladin's successors warred between themselves. The proximity of Krak des Chevaliers to Muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role, acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked. By 1203 the garrison were making raids on Montferrand (which was under Muslim control) and Hama, and in 1207 and 1208 the castle's soldiers took part in an attack on Homs. Krak des Chevaliers acted {{as a base for}} expeditions to Hama in 1230 and 1233 after the amir refused to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute.</b> The former was unsuccessful, but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of Krak des Chevaliers.|$|E

5|$|The {{outcome of}} a {{successful}} military campaign could vary in {{its impact on the}} defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca. In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> to the victor.|$|E

5|$|Another origin tale {{claims that}} King Solomon {{was given a}} pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad ("the pure") by the Queen of Sheba.

This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.|$|E

5|$|Around 1785BC, as {{the power}} of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, a Western Asian people called the Hyksos had already settled in the Eastern Delta town of Avaris, seized control of Egypt, and forced the central {{government}} to retreat to Thebes. The pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute.</b> The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the composite bow and the horse-drawn chariot.|$|E
5|$|By the 13th century, {{a need to}} formalize {{the border}} between the Novgorod Republic and the Scandinavian {{countries}} became evident. The Novgorodians, along with the Karelians who came from the south, reached the coast of what now is Pechengsky District and the portion of the coast of Varangerfjord near the Voryema River, which now is a part of Norway. The Sami population was forced to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute.</b> The Norwegians, however, were also attempting to take control of these lands, resulting in armed conflicts. In 1251, a conflict between the Karelians, Novgorodians and the servants of the king of Norway led to the establishment of a Novgorodian mission in Norway. Also in 1251, the first treaty with Norway was signed in Novgorod regarding the Sami lands and the system of tribute collections, making the Sami people <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> to both Novgorod and Norway. By the terms of the treaty, Novgorodians could collect tribute from the Sami as far as Lyngen fjord in the west, while Norwegians could collect tribute on the territory of the whole Kola Peninsula except {{in the eastern part of}} Tersky Coast. No state borders were established by the 1251 treaty.|$|E
