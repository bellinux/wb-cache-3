5|$|The {{building}} did {{not last}} very long—damage to the Inn during the Blitz completely destroyed the Library and {{a large part of}} its collection, although the rare manuscripts, which had been moved elsewhere, survived. After the destruction of much of the Inn's collection, George VI donated replacements for many lost texts. A <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> in the Walks was used to hold the surviving books while a new Library was constructed, and the new building (designed by Sir Edward Maufe) was opened in 1958. It is similar in size to the old Holker Library, but is more workmanlike and designed to allow for easy access to the books.|$|E
25|$|The village {{became a}} ghost town, quickly {{taken over by}} the local poor and homeless, while the factory was partly sold-off as {{individual}} units. In the 1930s the work of demolishing the village began, to make way for new council houses. Further redevelopment of the site after World War II removed more traces, including the school, a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> estimated to have a working life of ten years yet in constant use for sixty-three! Now all that is left of the whole project is two blocks that were once the food-store and the butcher’s (both now listed buildings but still under threat of demolition), and several of the original sheds on the factory site – though their future is now in some doubt since BAe moved out in early 2010.|$|E
25|$|Fintona {{has its own}} branch library {{that was}} {{originally}} opened in the early 1980s in a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> in Ecclesville Park before moving to its current location on Main Street in 1991. In early 2011 the library was one of ten marked down by Libraries NI for closure who claimed that the library {{was one of the}} least used in Northern Ireland and that the roof of the building required repair at a significant cost. A public consultation meeting in Fintona Golf Club on 3 March that year saw a strong local turn out of at least 245 people calling for the retention of the library. On 20 October 2011, Libraries NI announced that the Fintona branch library would remain open while efforts were made to either improve its current premises or find an alternative location in due course.|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} {{at the western}} end of the complex, including the control tower, were returned to civilian use. Externally they were rendered and painted in art-deco style, to give a modern appearance. Internally a passenger terminal was fitted out, including a glass-walled observation restaurant facing the apron. As a public relations exercise, space was allocated within the lower tower as a club room for the Ringway Spotters Club. This branch of the Ian Allen-inspired hobby of aircraft spotting later changed its name to Society of Northern Aeronautical Enthusiasts, rapidly becoming known by its initials, SNAE. Members sported an enamel badge similar to the BOAC Bluebird but in red in place of blue. These spotters and the general public were catered for by a large viewing enclosure, adjacent to {{the western end of}} the building. They were provided with a more modest cafe, {{in the form of a}} large single-storey <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building.</b> Near this cafe, a small gate in the chain link fence, which kept the public off the apron, gave access to those wanting to take a pleasure flight. These were provided by Airviews Ltd. who operated an Auster monoplane, and two De Havilland biplanes (a Dragon Rapide and a Fox Moth. Five shillings (now 25p) bought you a flight around Wythenshawe.|$|E
500|$|A {{base camp}} (named [...] "Camp Hunziker" [...] after Richard Overton Hunziker, the USAF general {{in charge of}} the operation) was created at the crash site; it {{included}} a heliport, igloos, generators and communications facilities. A [...] "zero line" [...] delineating the [...] by [...] area in which alpha particle contamination could be measured was established by 25 January, four days after the crash. The line was subsequently used to control decontamination of personnel and vehicles. An ice road was constructed to Thule from the site. This was followed by a second, more direct, road so the ice on the first road was not fatigued by overuse. The camp later included a large <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building,</b> two ski-mounted buildings, several huts, a decontamination trailer and a latrine. These facilities allowed for 24-hour operations at the crash site.|$|E

2500|$|Money {{from the}} weekly {{building}} fund started by Fr Denis Hawkins in 1964 was used both for St Joseph's Church in Milford {{and for the}} construction of a permanent church in Elstead, a village between Godalming and Farnham. [...] Before World War II, a resident of Elstead named Colonel Fitzgerald petitioned Bishop of Southwark Peter Amigo to ask for Mass to be celebrated in the village. [...] Canon Hyland of St Edmund's Church agreed to send a curate, and Fitzgerald himself fitted up the upper storey of a barn to create a temporary chapel. [...] This was used until 1953, when a hall formerly owned by The Royal British Legion was converted into a chapel. [...] This building was dilapidated even then, though, so in 1968 a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> was purchased and became the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption. [...] It was also used as a hall. [...] A shortage of priests in the 1980s meant the church could no longer be served, and the last Mass was said in 1985. [...] The building stood until 1992, when it was demolished and replaced with a detached house.|$|E
