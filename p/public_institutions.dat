40|$|This article {{addresses}} some theoretical considerations on {{risk identification}} and {{analysis for the}} development of a <b>public</b> <b>institution</b> audit program. Starting from the three proposed objectives, the author makes a synthesis of the literature based on the two central concepts of the study: Audit and Risk Management. Here are presented the internal audit organisation mode at a <b>public</b> <b>institution</b> and the stages that are going to identify and analyse the risks in order to draw up the audit program at the <b>public</b> <b>institution</b> and finally highlight the audit program of the <b>public</b> <b>institution.</b> The whole article is sprinkled with figures and tables designed to facilitate the perception of readers and specialists interested in the field of auditing. The article concludes with the author's conclusions regarding the identification and analysis of risks for the preparation of the audit program of a <b>public</b> <b>institution...</b>|$|R

5|$|After a {{successful}} Maltese uprising against French rule, in 1800 Malta became a British protectorate, with the Castellania becoming {{known as the}} Gran Corte della Valletta. It was amongst the first <b>public</b> <b>institutions</b> to be reestablished. In February 1806, Alexander Ball gave instrcutions to presumably guarantee independence of the Judiciary, whereas the Judges could not be removed at a simple request, and legal persons would not be threatened to be jailed if they disagree with signing legal documents.|$|E
5|$|Although not all Jews in Israel keep kosher, the {{tradition}} of kashrut strongly influences the availability of certain foods and their preparation in homes, <b>public</b> <b>institutions</b> and many restaurants, including the separation of milk and meat and avoiding the use of non-kosher foods, especially pork and shellfish. During Passover, bread and other leavened foods are prohibited to observant Jews and matza and leaven-free foods are substituted.|$|E

5|$|Higher {{education}} students normally attend university from age 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree. There are over 90universities in England, {{all but one}} of which are <b>public</b> <b>institutions.</b> The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the government department responsible for higher education in England. Students are generally entitled to student loans {{to cover the cost of}} tuition fees and living costs. The first degree offered to undergraduates is the Bachelor's degree, which usually takes three years to complete. Students are then able to work towards a postgraduate degree, which usually takes one year, or towards a doctorate, which takes three or more years.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} {{following}} PedroII's majority in 1840, however, that the Academy became a powerhouse, {{part of the}} Emperor's greater scheme of fomenting a national culture and consequently uniting all Brazilians in a common sense of nationhood. PedroII would sponsor the Brazilian culture through several <b>public</b> <b>institutions</b> funded by the government (not restricted to the Academy of Fine Arts), such as Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute and Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera. That sponsorship would pave the way {{not only for the}} careers of artists, but also for those engaged in other fields, including historians such as Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen and musicians such as the operatic composer Antônio Carlos Gomes.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{announced}} {{that one of}} the top priorities of his government was to eliminate racism against the country's indigenous population. To do this, he {{announced that}} all civil servants were required to learn one of Bolivia's three indigenous languages, Quechua, Aymara, or Guaraní, within two years. His government encouraged the development of indigenous cultural projects, and sought to encourage more indigenous people to attend university; by 2008, it was estimated that half of the students enrolled in Bolivia's 11 public universities were indigenous, while three indigenous-specific universities had been established, offering subsidized education. In 2009, a Vice Ministry for Decolonization was established, which proceeded to pass the 2010 Law against Racism and Discrimination banning the espousal of racist views in private or <b>public</b> <b>institutions.</b>|$|E
5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that {{there ought to be a}} political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in <b>public</b> <b>institutions</b> creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

5|$|The Privy Council {{formally}} {{advises the}} sovereign on {{the exercise of}} the Royal Prerogative, and corporately (as Queen-in-Council) it issues executive instruments known as Orders in Council, which among other powers enact Acts of Parliament. The Council also holds the delegated authority to issue Orders of Council, mostly used to regulate certain <b>public</b> <b>institutions.</b> The Council advises the sovereign on the issuing of Royal Charters, which are used to grant special status to incorporated bodies, and city or borough status to local authorities. Otherwise, the Privy Council's powers have now been largely replaced by the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.|$|E
