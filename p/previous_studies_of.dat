25|$|French {{had already}} created (1909–1912) a major {{memorial}} statue of Lincoln—this one standing—for the Nebraska State Capitol (Abraham Lincoln, 1912) in Lincoln, Nebraska. His <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> Lincoln—which included biographies, photographs, {{and a life}} mask of Lincoln by Leonard Volk done in 1860—had prepared him for the challenging task of the larger statue. For the national memorial, he and Bacon decided that a large seated figure would be most appropriate. French started with a small clay study and subsequently created several plaster models, each time making subtle changes in the figure's pose or setting. He placed the President not in an ordinary 19th-century seat, but in a classical chair including fasces, a Roman symbol of authority, to convey that the subject was an eminence for all the ages.|$|E

500|$|Eberhardt {{relocated}} to Bône {{with her mother}} in May 1897. They initially lived with David and his wife, who both disapproved {{of the amount of}} time Eberhardt and her mother spent with Arabs. Eberhardt and her mother did not like the Davids' attitude, which was typical of European settlers in the area, and later avoided the country's French residents, renting an Arabic-style house far from the European quarter. Eberhardt, aware that a Muslim woman could go out neither alone nor unveiled, dressed as a man in a burnous and turban. She expanded on her <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> Arabic, and became fluent within a few months. She and her mother converted to Islam. Mackworth writes that while Eberhardt was a [...] "natural mystic", her conversion appeared to be largely for practical reasons, as it gave her greater acceptance among the Arabs. Eberhardt found it easy to accept Islam; Trophimowsky had brought her up as a fatalist and Islam gave her fatalism a meaning. She embraced the Islamic concept that everything is predestined and the will of God. Although Eberhardt largely devoted herself to the Muslim way of life, she frequently partook of marijuana and alcohol and had many lovers. According to a friend, Eberhardt [...] "drank more than a Legionnaire, smoked more kief than a hashish addict and made love for the love of making love". She was considered heterosexual, though approached sexual intercourse with a traditionally masculine attitude, often treating it as impersonal. The reason for her Arabic companions' tolerance of her lifestyle has been debated by biographers. According to Mackworth, the [...] "delicate courtesy of the Arabs" [...] led them to treat Eberhardt as a man because she wished to live as one. Eberhardt's behaviour made her an outcast with the French settlers and the colonial administration, who watched her closely. Seeing no reason as to why a woman would choose the company of impoverished Arabs over her fellow Europeans, they eventually concluded she must be an English agent, sent to stir up resentment towards the French.|$|E

2500|$|Psychologist Robert L. Smith {{states that}} {{some studies have}} {{reported}} [...] "unusually high rates of conception following rape". He cites a paper by C.A.

Smith also cites veterinary scientist Wolfgang Jöchle, who [...] "proposed that rape may induce ovulation in human females". Literary scholar Jonathan Gottschall and economist Tiffani Gottschall argued in a 2003 Human Nature article that <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> rape-pregnancy statistics were not directly comparable to pregnancy rates from consensual intercourse, because the comparisons were largely uncorrected for such factors {{as the use of}} contraception.

2500|$|ABC {{can be used}} {{to infer}} {{problems}} in high-dimensional parameter spaces, although one should account for the possibility of overfitting (e.g., see the model selection methods in [...] and [...] ). However, the probability of accepting the simulated values for the parameters under a given tolerance with the ABC rejection algorithm typically decreases exponentially with increasing dimensionality of the parameter space (due to the global acceptance criterion). Although no computational method (based on ABC or not) seems to be able to break the curse-of-dimensionality, methods have recently been developed to handle high-dimensional parameter spaces under certain assumptions (e.g., based on polynomial approximation on sparse grids, which could potentially heavily reduce the simulation times for ABC). However, the applicability of such methods is problem dependent, and the difficulty of exploring parameter spaces should in general not be underestimated. For example, the introduction of deterministic global parameter estimation led to reports that the global optima obtained in several <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> low-dimensional problems were incorrect. For certain problems, it might therefore be difficult to know whether the model is incorrect or, as discussed above, whether the explored region of the parameter space is inappropriate. A more pragmatic approach is to cut the scope of the problem through model reduction.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study by}} Haber et al. (2013) noted that while <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> the Levant, which had focused mainly on {{diaspora}} Jewish populations, {{showed that the}} [...] "Jews form a distinctive cluster in the Middle East", these studies did not make clear [...] "whether the factors driving this structure would also involve other groups in the Levant". The authors found strong evidence that modern Levant populations descend from two major apparent ancestral populations. One set of genetic characteristics which is shared with modern-day Europeans and Central Asians is most prominent in the Levant among [...] "Lebanese, Armenians, Cypriots, Druze and Jews, as well as Turks, Iranians and Caucasian populations". The second set of inherited genetic characteristics is shared with populations {{in other parts of}} the Middle East as well as some African populations. Levant populations in this category today include [...] "Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians, as well as North Africans, Ethiopians, Saudis, and Bedouins". Concerning this second component of ancestry, the authors remark that while it correlates with [...] "the pattern of the Islamic expansion", and that [...] "a pre-Islamic expansion Levant was more genetically similar to Europeans than to Middle Easterners," [...] they also say that [...] "its presence in Lebanese Christians, Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews, Cypriots and Armenians might suggest that its spread to the Levant could also represent an earlier event". The authors also found a strong correlation between religion and apparent ancestry in the Levant: [...] "all Jews (Sephardi and Ashkenazi) cluster in one branch; Druze from Mount Lebanon and Druze from Mount Carmel are depicted on a private branch; and Lebanese Christians form a private branch with the Christian populations of Armenia and Cyprus placing the Lebanese Muslims as an outer group. The predominantly Muslim populations of Syrians, Palestinians and Jordanians cluster on branches with other Muslim populations as distant as Morocco and Yemen." ...|$|E
