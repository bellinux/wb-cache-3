40|$|<b>Phased</b> <b>array</b> <b>antennas</b> {{long were}} {{investigated}} {{to support the}} agile, multibeam radiating apertures with rapid reconfigurability needs of radar and communications. With {{the development of the}} Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC), <b>phased</b> <b>array</b> <b>antennas</b> having the stated characteristics are becoming realizable. However, at K-band frequencies (20 to 40 GHz) and higher, the problem of controlling the MMICs using conventional techniques either severely limits the array size or becomes insurmountable due to the close spacing of the radiating elements necessary to achieve the desired antenna performance. Investigations were made that indicate using fiber optics as a transmission line for control information for the MMICs provides a potential solution. By adding an optical interface circuit to pre-existing MMIC designs, it is possible {{to take advantage of the}} small size, lightweight, mechanical flexibility and RFI/EMI resistant characteristics of fiber optics to distribute MMIC control signals.
