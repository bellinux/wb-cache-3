[...] This autochthonous process involves the combination of carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy to produce carbohydrates and dissolved oxygen. [...] Within a lake or pond, the potential rate of photosynthesis generally decreases with depth due to light attenuation. [...] Photosynthesis, however, is often low at the top few millimeters of the surface, likely due to inhibition by ultraviolet light. [...] The exact depth and <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rate</b> measurements of this curve are system specific and depend upon: 1) the total biomass of photosynthesizing cells, 2) the amount of light attenuating materials and 3) the abundance and frequency range of light absorbing pigments (i.e. chlorophylls) inside of photosynthesizing cells.

40|$|The {{interactive}} effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 and temperature on seasonal patterns of photosynthesis in Douglas fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings were examined. Seedlings were grown in sunlit chambers controlled to track either ambient (~ 400 p. p. m.) CO 2 or ambient + 200 p. p. m. CO 2, and either ambient temperature or ambient + 4 °C. Light-saturated net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> were measured approximately monthly over a 21 month period. Elevated CO 2 increased net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> {{by an average}} of 21 % across temperature treatments during both the 1996 hydrologic year, the third year of exposure, and the 1997 hydrologic year. Elevated mean annual temperature increased net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> {{by an average of}} 33 % across CO 2 treatments during both years. Seasonal temperature changes also affected net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates.</b> Across treatments, net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> were highest in the spring and autumn, and lowest in July, August and December–January. Seasonal increases in temperature were not correlated with increases in the relative photosynthetic response to elevated CO 2. Seasonal shifts in the photosynthetic temperature optimum reduced temperature effects on the relative response to elevated CO 2. These results suggest that the effects of elevated CO 2 on net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> in Douglas fir are largely independent of temperature...|$|R

Ag. {{collected from the}} Mgeni Estuary mangrove swamp, were studied. Both species are intertidal and common on Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. pneumatophores. Maximum <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> of B. radicans were evident between 25 % and 58 % desiccation. Respiratory rates were constant up to 58 % desiccation and decreased thereafter. C. leprieurii showed highest <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> under submerged conditions, whilst respiratory rates were highest under saturated conditions. Both species showed increases in <b>photosynthetic</b> {{and respiratory}} <b>rates</b> with increase in temperature. <b>Photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> peaked at 32 °C to 37 °C, whilst respiratory rates peaked at 37 °C. With increases in light intensity, maximum <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> of C. leprieurii and B. radicans occurred at 140 to 225 μE m− 2 s− 1 and 225 to 550 μE m− 2 s− 1 respectively.

40|$|Algal size {{can affect}} the rate of {{metabolism}} and of growth. Different sized colonies of Nostoc sphaeroides were used {{with the aim of}} determining the effects of colony size on photosynthetic physiology and growth. Small colonies showed higher maximum <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> per unit chlorophyll, higher light saturation point, and higher photosynthetic efficiency (a) than large colonies. Furthermore, small colonies had a higher affinity for DIC and higher DIC-saturated <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates.</b> In addition, small colonies showed higher <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> from 5 - 45 degreesC than large colonies. There was a greater decrease in Fv/Fm after exposure to high irradiance and less recovery in darkness for large colonies than for small colonies. Relative growth rate decreased with increasing colony size. Small colonies had less chl a and mass per unit surface area.

Light-saturated stomatal resistances {{did not differ in}} leaves of similar age and exposure on field and chamber plants; lower <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> in chamber leaves were associated with greater mesophyll resistance. Differences in net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> were related to differences in leaf thickness. When the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> were expressed per unit of mesophyll volume or per unit chlorophyll differences between field and chamber plants were much less than when rates were expressed per unit leaf area. Characterization of the chloroplast lamellar proteins showed that the field leaves had smaller photosynthetic units than the chamber leaves.

40|$|Seaweeds {{that lack}} carbon-concentrating {{mechanisms}} are potentially inorganic carbon-limited under current air equilibrium conditions. To estimate effects of increased atmo-spheric carbon dioxide concentration and ocean acidification on <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates,</b> we modeled rates of photosynthesis {{in response to}} pCO 2, temperature, and their interaction under limiting and saturating photon flux densities. We synthesized the available data for photosynthetic responses of red seaweeds lacking carbon-concentrating mechanisms to light and temperature. The model was parameterized with published data and known car-bonate system dynamics. The model predicts that direction and magnitude of response to pCO 2 and temperature, depend on photon flux density. At sub-saturating light intensities, <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> are predicted to be low and respond positively to increasing pCO 2, and negatively to increasing temperature. Consequently, pCO 2 and temperature are predicted to interact antagonistically to influence <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> at low PFD.

40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} {{photosynthesis}} of apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh.) were monitored {{to examine the}} effect of source-sink interactions on photosynthesis and photorespiration. Elevated <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> were observed during two periods of the growing season and correlated with the fruiting process. The first period of increased <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> was during the bloom period, when spur leaves on flowering shoots exhibited up to 25 % higher <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> than vegetative spur leaves on a leaf area basis. CO 2 assimilation rates were also higher in fruiting trees than nonfruiting trees during the period of rapid fruit growth from July to September. Photorespiration, dark respiration, leaf resistance, and transpiration exhibited no seasonal changes which correlated to {{the presence or absence of}} fruit.

40|$|Sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas L. (Lam.) ] {{has been}} {{selected}} by NASA as a potential food for long-term space missions. In previous experiments, sweetpotato plants grown hydroponically under elevated levels of CO 2 depleted the nitrogen in the nutrient solution between the hi-weekly solution replacements. In this experiment, the effect of enhanced nutrient replenishment on <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> of sweetpotato was determined. CO 2 response curves were determined for "TU- 82 - 155 " and "Georgia-Jet" sweetpotatoes grown hydroponically in growth chambers at three different CO 2 concentrations (400, 750, and 1000 micro-mol/mol CO 2). Gas exchange measurements were made using infrared gas analysis, an open-flow gas exchange system, and a controlled-climate cuvette. Photosynthetic measurements were made at CO 2 concentrations from 50 - 1000 micro-mol/mol CO 2. Net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> showed an increase with increasing measurement CO 2 in all nutrient regimes, but the response of <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> to the growth CO 2 conditions varied among the experiments and between the two varieties. Enhanced mineral nutrition led to increased net <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> in "Georgia Jet" plants, but not in "TU- 82 - 155 " plants.

50|$|An {{increase}} in <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rate</b> in undamaged tissues is commonly {{cited as a}} mechanism for plants to achieve tolerance (Trumble et al. 1993; Strauss and Agrawal 1999). This is possible since leaves often function at below their maximum capacity (Trumble et al. 1993). Several different pathways may lead to increases in photosynthesis, including higher levels of the Rubisco enzyme and delays in leaf senescence (Stowe et al. 2000). However, detecting an {{increase in}} photosynthesis does not mean plants are tolerant to damage. The resources gained from these mechanisms {{can be used to}} increase resistance instead of tolerance, such as for the production secondary compounds in the plant (Tiffin 2000). Also, whether the increase in <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rate</b> is able to compensate for the damage is still not well studied (Trumble et al. 1993; Stowe et al. 2000).|$|E

C., revealed optimal chlorophyll a-normalized <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> and resistance to photoinhibition at surface photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intensities. At saturating PAR levels these populations exhibited higher <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> in quartz than in Pyrex vessels. Eucaryotic algal populations obtained from the same river failed to counteract photoinhibition. At saturating PAR levels, such populations generally yielded lower <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> in quartz containers {{than they did in}} Pyrex containers. Cultivation of natural Microcystis populations under laboratory conditions led to physiologically distinct populations which had photoinhibitory characteristics similar to those of other cultured cyanobacterial and eucaryotic algae. Our findings indicate that (i) photosynthetic production among natural surface populations is best characterized and quantified in quartz rather than Pyrex incubation vessels; (ii) extrapolation of natural photoinhibitory trends from laboratory populations is highly subjective to culture and PAR histories and may yield contradictory results; and (iii) buoyant surface-dwelling populations, rather than exhibiting senescence, are poised at optimizing PAR utilization, thereby maintaining numerical dominance in eutrophic waters when physico-chemical conditions favor bloom formation...|$|R

50|$|An {{integrated}} fluorometer is {{a system}} that measures the light reaction and the dark reaction of photosynthesis. Software allows combined operation of gas exchange measurement and chlorophyll fluorescence measurement of a leaf. These parameters are used to non-destructively measure the photosynthetic efficiency of plants. The use of an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer provides the opportunity to measure additional measuring parameters that allow for a more exact measurement of photosynthesis than with gas exchange alone. Advanced gas exchange instrumentation, by itself, is capable of measuring A/Ci curves, commonly used for plant characterization. “A” is the term for <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rate</b> (rate of CO2 exchange in the leaf chamber), and Ci is Sub-stomatal CO2 concentration or intracellular CO2 level within the leaf. When measured over a range of CO2 levels above and below ambient conditions, A/Ci curves become possible. With the addition of an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer, it becomes possible to measure more accurate A/CC curves, or <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rate</b> at the site of carboxylation in chloroplasts. The integrated fluorometer allows measurement of mesophyll conductance, or the opposite of the resistance to CO2 transfer from intracellular air spaces to the site of carboxylation in chloroplasts. Various integrated chlorophyll fluorometer measuring protocols, such as the Laisk Protocol, the Kok protocol and the Yin Protocol are used to measure or estimate gm or mesophyll conductance. For example: the Laisk protocol allows the measurement of Γ* or compensation point, and Rd or respiration in the dark. Both values are required to calculate gm or mesophyll conductance and CC or CO2 at the site of carboxylation. Parameters typically measured by the gas exchange portion of the system include: “A” or <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rate,</b> “gs” or stomatal conductance, “Ci” or sub stomatal CO2 concentration, and “E” or transpiration.|$|E

Seven F 1 hybrids and three parental varieties of Oriental tobaccos were evaluated for the characteristics of <b>photosynthetic</b> and transpiration <b>rates,</b> esterase isozymes, resistance to black shank, quality and product potential from the 1996 - 1998 growing seasons. Tobacco leaves had higher <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>rates</b> and many differences among genotypes in the early stage of plant vigorous growth compared with more mature leaves. However, transpiration rates were lower in the younger leaves and greater in the more mature leaves. All the entries had four common bands (B 1, B 3, B 4 and B 6) of the esterase isoenzymes.
