40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} of current issues relating to rollover safety and associated literature. It also describes the research program currently underway in Australia investigating rollover crashes. Preliminary data from investigating US NASS online data and some Australian data is revealing the highly fatal nature of rollovers caused by the consistent violation of basic crashworthy design principles when considering occupant protection in rollover crashes. The <b>paper</b> confirms that <b>ejection</b> and roof intrusion are again linked to a higher proportion of MAIS 3 + injuries suggesting that manufacturers have yet to fully address these areas in modern vehicle design related to rollover crashes...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} active galaxies with {{significant}} alignments of quasars are being observed. It {{is the purpose}} of this <b>paper</b> to explore <b>ejection</b> dynamics of these quasars using the variable mass hypothesis (VMH) originally discussed by Narlikar and Das in 1980. According to the VMH quasars are ejected from parent galaxies initially with zero rest mass which grows through a Machian interaction. The intrinsic redshift of the quasar steadily decreases as its mass grows, but always remains in excess of the redshift of the galaxy. The ultimate aim of this hypothesis is to quantitatively relate the observed ordering of redshifts of ejected quasars, with separation from the galaxy, their intrinsic redshifts and the age of the evolutionary stage of the ejecta...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this <b>paper,</b> the flux <b>ejection</b> dynamo in an {{infinitely}} broad convective layer of finite depth is treated in the limit of electrical conductivity, where the convective layer upper surface is open to empty space while the lower surface is closed to the passage of fluid and field. The idealized convective overturning used allows an exact description of the symmetry and distribution of the magnetic field carried with the fluid. The total flux of the mean horizontal field grows linearly with the number of convective cycles. A discussion is given of the boundary conditions to be applied to an astronomical body whose flux ejection dynamo operates at its surface. In the second part, examples are presented which illustrate the consequences of reverse flux ejection from the surface of a convective layer of conducting fluid. Reverse flux ejection generally has the opposite effect of magnetic buoyancy, burying the fields rather than bringing them through the surface. Reverse flux injection at the surface of an alpha-omega dynamo profoundly alters the character of the solutions of dynamo equations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This <b>paper</b> {{introduces}} new <b>ejection</b> chain {{strategies to}} ef-fectively target vehicle routing problems with time window constraints (VRPTW). Ejection chain procedures {{are based on}} the idea of compound moves that allow a variable number of solution components to be modi-fied within any single iteration of a local search algorithm. The yardstick behind such procedures is the underlying reference structure, which is the structure that is used to coordinate the moves that are available for the local search algorithm. The main contribution of the paper is a new reference structure that is particularly suited in order to handle the asymmetric aspects in a VRPTW. The new reference structure is a generalization of the doubly rooted reference structure introduced by Glover, resulting in a new, powerful neighborhood for the VRPTW. We use tabu search for the generation of the ejection chains. On a higher algorithmic level, we study the effect of different meta heuristics to steer the tabu chain ejection process. Computational results confirm that our approach leads to very fast algorithms that can compete with {{the current state of the}} art algorithms for the VRPTW. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEjection chain {{procedures}} {{are based on}} the notion of generating compound sequences of moves, leading from one solution to another, by linked steps in which changes in selected elements cause other elements to be “ejected from” their current state, position or value assignment. This <b>paper</b> introduces new <b>ejection</b> chain strategies designed to generate neighborhoods of compound moves with attractive properties for traveling salesman problems. These procedures derive from the principle of creating a reference structure that coordinates the options for the moves generated. We focus on ejection chain processes related to alternating paths, and introduce three reference structures, of progressively greater scope, that produce both classical and non-standard alternating path trajectories. Theorems and examples show that various rules for exploiting these structures can generate moves not available to customary neighborhood search approaches. We also provide a reference structure that makes it possible to generate a collection of alternating paths that precisely expresses the symmetric difference between two tours. In addition to providing new results related to generalized alternating paths, in directed and undirected graphs, we lay a foundation for achieving a combinatorial leverage effect, where an investment of polynomial effort yields solutions dominating exponential numbers of alternatives. These consequences are explored in a sequel...|$|R
40|$|Many {{sounding}} rocket experiments have {{the requirement to}} be free flying due to their size or the required precision of their measurements which would be falsified by other experiments on-board the same {{sounding rocket}}. This <b>paper</b> outlines the <b>ejection</b> and recovery system that was flown on the sounding rocket REXUS 13 in May 2013 {{as part of the}} StrathSat-R experiment. The ejection system consists of two free flying units (whose dimensions are that of a one unit cube satellite) ejected from the side of an experimental module. The cubes are ejected via compressed springs which are constrained during launch by a stainless steel cable that holds the hatches in place. A pyro cutter is then used to sever the steel cable at apogee in order to release the cubes in free space. During descent, a recovery system consisting of a parachute, a GPS receiver, a Globalstar transmitter and a radio beacon is activated and used to locate the two cubes after impact. The parachute is automatically released at ~ 5 km enabling the GPS receiver to locate the falling cubes and transmit their positions over the Globalstar satellite system and the radio beacon to the ground station. This paper will present the mechanical design of the ejection system and the electronic design and component selection of the recovery system...|$|R
40|$|Comets {{have been}} invoked in {{numerous}} studies as a potentially {{important source of}} dust and gas around stars, but none has studied the thermo-physical evolution, out-gassing rate, and dust ejection of these objects in such stellar systems. We investigate the thermo-physical evolution of comets in exo-planetary systems {{in order to provide}} valuable theoretical data required to interpret observations of gas and dust. We use a quasi 3 D model of cometary nucleus to study the thermo-physical evolution of comets evolving around a single star from 0. 1 to 50 AU, whose homogeneous luminosity varies from 0. 1 to 70 solar luminosities. This <b>paper</b> provides mass <b>ejection,</b> lifetimes, and the rate of dust and water gas mass productions for comets {{as a function of the}} distance to the star and stellar luminosity. Results show significant physical changes to comets at high stellar luminosities. The models are presented in such a manner that they can be readily applied to any planetary system. By considering the examples of the Solar System, Vega and HD 69830, we show that dust grains released from sublimating comets have the potential to create the observed (exo) zodiacal emission. We show that observations can be reproduced by 1 to 2 massive comets or by a large number of comets whose orbits approach close to the star. Our conclusions depend on the stellar luminosity and the uncertain lifetime of the dust grains. We find, as in previous studies, that exozodiacal dust disks can only survive if replenished by a population of typically sized comets renewed from a large and cold reservoir of cometary bodies beyond the water ice line. These comets could reach the inner regions of the planetary system following scattering by a (giant) planet. Comment: 21 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
