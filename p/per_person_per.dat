5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized.

South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>per</b> day, and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern.

Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

40|$|Abstract. According to the International Commission on Trichinellosis {{survey in}} 2004, Romania {{has the most}} cases of {{trichinellosis}} in the world. Epidemiologic data for each county were collected and analyzed from two different time periods: before (1980 – 1989) and after (1990 – 2004) political changes. Data were analyzed separately for Transylvania {{and the rest of}} the Romanian counties. During the past 25 years, 28, 293 human cases of trichinellosis were reported with an incidence of 51. 0 cases <b>per</b> 106 <b>persons</b> <b>per</b> year. An important increase in the incidence was observed from 1980 to 1989 compared with the 1990 – 2004 period. For the entire period, the incidence rate obtained for Transylvanian counties (82. 2 cases <b>per</b> 106 <b>persons</b> <b>per</b> year) was higher than the incidence rate obtained for the other counties (35. 7 cases <b>per</b> 106 <b>persons</b> <b>per</b> year).

25|$|The {{negative}} {{decisions on}} public transport, {{such as the}} removal of the trams and tracks for a bus system considered more modern, and Auckland authorities not pushing for electrification of the rail network (criticised by some as a concession in return for government funding of the Auckland Harbour Bridge) led to a collapse in rider numbers. From a 1954 average level of 290 public transport trips <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>per</b> year (a share of 58% of all motorised trips), patronage decreased rapidly, and in 2009 only 41 trips <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>per</b> year were made. From the record of about 100 million annual passenger trips the numbers fell to about 57 million - a level that fell even further in following decades, notwithstanding Auckland's substantial interim population growth. The level of 57 million annual trips was not reached again until the late 2000s.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{modelisation}} of socio-economic determinants in smallholder farming {{management in}} southwest of Burkina Faso. The study aims at identifying farmer’s decision {{rules and the}} socio-economic determinants of organic resource dynamics. Decision rules study and socio-economic determinants of organic resource dynamics allowed quantification of their impact on these organic resource dynamics. The main results of the investigations reveal that principal decision rules are edicted and managed by local authorities. These decision rules concern collective management {{and access to the}} cultivated land, grazing land, and homestead and to the bush. Farmers have also a diversity of individual rules covering production, consumption, marketing and relations between themselves. Survey of a sample of one hundred farmers selected for their representativity allowed to quantify relations between farm needs and their organic resource use. These relations permitted developing empirical statistical models (needs of land to cultivate, food grains needs, cash needs, fuel wood needs) depending on farming system. Fuel wood needs were established with survey measured data. These needs expressed in kilogramme consumed wood <b>per</b> day <b>per</b> <b>person</b> were established for the dry season (0. 97 kg <b>per</b> <b>person</b> and <b>per</b> day) and for the wet season (1. 36 kg <b>per</b> <b>person</b> and <b>per</b> day). Average fuel wood consumption <b>per</b> <b>person</b> and <b>per</b> day has an exponential decay when the household size increases. When land is available, land need for cultivation mainly depends on labour availability. Food grain needs is constant (180 kg <b>per</b> <b>person</b> and <b>per</b> year). It is the same in both farming systems studied. Money needs depend on cash crop surfaces, livestock’s products and extra agricultural activities of the farmer...|$|R
