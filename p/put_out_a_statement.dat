500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, Newman, Wood and Speyer were obliged to consider the immediate future of concert-giving at the Queen's Hall. They discussed whether the Proms should continue as planned, and agreed to go ahead. However, within months anti-German feeling forced Speyer to leave the country and seek refuge in the U.S., and there was a campaign to ban all German music from concerts. Newman <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> declaring that German music would be played as planned: [...] "The greatest examples of Music and Art are world possessions and unassailable even by the prejudices and passions of the hour".|$|E

[...] When Speyer left Britain, the music publishers Chappell's took on the responsibility for the Queen's Hall and its orchestra. The Proms continued throughout the war years, with fewer major new works than before, although there were nevertheless British premieres of pieces by Bartók, Stravinsky and Debussy. An historian of the Proms, Ateş Orga, wrote, [...] "Concerts often had to be re-timed to coincide with the 'All Clear' between air raids. Falling bombs, shrapnel, anti-aircraft fire and the droning of Zeppelins were ever threatening. But [...] kept things on the go and in the end had a very real part to play in boosting morale." ...|$|E

While others spend time wrapping and shopping, Donohue stays busy sniping." [...] He described the challenge: [...] "It's political correctness run amok. Every day I'm <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> about the latest absurdity ... This time of year, you can just bank on it." ...|$|R
50|$|The band seem to {{have been}} trying {{to make up for the}} many years of missing out on good, quality, live {{material}} <b>put</b> <b>out</b> to the public. Since their seminal No.#1 UK hit album, No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, was released they have struggled match it, as 1988s follow up album, Nö Sleep at All, was not nearly as good in record sales. It would be over a decade until the next live album, Everything Louder Than Everyone Else in 1999, recorded in 1998 in Germany, was released to the public, and it was quickly followed by Live at Brixton Academy in 2003, their 25th anniversary concert from 2000. So this album is <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> that they have always wanted to do good by the fans, but haven't had the label to back them, until signing with Steamhammer.|$|R
5000|$|...Britain, France and Germany <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> joint <b>statement</b> {{in which}} they {{explained}} they had voted for the resolution [...] "because our views on settlements, including east Jerusalem, are clear: they are illegal under international law, an obstacle to peace, and constitute a threat to a two-state solution.

2500|$|On October 7, 2004, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan {{reported}} to the Security Council that Syria had failed to withdraw its forces from Lebanon. [...] Mr. Annan concluded his report saying that [...] "It is time, 14 {{years after the end}} of hostilities and four years after the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, for all parties concerned to set aside the remaining vestiges of the past. The withdrawal of foreign forces and the disbandment and disarmament of militias would, with finality, end that sad chapter of Lebanese history.". On October 19, 2004, following the UN Secretary General's report, the UN Security Council voted unanimously (meaning that it received the backing of Algeria, the only Arab member of the Security Council) to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> calling on Syria to pull its troops out of Lebanon, in accordance with Resolution 1559.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 December 2016, Sharif called Donald Trump {{to congratulate}} on his {{election}} to White House. During the conversation, Trump praised upon Pakistan's {{prime minister and}} its people. The statement released by Sharif's office quoted Trump as terming Sharif as a [...] "terrific guy", adding that Pakistan is a [...] "fantastic country, fantastic place." [...] Trump Tower <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> saying the two sides [...] "had a productive conversation about how the United States and Pakistan will have a strong working relationship in the future." [...] On 3 December 2016, Dawn reported that a consensus US National Defence Authorisation Act for fiscal year 2017 is set {{to be approved by}} the United States Congress which would recognise Pakistan as a key strategic partner and pledges more than $900million in economic and other assistance to the country, but the bill also conditions $450m from this assistance to a certification from the US Defence Secretary that Pakistan is committed to fighting all terrorist groups, including the Haqqani network.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 March 2012 the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} Cuccinelli as Attorney General had no legal {{authority}} {{to demand the}} records from the university. Mann expressed pleasure at the outcome, but stated that [...] "It's sad that so much money and resources had to be wasted on Cuccinelli's witch hunt against me and the University of Virginia, when {{it could have been}} invested, for example, in measures to protect Virginia's coastline from the damaging effects of sea-level rise it is already seeing." [...] The Union of Concerned Scientists applauded the reconfirmation that the demands lacked legal standing, and said that [...] "Academic institutions have the responsibility to protect their faculty's ability to discover new things about our world without fearing harassment. Nobody should expect the rough drafts of their work to be subject to the same level of scrutiny as their published research." [...] The Attorney General's office <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> that [...] "From the beginning, we have said that we were simply trying to review documents that are unquestionably state property {{to determine whether or not}} fraud had been committed. Today, the court effectively held that state agencies do not have to provide state-owned property to state investigators looking into potential fraud involving government funds." ...|$|E
50|$|Every day we {{comment on}} things that aren't formal cases. Part of {{our job is to}} {{identify}} discrimination and to work to address it, but more often it is <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement,</b> having <b>a</b> debate, meeting with people, discussing and understanding the impact. Whenever we comment on what someone has said or done, we comment because we want them to think about the Human Rights Code, and the implications of it, and to think seriously about what they're saying or doing does to other people. I think that's an important and legitimate part of our role... I think that part of freedom of speech is being able to say things and another part of it is being able to be critical of things that are said. I don't view it as a chill. I view it as responsibility.|$|R

2500|$|The story {{found its}} way into the British press much faster than expected. Three days after the {{transmission}} of episode one, EastEnders made the front page of a national newspaper {{for the first time with}} the headline [...] "EASTENDERS STAR IS A KILLER." [...] The security gates at Elstree Studios (where EastEnders is filmed) were swamped with journalists and photographers, and so began a [...] "double-edged" [...] relationship between EastEnders and the popular press. [...] The devisers of the programme were quick to realise that whilst a newspaper's publicity may sometimes boost a soap's position in the ratings, it could equally help to tarnish it. In conjunction, soaps could help to sell newspapers, and from then on stories about EastEnders and the cast began to fill their pages. [...] Grantham was hounded by the press and the BBC was forced to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> supporting him and their decision to employ a convicted murderer. In order to keep the press at bay, Grantham was smuggled out of the studios by the back route and decoy cars were used to lure the press away from his home, all of which put an increasing strain on the actor. Eventually the furor quieted down, but it never went away entirely and nearly every article written about the actor during his first stint in the show referenced his past. Press began to blur the characters in the show with the actors and it was at this point that Julia Smith — in an attempt to dispel confusion about reality and fiction — introduced the rule that no actor was ever to appear in public [...] "in character".|$|E

Khorasani also said [...] "Our suicide bombers have entered the school, they have instructions not to harm the children, but to target the Army personnel. It's a revenge attack for the Army offensive in North Waziristan." [...] Later though the Taliban claimed contrary by <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>statement</b> saying, [...] "More than 50 sons of important army officers were killed after being identified." [...] The attacks were mainly coordinated by TTP leaders operating in Afghanistan. [...] According to the Pakistani Federal Investigation Agency or FIA's early investigations, the group was led by the terrorist, Abu Shamil who planned the attacks, accompanied by three Arabs and two Afghans who spoke Pashto and were from Eastern Afghanistan. Khorasani was later killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan on 9 July 2016.|$|R

The hospital was thereby put in the position of issuing a correction, which embarrassed both the hospital and Hardy. Hardy was further embarrassed at a medical convention two weeks later. [...] Hardy withdrew from the transplant race.

In it he directly accused the Milošević administration of forcing the young people of Serbia to grow up in the country flooded by the wave of primitivism and nationalism where those who went through puberty while Vukovar and Sarajevo were being destroyed have been made the terrible victims whose wounds will never heal: [...] "This is a story about young criminals whom I believe have a deep moral right to be violent, even to murder, despite the political unacceptability of this idea.

Tricky finished his duet version of [...] "Milk" [...] in New York's Platinum Island Studios; Garbage completed their own guitar-led version of [...] "Milk" [...] in Madison during a break in their world tour. Garbage's rework was finished in two versions; the first was titled the Siren mix and featured only Manson's vocal; the second also incorporated Tricky's vocal and was titled the Wicked mix.
