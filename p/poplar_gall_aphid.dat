50|$|Pemphigus spyrothecae, or the <b>poplar</b> spiral <b>gall</b> <b>aphid,</b> is {{a social}} insect which {{exhibits}} apparent altruistic behaviors. The <b>aphids</b> form <b>galls</b> and act as colony defenders, at times sacrificing their own lives to do so. It {{has been shown that}} colony defense is more likely in habitats that are difficult to obtain and can hold a large number of individuals. These gall locations are so crucial because plants have a short window in which a gall can be produced. Thus, it is important for there to be a defense system that enables organisms to retain their galls. The need for defense arises when the gall is opened up to allow winged aphid migrants to leave and to release any waste. The process of repairing the holes, in P. spyrotheca, can take up to 10 days; during this time, the gall is susceptible to intruding predators.|$|R

25|$|Sugarbeet root aphid stem mothers induce gall {{formation}} in the leaf by probing the leaf tissue with their stylets. This leads {{to the formation of}} a small depression on the leaf, which eventually closes up over the stem mother and forms a gall. The extent of the probing activity dictates gall size, and removing the stem mother early on in the process leads to the formation of an unclosed, rudimentary gall. The extent of probing activity is correlated with the aphid's reproductive success. The probing activity may also serve a secondary purpose in helping the aphid determine leaf size. Leaf size {{is an important factor in}} determining what leaf a stem mother chooses to develop a gall on, but at the time of leaf colonization, leaves that are being colonized are only a tenth to a quarter of their mature size. It has been suggested that, during the probing of the leaf, the stem mother gauges the chemical environment of the leaf and uses that as a predictor of final leaf size and suitability as a <b>gall</b> site. <b>Aphids</b> possess chemosensory organs, allowing them to respond to a variety of stimuli from the plant, both those of the volatile variety (olfaction) and non-volatile variety (taste). Once the aphid is on a plant, it tests the surface of plant with its antennae and probes the plant with its mouth parts. The antennae contain many sensilla, allowing them to sense tactile and chemical stimuli.|$|R

Herbivorous insects favorably alter the microhabitat in which the herbivore feeds to counter existing plant defenses. For example, caterpillars from the families Pyralidae and Ctenuchidae roll mature leaves of the neotropical shrub Psychotria horizontalis around an expanding bud that they consume. By rolling the leaves, the insects {{reduce the amount of}} light reaching the bud by 95%, and this shading prevents leaf toughness and leaf tannin concentrations in the expanding bud, while maintaining the amount of nutritional gain of nitrogen.

Models of habitat selection are described and discussed in context with galling aphids. Habitat quality and aphid fitness can be quantified easily. Measures of relative reproductive fitness {{may be used to}} determine selection pressures driving habitat selection. The poplar trees differed significantly in budburst phenology, but Pemphigus spyrothecae stem mothers hatched on all trees within two days. Structural differences among and within trees were examined. Within and between host plant variation accounted for a dramatic difference in aphid fecundity. Larger leaves or shoots supported galls containing a higher number of offspring and a lower rate of gall failure. On singly galled shoots, gall position on a shoot did not affect reproductive outcome. Most stem mothers located their galls {{at the top of the}} petiole, closest to the base of the leaf, but gall position on the petiole did not affect the number of offspring produced. No relationship between stem mother size and fecundity could be detected. When competitor density increased on the same shoot or petiole, average fitness declined. Gall order on the petiole affected the growth rate of the gall tissue, but not the enclosed colony. However, distal galls (furthest from the leaf) were, on average, heavier and had more offspring than proximal galls. Predators are known to be important in regulating insect populations. Although, predators, on average, approached larger galls more often, this was not statistically significant. Due to the restrictive assumptions of models based on the Ideal Free Distribution, no qualitative fit of the distribution pattern of Pemphigus spyrothecae aphids was attempted. However, the characteristics of this aphid system were found to approximate an unequal competitors model. The availability of closed leaves on shoots at budburst, when stem mothers emerge, appeared to be the most important factor (of those examined) explaining the population distribution seen in spiral galling aphids...|$|R

Furthermore, the propensity for soldiers alone to be located at the opening provides excellent supporting evidence that they are also the agents of gall cleaning and repair.

40|$|This project used genetic {{variation}} to investigate dispersal, inbreeding and social behaviour in the aphid Pemphigus spyrothecac. P. spyrothecae is cyclically parthenogenetic, reproducing sexually on {{the bark of}} its primary host, Populus nigra, and asexually within galls on the leaf petioles. Within the gall, a soldier caste defends and cleans the gall, potentially reducing its own fitness. P. spyrothecae collected across the UK from 1997 to 1999 and from mainland Europe and America in 1999 were genotyped using seven variable microsatellite markers that I developed in collaboration with William Amos and Kate Llewellyn. Using population genetic analysis, I showed that P. spyrothecae populations were temporally stable over three years, and spatially structured. Populations from trees 5 to 1700 km apart were significantly differentiated, and loosely followed an isolation-by-distance model. There was slight evidence of differentiation between neighbouring trees (5 to 500 m apart), but not between samples taken from within trees (less than 5 m apart). By contrast, P. bursarius, a closely related species that, unlike P. spyrothecae, has a secondary host, showed no differentiation between populations 150 km apart, suggesting that population isolation in P. spyrothecae may be a consequence of losing its secondary host. Populations within trees were highly inbred, probably due to selfing between sexuales from the same clone. This finding corresponds with the theory that female-biased sex ratios in P. spyrothecae evolved through local mate competition. There was no evidence for a correlation between inbreeding and population density. Genetic variation was also found within <b>galls.</b> Of 633 <b>aphids</b> in one <b>gall,</b> 619 shared one genotype, while the remaining 14 were immigrants from at least nine other clones.

40|$|Summary, We {{examined}} {{the capacity of}} the galling aphid, Pemphigus betae, to manipulate the sink-source translocation patterns of its host, narrowleaf cotton-wood (Populus angustifolia). A series of 14 C-labeling ex-periments and a biomass allocation experiment showed that P. betae galls functioned as physiologic sinks, draw-ing in resources from surrounding plant sources. Early gall development was dependent on aphid sinks increas-ing allocation from storage reserves of the stem, and later development of the progeny within the gall was dependent on resources from the galled leaf blade and from neighboring leaves. Regardless of gall position within a leaf, aphids intercepted 14 C exported from the galled leaf (a non-mobilized source). However, only <b>aphid</b> <b>galls</b> at the most basal site of the leaf were strong sinks for 14 C fixed in neighboring leaves (a mobilized source). Drawing resources from neighboring leaves rep-resents active herbivore manipulation of normal host transport patterns. Neighboring leaves supplied 29 % of the 14 C accumulating in <b>aphids</b> in basal <b>galls,</b> while only supplying 7 % to <b>aphids</b> in distal <b>galls.</b> This additional resource available to <b>aphids</b> in basal <b>galls</b> can account for the 65 % increase in progeny produced in basal galls compared to galls located more distally on the leaf and limited to the galled leaf as a food resource.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Presentation date: 1981 - 12 - 17 The anatomies of 44 galls are {{discussed}} with special {{attention given to}} the development, longevity, and tannin content of the nutritive tissues. Within the main section of the thesis, representative galls from the major cecidogenetic groups, {{with the exception of}} bacterial and Australian scale galls, are studied. These include galls caused by fungi, nematodes, mites, moths, sawflys, scales, aphids, adelgids, tephritids, cecidomyiids, and cynipids. Three leaf mines are also described. Observations were taken from thin sections (plastic embedment) with a light microscope. The galls are arrayed along a continuum of increasing structural complexity, as judged by the degree of gall tissue differentiation. The sclerenchymatous "protective" zone and nutritive cells are used as indicators of gall complexity and of strength of the gall-former's influence over host plant tissue. Starting with the Fungal galls, then moth and sawfly galls, to the thrips, scale, mites, nematode, cecidomyiid and cynipid galls, one sees greater differentiation of gall tissues, with an increasingly distinct nutritive layer. A scierenchyma zone develops only in in midge and wasp galls. The longevity of the nutritive tissue varies from gall to gall. Generally, the nutritive tissue is maintained in an enriched state for an extended period only in galls caused by cynipids (and perhaps by nematodes). The mites and midges show enriched nutritive cells only in early gall development. No distinctive nutritive tissue occurs in the <b>aphid</b> <b>galls</b> that were studied. Generally, nutritive tissue contains less tanniferous material (as detected by the ferrous sulfate stain) than do either peripheral gall tissues or cells of the leaf. Thus, many gall-formers avoid tannins by directing the development of the cells upon which they feed. The epilogue includes a list of features shared by many galls and by gall-forming organisms. Gall-fparasites.

C. clematis was reported producing morphologically specialized sterile soldiers on the secondary host, Clematis apiifolia DC. in Japan. On its primary host, Zelkova serrata (Thunb.), Colophina clematis induces rolling-sphere galls on the leaves. The reported studies of C. clematis was restricted to the description of morphology of sterile soldiers and brief life cycle. To understand batter about the biology of C. clematis, further survey and analyses were conducted in central Taiwan, including gall developments, variations of individual numbers inside galls, other organisms associate with galls, and their relationships with the gallers. In addition, life history information and behavior observation based on laboratory-reared colonies on the secondary host were recorded, including length of each stadium, longevity of adult life, and some undescribed behaviors. The results showed that C. clematis induced galls in late February. Galls matured and dehisced in May when the progenies of stem mothers were mature, and the numbers of individuals inside the galls also reached the highest peak in the same month. The <b>aphids</b> left the <b>galls</b> completely in July and migrated to the secondary host, Clematis grata. The volume of matured galls varied obviously from 188. 94 mm 3 to 1607. 04 mm 3, and the analytic {{results showed that the}} gall volume was positively correlated with the individual numbers inside the galls (r= 0. 65829, p< 0. 01). In other words, bigger <b>galls</b> hosted more <b>aphids.</b> Therefore, it indicates that the gall volume is a density-dependent factor and, hence, affect the colony sizes inside the galls. Five other taxa were found associated with galls, including a thrips, a Tinocallis aphid nymph, an anthocorid nymph, a dipteran larva, and a coccinellid larva. The former three were considered as occasional invaders but not real inquilines. The latter two should be the main predators of Colophina clematis on Clematis. In addition, the length of 1 st stadium of the nymphs which lived on the secondary host was almost twice longer than the lengths of other stadia (7. 91. 9 days), and the developmental strategy was similar to another two aphid species of the same family. Only one individual completed the whole life span and totally produced 109 normal nymphs and 15 soldiers. Two undescribed behaviors were also recorded in this study. The soldiers which lived on Clematis seemed to be able to identify whether the disturbances are con-specific or not when they hugged the disturbances, and adult Colophina clematis which lived on Clematis seemed that they also perform defensing behaviors by secreting waxy chemical materials. 摘 要 [...] i ABSTRACT [...] iii TABLE OF CONTENTS [...] . v LIST OF TABLES [...] . vi LIST OF FIGURES [...] . vii INTRODUCTION [...] 1 Gall-inducing social aphid Colophina clematis [...] . 1 Hypothesis of kin selection	 [...] . 2 Adaptive hypothesis of insect galls [...] . 3 Purpose of researches [...] . 4 MATERIALS AND METHODS [...] . 5 I.
