40|$|Abstract- Surgeons should perform several tasks during medical {{operations}} (i. e. suture, ligature, etc.). In particular, the suture and ligature require {{high level}} skills {{in order not}} to damage skin or tissues. Therefore, many trainees practice using surgical training models. However, these training models focus only on helping trainee to learn a surgical procedure by simulation and imitation, and do not provide quantitative data for the evaluation of the task. For that reason, this paper describes the development of new Surgical Skills Training Simulator and Evaluation System. In order to provide quantitative data for the evaluation of suture and ligature skills, sensors are required to be embedded in the training simulator. This system used <b>photo</b> <b>interrupter</b> embedded under the skin dummy in order t...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation of}} existing sensor techniques, bothcommercial sensors and scientific studies, has been performed inorder {{to find a}} cost efficient fluid sensor with the ability todetect small amounts of non-conducting fluids. From these studies,six different techniques could be distinguished. The techniques weretested and compared, both in theory and practically, against certaincriteria’s such as temperature and movement sensibility. Three of thetechniques have been proved to work {{and two of them}} were built,installed and tested on an industrial robot manufactured by ABBRobotics. The two most promising techniques distinguished were a photointerrupter and a Quartz Crystal Microbalance sensor. After tests itcould be concluded that both sensors fulfilled all preferences. However out of the two, the Quartz Crystal Microbalance sensorperformed best and could detect smaller amounts of fluid more quicklyand reliably than the <b>photo</b> <b>interrupter.</b> This work has resulted in a patent application...|$|E
40|$|Written in {{relation}} to After the Last Sky, WJT Mitchell (1995) notes how ‘extraordinarily limited’ {{the image of the}} Palestinian is. Obscured from the dominant field of vision, Mitchell suggests that ‘visual facts’ which everyone knows in theory, but is rarely seen in practice – the Palestinian woman, the domestic space and children are subsequently constituted as ‘icons’ of an unseen reality that underpin Edward Said and Jean Mohr’s project. As a photo-essay, After the Last Sky has been referred to as a ‘nation-making’ text that sought to produce a new type of visibility concerning the Palestinian. With this in mind, my paper will focus on an online photo-essay facilitated by the Israeli activist photography collective, Activestills in 2012. Based in the Bedouin village of Susiya, located in the Southern Hebron Hills of the Occupied Territories, the photography collective worked in collaboration with the female villagers to produce a series of images based on their own lives. Thus, firstly, I will explore how the photo-essay challenges the universal legibility of an individual <b>photo,</b> <b>interrupting</b> the visual order by which the Palestinian is most commonly framed. Secondly, by focusing specifically on the collaboration between Israeli citizen and unrecognized Palestinian, I will identify how visual activism promotes a widening of the space in which politics can be conceived and performed. By creating new visibilities, in a political process that Jacques Rancière defines as a ‘sense-making practice’ (2006), visual activism tackles the issues of democracy creatively, not as a goal but as a practice that is democratic in its very development...|$|R
30|$|We {{developed}} a paperclip-shaped motion-actuating system, named “Move-it”. With this system, users can add motions to sticky notes just by clipping it. This system is constructed by using clip-shaped devices that have sensors and actuators. The recognition system uses <b>photo</b> <b>interrupter</b> module as sensor. Each clip device can recognize which note {{it has been}} attached to by calculating how much infrared light is being reflected by the grayscale image printed {{on the flip side}} of each note. The actuation system is made of a coil-shaped shape memory alloy combined with a polyolefin sheet that is embedded to the clip device, and can provide a sufficient motion for actuating the note. By writing for example, “meeting 16 : 00 ” on the sticky note using a digital pen and our device, the user can get physical reminder without any complex setting. This paper presents the design and evaluation of the recognition and actuation system of our clip-shaped device.|$|E
40|$|The {{validation}} {{of a new}} dynamometer for evaluation of dynamic muscle work is presented. The device {{was based on a}} precise measurement of load displacements of any machine using gravitational loads as external resistance. It allowed, through a sensor consisting of an infrared <b>photo</b> <b>interrupter,</b> the calculation of velocity, force and power during concentric, eccentric and stretch-shortening cycle activity. To validate the dynamometer 33 male and female track and field athletes (12 throwers and 21 jumpers) participated in the study. The throwers (4 women and 8 men) were asked to perform half-squat exercises on a slide machine with a load of 100 % of the subject's body mass. The day-to-day reproducibility of half-squat exercises gave a correlation coefficient of r = 0. 88, 0. 97 and 0. 95 for average push-off force (AF), average push-off velocity (AV), and average push-off power (AP) respectively. Comparison of half-squat measurements was performed against jumping and running test evaluation by the jumpers (7 women and 14 men). The interrelationships among the different variables studied demonstrated a strong correlation between AF, AV and AP and sprinting and jumping parameters (r = 0. 53 - 0. 97; P < 0. 05 - 0. 001). Using values of AF, AV and AP developed in half-squat exercises executed with different loads, ranging from 35 % to 210 % of the subject's body mass, it was also possible to establish the force-velocity and power-velocity relationships for both male and female jumpers. In any individual case, the maximal error due to the measurement system was calculated to be less than 0. 3 %, 0. 9 % and 1. 2 % for AF, AV, and AP respectively. Given the accuracy of the ergometer, the high reliability found between 2 days of measurements, and the specificity of the results it is suggested that the dynamic dynamometer would be suitable for evaluation of athletes performing specific skills. In addition, because single and multiple joint movements involving appropriate muscle groups call be easily performed, physiological characteristics could be evaluated for both athletic and rehabilitation purposes. Therefore, because of its simplicity of use and application, and its low cost the dynamometer would be suitable for both laboratory and field conditions...|$|E
40|$|The urine {{output is}} a rapid bedside test for kidney function, and reduced output {{is the common}} {{biomarker}} for an acute kidney injury (AKI). The consensus definition of the symptom is used urine output < 0. 5 ml/kg/hour for ≥ 6 hours to define AKI. If a patient is suspected to have this problem, the urine output monitoring {{needs to be done}} hourly, and this task consumes a lot of time, and easily affected by human errors. Moreover, available evidences in literatures indicate that more frequent patient monitoring could impact clinical decision making and patient’s outcome. However, it is not possible for nurses to dedicate their precious time manually up to minute manually measurements. To date, there is no reliable device has been used in the clinical routine. From the literatures, only a few automated devices were found with the ability to automatically monitor urine outputs, and could reduce nurse workload {{and at the same time}} enhance work performance, but these still have some limitations to measure human urine. In this thesis presents the development and testing for such a device. The research was aimed at building a prototype that could be measured a small amount of urine output, and transit information via wireless to a Cloud database with inexpensive and less complex components. The concept is to provide a real-time measurement and generates data records in Cloud database without requiring any intervention by the nurse. The initial experiment was done measure small amount of liquid using a dropvolume calculation technique. An optical sensor was placed in a medical dropper to record number of counted-drops, the Mean Absolute Percent Error from the test is reported ± 3. 96 % for measuring 35 ml of liquid compared with the ISO standard. The second prototype was developed with multi-sensors, including <b>photo</b> <b>interrupter</b> sensor, infrared proximity sensor, and ultrasonic sensor, to detect the dripping and urine flow. However, the optical sensor still provided the most accuracy of all. The final prototype is based on the combination of optical sensor for detecting drops to calculated urine flow rate and its volume, and weight scales to measurement the weight of collected urine in a commercial urine meter. The prototype also provides an alert in two scenarios; when the urine production is not met the goals, and when the urine container is almost full, the system will automatically generate alarms that warn the nurse. Series of experimentation tests have been conducted under consultant of medical professional to verify the proper operation and accuracy in the measurement. The results are improved from the previous prototype. The mean error found of this version is 1. 975 % or ≈ ± 1. 215 ml. when measure 35 ml of urine under the average density value of urine (1. 020). These tests confirm the potential application of the device by assisting nurse to monitor urine output with the accuracy in the measurement. The use of the Cloud based technology has not been previously reported in the literature as far as can be ascertained. These results illustrated the capability, suitability and limitation of the chosen technology...|$|E
