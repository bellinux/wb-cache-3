5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} of Category 3 {{and higher}} {{are described as}} major hurricanes in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific basins. These storms can cause some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings, particularly those of wood frame or manufactured materials with minor curtain wall failures. Buildings that lack a solid foundation, such as mobile homes, are usually destroyed, and gable-end roofs are peeled off. Manufactured homes usually sustain severe and irreparable damage. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures, while larger structures are struck by floating debris. A large number of trees are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. Additionally, terrain may be flooded well inland. Near-total to total <b>power</b> <b>loss</b> is likely for up to several weeks and water will likely also be lost or contaminated.|$|E
5|$|On Bermuda, the {{hurricane}} brought sustained winds estimated between , with higher gusts. A minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.30inHg) was recorded, though a lower pressure {{may have occurred}} on the island as the barometer had been falling at the time. The strong winds downed power lines and felled trees, littering insular streets with debris. As a result, power outages occurred and loss of telecommunications was reported. Radio stations based on the island went silent due to the <b>power</b> <b>loss.</b> An emergency backup power generator at King Edward Memorial Hospital was used to restore electrical power to the facility. However, oil lamps were still used in place of any form of electrical lighting. Several slate roofs were torn from their buildings from the strong winds. Heavy rainfall associated with {{the hurricane}} flooded long stretches of roadway. Some roads were blocked and rendered impassable by the rainfall. At the local harbor, six vessels were inundated by the strong offshore wave action. Overall, property damage on the island was estimated at $400,000.|$|E

25|$|Constant-voltage speaker {{systems are}} {{analogous}} to electrical power transmission methods employed by power companies to transmit electrical power over long distances. Typically, a power company will {{step up the}} voltage of the power being transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current and therefore also reduces the <b>power</b> <b>loss</b> during transmission. The voltage is stepped back down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce <b>power</b> <b>loss</b> over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to convert the voltage back to a usable level.|$|E

25|$|Insertion loss: The {{transformers}} themselves commonly reduce {{total power}} {{applied to the}} loudspeakers, requiring the amplifier to be some ten to twenty percent {{more powerful than the}} total power that is intended to be applied to the loudspeakers. Typical transformer insertion loss measurements are taken at 1,000 Hz {{in order to make the}} transformer's specifications appear as good as possible. Using this method, typical insertion losses are about 1 dB, a 20% <b>power</b> <b>loss.</b> Unfortunately, most of the power in voice-application audio systems is below 400 Hz, meaning that insertion loss at lower frequencies would be greater. The best transformers reduce mid-band frequencies by 0.5 dB (approximately 10% <b>power</b> <b>loss)</b> or less, resulting in a ten watt loudspeaker drawing 11.1 watts from the amplifier.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{process for}} grid companies {{in order to}} reduce <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> in electricity distribution grids is to figure out where and how they appear. This report describes the factors that cause <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> in low voltage distribution grids and methods for how they could be measured and analyzed. Measurement data for consumed and injected energy were collected for twelve low voltage distribution grids owned by Gävle Energi AB in order to analyze the size of the <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> and how the measurement uncertainty affects the collected data. Then models of three of the grids were created in MATLAB in order to analyze the data and the <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> were calculated to be compared to the collected data. Curve fitting were also used as a method in order to analyze the <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> from collected data. The results show that the losses in the studied grids are low. The measurement uncertainty is also low when losses are studied for long time periods, but high when losses are studied for short periods such as single hours. The calculated <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> from the MATLAB calculations seem to be lower than the measured <b>power</b> <b>losses,</b> which could indicate that a more complex model is needed for these kinds of studies. With a good interaction between the grid information system and the system that is storing measurement data it should be possible for grid companies to chart their <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> and with an accurate model of the grids the <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> can be calculated theoretically which should make it possible to analyze the causes of <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> in low voltage distribution grids...|$|R

40|$|The {{new method}} for {{turbogenerator}} <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> determination is introduced in this paper. The method {{relies on the}} experimentally derived <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> versus <b>power</b> reactive power dependence using data recorded in characteristic operating points. The proposed procedure is illustrated on the example of turbogenerators 410 MVA (and 348 MW). The procedures {{and the results of}} <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> calculations are also given for purely active generator load and at different reactive load levels. The <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> difference at same active power levels and at different reactive power levels appears {{to be related to the}} reactive load. For the three different turbogenerators rated at 247 MVA (and 210 MW) 367 MVA (and 348 MW) 727 MVA (and 618 MW), the results of calculations and analysis of <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> functions from reactive loads are presented. It is shown that block generator-transformer <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> are reduced remarkably, when generators power factor increase up to 0. 92 from 0. 85. This presents an important argument for power factor correction improvement in EES EPS together with the fact that in this situation the rotation reserves have been increased. From 2005 to 2008 by installing 550 Mvar of new capacitors in distribution network, reactive power demand from generators has been reduced for 720 Mvar, and so <b>power</b> <b>losses</b> are reduced for 9 MW, only in generator-transformer blocks of total rated power of 3800 MW...|$|R

40|$|In the {{scientific}} literature, various authors presented different control strategies aimed {{to increase the}} efficiency of the interior permanent magnet synchronous motors.

25|$|Multiple {{solar cells}} in an {{integrated}} group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar photovoltaic module. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers. Solar cells are usually connected in series and parallel circuits or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial <b>power</b> <b>loss</b> and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual power boxes are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs (maximum power point trackers) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt diodes can reduce shadowing <b>power</b> <b>loss</b> in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.|$|E
