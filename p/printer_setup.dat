50|$|In Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), the <b>Printer</b> <b>Setup</b> Utility {{was removed}} and its {{features}} {{placed in the}} Print & Fax System Preferences pane. Viewing individual printers' queues was moved to a Printer Proxy application.|$|E
50|$|Starting with Mac OS X 10.0, the Chooser was {{replaced}} by macOS's integrated networking features in the Finder. For the printing functions, they are now found in the separate Print Center (10.0 - 10.2) and <b>Printer</b> <b>Setup</b> Utility (10.3 and later) applications.|$|E
30|$|Though the new {{technologies}} have shown great advantages compared with amorphous silicon technologies for flexible electronics, there still exist many problems, for example, some pollution and waste still cannot be avoided during screen printing, <b>printer</b> <b>setups</b> are also very expensive, the defective products produced by these methods are hard to repair, etc. Therefore, more practical technologies need to be studied.|$|R
50|$|The Instant Access {{program is}} {{intended}} to assist students in grades 3-10 that use New York State curriculum and is focused on academics related mainly to Social Studies. There is no charge for the Braille note-taking devices, disk drives, <b>printers</b> or <b>setup</b> of the equipment. The program is a one-year school-based project and can be adjusted {{to take full advantage}} of features that will benefit the student and support the education process.|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, 3 D {{printing}} (also {{known as}} additive manufacturing) techniques have moved beyond their traditional {{applications in the}} fields of industrial manufacturing and prototyping to increasingly find roles in scientific research contexts, such as synthetic chemistry. We present a general approach for the production of bespoke chemical reactors, termed reactionware, using two different approaches to extrusion-based 3 D printing. This protocol describes the printing of an inert polypropylene (PP) architecture with the concurrent printing of soft material catalyst composites, using two different 3 D <b>printer</b> <b>setups.</b> The steps of the PROCEDURE describe the design and preparation of a 3 D digital model of the desired reactionware device and the preparation of this model for use with fused deposition modeling (FDM) type 3 D printers. The protocol then further describes the preparation of composite catalystâ€“silicone materials for incorporation into the 3 D-printed device and the steps required to fabricate a reactionware device. This combined approach allows versatility in the design and use of reactionware based on the specific needs of the experimental user. To illustrate this, we present a detailed procedure for the production of one such reactionware device that will result in the production of a sealed reactor capable of effecting a multistep organic synthesis. Depending on the design time of the 3 D model, and including time for curing and drying of materials, this procedure can be completed in ~ 3 d...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Printer</b> <b>Setup</b> Utility was an {{application}} in Mac OS X that served {{to allow the}} user to configure printers physically connected to the computer, or connected via a network. The Utility provided more specific tools than the more user friendly printers pane in System Preferences.|$|E
50|$|In Mac OS X 10.5, {{printers}} are configured in the Print & Fax {{panel in}} System Preferences, and in printer proxy applications which display the print queues and allow additional configuration after printers are set up. Earlier versions of Mac OS X {{also included a}} <b>Printer</b> <b>Setup</b> Utility, which supplied configuration options missing from earlier versions of the Print & Fax preference pane.|$|E
50|$|One handy and {{somewhat}} innovative feature {{for the time}} was the ability to add custom control characters in the <b>printer</b> <b>setup.</b> This allowed the user {{to take advantage of}} new features in a printer that were not intrinsically supported by Scripsit, such as different fonts or colours, or printing extended ASCII characters to produce simple lines and boxes. This was possible as printer manuals of the day included a full list of supported control character sequences for such functionality.|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} ink-jet {{technology}} {{in the field of}} three-dimensional printing has paved the way for its use in tactile map production. Tactile maps have raised features that are designed to convey spatial information to visually impaired people through touch. This research investigated the design of tactile ink-jet printers that had to embody printout quality principles to satisfy users' psychophysical preferences, via the manipulation of printout parameters such as: feature elevation, adhesion, texture, shape, contrast and size. Also, droplets coalescence and the control over build-up of three-dimensional micro-structures were investigated to enhance symbol discriminability and tactile map design. Analysis of data from a questionnaire helped formulate the Product Design Specification criteria. Collectively, these research elements culminated in a design methodology for tactile map production using tactile ink-jet printing. Research experiments were facilitated by a drop-on-demand ink-jet testing machine which jetted polymer ink. Tactile map production was enabled through a repetitive print process, depositing ink on the 'substrate and curing it via exposure to Ultraviolet light, resulting in elevated print features. Flexible configuration of the machine enabled the variation and isolation of subsystem parameters such as: Ultraviolet exposure, actuation, substrate types, printhead and ink as well as allowing the simulation of different <b>printer</b> <b>setups.</b> Machine performance data were collected along with data on users' performances and preferences from psychophysical experiments. Devised print algorithms, machine configurations and subsystems analyses established production process principles to yield the required printout quality. Print algorithms achieved three-dimensional profiles that improved adhesion to tested substrates and enhanced users' performance. The relationship between the structure of printed features', the printer's subsystems and users' psychophysical performance called for a two-strand convergent design methodology. While miniaturisation of this technology is possible, until it is more established, bureau-sized printers are best suited to improve the quality and availability of tactile maps.

50|$|An {{intermediate}} method does exist: {{a disposable}} ink tank {{connected to a}} disposable head, which is replaced infrequently (perhaps every tenth ink tank or so). Most high-volume Hewlett-Packard inkjet <b>printers</b> use this <b>setup,</b> with the disposable print heads used on lower volume models. A similar approach is used by Kodak, where the printhead intended for permanent use is nevertheless inexpensive and can {{be replaced by the}} user. Canon now uses (in most models) replaceable print heads which are designed to last the life of the printer, but can be replaced by the user should they become clogged.|$|R
40|$|Cyclone {{separators}} {{are used}} as main or pre-separator of particle in power plants, combustion systems, chemical and medical processes, systems related heat and mass transfer, etc. In this study, a new virtual body mini cyclone was designed and manufactured by using 3 D <b>printer.</b> An experimental <b>setup</b> was constructed for its performance tests. The system was run in suction mode and the atmospheric air was sucked by using a blower. A digital flowmeter and a differential pressure sensor were used for measurement of the flow rate and pressure drop respectively. Calcite particles fed into incoming air {{was used in the}} experiments. Particle size distributions of the particles entering the cyclone and the collected particles were analyzed by using a particle analyzer. The particle collection efficiency, fractional efficiencies and pressure losses were obtained from the test results. The effects of flow rate or inlet velocity and various geometrical parameters on the cyclone performances were also analyzed...|$|R
50|$|Scriptable {{core system}} applications: These background-only applications, {{packaged}} with macOS, {{are used to}} allow AppleScript to access features that would not normally be scriptable. As of Mac OS X 10.6.3 they include the scriptable applications for VoiceOver (scriptable auditory and braille screen reader package), System Events (control of non-scriptable applications and access to certain system functions and basic file operations), <b>Printer</b> <b>Setup</b> Utility (scriptable utility for handling print jobs), Image Events (core image manipulation), HelpViewer (scriptable utility for showing help displays), Database Events (minimal SQLite3 database interface), and AppleScript Utility (for scripting a few AppleScript related preferences), {{as well as a}} few utility applications used by the system.|$|E
40|$|Value Stream Mapping of the Singapore {{operations}} of a multi-national food products packaging company {{was carried out}} {{with the objective of}} streamlining production in accordance with the World Class Manufacturing philosophy. An opportunity for reduction in WIP and lead time was identified. Simulation models were used, on the make- to-order, serial production system to test three potential solutions to the problem. The models used showed great promise for reduction in WIP and the lead time for both the priority and ordinary products. The role of design as a sorting criterion on the printer was also investigated by a fundamental integer programming model using the Travelling Salesman approach. Results confirming the significance of design in the <b>printer</b> <b>setup</b> process were obtained in the trial run. by Priyanka Ram Sudhir. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|This article {{reports on}} 3 D {{bioprinting}} of dissolved cellulose to produce small feature structures with a tailored design of regenerated cellulose. The process consists of dissolving cellulose with different origins and molecular weight in an ionic liq uid (1 - ethyl - 3 - methylimidazolium acetat e), controlled multilayered dispensing, and coagulation. The printability was examined {{by studying the}} viscosity of cellulose solutions and by varying the settings of the <b>printer</b> <b>setup</b> regarding flow rate and needle dimensions. Water was added as a nonsolvent, enab ling a coagulation process to form a gel structure of the printed solutions. By printing on a coagulating gel, the printed solutions were regenerated within a few seconds. Rheology analysis showed that higher concentrations of cellulose and cellulose of a high molecular weight were shear thinning, providing favorable printing properties. Printing 3 D structures of cellulose dissolved in an ionic liquid followed by coagulation by a nonsolvent was possib le. Both complex patterns of 2 D structures as well as multilayered prints were created to obtain 3 D structures. This novel method allows {{for the production of}} spatially tailored 3 D gels or membrane structures made from cellulose...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{printing}} techniques {{have been developed}} for the realization of electronic circuits using functional inks. In this field inkjet printing technology has a number of attractive features and received a lot of interest with the development of specifically designed functional inks, including conductive inks based on silver nanoparticles or organic polymers. Some works in literature investigated the use of inkjet printing technique for the development of electrophysiological sensors. The aim of this work was to explore the potentialities of low cost inkjet printing for the prototyping of high-density electrode arrays for the detection of surface electromyographic signal (sEMG). A low cost inkjet system for the printing of conductive tracks based on standard office <b>printer</b> has been <b>setup</b> and tested for the prototyping of sEMG detection systems. The setup allowed the printing of high density bi-dimensional electrode arrays. The sEMG detection systems have been tested on the abductor pollicis muscle and biceps brachii muscle during isometric and dynamic contractions. The detected signals show a good quality and a stable contact without movement artifacts. The proposed system offers the possibility to design and print electrode arrays with different electrode patterns in a few minutes. This characteristic allows developing sEMG detection systems that can be adapted to the anatomy of the muscles under investigation in a short tim...|$|R
