From our study, we found the following: (1) For strong convection, the electron density exhibits a significant variation with altitude, latitude, longitude, and universal time. A similar result was obtained {{in our previous study}} dealing with a weak convection model. (2) For strong convection, ionospheric features, such as the main trough, the aurorally produced ionization peaks, the <b>polar</b> <b>hole,</b> and the tongue of ionization, are evident but they are modified in comparison with those found for slow convection. (3) For strong convection, the tongue of ionization is much more pronounced than for weak convection.

(5) For strong convection, a new <b>polar</b> <b>hole</b> appears in the polar cap at certain universal times.

Five observations are analyzed that span the <b>polar</b> coronal <b>hole</b> from the central meridian to the boundary with the quiet Sun corona. We study the observations above the solar limb in the height range of 1. 03 - 1. 20 solar radii. The electron temperature Te and emission measure EM are found using the Geometric mean Emission Measure (GEM) method. The EM derived from the elements Fe, Si, S, and Al are compared {{in order to measure}} relative coronal-to-photospheric abundance enhancement factors. We also studied the ion temperature Ti and the non-thermal velocity Vnt using the line profiles. All these measurements are compared to <b>polar</b> coronal <b>hole</b> observations from the previous (1996 - 1997) solar minimum and to model predictions for relative abundances. There are many similarities in the physical properties of the <b>polar</b> coronal <b>holes</b> between the two minima at these low heights. We find that Te, electron density Ne, and Ti are comparable in both minima. Te shows a comparable gradient with height. Both minima show a decreasing Ti with increasing charge-to-mass ratio q/M. A previously observed upturn of Ti for ions above q/M > 0. 25 was not found here. We also compared relative coronal-to-photospheric elemental abundance enhancement factors for a number of elements.

40|$|Abstract A {{new method}} for {{automated}} detection of polar coronal holes is presented. This method, called perimeter tracing, uses {{a series of}} 171, 195, and 304 ˚A full disk images from the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on SOHO over solar cycle 23 to measure the perimeter of polar coronal holes as they appear on the limbs. Perimeter tracing minimizes line-of-sight obscurations caused by the emitting plasma of the various wavelengths by taking measurements at the solar limb. Perimeter tracing also allows for the polar rotation period to emerge organically from the data as 33 days. We have called this the Harvey rotation rate and count Harvey rotations starting 4 January 1900. From the measured perimeter, we are then able to fit a curve to the data and derive an area within the line of best fit. We observe {{the area of the}} northern <b>polar</b> <b>hole</b> area in 1996, at the beginning of solar cycle 23, to be about 4. 2 % of the total solar surface area and about 3. 6 % in 2007.

Plasma motion due to polar convection and corotation above 500 N is modeled.

40|$|We {{focus on}} a <b>polar</b> coronal <b>hole</b> region to find any {{evidence}} of dissipation of propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves. We obtained time-distance and frequency-distance maps along the plume structure in a <b>polar</b> coronal <b>hole.</b> We also obtained Fourier power maps of the <b>polar</b> coronal <b>hole</b> in different frequency ranges in 171 Å and 193 Å passbands. We performed intensity distribution statistics in time domain at several locations in the <b>polar</b> coronal <b>hole.</b> We find the presence of propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves having temperature dependent propagation speeds. The wavelet analysis and Fourier power maps of the <b>polar</b> coronal <b>hole</b> show that low-frequency waves are travelling longer distances (longer detection length) as compared to high-frequency waves. We found two distinct dissipation length scales of wave amplitude decay at two different height ranges (between 0 [...] 10 Mm and 10 [...] 70 Mm) along the observed plume structure. The dissipation lengths obtained at higher height range show some frequency dependence. Individual Fourier power spectrum at several locations show a power-law distribution with frequency whereas probability density function (PDF) of intensity fluctuations in time show nearly Gaussian distributions. Propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves are getting heavily damped (small dissipation lengths) within the first 10 Mm distance. Beyond that waves are getting damped slowly with height. Frequency dependent dissipation lengths of wave propagation at higher heights may indicate the possibility of wave dissipation due to thermal conduction, however, the contribution from other dissipative parameters cannot be ruled out. Power-law distributed power spectra were also found at lower heights in the solar corona, which may provide viable information on the generation of longer period waves in the solar atmosphere.

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{was conducted}} to model the high-latitude ionospheric response to the sustained level of high geomagnetic activity for the great magnetic storm period of March 13 - 14, 1989. The geomagnetic and solar activity indices and the DMSP F 8 and F 9 satellite data for particle precipitation and high-latitude convection were used as inputs to a time-dependent ionospheric model (TDIM). The results of the TDIM were compared to both DMSP plasma density data and ground-based total electron content (TEC) measurements for the great storm period {{as well as with}} earlier storm observations. The comparisons showed that the overall structure of the high-latitude ionosphere was dominated by an increased convection speed within the polar cap that led to increased ion temperatures. In turn, this enhanced the NO+ density, raised the atomic-to-molecular ion transition height to over 300 km, decreased NmF 2, increased hmF 2, and in places either increased ne at 800 km or slightly decreased it. The morphology of the ionosphere under these extreme conditions was considerably different than that modeled for less disturbed intervals. These differences included the character of the dayside tongue of ionization that no longer extended deep into the polar cap. Instead, {{as a result of the}} ion heating and consequent reduction in NmF 2, a large <b>polar</b> <b>hole</b> occupied much of the polar region. This <b>polar</b> <b>hole</b> extended beyond the auroral oval and merged with the night sector midlatitude trough. The limitations associated with the applicability of the TDIM to the geomagnetic conditions present on March 13 and 14 are discussed. The primary limitations of the TDIM derive from the limited temporal resolution of the model input parameters and the lack of a suitably dynamic thermospheric specification for the great storm conditions. These limitations lead to midlatitude ionospheric storm phases that do not follow those observed...|$|E

We attempt to detect whether Alfven waves are present in the <b>polar</b> coronal <b>holes</b> through variations in EUV line widths. Methods. Using spectral observations performed over a <b>polar</b> coronal <b>hole</b> region with the EIS spectrometer on Hinode, we study the variation in the line width and electron density as a function of height. We use the density sensitive line pairs of Fe xii 186. 88 A & 195. 119 A and Fe xiii 203. 82 A & 202. 04 A. Results. For the polar region, the line width data show that the nonthermal line-of-sight velocity increases from 26 km/s at 1000 above the limb to 42 km/s some 15000 (i. e. 110, 000 km) above the limb. The electron density shows a decrease from 3 : 3 10 ^ 9 cm^- 3 to 1 : 9 10 ^ 8 cm^- 3 over the same distance. Conclusions. These results imply that the nonthermal velocity is inversely proportional to the quadratic root of the electron density, in excellent agreement with what is predicted for undamped radially propagating linear Alfven waves.

For four-cell convection, the two additional convection cells in the polar cap are in darkness most of the time, and the resulting O(+) decay acts to produce twin polar holes that are separated by a sun-aligned ridge of enhanced ionization due to theta-auroral precipitation.

40|$|The north <b>polar</b> coronal <b>hole</b> and {{the wind}} {{originating}} from it have {{been the target of}} a week [...] long observing campaign with UVCS. The observations with UVCS in the Lyff and O VI (1032 A and 1037 A) lines have covered the heliocentric distance from 1. 5 R fi to 3. 5 R fi. The corresponding inner corona has been observed, during part of the campaign, with CDS and SUMER in several chromospheric and coronal lines, including those observed with UVCS. Several EIT images and some EIT fast sequences, taken during the observing campaign, provide the overall scenario of the <b>polar</b> coronal <b>hole</b> at a high level of detail. Key words: fast solar wind; coronal holes; spectroscopy...|$|R
