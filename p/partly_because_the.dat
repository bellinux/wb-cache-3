5|$|The {{maintenance}} of Taman Sari was abandoned shortly after Hamengkubuwono I died, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> elaborate hydraulic works were {{so difficult to}} maintain. The gardens were neglected and the buildings suffered some damage during the Java War of 1825–1830.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} ratites, emus have a {{relatively}} low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds. At , the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about 60% of that when standing, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> lack of feathers under the stomach leads to {{a higher rate of}} heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> story is told {{in the first person}} narrative. Academic Jeremy Black notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to kitchen sink realism in the Bond canon: she has been a victim of life in the past, but is wilful and tough, too.|$|E
50|$|The {{study is}} unique <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> long time {{span of the}} cohort, and also <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> high social status {{of some of the}} study participants.|$|R
50|$|Phase 2 {{has been}} delayed, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> {{downturn}} in Arizona's economy and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> Goldwater Institute's lawsuit, Turken v. Gordon, against the $97.4 million economic development {{agreement with the}} City of Phoenix for the project.|$|R
30|$|After 1896, the {{radiation}} risk decreased very fast {{at first and}} more slowly thereafter to nearly zero in 1935. Many victims became quite old, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> slower progress of tissue reactions at lower radiation doses, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> success of often multiple surgical interventions.|$|R
5|$|For the 1893 version a {{baritone}} solo, two bassoons, four {{horns and}} two trumpets {{are added to}} the original scoring. When possible Fauré employed a mixed choir and a female soprano soloist, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> soprano lines, particularly the solo in the , are difficult to sing and demand excellent breath control, easier for adult women than for boys.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{around the}} world are {{considering}} a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions. This is <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.|$|E
5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security {{and the rule of}} law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Technology {{has always been}} the Cinderella of <b>the</b> {{education}} system, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> power and mysticism bound up with the term by society, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> high value placed on theoretical knowledge and on the ability of children to remember facts and regurgitate them in however many ways teachers can devise...|$|R
50|$|The {{story was}} an {{immediate}} popular success, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> Byron attribution and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> it exploited <b>the</b> gothic horror predilections of the public. Polidori transformed the vampire from a character in folklore into the form that is recognized today—an aristocratic fiend who preys among high society.|$|R
5|$|An {{issue with}} the Hinomaru and {{national}} anthem was raised once again when Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympic Games. Before the Olympic Games, {{the size of the}} sun disc of the national flag was changed <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> sun disc was not considered striking when it was being flown with other national flags. Tadamasa Fukiura, a color specialist, chose to set the sun disc at two thirds of the flag's length. Fukiura also chose the flag colors for the 1964 as well as the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th Légère, renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> King's German Legion's ammunition ran out. However, the Germans had held the centre of the battlefield for almost the entire day, and this had stalled the French advance.|$|E
5|$|For many years, revellers {{celebrating the}} New Year have {{gathered}} in the square {{despite a lack of}} celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events was <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003, a firework display centred on the London Eye and South Bank of the Thames has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014, New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with the charity Unicef, who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers.|$|E
50|$|Many Hungarian {{scientists}} such as Edward Teller emigrated <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> numerus clausus.|$|R
50|$|It {{is listed}} as near threatened, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> small size of its known range.|$|R
50|$|The band {{recorded}} Fools at Echo Mountain Studios in Asheville, North Carolina in November 2008. The month-long {{experience had}} a rejuvenating effect on <b>the</b> band, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> great locale and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> work of producer Steven Haigler (The Pixies, Brand New, Clutch). Haigler played {{a pivotal role}} in developing the band's new sound, which steered away from its previous heavier style.|$|R
5|$|On January 9, 2011, Electronic Arts {{announced}} that the online game servers would be shut down on January 11, 2011 for the Xbox 360 format of the game. The PC version of the game was shut down on December 31, 2010. Electronic Arts noted that their discontinuation {{of support for the}} game was <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> licensing deal with New Line Cinema (holders of the Lord of the Rings license) had expired, which led them to no other option than to shut down all online services for the game.|$|E
5|$|The V-22's two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C {{engines are}} {{connected}} by drive shafts {{to a common}} central gearbox so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine failure occurs. Either engine can power both proprotors through the wing driveshaft. However, the V-22 is generally not capable of hovering on one engine. If a proprotor gearbox fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The V-22's autorotation characteristics are poor <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> rotors have low inertia.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortunes}} of Gray's Inn continued to decline after the English Restoration, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining the Inn a year. This fall in numbers was <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> landed gentry {{were no longer}} sending sons who {{had no intention of}} becoming barristers to study at the Inn. In 1615, 13 students joined the Inn for every student called to the Bar, but by 1713 the ratio had become 2.3 new members to every 1 call.|$|E
50|$|On the Karst Plateau {{took place}} an {{exhausting}} series of hand-to-hand fights involving the Italian Second and Third Armies, with severe casualties on both sides. Bayonets, swords, knives, and various scrap metal and debris were all {{used in the}} terrifying melee. The Hungarian 20th division lost two-thirds of its effectives and was routed, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> successive attacks and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> unfavourable terrain.|$|R
50|$|Rolawn Limited {{has become}} Europe's largest {{producer}} of lawn turf. Based in the North of England {{in the county}} of North Yorkshire, Rolawn is a widely known name in the UK turf industry, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> quantity of turf {{that the company is}} able to produce on a regular basis and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> technological advances it has developed and then introduced to the industry.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{excepting}} {{this same}} peak, Maramma is all rolling hill and dale, like the sea after a storm; which then {{seems not to}} roll, but to stand still, poising its mountains. Yet the landscape of Maramma has not the merriness of meadows; <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> shadow of Ofo, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> solemn groves in which the Morais and temples are buried.|$|R
5|$|The {{naming rights}} of the space belong to Wm. Wrigley Jr, the {{foundation}} that created the world’s famous chewing gum. Wrigley Company officials, including William Wrigley, Jr. II, wanted to contribute to Millennium Park, and the historic aspect of the peristyle was attractive to them <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> original peristyle was constructed {{around the same time}} as the Wrigley Building, the corporate headquarters located a few blocks to the north, and because the classical architectural styles of both are similar.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S. Truman, a native Missourian, who refused to allow the battleship to be decommissioned, and against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Dennis claimed {{at least}} 88 lives: 56 in Haiti, 16 in Cuba, 15 in the U.S. and 1 in Jamaica. Total damages are {{estimated}} at US$4–6billion, including $2.23billion in the United States {{and the rest}} in the Caribbean. Dennis was most damaging to Cuba, where the storm wiped out {{a significant portion of}} the citrus crop. As the storm struck near the end of Cuba's dry season, farmers were not yet prepared for the heavy rainfall brought by the storm. In the United States, Dennis drew comparison with Hurricane Ivan of the previous year, but it was both smaller and weaker than Ivan at landfall and caused significantly fewer damages, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> region had not yet fully rebuilt.|$|E
50|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> {{use of an}} MP4 container, Apple Lossless {{does not}} contain {{integrated}} error checking.|$|R
5000|$|... {{a market}} flooded with poor-quality games, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> {{loss of control}} over third party developers; ...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of the fishery wealth available in the seas around India was confined until recently to the inshore region extending less than ten miles from the shore, the offshore region being left mostly untouched. This was <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> want of mechanization of the craft and gear, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> want of sufficient knowledge {{of the availability of}} good catches in the offshore grounds...|$|R
5|$|JFK was {{released}} in theaters on December 20, 1991. In its first week of release, JFK tied with Beauty and the Beast for fifth place in the U.S. box office and its critics began {{to say it was}} a flop. Warner Brothers executives argued that this was at least <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> film's long running time meant it had had fewer screenings than other films. Box office picked up momentum, however, in part due to a $15 million marketing campaign from the studio. By the first week in January 1992, it had grossed over $50 million worldwide, eventually earning over $200 million worldwide and $70 million in the United States during its initial run.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1996, Deal {{changed the}} name of the group back to the Breeders, {{originally}} with almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then, Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. Deal then decided that {{she did not want to}} wait any longer to reform the group, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Breeders' repertoire was larger than the Amps', thereby allowing longer concerts. Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders' Pod album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives {{a warm and}} mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. The proportions appear spacious because {{the view from the}} west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery. The proportions are made possible <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E
50|$|Peter Bullock—Editor of the Monmouth Chronicle. He {{suffers from}} ulcers, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> stress of {{maintaining}} his upper-middle-class lifestyle.|$|R
50|$|Conflicts {{between the}} insurer and insured {{can put a}} {{solicitor}} who represents both in an invidious position, particularly where the solicitor has received confidential information from one party, and may result in multiplicity of legal representation. In practice however, {{there is an enormous}} reluctance to invoke such clauses, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> expense of instructing Queen's Counsel to advise, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> insurer's need to maintain good relations with the insured.|$|R
50|$|As Lord Mayor Steeg was responsible, under Goebbels, for the city's budget, traffic, {{building}} regulations, schools, youth {{facilities and}} health services. All these came under increasing strain as World War II went on, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> inexperience of the Nazi loyalists {{who had been}} placed on responsible jobs following the removal of experienced but politically unreliable officials, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> increasing shortage of staff {{as a result of}} wartime conscription.|$|R
