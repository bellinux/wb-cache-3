Exact theoretical description of processes occurring at argon bubbling into steel would be very complex and {{it would lead to}} a system of non-linear partial differential equations describing transfer of momentum, heat, components, and with excitation function in the form of equation of so called deterministic chaos (argon bubbling). On the basis of <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle</b> model diagram and concentrations courses, the simplified linear physically adequate model was proposed, which described behavior of steel concentration in <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle</b> during its bubbling.

40|$|The work {{compares the}} {{effectiveness}} of selected methods of graphitizing inoculation applied after the spheroidization in the slender tundish ladle of 1 Mg capacity. The inoculation was carried out according to the three various options. The first one was performed simply {{by means of the}} block of inoculant inserted in the gating system of the mould, the second one started with initial inoculation by the in-stream method during the transfer of metal from the slender ladle to the <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle</b> and was completed with the secondary modification by means of the inoculant insert placed in the mould, the third one consisted in similar initial inoculation by the in-stream method during the transfer of metal from the slender ladle to the <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle</b> followed by the secondary inoculation, again by the in-stream method, applied during the pouring operation. Examination of cast iron structure allowed to find that the best results of inoculation are achieved in the case of inoculation carried out according to the Option III, though in all cases it was possible to produce cast iron of EN-GJS- 400 - 15 grade meeting the demands of the Standard [8]...|$|E

Boron carbide dispersion was introduced at the bottom of <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle</b> before tap of liquid cast iron. In this investigations were used three different quantities of inoculant in amounts 0, 1 %; 0, 2 % and 0, 3 % with relation to bath weight.

The measurements were performed in conditions determined by the kind of a pouring device. The results obtained for bottom-tap ladles were supplemented by laboratory measurements.

50|$|The {{molten metal}} had alloys added, then sampled and after {{satisfactory}} laboratory checks {{of the metal}} composition the furnaces were tapped out into preheated bottom <b>pouring</b> <b>ladles</b> holding some 20 tons. The ladles were manoeuvred by overhead crane into the casting bays over several ceramic runner systems each feeding six preheated one-ton ingot moulds. After cooling the ingot moulds were stripped of the still hot ingots and taken to the ingot yard. In the 1950s the transport from the Open Hearth Casting Bays to the ingot yard was by steam lorry, or on the internal steam railway system. As of 2016, a fully restored original example {{of one of the}} steam lorries carrying the Brown Bayley livery {{can be found at the}} Riverside Museum in Glasgow.|$|R
40|$|The {{performed}} {{investigations have}} resulted in conclusion that the vermicularizing treatment of ‘basic’ cast iron, consisting in‘conditioning’ the alloy by means of VLCe(2) master alloy, introducing the DENODUL 5 master alloy, and graphitizing with SRF 75 master alloy, provides for obtaining vermicular graphite precipitates {{in the structure of}} material cast within 15 minutes’ period from themodifying treatment. The cast iron has been melted in the induction crucible furnace of medium frequency under industrial conditions. Thealloy has been subjected to vermicularization in the slender ladle of 1 Mg capacity. Graphitizing has been performed in the course oftransferring the cast iron from the slender ladle to the <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle.</b> A series of test coupons in the form of reversed U-blocks of test part walls 25 mm thick have been cast of the produced cast iron. Then specimens both for metallographic examination and for testing themechanical properties have been taken from the coupons. The analysis of cast iron structure has revealed, among others, that howeverpurely vermicular graphite precipitates occurred in specimens taken out of the lower parts of test coupon walls (which are cooled faster),the nodular graphite precipitates in quantity up to 10 % could be observed in specimens from the upper parts of test coupon walls (located close beneath the sinkhead) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} pinholes in castings by reaction between cast iron with compacted graphite and green sand mould. Methodology: Experiments were done on bar castings moulded in green bentonite mixtures without carbonaceous matters. Moulding sand moisture and aluminium content in the melt were purposely changed. Metal was melted in a 100 kg furnace by remelting the uniform charge of return material. Metal was inoculated all at once in a ladle and modified in a reaction chamber in a mould or as sandwich method in a <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle.</b> Findings: The formation of pinholes was not caused by high moisture of the mould but this defect was sensible to aluminium content in metal. In castings with high aluminium content > 0. 2 % the pinholes occurred in high numbers, and namely under low and also high moistures (> 4 %). In previous melts with aluminium contents < 0. 02 % defects occurred in small range. Practical implications: Thus the conclusions known from literature {{about the influence of}} Al on pinholes occurrence in cast irons were confirmed. Oxygen activity in metal during its flowing and cooling in the mould was also measured but this quantity was not changed too in dependence on pinholes content. Morphological analyses near the defect have indicated that it is a physical type of pinholes caused by hydrogen. Originality: A number of works were aimed at explanation of causes of pinholes formation in lamellar graphite iron castings and spheroidal graphite ones. But this defect is formed in castings from compacted graphite cast iron too and the research was aimed just to this material. The contribution is in such a way an exceptional one...|$|E
40|$|Scientific and {{practical}} {{interest is the}} application of alloying alloy-modifiers for secondary treatment of high-strength cast iron to stabilize the process of spheroidization graphite and achieving higher physical-mechanical properties of castings. The peculiarity of the high-strength cast irons manufacturing technology is their tendency to supercooling during solidification in the mold. This leads {{to the formation of}} shrinkage defects and structurally free cementite, especially in thin-walled sections of the finished castings. To minimize these effects in foundry practice during production of ductile iron the secondary inoculation is widely used. In this regard, the question of the choice of the additives with effective impact not only on the graphitization process but also on the formation of the metallic base of ductile iron is relevant. The aim of the present work is to study the peculiarities of structure formation in cast iron with nodular graphite when alloying alloy-modifier based on tin with additions of nanoparticles of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes is used for secondary treatment. Melting of iron in laboratory conditions was performed in crucible induction furnace IST- 006 with an acid lining held. Spheroidizing treatment of melt was realized with magnesium containing alloying alloy FeSiMg 7 by means of ladle method. Secondary treatment of high strength cast iron was carried out by addition of alloying alloy-modifier in an amount of 0. 1 % {{to the bottom of the}} <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle.</b> Cast samples for chemical composition analysis, study of microstructure, technological and mechanical properties of the resultant alloy were made. Studies have shown that the secondary treatment of high strength cast iron with developed modifier-alloying alloy results in formation of the perlite metallic base due to the tin impact and nodular graphite with regular shape under the influence of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes. The tendency of high strength cast iron to «white cast iron» formation has been minimized, and the mechanical properties of the alloy produced correspond to HSCI 80. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{titanium}} modification, which was added {{along with the}} <b>pouring</b> liquid in <b>ladles,</b> on the shrinkage porosity and cavity of cast steel ZG 45 smelted in intermediate frequency induction furnace were studied. The metal liquid fluidity was measured by casting spiral samples. 0. 2 wt. % titanium modification achieved the highest fluidity for steel liquid. Proper content of titanium could effectively increase the volume of concentrated shrinkage cavity, and restrain the forming of shrinkage porosity. By scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy disperse spectroscope (EDS) analysis, {{it was found that}} TiC, acting as heterogeneous nuclei, could refine the structure grains, diminish the strong dendrite, and increase the fluidity and feeding capacity of steel liquid. However, overdoes titanium modification easily caused mass oxide TiO 2, which kept solid phases with high meting point in metal liquid to increase its viscosity and decrease the fluidity. Meanwhile, these solid state titanium compounds enlarged the composition supercooling, so the metal liquid changed from sequential solidification to simultaneous solidification, resulting in inadequate metal liquid feeding, less oncentrated shrinkage cavity and serious shrinkage porosity...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of quality castings requires the casting surface {{to be clean}} and free from defects. In some grey cast iron components which are cast in sand moulds, the metal sometimes penetrates into the mould, producing difficulties in cleaning the components. The defect causes very high costs due to component rejection and increased fettling in the casting industry. Most of the grey iron foundries {{around the world have}} problems with metal penetration on applicable components. In this work the problem of metal penetration has been studied using a commercial casting component. Eight castings were mounted on the pattern plate and five different inoculants were investigated. The experiments show that the inoculation of grey cast iron will influence the metal penetration in areas with late solidification times and where the melt is in contact with the sand mould. In all experiments 0. 14 % inoculant was added in the <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle.</b> The experiments show that the best results to reduce metal penetration have been obtained when using the inoculant which contained silicon, aluminium and zirconium. Using this inoculant, the average penetration area was only about 20 % of what was found using the worst inoculant. However, this inoculant also gave rise to a large tendency to formation sinks. The experiments also show two main classes of eutectic cell size. One class nucleated {{at the beginning of the}} eutectic solidification and one at the end of the solidification. Two other inoculants, both containing Al and Si have about the same base composition. From the measurements of penetration areas, one can draw the conclusion that the inoculant with the smallest grain size gives nuclei with the shortest lifetime. The coarser grains give a longer dissolution time and this promotes the survival of the nuclei. At the end of solidification, a larger amount of graphite will precipitate at higher temperatures if new nuclei can be activated. If the hot spot is located close to the metal surface, the metal will expand into the mould; resulting in metal expansion penetration. The worst cases of metal penetration have been obtained using an inoculant containing titanium. A large number of small eutectic cells and high volume of the small cells were observed, which leads to severe penetration...|$|E
