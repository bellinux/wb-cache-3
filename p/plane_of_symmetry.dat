5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shell of}} a scallop {{consists}} of two sides or valves, a left valve and a right one, divided by a <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry.</b> [...] Most species of scallop rest on their right valve, and consequently this valve is often deeper and more rounded than the left (i.e., upper) valve which in many species is actually concave. [...] With the hinge of the two valves oriented towards the top, one side corresponds to the animal's morphological anterior or front, {{the other is the}} posterior or rear, the hinge is the dorsal or back/ top region, and the bottom corresponds to the ventral or (as it were) underside/ belly.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{computationally}} efficient {{finite element}} analysis model of the rotary forging process for assembling a wheel hub bearing assembly is presented. The analysis model is composed of a part of material defined by two artificial <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry,</b> which is to reduce computational time taken in simulating the holistic process. Three cases of 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° analysis models for simulating rotary forging processes are studied to validate the present {{finite element analysis}} model. The predictions at their <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> and mid-planes are investigated and compared with the experiments, revealing that the predictions at the mid-planes are in good agreement with the experiments for all the cases while those at the <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> are to the contrary. Thus, the 60 ° analysis model is recommended for both computational efficiency and solution reliability. With the present finite element analysis model, one hour of computational time with PC can be sufficient enough to obtain valuable information about such rotary forging processes as the wheel hub bearing assembly making process...|$|R
