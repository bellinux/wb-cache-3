Specifically, the effects of arc current, primary atomizing <b>gas</b> <b>pressure,</b> and secondary atomizing <b>gas</b> <b>pressure</b> on spray pattern size, spray pattern flatness, spray pattern eccentricity, and coating deposition rate were investigated.

25|$|Dry suit squeeze. The {{main risk}} is skin getting pinched and bruised by {{folds of the}} dry suit when {{squeezed}} on descent. Most dry suits can be equalised against squeeze via a manually operated valve fed from a low <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> supply. Air must be manually injected during the descent to avoid squeeze and is manually or automatically vented on the ascent to maintain buoyancy control.|$|E
25|$|During descent {{the air in}} {{the suit}} is {{compressed}} and unless more is added, the folds may be pressed together so tightly by water pressure that they pinch the skin, which is painful and may cause local bruising. The suit may also become so tight that movement is restricted, particularly in a membrane suit. This problem is managed by suit inflation from a low <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> supply.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, two basic {{architectures}} for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated.

25|$|The {{demand valve}} has a chamber, which in normal use {{contains}} breathing gas at ambient pressure. A valve which supplies medium <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> can vent into the chamber. Either a mouthpiece or a full-face mask {{is connected to}} the chamber for the diver to breathe from. The mouthpiece can be direct coupled or connected by a flexible low-pressure hose. On one side of the chamber is a flexible diaphragm to control the operation of the valve. The diaphragm is protected by a cover with holes or slits through which outside water can enter freely.|$|E
25|$|The piston in {{the first}} stage is rigid and acts {{directly}} on the seat of the valve. The pressure in the intermediate pressure chamber drops when the diver inhales from the second stage valve, this causes the piston to lift off the stationary valve seat as the piston slides into the intermediate pressure chamber. The now open valve permits high <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> to flow into the medium pressure chamber until the pressure in the chamber has risen enough to push the piston back into its original position against the seat and thus close the valve.|$|E

Over time, the convenience and performance of improved single hose regulators would make them the industry standard. Performance continues to be improved by small increments, and adaptations have been applied to rebreather technology.|$|E
25|$|From the {{earliest}} period, gunpowder has been {{composed of a}} nitrate salt, sulfur, and carbonaceous matter. The Nitrate component is the Oxidizing agent, Sulfur is a low melting Reducing agent and serves {{to aid in the}} transfer of heat through the gunpowder mass, and Carbon is a reducing component producing hot, high <b>pressure</b> <b>gas.</b> The utility of gunpowder lies in its ability to accelerate a projectile by the explosive expansion of gas. The development of new explosive materials in the 19th century naturally led to improvements in the rate and magnitude of pressure rise as well as new means for ignition of the charge.|$|E
25|$|Lungs: There {{is a risk}} pneumothorax, {{arterial}} gas embolism, and mediastinal and subcutanous emphysemas during ascent, {{which are}} commonly called burst lung or lung overpressure injury by divers. To equalise the lungs, all that is necessary is not to hold the breath during ascent. This risk does not occur when breath-hold diving from the surface, unless the diver breathes from an ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> source underwater; breath-hold divers do suffer squeezed lungs on descent, crushing in the chest cavity, but, while uncomfortable, this rarely causes lung injury and returns to normal at the surface. Some people have pathologies of the lung which prevent rapid flow of excess air through the passages, {{which can lead to}} lung barotrauma even if the breath is not held during rapid depressurisation. These people should not dive as the risk is unacceptably high. Most commercial or military diving medical examinations will look specifically for signs of this pathology.|$|E
