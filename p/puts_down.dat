It then lifts its right hind leg (while being {{supported by the}} diagonal pair front right and left hind). Next, the left front foot touches the ground (the horse is now supported by all but the right hind leg); then the horse lifts its right front leg (it is now supported laterally on both left legs), and shortly afterwards it sets down the right rear leg (only the front right leg is now lifted). Then it lifts its left rear leg (diagonal support), <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> the front right (lateral support), lifts the left front, <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> the rear left, and the pattern repeats.|$|E

25|$|From this event, Jaggar {{assumes a}} {{hereditary}} {{right to be}} the leader of Heldon and embarks on a violent crusade for genetic purity, drawing a massive following, staging outdoor rallies and raising an army personally loyal to him. He is elected to the Council and stages a coup d'état when he forces the Council to admit to treason and a Zind plot against Heldon. Confirming his suspicions, the Universalist member of the Council {{turns out to be a}} Dom. Feric summarily executes him with the Great Truncheon. Jaggar coerces the Council into granting him complete executive power and then has them shot. Immediately after assuming power Jaggar <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> an imminent coup by Stopa, who has been corrupted by the fleshly pleasures of Zind.|$|E
25|$|A {{secured credit}} card {{is a type}} of credit card secured by a deposit account owned by the {{cardholder}}. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500–1,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special savings account. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.|$|E

25|$|AMS Performance, {{based in}} West Chicago, Illinois, has set record power levels and {{performance}} {{numbers for the}} GT-R. Their Alpha Omega GT-R <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> between 1700–1750 whp and boasts 0–60 times of 1.7 seconds according to their staff on their official Facebook page. In June 2013, Omega set multiple world records at the WannaGoFast 1/2 Mile Shootout at Built Field Airport in Monee, Illinois which included: 214.04mph in a standing 1/2 mile; 60–130mph in 3 seconds; 0–100mph in 4.4 seconds; 0–200mph in 11.87 seconds. In July 2013, AMS regained their world record (previously held by John Shepherd's AMS/Switzer GT-R for a brief time) when Omega ran 8.259 at 185.18mph. A few days later, OMEGA broke into the 7s when it ran a 7.98 at 186.14mph, currently making it the quickest and fastest GT-R in the world, {{as well as the}} first GT-R to reach the 9's, 8's, and 7's. During the evening of the 7 second pass Omega broke a couple of other records. Omega bested its previous 60–130mph time with a staggering 2.67 seconds. Omega also broke the 100–150mph record which was previously held by an Underground Racing TT Gallardo (2.58 seconds) with an astounding 2.45 seconds. The AMS Performance Alpha Omega package functions more as a shop/research and development vehicle which is the reason why it is not available to the general public. However, anybody can purchase the Alpha 6, Alpha 9, Alpha 10, Alpha 12, Alpha 14 and Alpha 16 packages; each respectively with approximately 600, 900, 1000, 1200, 1,400 and 1,600 wheel horsepower when installed and tuned.|$|E
500|$|As the {{infection}} spreads, Israel abandons the Palestinian territories and initiates a nationwide cordon sanitaire, closing its borders to everyone except uninfected Jews and Palestinians. Its military then <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> an ultra-Orthodox uprising, which is later {{referred to as}} an Israeli Civil War. The United States does little to prepare because it is overconfident {{in its ability to}} suppress any threat. Although special forces teams contain initial outbreaks, a widespread effort never starts: the nation is deprived of political will by [...] "brushfire wars", and a widely distributed and marketed placebo vaccine, Phalanx, creates a false sense of security.|$|E
500|$|The Defective Premises Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons as a private member's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971, and was not debated at all in the Commons, something the academic lawyer Peter North called [...] "remarkable". There was some debate in the House of Lords, with questions and amendments covering Section 1, but the bill was not substantially amended, something North <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> {{to the quality of the}} draft prepared by the Law Commission. The Act was given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, and came into force on 1 January 1974.|$|E

500|$|Roger Moore of The Seattle Times showed mixed {{feelings}} in his review: [...] "Rare is the thriller that goes as completely and utterly wrong as The Call does at almost precisely the one-hour mark. Which is a crying shame, because {{for an hour}} this is a riveting, by-the-book kidnapping." [...] Moore explained {{what he saw as}} the highs and lows: [...] "Brad Anderson turns this...serial-killer hunt...into a real edge-of-your-seat thriller. Given...a half-decent tale of horror, guilt, problem-solving and redemption, Anderson couldn't go far wrong," [...] but, Moore states, [...] "It's only when our Oscar-winning heroine <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> the phone and sets out to do some sleuthing of her own that The Call disconnects, turning into something far more generic and far less exciting." [...] The Los Angeles Times turned in a similar review: [...] "The semi-fresh thriller, set mainly in an emergency call center and on the freeways of Los Angeles, puts a tech slant on a damsel-in-distress setup. It buzzes along for a while, the promising plot innovations inviting suspension of disbelief, before by-the-numbers implausibility, over-the-top valor and unsavory contrivances take over and the line goes dead." ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to lack of}} needed equipment, the Smurfs don't {{manage to}} put out the fire of a bench, so they decide to organise as firemen in case of a really serious fire.

The firemen take their task very seriously: they <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a chimney fire (destroying a house in the process), they <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the fire of Handy Smurf's forge, they <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the fire of Papa Smurf's just-lit candle, and they even <b>put</b> <b>down</b> Poet Smurf's poem to the Smurfette because it claims his love is a flame. However, they cannot <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a barbecue fire because it's just outside the Smurf Village, so it's beyond their surveillance. Gargamel smells the barbecue and tries to follow it to the village, but he fails and, in anger, puts the forest in fire. While the firemen Smurfs try to <b>put</b> the fire <b>down,</b> Papa Smurf uses the magic weather vane to make wind that sends the fire towards Gargamel, and then some rain to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the fire. A Smurf asks Papa Smurf who gave him the magic weather vane, and he answers it was a certain Aeolus.|$|R

60|$|But, indeed, the dictum {{that truth}} always triumphs over persecution, {{is one of}} those {{pleasant}} falsehoods which men repeat after one another till they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes. History teems with instances of truth <b>put</b> <b>down</b> by persecution. If not suppressed for ever, it may be thrown back for centuries. To speak only of religious opinions: the Reformation broke out at least twenty times before Luther, and was <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> Arnold of Brescia was <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> Fra Dolcino was <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> Savonarola was <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> The Albigeois were <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> The Vaudois were <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> The Lollards were <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> The Hussites were <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> Even after the era of Luther, wherever persecution was persisted in, it was successful. In Spain, Italy, Flanders, the Austrian empire, Protestantism was rooted out; and, most likely, would have been so in England, had Queen Mary lived, or Queen Elizabeth died. Persecution has always succeeded, save where the heretics were too strong a party to be effectually persecuted. No reasonable person can doubt that Christianity might have been extirpated in the Roman Empire. It spread, and became predominant, because the persecutions were only occasional, lasting but a short time, and separated by long intervals of almost undisturbed propagandism. It is a piece of idle sentimentality that truth, merely as truth, has any inherent power denied to error, of prevailing against the dungeon and the stake. Men are not more zealous for truth than they often are for error, and a sufficient application of legal or even of social penalties will generally succeed in stopping the propagation of either. The real advantage which truth has, consists in this, that when an opinion is true, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times, but in the course of ages there will generally be found persons to rediscover it, until some one of its reappearances falls on a time when from favourable circumstances it escapes persecution until it has made such head as to withstand all subsequent attempts to suppress it.|$|R
