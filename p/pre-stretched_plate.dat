40|$|AbstractMachining {{deformation}} of aircraft monolithic component is simulated by {{finite element method}} (FEM) and validated by experiment. The initial residual stress in <b>pre-stretched</b> <b>plate</b> is generated by simulating quenching and stretching processes. With a single tool-tooth milling process FEM, the machining loads in monolithic component material removing is obtained. Restart-calculation is put forward to complete the whole simulation of machining process. To verify the FEM result, an experiment is carried out. The deformation distribution of the monolithic component resulting from FEM shows a good agreement with the experiment result, which indicates that the key technologies presented in the paper are practicable {{and can be used}} to simulate the milling process of monolithic component to predict its deformation. Lengthy and expensive trial and error experiment process can be avoided...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} linearized {{theory of}} elastodynamics mathematical {{formulation of the}} forced vibration of a prestretched plate resting on a rigid half-plane is given. The vari-ational formulation of corresponding boundary-value problem is constructed. The first variational of the functional in the variational statement is equated to zero. In the frame-work of the virtual work principle, it is proved that appropriate equations and boundary conditions are derived. Using these conditions, finite element formulation of the <b>pre-stretched</b> <b>plate</b> is done. The numerical results obtained coincide with the ones given by Ufly and in 1963 for the static loading case. Copyright © 2007 M. Eröz and A. Yildiz.

40|$|The {{parameters}} of duplex aging treatment of <b>pre-stretched</b> <b>plates</b> including both {{the temperature and}} the holding time of two aging stages have been systematically investigated by using electric conductivity and tensile properties tests, exfoliation corrosion experiments and TEM observations. The results show that both {{the first and the}} second age have effect on properties of plates after having been performed by different duplex aging treatments and the effect of the second age is much greater. It is found that such a duplex aging treatment is appropriate in which the temperature of the second age is 155 °C and the holding time of the first and the second age is 4 - 6 and 28 - 32 hours, respectively. The ultimate strength of specimens treated with the duplex aging treatment given above can achieve 540 MPa while electric conductivity is 40. 5 - 42 %IACS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of residual stress in thick <b>pre-stretched</b> aluminum <b>plate</b> {{needs to be}} accurately measured {{in order to control}} the machining distortion. In the measuring process, the dynamic resistance strain instrument was used to accurately measure the releasing process of stress and collect the strain changes data with the time changing. Not only the status and the {{distribution of}} 3 D residual stress, but also the releasing velocity trend of 3 D residual stress are obtained, which is very significant in engineering...|$|R
30|$|Research {{has found}} that large initial cavity volumes can cause reduced {{fracture}} strain of <b>pre-stretched</b> aluminum alloy <b>plates</b> [5]. Cold-rolling can avoid oxide inclusions and enhance its mechanical properties, in particular its fracture toughness [6]. Recrystallization {{has been shown to}} decrease stress corrosion cracking and inter-granular fractures of Al–Zn–Mg–Cu alloy [7 – 9], but these researchers could not find an effective mechanism with which to improve the fracture toughness of Al alloy.|$|R
40|$|The {{equations}} {{governing the}} appearance of flexural static perturbations {{at the edge of}} a semi-infinite thin elastic isotropic plate, subjected to a state of homogeneous bi-axial pre-stress, are derived and solved. The plate is incompressible and supported by a Winkler elastic foundation with, possibly, wavenumber dependence. Small perturbations superposed onto the homogeneous state of pre-stress, within the three-dimensional elasticity theory, are considered. A series expansion of the plate kinematics in the plate thickness provides a consistent expression for the second variation of the potential energy, whose minimization gives the plate governing equations. Consistency considerations supplement a constraint on the scaling of the pre-stress so that the classical Kirchhoff Love linear theory of <b>pre-stretched</b> elastic <b>plates</b> is retrieved. Moreover, a scaling constraint for the foundation stiffness is also introduced. Edge wrinkling is investigated and compared with body wrinkling. We find that the former always precedes the latter in a state of uni-axial pre-stretch, regardless of the foundation stiffness. By contrast, a general bi-axial pre-stretch state may favour body wrinkling for moderate foundation stiffness. Wavenumber dependence significantly alters the predicted behaviour. The results may be especially relevant to modelling soft biological materials, such as skin or tissues, or stretchable organic thin-films, embedded in a compliant elastic matrix. 2017 - 09 - 0...|$|R
