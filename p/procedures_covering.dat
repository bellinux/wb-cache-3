5|$|While Yellowstone {{was under}} army management, the activities, {{policies}} and procedures developed served as precedents for other national parks and subsequent actions by the National Park Service after its formation in 1916. The army solved {{a wide variety of}} problems and developed <b>procedures</b> <b>covering</b> a multitude of administrative issues. The military superintendents continued the evolution of park policies and conservation measures initiated by the first civilian administrators. They implemented backcountry patrols, access improvement, wildlife protection and management, protection of natural features, law enforcement and development of a ranger force. The army set precedents for future headquarters area development designs, visitor services such as educational outreach and interpretive tours. Their diligence in dealing with poachers led to legislation that provided for prosecution and punishment of illegal activity. That most of the precedents that the army established were incorporated later by the National Park Service is a lasting legacy of the important role the army played in U.S. national park history. Modern Park Ranger uniforms are legacies of army management of the park.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two techniques}} for speeding up reinforcement learning algorithms {{based on the}} methods of temporal differences (TD). The first of them, recently developed by the author and known as the TTD procedure, is an approximate implementation of TD(? 0), significantly more computationally efficient than the traditional eligibility traces implementation. The second technique, previously used by other authors and called here sequential replay (SR), relies on performing at each step several temporally chained TD(0) updates. In this paper the SR technique is shown to yield roughly mathematically equivalent overall effects as TTD with certain parameter values. It is also demonstrated how sequential replay can be integrated with the TTD procedure, leading to the TTD-SR <b>procedure,</b> <b>covering</b> both the basic techniques as special cases and {{making it possible to}} use sequential replay with ? 0.

Hashem Sharghi and Hosseini [18] described a solventless reaction protocol for synthesizing aldoximes from corresponding aldehydes using ZnO as catalyst at 80 °C. Interestingly, they obtained Beckmann rearrangement product at higher temperatures (140 - 170 °C). More recently, conversion of carbonyl compounds to oximes in aqueous biphasic medium and ionic liquid/water biphasic system [19, 20] has been reported. However, problems of generation of polluting HCl, high reaction temperature, occasionally low yields, and lack of a generalized <b>procedure</b> <b>covering</b> all types of aldehydes and ketones still present. Consequently, there is a demand for developing an efficient, convenient, and non-polluting or less polluting alternative method for the preparation of oximes. In this context, because of the rich chemistry of bismuth compounds [21 – 25], we became interested therein. Bismuth compounds are generally cheap, commercially available, air stable crystalline solids, safe, and non-toxic, hence easy to handle. Their Lewis acidity is also well known [26, 27].
