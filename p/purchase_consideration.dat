Inspired by theories addressing embodied cognition and symbolic meaning portrayal, this paper argues that visual cues inspiring verticality perceptions (i. e., camera angle and advertising background orientation) affect luxury perceptions and, consequently, consumer evaluations and price expectations. Across three experiments, verticality cues fostered perceptions of product luxury but differentially affected price expectations and <b>purchase</b> <b>considerations</b> depending on product type.

Paragraph 6. 1 of Accounting Standards AASB 1015 and AAS 21 “Acquisitions of Assets ” requires an acquisition {{to be measured}} at {{the cost to the}} acquiring entity. In determining the cost of acquisition, the Standards require equity instruments issued by the acquirer to be measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition. 2. Both AASB 1015 and AAS 21 require that, where an entity or operation is acquired, any difference between the cost of acquisition and the aggregate fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (less, where applicable, the aggregate fair value of the identifiable liabilities assumed) must be accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards AASB 1013 and AAS 18 “Accounting for Goodwill”. 3. The determination of the fair value of equity instruments issued in an acquisition and, therefore, the <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration,</b> has a direct effect on the calculation of any goodwill or discount on acquisition, where an entity or business operation is acquired. 4.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{earnings}} management phenomena in Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) in the UK. The {{intention is to}} provide evidence of the occurrence of earnings management practices prior to {{the completion of the}} deal process among acquiring companies that issue shares as the <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration,</b> compared to those that use cash. In addition, the study examines the performance of the share acquirers against cash acquirers. The existing academic literature relating to,earnings management in US and Australian M&A transactions appears to provide contradictory results. The existing literature for the UK has anaysed the M&A position from a number of perspectives and reported similar results. However, limited research has been carried out for UK M&A from an earnings management perspective. Therefore, this study attempts to bridge the gap by providing evidence of earnings management practice in M&A activities in the UK. By using the accrual model, the results are directly comparable with existing research studies for the US and Australia. The main earnings management detection method used is this study is {{a modified version of the}} Jones model developed by Dechow et al (1995). In addition to this, the study investigates detection of earnings management by looking at 'other' measures and attempts to explain the performance of these companies, using ratio analysis. A control sample that uses cash as the <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration</b> is derived to compare the effect of earnings management with that of the main sample that uses shares. The accounting and market data for each company are obtained from Datastream for the time period of 1999 to 2003. The transaction values and the method of payment are gathered from different sources: National Statistics Bureau, Journal Monthly Acquisition and Hemscott premium websites. The results obtained by using the modified Jones model and 'other' measures highlight a positive and statistically significant difference between the share and cash sample. It indicates that in the years prior to M&A, acquiring firms manage earnings upward. It can be argued therefore that, acquiring firms' use accounting procedures in an attempt to increase their stock price, prior to stock for stock merger or acquisition. In addition, ratio analysis reveals that, firms that offer stock significantly under-perform those offering cash.

40|$|M. Com. (Accounting) This study {{sets out}} to suggest a method of {{accounting}} for goodwill and brands which is practically feasible, yet conceptually justifiable. Only positive, acquired goodwill is relevant {{for purposes of this}} study. Both acquired and internally generated brands are, however, investigated. In terms of historical cost accounting, both acquired goodwill and brands qualify as assets of the enterprise since they are controlled by the enterprise as a result of past transactions and future economic benefits are expected to flow therefrom. Goodwill arises as a balancing amount in terms of double entry accounting {{as a result of the}} fact that the <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration</b> applicable to a business take-over often exceeds the aggregate of the fair values of the acquired enterprise's net assets. Because goodwill can therefore effectively be seen as a function of two other figures, the potential exists that it can be manipulated. A number of possible alternative accounting treatments of goodwill are in existence. In spite of a historical background of divergence, international statements now display increasing agreement in favour of the amortisation option. The opposite is, however, true in respect of the financial statements of South African companies. The. preparers and users of financial interest in preventing goodwill as statements have a vested far as possible. As regards goodwill that does arise, an accounting treatment with the smallest possible detrimental effect on the financial position and results of the company will enjoy preference. Contrary to this is the fact that the amortisation of goodwill is the most justifiable alternative from a conceptual point of view. A number of accounting options have been developed over the years with the intention of either preventing goodwill, or at least limiting its extent. Included in this is merger accounting (also called pooling of interests accounting) in terms of which goodwill is effectively set off against the share premium account in the case of a take-over where the <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration</b> is settled by means of a share issue. Another method is the capitalisation of brands in the place of goodwill. Brands are therefore considered to be a mere substitute for goodwill on the balance sheet and is consequently of doubtful value from an accounting and financial analysis point of view. In spite of a variety of accounting alternatives, acquired brands should thus be accounted for in the same way as goodwill. Furthermore, internally generated brands should not be acknowledged on the balance sheet. The implementation of this will lead to the artificial distinction between goodwill and brands losing its prominence in the course of tim...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a detailed survey designed to explore the factors associated with purchase of private health insurance in England. The survey, a nationally representative survey of the population of England aged 25 to 70, was carried out in the first 4 months of 1987. The achieved sample was 1360 individuals. The survey sought detailed information on both the reasons for health insurance purchase and the reasons for non-purchase by individuals and families. The paper is in two parts. In the first part the survey is analysed in depth. Tables are presented showing the pattern of health insurance across different socio-economic groups and regions of England. These tables are compared to those from the latest General Household Survey (GHS) which asked questions on insurance (the 1983 survey). The large size of the current sample means that the results {{in this part of the}} discussion paper can be treated as a partial up date to the GHS. In addition, the paper examines the motives for self <b>purchase,</b> <b>consideration</b> of purchase and non-purchase of health insurance.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the relationships between vanity, social comparison and purchase behaviour. Specifically, this thesis defines and develops a conceptual model that expands on these relationships where vanity and social comparison act as antecedents to consumers’ self-esteem and product evaluation which in turn gives rise to purchase behaviour for luxury fashion products. Using this model, the research examines how manipulations of social comparison and vanity are reflected in these relationships and the resulting impact on purchase behaviour. To empirically test this model, an online experiment using a 3 x 2 between-subjects factorial design was conducted, where respondents were exposed to modified print advertisements for luxury branded sunglasses.

Still, {{few studies have examined}} how, neurofunctionally, consumers are making ethical, food-related decisions. We examined how consumers' ethical concern about a food's production method may relate to how, neurofunctionally, they make decisions whether to purchase that food. Forty-six participants completed a measure {{of the extent to which}} they took ethical concern into consideration when making food-related decisions. They then underwent a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while performing a food-related decision-making (FRDM) task. During this task, they made 56 decisions whether to purchase a food based on either its price (i. e., high or low, the "price condition") or production method (i. e., with or without the use of cages, the "production method condition"), but not both. For 23 randomly selected participants, we performed an exploratory, whole-brain correlation between ethical concern and differential neurofunctional activity in the price and production method conditions. Ethical concern correlated negatively and significantly with differential neurofunctional activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). For the remaining 23 participants, we performed a confirmatory, region-of-interest (ROI) correlation between the same variables, using an 8 -mm 3 volume situated in the left dlPFC. Again, the variables correlated negatively and significantly. This suggests, when making ethical, food-related decisions, the more consumers take ethical concern into consideration, the less they may rely on neurofunctional activity in the left dlPFC, possibly because making these decisions is more routine for them, and therefore a more perfunctory process requiring fewer cognitive resources...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} how usability {{was dealt}} with in four product development organizations active in different sectors: high-end automotive, professional printers and copiers, office coffee makers and fast moving consumer goods. The primary differentiators of the selected cases were whether they were targeting businesses or consumers {{and the degree of}} product complexity. Interviews with 19 product development practitioners were conducted, focussing on three topics: 1) the product development process and the integration of user involvement, 2) multidisciplinary teamwork, and 3) organizational attitude towards usability. Based on the interviews, context descriptions of the companies were created and barriers and enablers for usability were identified. To verify the findings and to discuss remaining issues a feedback workshop was held in which the primary contact from each company participated. The results indicate that differences in product–market combination lead to differences in organizational attitude towards usability. The prioritization of usability in an organization seems to be influenced by the degree of product complexity (complex products are more prone to suffer from usability issues) and whether developers think that usability is a <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration</b> for their clients. The product–market combination a company targets also affects the methods for user-centred design that a company can apply and that are relevant. What methods for user-centred design are used also seems to be influenced by the attitude towards usability: if usability is considered more important, methods that require more resources can be applied.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine how Web-based shopping environments influence the emotional states of consumers, and how these emotions subsequently affect their attitudes and behavioural intentions. To achieve this aim, this study drew theoretical guidance from the Mehrabian-Russell environmental psychology framework (Mehrabian and Russell 1974 b). Building upon the concept of information rate outlined in this framework, this study proposed that two aspects of a Web-based shopping environment would affect the emotional states of pleasure and arousal. The two independent variables examined in this study were the level of interactivity and the depth of information provided by a Web-based shopping environment. A conceptual model was then developed outlining the relationship between these variables and the emotional states of pleasure and arousal, and the effect of these emotional states upon the response variables of Attitude toward the Website, Attitude toward the E-tailer, and <b>Purchase</b> <b>Consideration.</b> To empirically examine this model, a Web-based experiment (using a 3 x 3 between-subjects factorial design) was conducted, where subjects were exposed to a simulated online store for digital cameras. A total of 360 responses were collected from Web users in Australia and New Zealand. To help analyse the dependence relationships outlined in the conceptual model, ANCOVA, two- and three-stage hierarchical regression, and path analysis were used. The results of the study suggest that level of interactivity was a better predictor of pleasure and arousal than depth of information. Moreover, pleasure was found to be a better predictor of the response variables included in the conceptual model than arousal. The implications of these findings are discussed, along with directions for future research...|$|E

Results show the domination of the takeover-context of the research. Two variables accounted for almost all the influence on disclosure of forecasts for both bidders and targets: bid horizon and type of bid. Probability of disclosure of a forecast is greater the shorter the bid horizon and during contested bids. In addition to bid horizon and type of bid, for bidders, year, value of bid and <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration</b> were significant, and for targets value of bid and industry were significant in one of the two models estimated. Evidence supporting the hypothesis that forecast disclosure is more likely when market expectations are out of line with actual results is provided. There is some evidence that forecasts by targets affect the outcome of bids, but there is no such evidence for bidders. Takeover-context variables and forecast-related variables were most relevant in determining disclosures in forecasts. Disclosure content in forecasts was significantly greater during contested bids, in voluntary forecasts and in longer period forecasts. Significantly more assumptions were disclosed by target forecasters and in longer horizon forecasts. Evidence shows a tendency to disclose good news, with some disclosure of bad news. Good news forecasts are more likely during contested bids. Targets are more likely to disclose bad news forecasts, but when bidders disclose bad news it tends to be worse on average than targets' bad news...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{automated}} and scalable garment recommender system using real-time in-store videos that {{can improve the}} experiences of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers’ preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper’s behavior {{in front of the}} mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, <b>purchasing,</b> and/or <b>consideration</b> decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, <b>purchasing,</b> and/or <b>consideration</b> decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers.

40|$|The South African {{consumer}} market is characterised by socio-economic and cultural diversity. Food expenditure patterns, behaviour and preferences differ significantly {{between the various}} socio-economic sub-groups. Packaging information, including red meat classification information, could be an important tangible resource used by consumers to gauge product quality. The first objective of the research reported in {{this paper is to}} investigate the red meat knowledge, usage and perceptions regarding beef and sheep meat classification and related quality parameters among South African consumers. Consumer perceptions of red meat classification were extracted from a comprehensive consumer survey among stratified representative samples of South African low-, middle- and high-income consumers (n = 165, n = 171 and n = 249). The paper also briefly reports on an in-store ‘observational’ research project that was conducted to develop an understanding of the communication of carcass classification to consumers through fresh red meat product labels at independent butchers and large retailers across South Africa (n = 60). Low-income consumers had very limited understanding and gave little attention to red meat classification. Even though middle-class and wealthy consumers also have a limited understanding of red meat classification, about half of these consumers check for a classification mark. Red meat classification was not mentioned by consumers as a major concern regarding red meat, but related aspects were important such as quality, fattiness, tenderness, juiciness, taste, freshness, smell and appearance. <b>Purchase</b> <b>considerations</b> for beef and mutton/lamb focussed largely on safety, appearance, price and eating quality.
