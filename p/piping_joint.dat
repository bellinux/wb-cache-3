40|$|Weld overlay of piping {{was first}} used as a method to repair {{components}} of simple configurations which were known to contain cracking. An adequate ultrasonic examination of these geometries {{can be achieved by}} using a few conventional search units. Currently the application of pre-emptive weld overlays as a mitigation technique and/or to improve the examination surface condition for more complex configurations is becoming more common. These complex geometries may require several focused conventional transducers for adequate inspection of the overlay, the original weld, and the base material. Alternatively ultrasonic phased array probes can be used to simultaneously generate several inspection angles at various focal depths to provide better and faster coverage when compare to conventional methods. This technical update describes the qualification and use of ultrasonic phased array techniques for weld overlay examinations of piping. WELD OVERLAY BACKGROUND INFORMATION Weld overlay {{was first used}} in US power plants in the early 1980 s as an interim method of repairing the welds of flawed <b>piping</b> <b>joints.</b> However due to EPRI research and development of effective ultrasonic (UT) techniques for inspection and corresponding requirements for conditioning th...|$|R

This enables resources and urgency to be assigned appropriately to only those joints that require it. •Further examination of the creep/relaxation characteristics of bolt materials will be presented. This information is based on recent laboratory testing performed on a range of bolt materials and will eventually enable the prediction of the influence of metallic component relaxation on joint integrity. •Assembler Qualification will also be examined, based on the system of training and demonstration that has been developed for the IES “Train-the-Trainer” program that fully complies with ASME PCC- 1 Appendix A...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the remediation of a low-level radiological waste burial site {{located at the}} former James Connally Air Force Base in Waco, Texas. Burial activities at the site occurred during the 1950 's when the property was under the ownership of the United States Air Force. Included is a discussion of methods and strategies {{that were used to}} successfully exhume and characterize the wastes for proper disposal at offsite disposal facilities. Worker and environmental protection measures are also described. Information gained from this project may be used at other similar project sites. A total of nine burial tubes had been identified for excavation, characterization, and removal from the site. The disposal tubes were constructed of 4 -ft lengths of concrete pipe buried upright with the upper ends flush with ground surface. Initial ground level observations of the burial tubes indicated that some weathering had occurred; however, the condition of the subsurface portions of the tubes was unknown. Soil excavation occurred in 1 -foot lifts in order that the tubes could be inspected and to allow for characterization of the soils at each stage of the excavation. Due to the weight of the concrete pipe and the condition of the <b>piping</b> <b>joints</b> it was determined that special measures would be required to maintain the tubes intact during their removal. Special tube anchoring and handling methods were required to relocate the tubes from their initial positions to a staging area where they could be further characterized. Characterization of the disposal tubes was accomplished using a combination of gamma spectroscopy and activity mapping methods. Important aspects of the project included the use of specialized excavation and disposal tube reinforcement measures to maintain the disposal tubes intact during excavation, removal and subsequent characterization. The non-intrusive gamma spectroscopy and data logging methods allowed for effective characterization of the wastes while minimizing disposal costs. In addition, worker exposures were maintained ALARA {{as a result of the}} removal and characterization methods employed...|$|R

Limited experimental work also suggested the complicated material and mechanical property of the fusion zone and the heat affected zone (HAZ) especially in dissimilar weld joints might {{play an important role in}} promoting SCC growth. In our study, different from the former sandwich like weld joint, a model of continuous heterogeneity mechanical property was established, the effect of welded mechanical heterogeneity on the stress-strain field and J-integral along the crack fronts at different locations were simulated in an Alloy 182 -A 533 B dissimilar weld joint by the elastic-plastic finite element method (EPFEM). The results indicate that the crack near the dividing line of base metal (BM) and HAZ has higher resistance to SCC. At the dividing line of HAZ and weld metal (WM), the crack is prone to propagate into the WM, and will present more complex crack morphology and behaviors...|$|R

It is said that lubricant on the screw of the bolts and the nut-seating surface can minimize the variability of axial force acting on flange bolts, while this process might {{make it harder to}} tight the bolts uniformly especially for small bore low rating flanges. So, in this paper the appropriate condition to apply lubricant is clarified by a series of bolt tightening tests and sealing tests results. On the other hand, for the bolted flanges applying spiral wound gaskets, measuring the gasket compress dimensions help us to prevent uneven tightening balance and to perform the appropriate tightening work. Appropriate gasket compress dimensions are also clarified to ensure the sealing performance for the flanges based on the sealing tests results. Based on these test results, recommended flange-tightening methods have been summarized as an instruction and tightening work procedure to improve the sealing performance of the bolted flanges and the workability of flange tightening work...|$|R

40|$|The 00 {{buildings}} {{are expected to}} collapse (per guidance from structure evaluation) during a seismic event in which acceleration level exceeds 0. 15 g. All roof beams may slip off supports, and collapse. Equipment may slip off from supports and fall onto the floor. The cell floor is also supposed to collapse due to structural instability and distortion due to excessive acceleration forces. Following structure collapse, expansion joints in the process <b>piping</b> and <b>joints</b> between the <b>piping</b> and equipment are expected to fail. Preliminary analysis showed that converters are likely to remain intact. The UF{sub 6 } gas released from the break will rapidly interact with moisture {{in the air to}} produce UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } and HF with exothermic energy released of {approximately} 0. 32 MJ/kg of UF{sub 6 } reacted. Depending on the degree of mixing between UF{sub 6 } gas, its reaction products, air and freon (R- 114), there may occur a strong buoyancy force to disperse UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } aerosol particles that are subjected to the gravitational force for settling. Such a chemical reaction will also occur inside the converters. A substantial amount of UF{sub 6 } must be stagnated {{at the bottom of the}} converters. At the interface between this stagnated UF{sub 6 } and air, UF{sub 6 } gas will diffuse into the air, undergo the chemical reaction with moisture there, and eventually be released through the break. Furthermore, lubricant oil fire in the building, if it occurs, will enhance the UF{sub 6 } release into the atmosphere. The purpose of this study is to evaluate source term (UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } and HF) during such a seismic event. This study takes an approach using multiple steps as follows: (1) Source term evaluation at the break due to mixing between UF{sub 6 } and air along with thermal buoyancy induced by chemical reaction energy, (2) Evaluation of additional source term from the converters in which a substantial UF{sub 6 } vapor remains, and (3) Source term evaluation with lubricant oil fire...|$|R

40|$|Air {{conditioning}} {{control systems}} are commonly installed in restaurants, commercial buildings, {{office buildings and}} institutional buildings in Hong Kong. The systems invariably involve the use of fans for moving the air, filters for cleansing, ducts for air distribution, a control system for regulating the amount of heating or cooling automatically and a refrigerating plant connected to the heat exchange surface. The ducts in turn present the possibility of spreading fire and smoke throughout the building or areas served. According to the local Code of Practice for Minimum Fire Service Installations and Equipment [1], when a ventilation or air conditioning control system to a building is provided, it shall stop mechanically induced air movement within a designated fire compartment. In order to fulfil such requirement, the architects and building services engineers will design to install associated equipment of air conditioning control systems to satisfy the relevant fire safety requirements of the local authority, which includes the provision of fire resisting ducting, fire dampers, smoke detectors and fire resisting cables, etc. However, lessons learned from past experience reveal that owners or property management staff of the buildings or covered areas and maintenance contractors will mainly concern the efficiency and energy saving of the systems without paying {{much attention to the}} fire hazards arising from the use of refrigerants. It is also noted that fire or explosion incidents [2] involving air conditioning control systems are often attributed to improper maintenance work conducted by maintenance contractors, such as refilling the refrigerating plant with poor quality refrigerants, recharging refrigerants incompatible with the metal parts of the system, refilling refrigerants at high pressure resulting in bursting of <b>piping</b> and <b>joints,</b> valves contaminated by grease, presence of an ignition source in close proximity of the refrigerating plant, etc. In general, refrigerants present two basic hazards [3], namely toxicity and flammability. Refrigerants mix readily with air and if flammable, may reach flammable concentrations ready to be ignited by an ignition source. As diffusion may not take place rapidly enough to avoid the hazards in the event of leakage, fire or explosion may occur. With reference to a recent fire with explosion incident involving air conditioning control system in a restaurant in Hong Kong, this paper will outline and discuss the fire hazards of refrigerants in air conditioning control systems...|$|R
40|$|Supermarkets are {{probably}} the largest energy users in the commercial sector and are responsible for considerable CO 2 emissions. A typical supermarket may consume {{on the order of}} million kWh annually. One of the largest uses of energy is for refrigeration, which can be as much as half of the store total. In most cases, refrigeration systems employ direct expansion air refrigerant coils as the evaporators in display cases and coolers. Compressors and condensers are kept in a remote machine room located in the back or {{on the roof of the}} store. As a consequence, large amount of refrigerant is needed to charge the refrigeration system, on the order of thousand kg. Furthermore, a significant risk of important annual leakages (on the order of ten percent of the total charge annually) is a consequence of the large number of <b>piping</b> and pipe <b>joints</b> used. Nowadays advanced supermarket systems can reduce both annual energy consumption and total equivalent warming impact (TEWI). One of these advanced solutions is the water-loop self-contained refrigeration system with modulating compressors (WLSC). In this paper a real WLSC supermarket located in Italy is considered and its performances during the summer period are analyzed and compared with those of a simulated multiplex benchmark solution with fixed evaporation and condensation pressures and thermostatic expansion valve. The comparison shows that the WLSC system leads to a 12. 6 % electric energy reduction. The main advantage comes from the possibility to decrease the average compression ratio when modulation is required. Moreover the WLSC solution lets a 71 % 15 -year TEWI reduction, which is mainly possible thanks to drastic reductions of both refrigerant charge and leakages...|$|R
