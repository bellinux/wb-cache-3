50|$|They are forgiving, {{allowing}} partial {{results and}} functions to work. One or more {{parts of a}} program can work correctly, even if other parts are unfinished or broken. This makes writing and debugging programs easier, and faster. Sequential programming usually needs every <b>program</b> <b>line</b> and character to be correct for a program to run. One error usually stops the whole program and prevents any result.|$|E

WITH-FM, in Baltimore, Maryland (1950s and 1960s), {{had to keep}} its FM carrier on the air until 2AM for restaurant subscribers, and could not sign-off the main FM carrier until that time and thus had to run a repeat of its previous day's evening concert on its main FM <b>program</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

50|$|HAL/S is {{a mostly}} free-form language: {{statements}} may begin anywhere {{on a line}} and may spill over the next lines, and multiple statements may be fitted onto the same line if required. However, non-space characters in the first column of a <b>program</b> <b>line</b> may have special significance. For instance, the letter 'C' in the first column indicates that the whole line is a comment and should be ignored by the compiler.|$|E
50|$|In addition, its low-resolution {{graphics}} commands have different names from their Integer BASIC/Applesoft II counterparts. All command names {{are of the}} form PLTx such that GR, COLOR=, PLOT, HLIN and VLIN are called PLTG, PLTC, PLTP, PLTH, and PLTV, respectively. The command for returning to text mode, known as TEXT in other versions, is simply TEX, and carries the proviso {{that it has to}} be the last statement in a <b>program</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to graphics and sound commands, Graphics BASIC also provides various other useful commands such as [...] {{to list the}} file directory of a device, [...] to return {{the position of a}} joystick, [...] to program function keys, [...] to renumber the current <b>program</b> <b>line</b> numbers. Graphics BASIC also added an [...] command to perform error capturing, a [...] command that allowed variables to be passed to subroutines, and added [...] to the [...] command.|$|E

50|$|The premise for {{offensive}} {{programming is}} {{to distinguish between}} expectable errors, coming from outside the <b>program's</b> <b>line</b> of defense, however improbable, versus preventable internal errors that shall not happen if all its software components behave as expected.|$|R
50|$|From the {{invention}} of computer programming languages up to the mid-1970s, many if not most computer programmers created, edited and stored their <b>programs</b> <b>line</b> by line on punched cards. The practice was nearly universal with IBM computers in the era.|$|R
50|$|ScriptBasic {{also has}} an open {{interface}} for preprocessor developers. These are modules that may act not only during run-time but also compile time, thus {{making it possible to}} alter the language. Currently there is a single preprocessor that delivers debugger functionality. This lets the BASIC programmer run the BASIC <b>program</b> <b>line</b> by line, examine variable contents, set break points and all the usual debugging features. This debugger supports not only the command line version but also the web server implementation allowing full interactive debugging of CGI applications in BASIC.|$|E
5000|$|Memory {{space was}} too {{precious}} for storing textual error messages, so FOCAL used a clever work-around: error messages instead displayed the start {{address of the}} error-managing routine as a floating-point number. For example, in the FOCAL-69 implementation the division by zero error was managed by code starting at memory address octal 4333; division by zero at a <b>program</b> <b>line</b> numbered [...] produced the error message , where [...] represents memory page 28 plus an offset of 73 words. Most FOCAL sites had an [...] "error number to error message" [...] listing taped up near the terminals.|$|E
50|$|This example {{shows the}} {{systematic}} process {{that takes place}} whilst the algorithm is processed. The initial value of x is zero, but i, although defined, has not been assigned a value. Thus, its initial value is unknown. As we execute the <b>program,</b> <b>line</b> by line, the values of i and x change, reflecting each statement of the source code in execution. Their new values are recorded in the trace table. When i reaches the value of 11 because of the i++ statement in the for definition, the comparison i <= 10 evaluates to false, thus halting the loop. As we also {{reached the end of}} the program, the table test also ends.|$|E
5000|$|Additional APL {{characters}} were available by overstriking one character with another. For example, the log symbol(⍟) {{was formed by}} overstriking [...] with [...] This extended the graphic capabilities of the earlier teleprinters, but made it more complicated to correct mistakes and editing <b>program</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

5000|$|By abbreviating keywords, it was {{possible}} to fit more code on a single line (line lengths were usually limited to 2 or 4 screen lines, depending on the specific machine). This allowed for a slight saving on the overhead to store otherwise necessary extra program lines, but nothing more. All BASIC commands were tokenized and took up 1 byte (or two, in the case of several commands of BASIC 7 or BASIC 10) in memory no matter which way they were entered. And, such long lines could be difficult to edit. The [...] command displayed the entire command keyword - extending the <b>program</b> <b>line</b> beyond the 2 or 4 screen lines which could be entered into program memory.|$|E
50|$|In March 2010 The History Channel {{cancelled}} {{the show}} {{before the final}} episode of season one was aired.

According to Triage Entertainment website they did have a film crew filming for a season two in mid-to-late 2010. As of December 2010 the only network that has been stated by Triage Entertainment to pick up the show has been Speed Channel but no official air date has been announced or whether the show will air as Madhouse or under a different show name. No updates of any filming or of the show returning as of July 2011.|$|E
50|$|Otto F.

He now learned the publishing operation and the work of a publisher from scratch, as warehousemen and billing clerk, and his way led up to the position of the vice cirector and joint owner.
