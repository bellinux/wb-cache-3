40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{fundamentals}} of {{a new class of}} parallel mechanisms called parallel mechanisms with configurable platforms as well as the design and analysis of parallel robots that are based on those mechanisms. Pure parallel robots are formed by two rigid links, the base and the end-effector, connected in parallel by independent serial chains, called legs. The novel concept behind parallel robots with configurable platforms is that the rigid end-effector is replaced by a closed-loop chain, the configurable platform. Some of the links of this closed-loop chain are attached to the legs so its configuration can be fully controlled from the actuators located on the base. The use of a closed-loop chain instead of a rigid end-effector allows the robot to interact with the environment using multiple contact points on the platform. This results in a robot that can combine motion and grasping capabilities into a structure that provides an inherent high structural stiffness. All the actuators are grounded on the base requiring no additional motor at the end-effector location to provide the grasping.

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{diversity of}} seed traits is an intriguing feature and {{critical for the}} overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named phenoSeeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a <b>pick-and-place</b> <b>robot</b> and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e. g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rapeseed (Brassica napus), and barley (Hordeum vulgare), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass.

An advantageous arrangement of several sputter guns, mounted on a rotative flange, gives the possibility to sputter under different deposition angles or to sputter different materials on the same substrate. The chamber is also equipped with a modular sample stage, which allows for the integration of different sample environments, such as a sample heating and cooling device. The design of HASE is unique in the flexibility.

40|$|Parallel elastic {{actuators}} (PEAs) {{have shown}} the ability to reduce the energy consumption of robots. However, regular PEAs do {{not allow us to}} freely choose at which instant or configuration to store or release energy. This paper introduces the concept and design of the bidirectional clutched parallel elastic actuator (BIC-PEA), which reduces the energy consumption of robots by loading and unloading a parallel spring with controlled timing and direction. The concept of the BIC-PEA consists of a spring that is mounted between the two outgoing axes of a differential mechanism. Those axes can also be locked to the ground by two locking mechanisms. At any position, the BIC-PEA can store the kinetic energy of a joint in the spring such that the joint is decelerated to zero velocity. The spring energy can then be released, accelerating the joint in any desired direction. Such functionality is suitable for robots that perform rest-to-rest motions, such as <b>pick-and-place</b> <b>robots</b> or intermittently moving belts. The main body of our prototype weighs 202 g and fits in a cylinder with a length of 51 mm and a diameter of 45 mm. This excludes the size and weight of the nonoptimized clutches, which would approximately triple the total volume and weight. In the results, we also omit the energy consumption of the clutches. The BIC-PEA can store 0. 77 J and has a peak torque of 1. 5 N. m. Simulations show that the energy consumption of our one-degree-of-freedom setup can be reduced by 73 %.

40|$|A {{printed circuit}} board (PCB) {{assembly}} task requires that a set of components be picked from their respective pickup locations and then be placed at their respective placement locations on the card being assembled. A <b>pick-and-place</b> <b>robot</b> is used for automated assembly of PCB's. The overall assembly time depends on two dierent de-cision variables (i) the pickup locations of the components (in general there are several alternative pickup locations available, whereas the placement location of components is xed and {{is determined by the}} card being assembled), and (ii) the sequence in which the pickup and placement of components is performed. In this paper we develop a technique based on integer programming to determine both an optimal assignment of pickup locations as well as an optimal sequence of pickup and placements of the com-ponents. We demonstrate that the overall optimization problem is an instance of linear integer programming problem, and hence it is computationally intractable. We obtain near optimal solutions|that are computationally tractable|using the techniques of (i) minimum weight matching for determining an optimal assignment of pickup locations, and (ii) traveling salesman problem for determining an optimum sequence of pickups and placements. Near optimal solutions provide an upper bound for the optimal as-sembly time; we consider a linear programming relaxation of the problem to obtain a lower bound for the optimal assembly time. The gap between the upper bound and the lower bound provides a measure of closeness of near optimal solutions to an optimal one. Finally, we use simulations to compare the saving in overall assembly time using the techniques developed here and some of the techniques that are currently in use in industrial settings...|$|E
40|$|The phenoSeeder {{system is}} based on a <b>pick-and-place</b> <b>robot</b> to analyze and handle {{individual}} seeds of very different sizes from Arabidopsis to maize. By default, morphometric traits are monitored at 3 different sensor stations. (1) At a 2 D-imaging station seeds are disseminated on a glass plate where they are selected according to user-defined selection criteria. A selected seed gets an ID and its traits (projected area, length, width, color distribution) are measured. (2) It is then picked up and conveyed to a 3 D-imaging station where a series of images are taken from different angles and a surface reconstruction procedure delivers 3 D information (volume, length, width, height, etc.). (3) The seed is then carried to a balance to get the actual weight which, divided by the measured volume, provides seed density. Finally, the seed is directly planted into substrate, sorted into storage containments according to user-defined classification criteria, or individually stored in a multi-well plate. This cycle is repeated for each single seed. All obtained seed data including the current position of a seed are stored in a database which also delivers the parameters needed for the workflow of the system. We want to systematically study how the different seed traits correlate and which seed traits are important for a developing plant of various species or genotypes under optimal or adverse environmental conditions. The main objective of the phenoSeeder approach is thus seed-to-plant tracking which includes monitoring seed germination and measurement of plant growth at early developmental stages and beyond. The modular implementation of the phenoSeeder system allows for easy integration of additional sensors enabling measurement of additional parameters of individual seeds, beside the morphometric traits described above. Modalities we plan to integrate are near infra-red (NIR) providing information about seed content, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) delivering water content or biomass, or X-ray CT for imaging internal seed structures allowing to extract e. g. embryo or endosperm size.

40|$|The {{quality of}} seeds is {{essential}} for plant breeding with very different variability of relevant traits for different crops. In DPPN we have developed a modular phenoSeeder system consisting of an industrial <b>pick-and-place</b> <b>robot</b> and different measurement stations. It enables precise and effi-cient seed handling with low error rates and collecting seed traits such as size or weight of dif-ferent plant species. The robot is equipped with different tools used for seed handling. Depend-ing on seed size, each tool uses a specifically designed needle to which vacuum or overpressure is supplied to suck or release individual seeds, respectively. The picking system has been success-fully tested for seeds of various species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus or Hordeum vulgare varying in size from 180 μm to 8 mm. The seed handling cycle starts at a so called seed source station. It consists of a circular glass pane on which the seeds are manually dispersed and which is uniformly illuminated by an LED ring from below. A color camera underneath the glass pane acquires images of the seeds. The images are analyzed to extract both seed positions and properties such as projected seed area, length and width. For the different seed types individual segmentation parameters have been determined. The position of a single seed is defined by its image coordinates describing the seed’s center of mass. A 2 D-homography is used to map image coordinates to world coordinates which can be approached by the robot. After picking up a seed, it can be carried to measure-ment stations like a balance or a 3 D-reconstruction station. Each single seed gets its own ID and all measured traits are transferred to a database allowing seed-to-plant tracking in phenotyping pipelines. The modular software concept {{makes it possible to}} simply add new measurement stations without having to change the existing software. After traits are measured, the seed is released either into a pot with soil or at a defined position of a well plate. Currently a sowing procedure without moving to a measurement station takes 2. 9 to 3. 3 seconds depending on the pot’s distance to the seed source station. In case that a seed could not be released, the robot moves to a needle cleaner station where two rotating brushes clean the needle. Another part within DPPN is the construction of a quickSeeder system, based on a similar robot as that of the phenoSeeder. It will enable fast planting of seeds of which the respective traits were scored and which were placed in well plates by the phenoSeeder sys-tem beforehand...|$|E

40|$|A {{key feature}} of {{semiconductor}} manufacturing {{over the past}} 30 years has been its ability to produce very small chips, the current state-of-the-art in production being around 0. 25 mm in size. Conventional assembly {{is based on the}} handling of individual components by <b>pick-and-place</b> <b>robots.</b> This technology is unsuitable for many microsystems due to the di±culty of handling small (less than 1 millimeter) and thin (less than 100 micrometers) components and of scaling up these techniques for mass production. Thus, micro-assembly of miniature electronics demands processes that are able to accurately handle components with dimensions of several tens of micrometers with high assembly rates onto a broad range of substrates. Nowadays, three ways of solving this problem are under investigation: * Development of new processes based on mechanical handling of the micro- components; * Improvement of the conventional pick-and-place equipment; * Development of laser-induced transferring processes. This work presents a study on a new technique based on the laser-induced release of the micro-component from its carrier, its transfer towards the interconnecting substrate and its landing. This technique provides a very high assembly speed of over 100 components per second, compared to 2 components per second using the conventional pick-and-place method. In some specific areas, this approach can already be applied. This work summarizes the experimental study of the component detachment pro- cess, release dynamics and placement accuracy for di®erent laser sources and process parameters. Examples are given to show the possibility of controlling and manipulating the kinetic and dynamic behavior of the released component. Major attention is paid to factors responsible for the placement accuracy. Important issues presented are: the role of the spatial intensity profile of the laser beam and possibilities to improve its homogeneity, control of the component's release speed and heating up of the components by the laser pulse.

The thrust of this work is to present the development of a three-degree-of-freedom revolute robot manipulator amenable to pick-and-place operations in {{the industry}}. Appropriate kinematic equations of the manipulator are obtained, and then used to develop algorithms for locating predetermined positions of a small object in a customized workspace. An Arduino-based controller circuit is built to implement the algorithms, and servomotors are used to carry out independent joint control of the manipulator. The positions of the object are identified with the aid of light-dependent resistors (LDR). Besides, in order to aid easy fabrication of links and overall system assembly, a 3 D model of the manipulator is designed. The results of the work, showing effective and satisfactory operation of the manipulator, are presented.
