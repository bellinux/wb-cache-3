500|$|In Singapore, {{the rule}} of law {{doctrine}} has been the topic of considerable disagreement and debate, largely through differing conceptions of the doctrine. These conceptions can generally be divided into two categories developed by legal academics, the [...] "thin", or formal, conception and the [...] "thick", or substantive, conception of {{the rule of}} law. The thin conception, often associated with the legal scholars Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz, advocates the view that {{the rule of law}} is fulfilled by adhering to formal <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements,</b> such as the stipulations that all laws be prospective, clear, stable and constitutionally enacted, and that the parties to legal disputes are treated equally and without bias on the part of judges. While people subscribing to the thin conception do not dismiss the importance of the content of the law, they take the view that {{this is a matter of}} substantive justice and should not be regarded as part of the concept of the rule of law. On the other hand, the thick conception of the rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule, it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to Proposition 218, {{the courts}} allowed local {{agencies}} significant flexibility in determining property-related fee or charge amounts.
