50|$|Sodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> (sodium <b>calcium</b> EDTA), {{also known}} as <b>edetate</b> <b>calcium</b> {{disodium}} among other names, is a medication primarily used to treat lead poisoning. This includes short term and long term lead poisoning. For lead encephalopathy it is typically used together with dimercaprol. It {{does not appear to}} be useful for tetraethyllead toxicity. It is given by slow injection into a vein or into a muscle.|$|R

50|$|Treatment {{for lead}} {{poisoning}} normally involves {{the administration of}} dimercaprol and succimer. Acute cases may {{require the use of}} disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate,</b> the <b>calcium</b> chelate of the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). It has a greater affinity for lead than calcium, with the result that lead chelate is formed by exchange and excreted in the urine, leaving behind harmless calcium.|$|R
40|$|Manganese (Mn) is an {{essential}} element for metabolic pathways {{but it can be}} toxic when present in excessive amounts in the body. Hypermanganesemia along with dystonia, polycythemia, characteristic MRI brain findings in the basal ganglia, and chronic liver disease are the hallmarks of an inherited Mn transporter defect due to mutations in the SLC 30 A 10 gene. We are reporting three siblings who presented with features of dystonia, polycythemia, MRI brain showing basal ganglia hyperintensity on T 1 weighted images and chronic liver disease. Blood Mn levels were markedly elevated in the affected patients. Mutation analysis of DNA samples of the affected children confirmed a homozygous missense mutation in SLC 30 A 10. Chelation therapy with intravenous disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> was started in two siblings and led to a marked decrease in whole blood Mn. Oral Penicillamine was later added to the therapy which further improved blood Mn levels. This is a rare disorder {{and is one of the}} potentially treatable inherited metal storage disorders. It can be fatal if left untreated. Penicillamine may be an effective alternative to disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{project was}} aimed at {{evaluation}} of comparative therapeutic efficacy of two treatment regimes {{for the treatment of}} lead poisoning in sheep. For this purpose 20, two-months-old, lambs of Buchi breed were used as experimental animals. Five animals were kept as healthy control, whereas the remaining 15 animals were given oral aqueous solution of lead acetate daily. The dose was started from 5 mg/kg bodyweight and was increased gradually till it reached 100 mg/kg body weight by the end of 2 nd month when clinical toxicosis was observed. Clinical findings included diarrhea, hindquarter weakness and reduction of feed intake, accompanied by anemia and elevated blood lead levels up to 2. 72 ppm. The 15 toxicated animals were divided into three groups A, B and C comprising of 5 animals each. Disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate,</b> which was used to treat animals of group A, resulted in 52. 7 % fall in blood lead level in 5 days. A combination of disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> and thiamine hydrochloride was used to treat animals of group B, which showed 73. 8 % fall in blood lead levels. Group C served as untreated control. Thus, combination therapy appears to be more effective for treatment of lead toxicosis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chelation {{therapy has}} been used as a means of {{reducing}} the body burden of lead for five decades. Intravenous sodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> has been the preferred agent, but there is increasing evi-dence that dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is also a potent chelator of lead.

40|$|Although {{manganese}} is {{an essential}} trace metal, {{little is known about}} its transport and homeostatic regulation. Here we have identified a cohort of patients with a novel autosomal recessive manganese transporter defect caused by mutations in SLC 39 A 14. Excessive accumulation of manganese in these patients results in rapidly progressive childhood-onset parkinsonism–dystonia with distinctive brain magnetic resonance imaging appearances and neurodegenerative features on post-mortem examination. We show that mutations in SLC 39 A 14 impair manganese transport in vitro and lead to manganese dyshomeostasis and altered locomotor activity in zebrafish with CRISPR-induced slc 39 a 14 null mutations. Chelation with disodium <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> lowers blood manganese levels in patients and can lead to striking clinical improvement.

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} {{a role for}} different predisposing factors in cases of copper toxicity, but any association between these factors and biochemical changes in the sheep have not been studied. Therefore {{the objective of this}} study was to look for the changes that occurred in sheep treated regularly with a parenteral form of copper. After identifying some of these parameters, further sheep were subjected to stressors that may be encountered in normal farming practice and the changes in response to copper treatment were compared to those of sheep not subjected to that stessor but treated with the same dose of copper. Eleven Romney rams were regularly monitored to measure any changes that occurred in certain biochemical parameters when the sheep received a weekly subcutaneous injection of 50 mg of copper <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate.</b> The biochemical parameters included serum levels of sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) and serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), blood copper concentration, and wool copper content. At fortnightly intervals, liver biopsy samples were collected for an estimation of the copper content and for a histopathological examination. It was found that the activity of SDH and SGOT in the serum became elevated as the liver accumulation of copper increased. SDH levels were the first to change and became elevated up to six weeks earlier than SGOT. Although the pathological changes in the hepatocytes developed progressively, their severity and extent did not have a direct relationship to liver copper content. There way no significant change in the copper content of either blood or of wool during the period that the liver copper content increased. The determination of indicators of early changes in cases of toxicity allowed stressors to be superimposed on copper therapy to assess whether such stressors might influence copper toxicity. The sheep involved received 3 mg Cu/kg bodyweight as copper <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> on the premise that sheep of low bodyweight might receive a double injection of the currently recommended dose of 50 mg per sheep. The same biochemical parameters of SDH and SGOT activity, blood copper concentration and liver copper content were used to assess the potentiating effects on copper toxicity of sheep first treated with copper <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> parenterally and then subjected to various stressors. For this purpose 56 sheep, with additional control animals where appropriate, were divided into their respective groups. The stressors included dehydration by removing 25 % of blood volume, starvation by fasting for 48 hours, exposure to cold (5 °C) for 5 days, and exposure to heat (40 °C) for 5 days. Other sheep were either immersed in an organophosphate insecticide, or treated with thiabendazole anthelmintic at a dose rate of 100 mg/kg bodyweight. Pregnant sheep, and others heavily parasitised (e. p. g. > 1570) were similarly created. The stressors of dehydration and cold, pregnancy, the application of insecticide or the administration of anthelmintic showed no evidence of enhancing the toxic effects of copper. However the stressors of starvation, heat, and parasitism did potentiate toxicity and resulted in approximately half of the sheop in each group dying from copper toxicity. A further series of experiments used 60 sheep, divided into 14 groups; each group being given a different schedule of copper administration which consisted of one of the stressors and/or one of a series of formulations of copper consisting of salts made up in various bases. Blood samples were collected hourly for 16 hours and the rate of change of blood copper concentration was measured. In the sheep that were starved, the rate of change of blood copper concentration increased to 0. 141 Mg Cu/l/hr for animals starved for 72 hours in comparison with a rate of 0. 056 mg Cu/l/hr for animals given access to food and water. Those sheep that received 50 mg of copper <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> in either of two proprietary formulations; one containing polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVP) and the other without PVP but the same dose contained in half the volume, showed a mean blood copper concentration rate of increase of 0. 017 mg Cu/l/hr. An increase in the dose to 100 mg Cu increased the rate of uptake of copper to 0. 022 mg Cu/l/hr, whereas a 50 mg dose diluted in an equivalent amount of water showed an increase in the rate of translocation of copper to 0. 036 mg Cu/l/hr. The four sheep subjected to heat stress or given copper by mouth as copper edetate at a dose rate of 0. 33 mg/kg showed a blood copper concentration increase to 0. 025 mg Cu/l/hr, whereas 7 gm of oral copper oxide needles administered to three 50 kg sheep did not produce any increase in blood copper concentration during the period of study. Starved sheep also showed changes in their blood concentrations of glucose and albumin. Blood glucose reduced from a mean of 4. 7 gm/ 100 ml to a mean of 2. 4 gm/ 100 ml in the nine sheep starved over 72 hours, plasma albumin increased from 1. 30 gm/ 100 ml to 2. 26 gm/ 100 ml, and total protein rose by 10. 2 %. Deaths following the administration of copper therapeutically have been reported on many occasions. Therefore it was decided to measure the effects of copper therapy on the liver copper storage of sheep which initially had a range of liver copper concentrations. A "copper deficient" farm which regularly reports lambs with enzootic ataxia, and a "copper sufficient" farm with no reported signs of copper deficiency in sheep, were selected. Two hundred sheep on the copper deficient farm and fifty sheep on the copper sufficient farm were treated once annually with 50 mg of copper <b>calcium</b> <b>edetate</b> given subcutaneously. This dose was adequate to maintain the liver copper content of all treated sheep on the copper deficient farm above 70 ppm Cu D. M. However in the sheep grazing the copper sufficient farm, liver biopsy samples indicated that copper, apparently surplus to requirements, was stored in the liver resulting in copper concentrations in all sheep in excess of 510 ppm Cu D. M. Another study measured the uptake of copper by the liver in groups of four sheep of four different breeds common in New Zealand. These breeds were the Border Leicester, N. Z. Romney, Suffolk and Merino. There was no significant difference between the former three breeds, but the Merinos retained less copper in their livers after grazing pasture for 3 months (88 ppm vs l 64 ppm), and also following administration of copper by subcutaneous injection (215 ppm vs 330 ppm). The results of this work indicate that certain common stressors met with in everyday sheep management, may enhance copper toxicity. Copper should never be administered to sheep unless the requirement has been confirmed, and at the time of administration particular attention should be paid to avoiding those circumstances that might lead to starvation of the sheep...|$|R

40|$|In each of 2 years, {{pregnant}} mares (n = 10 and n = 23) kept at pasture {{were divided}} into copper supplemented or unsupplemented groups, and injected with <b>calcium</b> copper <b>edetate</b> or saline. Their foals were examined, weighed, measured and clinically scored at 2 weekly intervals from birth to 160 days of age to assess growth and development, and evidence of developmental orthopaedic disease (DOD). Foal liver biopsies were harvested by Tru-cut biopsy needle at different ages for determination of copper concentration. At 160 days of age, articular surfaces were examined for cartilage irregularities, which were sampled for histology and histochemistry. Cartilage samples were harvested from irregularities and defined sites for histology. Distal third metacarpal and metatarsal bones (Mc 3 and Mt 3) were sawn frontally, radiographed and processed for histology. The parenteral copper supplementation {{had no effect on}} mare or foal liver copper concentration, and was not associated with reduced evidence of DOD in foals. The prevalence and severity of DOD lesions was very low. Two different patterns of decline in foal liver copper concentration were observed. Enlargements of the distal Mc 3 and Mt 3 physeal region were present in all foals, but were not associated with pain, lameness, or abnormalities in the metaphyseal growth plate. In vivo techniques to assess body composition could be used to predict chemical body composition, particularly ultrasonographic rump fat thickness measurements. Fillies were significantly fatter than colts at 160 days of age, despite no differences in mean birth weight and weight gain. The only growth parameters associated with the prevalence of DOD lesions was rapid growth rate between 5 and 6 months of age, which was associated with more lesions in the tibiotarsal joint. The New Zealand Thoroughbred industry should weigh and condition score foals at monthly intervals, keeping careful records. Foals can be successfully raised at pasture, with good growth, and a low incidence of DOD lesions at 160 days of age, without being excessively fat.

40|$|The {{appropriate}} clinical {{management of}} children who are moderately poisoned with lead (Pb) is under active investigation. To determine the pattern of change in blood Pb (BPb) levels in the absence of chelation therapy, we followed moderately Pb-poisoned children (initial blood Pb levels 1. 21 - 2. 66 mumol/l or 25 - 55 micrograms/dl) for 6 months with repeated BPb level measurements. Chelation therapy was not administered because all the children had negative lead mobilization tests indicating limited response to the chelating agent, <b>calcium</b> disodium <b>edetate</b> (CaNa 2 EDTA). Eligible children received the following interventions: notification of the health department to remediate lead hazards; reinforced educational efforts about the toxicity sources and treatment of Pb during 10 clinic and 3 home visits; and iron therapy for children with ferritin levels less than 16 micrograms/l. To quantify the lead paint hazards in the home, we combined a visual rating of the surfaces (intact to peeling) with an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement of the lead content of the painted surface. The sum of these assessments is termed the home environmental score (HES). Data were analyzed from 79 children. BPb levels declined by 27 %, on average, over 6 months. HES was correlated with BPb at enrollment, but neither the initial nor later HES measurements predicted BPb at other time points. The HES was highest at enrollment and declined by 50 % and 75 % at the second and third home visits, respectively. However, only a minority of the children (20 %) achieved an HES of 0, indicating no lead paint hazards at home. Despite some ongoing Pb exposure, a parallel fall in BPb levels was observed in subgroups of children with either initially low or high HES (above or below the median HES of 37). Iron status did not account for the change in BPb levels. These data provide evidence that our measure, the HES, is quantifiably related to BPb levels in children, that this correlation is significant only prior to intervention; and that BPb levels decline in children who are moderately poisoned with Pb after they are enrolled in a comprehensive intervention program, {{even in the absence of}} chelation therapy and in the presence of ongoing lead paint exposure and Fe deficiency...|$|R
40|$|Cinnarizine and {{flunarizine}} are <b>piperazine</b> derivatives with <b>calcium</b> antagonist and anticonvulsant {{properties and}} are used widely {{in the treatment of}} vertigo and circulatory disorders. They have been implicated recently in the aggravation, or even the induction, of parkinsonism in elderly patients. Because the aetiology of parkinsonism has been suggested as having a mitochondrial component, we have investigated the effects of both compounds on mitochondrial respiration and on the activities of the individual respiratory chain complexes. In intact mitochondria from rat liver, both drugs inhibited respiration rates, with substrates entering at Complex I (glutamate/malate) and Complex II (succinate). These effects could be explained by potent inhibitions (Ki 3 - 10 microM) of both complexes. Complex I is inhibited at a site near the ubiquinone-binding site, which is not competitive with respect to ubiquinone, whereas the inhibition of Complex II is apparently caused by competition with ubiquinone. Furthermore, the inhibition of NADH oxidation by flunarizine in submitochondrial particles caused an NADH-dependent generation of superoxide. These inhibitory properties of both compounds could be significant factors in the aggravation or induction of parkinsonism in elderly patients, in whom mitochondrial function already may be impaired...|$|R

40|$|This thesis set out {{to examine}} the {{difference}} in efficacy {{of the most commonly}} used copper supplements in New Zealand dairy herds. There is limited information on copper supplementation in New Zealand dairy cattle in the area of chelated (organic) verses sulphated (inorganic) supplements and {{this study was designed to}} provide more information to the New Zealand dairy industry. Sixty non-pregnant mixed age Friesian dairy cows, on the basis of liver copper concentrations, were randomized into 6 groups of 10 animals so that each group had the same mean liver copper concentration. The treatments were Group 1, non-supplemented control; Group 2, 150 mg copper/day as copper glycine chelate drench; Group 3, 150 mg copper/day as copper amino acid chelate drench; Group 4, 150 mg copper/day as copper sulphate drench; Group 5, 20 g copper oxide wire particles administered as a bolus and Group 6, l 00 mg of copper, as <b>calcium</b> copper <b>edetate,</b> administered as a subcutaneous injection on days 1 and 58. The duration of the study was 116 days and the cows were fed baleage, with limited access to pasture. On days - 5, 14, 28, 58, 86, and 116 after supplementation, liver samples were obtained by a biopsy technique and blood from the coccygeal vein for copper determinations. The mean initial copper concentration in the liver of the cows used in this study was 827 (SE 109) μmol/kg fresh weight (FW). The mean liver copper concentration of the cows in the control group decreased significantly (P< 0. 05), from 827 (SE 109) μmol/kg FW on day 1 to 554 (SE 114) μmol/kg FW on day 116. Over days 58 to 116 the mean liver copper concentration of the copper glycine chelate, copper amino acid chelate, and copper sulphate groups where significantly (P< 0. 05) greater than the non-supplemented control group. The combined means over the 6 sampling events showed that the group supplemented with the copper glycine chelate had significantly (P< 0. 05) greater liver copper concentration than the group supplemented with copper sulphate (1064 versus 910 <mol/kg FW). The mean liver copper concentrations of the group which received the copper oxide wire particle boluses were consistently greater than the control group; however a significant difference was only achieved at the day 58 sampling. The group injected with copper edetate achieved a significant rise in liver copper concentration on day 86 after being injected on day 58. However, when the group was injected at day 1 no significant rise was achieved at day 14, 28, or 58. The copper supplements had no effect on serum copper concentrations. Despite the large variation (SE 109) in initial liver copper status between the cows, this did not influence the amount of copper stored in the liver regardless of the copper supplement used. The data was analysed in two groups, cows with lower liver copper (553 μmol/kg FW). and cows with higher liver copper (1050 μmol/kg FW). and there was no difference between the two groups in response to the copper treatments. The initial liver copper concentration of the cows was high. A copper intake of 150 mg copper/day was effective in increasing the copper concentration of the liver of dry non-pregnant New Zealand dairy cows. As an oral supplement, copper glycine chelate was more effective in increasing liver copper concentrations than copper sulphate. Overall the oral supplements (copper glycine, copper amino acid chelate, and copper sulphate) were more effective in increasing liver copper concentration than the copper oxide wire particle bolus and the twice given 2 ml copper edetate injections. The copper oxide wire particle bolus maintained liver copper concentrations at 843 μmol/kg FW which is an adequate liver copper concentration. Therefore in this situation where liver copper concentrations where adequate prior to supplementation the bolus did provide enough copper. This study indicated that in order to maintain liver copper concentration in dry non-pregnant New Zealand dairy cows, on a low copper diet, a 2 ml injection may have to be given every 45 days...|$|R
