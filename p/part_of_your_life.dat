40|$|Introduction A sudden trauma like {{a spinal}} cord injury will have a {{significant}} impact on you and the people close to you. You may see <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> change a great deal. Other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> may not change at all. Regardless of the extent <b>of</b> <b>your</b> injury and disability, being hurt and having a disruption to <b>your</b> <b>life</b> may present unexpected problems or changes. This chapter provides information about services that are available at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Magee Rehabilitation Hospital and in the community to provide assistance. Coping with a Spinal Cord Injury After a {{spinal cord injury}}, you may experience many different feelings at one time or another, such as anger, worry, sadness, even hopelessness. These feelings are more likely to occur when you are under stress — as when your body undergoes dramatic changes in its functioning or when you have been in the hospital for a long time. Sometimes they are aimed in the wrong direction, like when your are really angry with one person or situation and you are nasty to someone else. While you are still basically the same person inside, there are many adjustments that you are going through. Rehabilitation is aimed at helping you learn new things — both physical and emotional, so that you can learn to live with <b>your</b> change <b>of</b> body functioning and all the changes in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> that it may bring. The emotional changes and behaviors you see in yourself may surprise you. It is important to recognize that what you are experiencing is normal, and also that what is normal for you may be very different from how someone else reacts. Really, if you think about it, it would be unnatural not to have some sort of reaction. Another aspect of dealing with this whole business of coping has to do with change. This is a transitional period for you. What is true for you today or this week may be different next week or next month. People change at their own speed. (23 pages, 371 Kb...|$|R

6000|$|I have {{sometimes}} tried {{that way of}} steadying and guiding attention; and I commend it to you. I need not {{tell you that you}} will find that most books worth reading once are worth reading twice, and--what is most important of all--the masterpieces of literature are worth reading a thousand times. It is a great mistake to think that because you have read a masterpiece once or twice, or ten times, therefore you have done with it. Because it is a masterpiece, you ought to live with it, and make it <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> daily <b>life.</b> Another practice is that of keeping a commonplace book, and transcribing into it what is striking and interesting and suggestive. And if you keep it wisely, as Locke has taught us, you will put every entry under a head, division, or subdivision.[1] This Is an excellent practice for concentrating your thought on the passage and making you alive to its real point and significance.

5000|$|Black Sabbath {{released}} Sabbath Bloody Sabbath on 1 December 1973. For {{the first}} time in their career, the band began to receive favourable reviews in the mainstream press, with Rolling Stone calling the album [...] "an extraordinarily gripping affair", and [...] "nothing less than a complete success". Later reviewers such as Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as [...] "a masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection", while also displaying [...] "a newfound sense of finesse and maturity". The album marked the band's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the United States. It reached number four on the UK charts, and number eleven in the US. In the UK, it was the first Black Sabbath album to attain Silver certification (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in February 1975.

40|$|Adjusting to {{a sudden}} income loss in your family {{involves}} thinking {{about more than just}} dollars and cents. You have many attitudes, values, and feelings about money from your childhood and family upbringing. Many of these are so deeply a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> everyday <b>life</b> that you don’t even realize how those feelings affect your money decisions or your reactions to money decisions of other family members. Everyone experiences changes in life. Sometimes you plan for it and sometimes things happen over which you have little control. When the lat ter happens, you are facing an unplanned change. Unplanned income changes can result from unex pected job loss or loss to your home or business by forces of nature such as tornadoes, floods, and drought. Market changes in commodities or stocks, or major expenses resulting from an illness, equipment break down, burglary, or accident can also cause such changes. Unlike a planned change, it is much more difficult to make adjustments for unplanned income changes because the choice to change has been taken away from you. This publication will help you understand what happens in the first few months after an unplanned income loss as you deal with the overlapping emotional, economic, and social effects (Figure 1). A major decrease in income requires that all family members recognize the grief they feel over the loss (emotional effect), reassess how money will be used within the family (economic effect), and make a conscious effort to manage the inevitable disagree ment and potential conflict that might arise (social effect). Doing so will help you live with the conse quences of the unplanned income change, develop new options, and move on...|$|R
40|$|Being {{immersed}} in the Art School for the most <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> professional <b>life</b> is a privileged position to find oneself in. But what if this immersion also presents a certain entrapment in the connoisseurship and knowledge that you have acquired, embodied, and are passing on. This paper is about the creative liberation of two female visual communication academics, through the pursuit of amateur practices in un-professional curatorship of personal obsessions. The first of these practices is a long-standing obsession with Marcel Duchamp, which has been enacted in the unofficial spaces and places of true fandom, where obsessions are lived out and ideas of being a neutral historian {{no longer need to}} be adhered to. The practice that has emerged is one based on leisure, travel and appropriation through collecting, recording and archiving. The importance of the process far outweighs any potential outcome or the production of any individual artefacts, as it is these alternative ways of experiencing, thinking about and documenting Marcel Duchamp that are the ultimate centre and purpose of this practice, - a kind of Duchamp Tourism. The second amateur practice could be considered to have made a similar journey of engagement only in reverse. The experience of childhood holidays on the island of Crete started a lifelong obsession with the collection of touristic artefacts and an immersion in its visual and historic heritage. An added dimension of ‘living out’ being the amateur, in as far as whilst loving a foreign place you still always remain ‘un-official’ – an outsider. This paper is an opportunity to discuss not only the freedom that is inherent in the enactment of amateur practices, but also the struggle to remain within the joy of the process rather than arriving at a destination. How can we preserve the freedom of ‘unknowing’ {{at the same time as}} the agency of the objects and experiences collected keeps on ‘acting back’ (Ingold 2009); beckoning to be solidified out of the aesthetic experience of the ‘making’ to new, but potentially dead-end, forms...|$|R

I observe among you some lines of an institution, which, in its original, might have been tolerable, but these half erased, and the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions. It does not appear, from all you have said, how any one perfection is required toward the procurement of any one station among you; much less, that men are ennobled on account of their virtue; that priests are advanced for their piety or learning; soldiers, for their conduct or valour; judges, for their integrity; senators, for the love of their country; or counsellors for their wisdom.

6000|$|There is {{something}} strange and fascinating in this mysterious impersonality of the gondola. It has an identity {{when you are}} in it, but, thanks to their all being of the same size, shape and colour, and of the same deportment and gait, it has none, or as little as possible, as you see it pass before you. From my windows on the Riva there was always the same silhouette--the long, black, slender skiff, lifting its head and throwing it back a little, moving yet seeming not to move, with the grotesquely- graceful figure on the poop. This figure inclines, as may be, more to the graceful or to the grotesque--standing in the [...] "second position" [...] of the dancing-master, but indulging from the waist upward in a freedom of movement which that functionary would deprecate. One may say as a general thing that there {{is something}} rather awkward in the movement even of the most graceful gondolier, and something graceful in the movement of the most awkward. In the graceful men of course the grace predominates, and nothing can be finer than the large, firm way in which, from their point of vantage, they throw themselves over their tremendous oar. It has the boldness of a plunging bird and the regularity of a pendulum. Sometimes, as you see this movement in profile, in a gondola that passes you--see, as you recline on your own low cushions, the arching body of the gondolier lifted up against the sky--it has a kind of nobleness which suggests an image on a Greek frieze. The gondolier at Venice is your very good friend--if you choose him happily--and {{on the quality of the}} personage depends a good deal that <b>of</b> <b>your</b> impressions. He is a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> daily <b>life,</b> <b>your</b> double, your shadow, your complement. Most people, I think, either like their gondolier or hate him; and if they like him, like him very much. In this case they take an interest in him after his departure; wish him to be sure of employment, speak of him as the gem of gondoliers and tell their friends to be certain to [...] "secure" [...] him. There is usually no difficulty in securing him; there is nothing elusive or reluctant about a gondolier. Nothing would induce me not to believe them for the most part excellent fellows, and the sentimental tourist must always have a kindness for them. More than the rest of the population, of course, they are the children of Venice; they are associated with its idiosyncrasy, with its essence, with its silence, with its melancholy.|$|R
60|$|There are a {{great many}} people who imagine that {{elementary}} teaching might be properly carried out by teachers provided with only elementary knowledge. Let me assure you that that is the profoundest mistake in the world. There is nothing so difficult to do as to write a good elementary book, and there is nobody so hard to teach properly and well as people who know nothing about a subject, and I will tell you why. If I address an audience of persons who are occupied in the same line of work as myself, I can assume that they know a vast deal, and that they can find out the blunders I make. If they don't, it is their fault and not mine; but when I appear before a body of people who know nothing about the matter, who take for gospel whatever I say, surely it becomes needful that I consider what I say, make sure that it will bear examination, and that I do not impose upon the credulity of those who have faith in me. In the second place, it involves that difficult process of knowing what you know so well that you can talk about it as you can talk about your ordinary business. A man can always talk about his own business. He can always make it plain; but, if his knowledge is hearsay, he is afraid to go beyond what he has recollected, and put it before those that are ignorant in such a shape that they shall comprehend it. That is why, to be a good elementary teacher, to teach the elements of any subject, requires most careful consideration, if you are a master of the subject; and, if you are not a master of it, it is needful you should familiarise yourself with so much as you are called upon to teach--soak yourself in it, so to speak--until you know it as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> daily <b>life</b> and daily knowledge, and then {{you will be able to}} teach anybody. That is what I mean by practical teachers, and, although the deficiency of such teachers is being remedied to a large extent, I think it is one which has long existed, and which has existed from no fault of those who undertook to teach, but because, until the last score of years, it absolutely was not possible for any one in a great many branches of science, whatever his desire might be, to get instruction which would enable him to be a good teacher of elementary things. All that is being rapidly altered, and I hope it will soon become a thing of the past.|$|R
40|$|Some {{things you}} cant touch, see or grab. But they are there. Always and everywhere. Silently invading every <b>part</b> <b>of</b> you, <b>your</b> {{everyday}} <b>life</b> {{and the things}} in it. The less you speak of it the more you have it. The more you have it the less you want and can address it. Shame is not logic, {{it is not the}} brain reacting, hardly our conscience, it's the body. It is truly and fully a physical feeling. For the first time I give myself permission to dig into all of these materials, I indulge in the styles and tastes that I've long felt forbidden for me. I wont be limited in my choices of symbols, coloration or aesthetics in ways that good taste and patriarchal structures have taught me to be. I am letting that guard down and diving in, using it in advantage for my work and my theme. I feast on fake pearls, glitter, shells and plastics. I turn towards what is considered shameful or bad taste and work with it, embrace it and elevate it. Not to show that is the new "right" but to justify for all of the times that I have turned away from it because of shame. To be a person with feelings of shame is to be a person that automatically will try to turn from itself. Shame is intimately entwined with femininity, it is silently inherited from generation to generation. It is experienced only by some bodies and not others. It is not being able to see your own value. It is the loneliest feeling in the world, but really a marker for something much bigger and deeper than one individual. It is materialized everywhere around us. It is not me, but it is not not me...|$|R
