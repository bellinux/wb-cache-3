25|$|The 60 extant {{photographs}} from their journey show that Hunt and Baker were keen {{on the new}} medium and familiar with its techniques. It was a real partnership: both men brought their own strengths to the process, and images that survive demonstrate their aesthetic acumen {{as well as their}} journalistic desire to show the settings in which they worked. One image of an unveiled Ghawazee female dancer, signed on the negative by Hunt himself, is likely the earliest <b>photographic</b> <b>portrait</b> of a Middle Eastern woman. Another image of the less photogenic view {{from the rear of the}} Parthenon demonstrates two men unafraid to indulge their take on a revered landmark.|$|E

2500|$|By 1981, {{the museum}} {{had more than}} 2,000 items in its collection. Two major 19th century {{photography}} collections were added by the museum that year. The first such acquisition was the Frederick Hill Meserve Collection of 5,419 glass negatives produced by the studio of famed Civil War photograph Mathew Brady and his assistants. Using historically accurate chemicals, paper, and techniques, prints were made of the negatives and the prints placed on rotating display. The Washington Post later described {{the importance of the}} acquisition by saying it made the NPG the [...] "epicenter" [...] for Brady scholarship. Later that year, 5,400 Civil War-era glass negatives produced by photographer Alexander Gardner were also purchased from the Meserve family. This included the famous [...] "cracked-plate" [...] portrait of Abraham Lincoln taken in February 1865, which was the last <b>photographic</b> <b>portrait</b> of Lincoln taken before his death in April 1865.|$|E

2500|$|Appearances of Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (1928–1967) {{in popular}} culture are common {{throughout}} the world. Although during his lifetime he was a highly politicized and controversial figure, in death his stylized image {{has been transformed into}} a worldwide emblem for an array of causes, representing a complex mesh of sometimes conflicting narratives. Che Guevara's image is viewed as everything from an inspirational icon of revolution, to a retro and vintage logo. Most commonly he is represented by a facial caricature originally by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick and based on Alberto Korda's famous 1960 photograph titled Guerrillero Heroico. The evocative simulacra abbreviation of the <b>photographic</b> <b>portrait</b> allowed for easy reproduction and instant recognizability across various uses. For many around the world, Che has become a generic symbol of the underdog, the idealist, the iconoclast, or the martyr. He has become, as author Michael Casey notes in Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image, [...] "the quintessential postmodern icon signifying anything to anyone and everything to everyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Newman's deepest {{relationships}} were with men, {{he had many}} affectionate friendships with women. One {{of the most important}} was with Maria Giberne, who knew him in his youth and followed him into the Catholic Church. She was a noted beauty, who even at fifty was described by one admirer as [...] "the handsomest woman I ever saw in my life". A gifted amateur artist, she painted many portraits of Newman at various periods, as well as several of the pictures hanging in the Birmingham Oratory. Newman had a <b>photographic</b> <b>portrait</b> of her in his room and was still corresponding with her into their eighties. Emily Bowles, who first met Newman at Littlemore, was the recipient of some of his most outspoken letters on what he felt to be the mistaken course of the extreme infallibilists and his reasons for not [...] "speaking out" [...] as many begged him to do. When she visited Newman at the Birmingham Oratory in 1861, she was welcomed by him [...] "as only he can welcome"; she would never forget [...] "the brightness that lit up his worn face as he received me at the door, carrying in several packages himself".|$|E
2500|$|Queen Elizabeth II has {{posed for}} a number of Canada's {{prominent}} photographers, the first being Yousuf Karsh, who made a formal portrait of Elizabeth when she was a 17-year-old princess and, later, took a series of official pictures of the Princess, in formal and informal poses, just months before she acceded to the throne. Karsh was commissioned on two subsequent occasions to create series of pictures of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, once prior to Elizabeth's 1967 tour of Canada for the centenary of Canada's confederation, when he photographed the royal couple at Buckingham Palace, and again in 1984, creating a set of portraits that included a shot of the Queen with her corgi, Shadow. Prior to her second tour of Canada as queen in 1959, Elizabeth requested that a Canadian photographer take her pre-tour pictures and Donald McKeague of Toronto was selected. Then, in 1973, Onnig Cavoukian, also from Toronto, made a <b>photographic</b> <b>portrait</b> that was dubbed [...] "The Citizen Queen" [...] because of the informal way in which Elizabeth was depicted. Rideau Hall photographer John Evans captured the sovereign on film in 1977, during her Silver Jubilee stay in Ottawa; Evans portrayed the Queen following her return from opening parliament. More recently, photographic portraits of Queen Elizabeth II were made in 2002, as part of her Golden Jubilee celebrations, and in 2005, when she marked the centenaries of Alberta and Saskatchewan.|$|E
