5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
25|$|After his {{ordination}} in Rome in 1910, Coady {{began teaching}} at St. FX. He put on special classes {{for students at}} risk of failing, and <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> being able to teach maths to anyone. He honed his considerable oratorical skills and developed a talent for making complex concepts easily understood.|$|E
25|$|Macaulay {{retained}} a passionate interest in classical literature throughout his life, and <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> {{his knowledge of}} Ancient Greek literature. He likely had an eidetic memory. While in India, he read every ancient Greek and Roman work that was available to him. In his letters, he describes reading the Aeneid whilst on vacation in Malvern in 1851, and being moved to tears by the beauty of Virgil's poetry. He also taught himself German, Dutch, and Spanish, and remained fluent in French.|$|E

25|$|Jiang Wei <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> his {{familiarity}} with the cultures and customs of the Qiang, Di, and other ethnic minority groups living in northwestern China. As such, he often suggested to the Shu government to use material wealth to induce these tribal peoples to ally with Shu and make a coordinated attack on the Wei-controlled territories in the region. However, Fei Yi, the de facto head of the Shu government, strongly disagreed with Jiang Wei's view and blocked Jiang Wei's attempts {{to carry out his}} plan. He argued that they should stop attacking Wei and focus on policies promoting internal stability and prosperity.|$|E
25|$|Aymes was a {{technically}} correct batsman who <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> {{not giving}} his wicket away, and was often required {{to shore up}} batting inadequacies in the side. Hampshire struggled in their two seasons in Division 1 (in 2000 and 2000); this unfortunately coincided with Aymes' hand and knee injuries. Aymes was regarded as the best wicket-keeper in the County Championship, being equally adept at standing back to the West Indies fast bowler Malcolm Marshall and {{standing up to the}} leg spin of Shane Warne. It was in standing up to his medium pace bowlers that brought the downfall of David Ward in the 1991 Natwest Trophy Final, which turned the fate of the match. Aymes was also unlucky not to participate in the 1998–99 tour of Australia after a slight dip of form {{towards the end of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|Charles II {{was a man}} who <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> his wit and his worldliness. He {{was well}} known as a philanderer as well. Highly witty, playful, and sexually wise poetry thus had court sanction. Charles and his brother James, the Duke of York and future King of England, also {{sponsored}} mathematics and natural philosophy, and so spirited scepticism and investigation into nature were favoured by the court. Charles II sponsored the Royal Society, which courtiers were eager to join (for example, the noted diarist Samuel Pepys was a member), just as Royal Society members moved in court. Charles and his court had also learned the lessons of exile. Charles was High Church (and secretly vowed to convert to Roman Catholicism on his death) and James was crypto-Catholic, but royal policy was generally tolerant of religious and political dissenters. While Charles II did have his own version of the Test Act, he was slow to jail or persecute Puritans, preferring merely to keep them from public office (and therefore to try to rob them of their Parliamentary positions). As a consequence, the prose literature of dissent, political theory, and economics increased in Charles II's reign.|$|E

His 'no nonsense' approach was criticised by footballing purists such as Dario Gradi, as Swan's 'crunching tackles' could cause injuries to opposition players.|$|E
500|$|After {{retirement}} from first-class cricket {{at the end}} of the 1960 season in England, McCool returned to Australia, taking up market gardening with a specialty in rare blooms at Umina Beach on the Central Coast of New South Wales. He continued playing club cricket in the Newcastle competition for Belmont until rheumatism forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55: [...] "Rheumatism in my right hand made it embarrassing for me to continue.

He had thick hair, manicured nails, a well-trimmed beard and an athletic figure. An opponent of antisemitism, he attended dinners publicizing the plight of Russian Jews and regularly addressed Jewish religious and social organizations avoided by others. He rented pews in many New York churches, supported about a dozen missionaries and {{was described as a}} generous donor to hospitals and charitable societies. Shepard was politically ambitious, and decided to build Woodlea as a symbol of power and influence. Shepard had horses and carriages which were ridden by the family in parks, and he <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> his equestrianism. Shepard was a long-time friend of US Senator Chauncey Depew.|$|E
500|$|Conflicting reports {{reached the}} outside world and for a time it was feared that Tom had died. In the press, Horatio was accused of {{ignoring}} warnings and allowing Aborigines to encroach on his property. The retribution was also called excessive. Tom vehemently defended his father against any perceived criticism. Privately, in his letter to Harrison, he admitted, [...] "if we had used common precaution all would have been well". It was later revealed that, prior to leaving the camp, Tom advised Horatio to be watchful of the local Aborigines, but according to Hammersley, [...] "the old man <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> being able to manage the blacks ... and said they would never harm him." [...] The Queensland press, still {{in the wake of the}} massacre, suggested that Wills, [...] "now a Queenslander", be approached to captain the colony's cricket team.|$|E

Mervyn Stockwood, in his address at the funeral service, praised Driberg as [...] "a searcher for truth", whose loyalty to the socialist cause was beyond question. This verdict was echoed by Michael Foot, who in a postscript to Driberg's memoir wrote of Driberg's [...] "great services" [...] to the Labour Party in the various offices that he occupied. Foot believed that Driberg's homosexual passion, rather than bringing him fulfilment, had [...] "condemned him to a lifetime of deep loneliness". The Times obituarist described Driberg as [...] "A journalist, an intellectual, a drinking man, a gossip, a high churchman, a liturgist, a homosexual", the first time, according to journalist Christopher Hitchens, that the newspaper had ever defined a public figure specifically as homosexual.|$|E

500|$|Schwarzkopf was {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel and ordered to a second tour in Vietnam, leaving in June 1969. He was assigned as executive officer to {{the chief of staff}} at MACV headquarters, based at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon. Schwarzkopf later recalled this second tour of duty was very different from his first; there were 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, the Vietnamization strategy was in effect, and recent events such as the Tet Offensive and My Lai Massacre put troops under increased political scrutiny. In December 1969 he gained his first field command, taking over the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry, 198th Infantry Brigade at Chu Lai. He later said these troops were initially demoralized and in poor condition, racked with rampant drug use and disciplinary problems as well as a lack of support from home. Despite the brigade's otherwise controversial performance record, Schwarzkopf was quickly regarded as one of its best combat commanders. He aggressively stepped up patrols and operations to counter Viet Cong infiltration in the battalion's sector. He developed his leadership attitudes during this command. Fellow commander Hal Moore later wrote that during his time in Vietnam Schwarzkopf acquired his well-known temper, while arguing via radio for passing American helicopters to land and pick up his wounded men. He also showed a preference of leading from the front and <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> avoiding the rear areas, which he called a [...] "cesspool".|$|E
500|$|Warner {{learned from}} twelfth man Leo O'Brien that Woodfull was badly injured. Later in the afternoon, while Ponsford and Richardson were still batting, Warner and Palairet visited the Australian {{dressing}} {{room with the}} intention of enquiring about Woodfull's health. Accounts vary about what followed. According to the original newspaper reports and Fingleton's later description, Woodfull was lying on the masseur's table, awaiting treatment from a doctor, although this may have been an exaggeration for dramatic effect. Leo O'Brien described Woodfull as wearing a towel around his waist, having showered. Warner expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it." [...] Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present. Warner recalled saying, [...] "Apart from all that, we most sincerely hope you are not too badly hurt," [...] to which Woodfull replied, [...] "The bruise is coming out." [...] Embarrassed and humiliated, Warner and Palairet turned and left. Fingleton noted that Woodfull spoke quietly and calmly, which increased the effectiveness of his words. He also pointed out that Warner <b>prided</b> <b>himself</b> <b>on</b> sportsmanship, so an accusation of [...] would have stung the Englishman. Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.|$|E
