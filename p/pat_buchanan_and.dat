5|$|The biggest {{endorsement}} that Tancredo received {{was that}} of Bay Buchanan, the sister of perennial presidential candidate <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> <b>and</b> former Treasurer of the United States under President Ronald Reagan. Immediately following her endorsement she was named the Senior Advisor of the campaign. Other advisors included Phil Alexander, formerly of the Buchanan campaigns in 1996, and 2000. New Hampshire advisor, Shelly Uscinski formerly the New Hampshire chairman of the Christian Coalition. Iowa advisor and former U.S. Senate candidate in 2002 Bill Salier.

In the end, the Federal Election Commission sided with Buchanan, and that ticket appeared on 49 of 51 possible ballots.|$|E

25|$|In the 2000 presidential election, Perot {{refused to}} become openly {{involved}} with the internal Reform Party dispute between supporters of <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> <b>and</b> John Hagelin. Perot was reportedly unhappy with {{what he saw as}} the disintegration of the party, as well as his own portrayal in the press; thus, he chose to remain quiet. He appeared on Larry King Live four days before the election and endorsed George W. Bush for president. Despite his earlier opposition to NAFTA, Perot remained largely silent about expanded use of guest-worker visas in the United States, with Buchanan supporters attributing this silence to his corporate reliance on foreign workers. Some state parties affiliated with the new (Buchananite) America First Party.|$|E

500|$|While {{considering}} {{a run for}} president, during an October 2006 interview with The Conservative President 2008 website, Baldwin expressed his frustration with the Republican Party, which he believed was on a course of [...] "self-destruction" [...] and that was only kept afloat by the [...] "absurd liberalism of Democrats." [...] He praised Congressmen Tom Tancredo and Ron Paul as well as activists <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> <b>and</b> [...] Alan Keyes, but stated that the Republican Party had steered {{too far to the}} left for him to support any of their candidates for president. When asked if he would run for president in 2008 he stated that he had [...] "no desire to run" [...] but that he was [...] "always open to God's will."

500|$|Within days of Rockefeller's announcement, Agnew {{was being}} wooed by {{supporters}} of {{the former vice president}} Richard Nixon, whose campaign for the Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and in the wake of Rockefeller's withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his [...] "second choice". When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew's words and actions after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> <b>and</b> also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew's reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a [...] "formidable candidate" [...] but did not commit his support: [...] "A lot of things have happened since his withdrawal... I think I've got {{to take another look at}} this situation".|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{approval}} ratings were around 80percent during the Gulf War, {{and he was}} described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his , which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep. By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40percent. Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but {{with the end of}} the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> <b>and</b> Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention—with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform—many moderates were alienated. Clinton then pointed to his moderate, [...] "New Democrat" [...] record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious. Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton. Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a [...] "new beginning".|$|E
5000|$|The 2000 presidential {{campaign}} of <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> conservative pundit <b>and</b> adviser to both President Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, began on March 2, 1999 in New Hampshire. Buchanan had twice sought {{the nomination of}} the Republican Party (in 1992 and 1996).|$|R

500|$|On February 14, Trump {{withdrew from}} the race. [...] In a press release, he cited infighting in the Reform Party as not [...] "conducive to victory," [...] {{concluding}} he could not win the election as the party's nominee and so, as pledged, would not continue his campaign. [...] He expressed concerns {{about the direction of}} the party, particularly its membership, referring to David Duke, <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> <b>and</b> Lenora Fulani as a Klansman, a Neo-Nazi, and a Communist, respectively. [...] However, he lauded party members Russ Verney, Jack Gargan, and others as [...] "wonderful people" [...] he was honored to meet. [...] Trump lamented the exit of Jesse Ventura from the party, arguing [...] "without Jesse, the Reform Party is just an extremist shell and cannot be a force or even a factor in 2000." [...] Trump declined to seek the nomination of Ventura's new Independence Party, finding it [...] "healthy" [...] but too young to win. [...] He expressly kept open the possibility of running for president in 2004. [...] Trump publicly announced his withdrawal on The Today Show in an interview with Matt Lauer. He explained that though he still could have won the Reform Party nomination, he believed he would only win 20 percent in the general election, which he did not want. [...] He claimed the party {{was on the verge of}} [...] "self-destructing" [...] and referred to it as a [...] "total mess." [...] In response, Pat Choate, who became the new Reform Party chairman after the unseating of Gargan, disputed Trump's claim about the party and said Trump's campaign was meant only [...] "to smear Pat Buchanan." [...] He declared Trump [...] "unwelcome" [...] to seek the party's 2004 presidential nomination. Choate later remarked that he believed Trump's campaign was a [...] "Republican dirty trick" [...] orchestrated by Roger Stone [...] "to disgust people and drive them away from the Reform Party." [...] Stone argued that John McCain [...] "running on Trump's message" [...] and surging in the polls signaled an end to the Trump campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Perot's {{candidacy}} received increasing {{media attention}} when the competitive {{phase of the}} primary season ended for the two major parties. With the insurgent candidacies of Republican <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> <b>and</b> Democrat Jerry Brown winding down, Perot was the natural beneficiary of populist resentment toward establishment politicians.

Not from where I'm sitting and what I'm looking at." [...] Cunningham estimated the number of Buchanan supporters in Palm Beach County to be between 400 and 500. Asked how many votes he would guess Buchanan legitimately received in Palm Beach County, he said, [...] "I think 1,000 would be generous.

2500|$|The term {{remained}} academic {{until the}} late 1990s when it was misappropriated by paleoconservatives {{as part of an}} ongoing Culture War in which it is claimed that the very same theorists who were analysing and objecting to the [...] "massification" [...] and mass control via commercialization of culture were in fact working in a conspiracy to control and stage their own attack on Western society, using 1960s counter culture, multiculturalism, progressive politics and political correctness as their methods. This conspiracy theory version of the term is associated with American religious paleoconservatives such as William S. Lind, <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> <b>and</b> Paul Weyrich, but also holds currency among alt-right/white nationalist groups and the neo-reactionary movement. Adherents of the conspiracy theory often seem to mean that the existence of things like modern feminism, civil rights, gay rights and atheism are dependent on the Frankfurt School, even though these movements predate The Frankfurt School.|$|E
