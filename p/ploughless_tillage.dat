40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this report forms part of the endeavour to draw up guidelines for successful implementation of <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> techniques (cultivation to 10 cm replacing ploughing). Results and experiences from over 120 field trials carried out during the period 1975 - 86 are presented in the first section. On average, use of <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> has meant reduced yields of winter wheat, spring barley, winter and spring oilseed rape and sugarbeet and somewhat improved yields of oats, first year grass leys and potatoes. The results from <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> were generally improved by use of twin mounted tractor tires instead of single mounted, placement of artificial fertilizer instead of broadcasting and removal of straw. Incidence of seeding weeds increased on average by 25 % and stoloniferous weeds by 100 %. Most suitable soils were peats, sandy Loamy tills, silty Loams or silty clay loams and heavy clays. The second section consists of results of soil physical and chemical investigations carried out during 1980 - 1984. Soil physical changes observed included increased compaction in mid-topsoil, improved saturated hydraulic conductivity in the Lower topsoil and upper subsoil and improved aggregate stability in the seedbed. Reduced rate of evaporation Was also recorded in a pilot investigation. Soil chemical investigations showed increased Levels of readily-soluble phosphorus and potassium in the surface Layer and reduced Levels in mid- and Lower topsoil. Humus content also increased in the surface Layer and decreased in mid- and Lower topsoil. No relationship was found between pH and cultivation technique. On {{the basis of the}} results obtained, a procedure to evaluate site suitability for <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> is described. The effects of <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> on root development and evaporation were investigated in 1985 and results from these investigations are described in a third section of this report. Root studies showed that root development was invariably obstructed in mid-topsoil, an effect ascribed to high mechanical resistance. Studies on evaporation showed that <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage,</b> in contrast to conventional tillage, gave a better effect of reduced evaporation after a wet followed by a dry period than after a wholly dry period. It was also shown that superficial incorporation of harvest residues gave a better effect of reduced evaporation on a silty clay Loam than on a heavy clay. In conclusion, results and experiences obtained from these investigations are used to suggest practical measures for best applying <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> while minimizing those problems arising when soil is no Longer ploughed annually...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} the period 2007 - 2009 in the Uhrusk Experimental Farm (Lublin region) belonging to the University of Life Sciences in Lublin. Different tillage systems - plough and <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> - were the experimental factors. In the plough tillage system, tillage involved skimming done after the harvest of the forecrop and autumn ploughing. In the <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> system, only the herbicide Roundup 360 SL (active substance - glyphosate) was applied after the harvest of the forecrop. In both tillage treatments, spring tillage involved field cultivating {{and the use of}} a tillage assembly consisting of a cultivator, cage roller, and harrow. The present experiment evaluated weed infestation of the crop expressed by the number and air-dry weight of weeds and their species composition. Under the conditions of <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage,</b> air-dry weight of weeds in the spring wheat crop was shown to increase significantly compared to plough tillage. The tillage systems under comparison did not differentiate the number of weeds per 1 m 2. Spring wheat sown using plough tillage was colonized most extensively by the following weed species: Avena fatua L., Stellaria media (L.) Vill., Galium aparine L., Amaranthus retroflexus L., Chenopodium album L., and Consolida regalis Gray. In the <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> treatments, the following weeds were predominant: Stellaria media (L.) Vill., Avena fatua L., Fallopia convolvulus (L.) A.

40|$|In recent years, a {{significant}} increase in weed infestation of agricultural crops with Artemisia vulgaris has been observed in the south-western region of Poland. The ease of migration of this expansive species results {{from the fact that it}} does not face competition from segetal weeds and therefore poses a great threat to the ecological balance. During the period 2008 – 2011, a floristic study was carried out using the Braun-Blanquet method in an abandoned field adjacent to a maize monoculture grown under two tillage systems: plough and <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage.</b> These observations allowed an evaluation of the actual risk of spread of Artemisia vulgaris depending on tillage system. The vicinity of the abandoned field had {{a significant}} effect on the penetration of Artemisia vulgaris into maize crops. Higher numbers of individu-als of this species were found under <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> compared to plough tillage, regardless of the distance from the field edge, and its increased competitive effects on Viola arvensis L. and Ve-ronica persica L. could be observed. The lowest grain yield was obtained under <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> where the strong competitive effects of Artemisia vulgaris were observed even in the plot most distant from the abandoned field adjacent to the maize crop.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} the influence of conventional and <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> systems upon infestation in two differentiated fertilization and plant protection levels on light soil. Before harvest winter rye there was determined weed infestation of square-frame method. There were estimated weed species composition and air dry matter of weeds in two randomly selected place. Number of monocotyledonous weeds, total weeds and dry matter of weeds was higher on the objects with <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> system compared with conventional tillage. Intensive fertilization and plant protection decreased number of dicotyledonous weeds in canopy of winter rye. Conventional tillage system decreased Apera spica-venti occurrence in a canopy of winter rye and increased number of Plantago major plants.

40|$|Based on a 3 -year field {{experiment}} conducted on medium heavy mixed rendzina soil, {{the present study}} evaluated the effect of chemical plant protection on the species composition, number and air-dry weight of weeds infesting crops of winter spelt wheat cultivars (‘Frankenkorn’, ‘Badengold’, ‘Schwaben- speltz’, and ‘Oberkulmer Rotkorn’) sown under ploughing and <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> systems. Ploughing tillage involved skim- ming done after harvest of the previous crop and pre-sowing ploughing, while in the <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> system ploughing was replaced with cultivating. Chemical weed control included {{the application of the}} herbicides Mustang 306 SE and Attribut 70 WG. Plots where the herbicides were not used were the control treatment. On average, from 21 to 30 weed species colonised the winter spelt wheat crops compared. Galium aparine and Apera spica-venti occurred in greatest numbers and their percentage in the total number of weeds was estimated at 26 – 35 % and 17 – 25 %, respectively. The cultivar ‘Frankenkorn’ was the least weed-infested. Both the number of weeds in the crop of this cultivar and their above-ground dry weight were lower compared to the other cultivars. The use of reduced tillage significantly increased the air-dry weight of weeds compared to ploughing tillage. Nevertheless, it should be indicated under <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> conditions the application of chemical crop protection reduced weed biomass by 59 % compared to the control treatments without crop protection...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> on {{physical}} and chemical properties of soils were investigated during the period 1980 - 1984 in field trials on Ultuna (heavy clay), Lanna (heavy clay), Rudsberg (silt loam) and Lönnstorp (clayey till). Trial plots on Ultuna, Lanna and Lönnstorp were laid down in the autumn of 19 ? 3 and those on Rudsberg in the autumn of 1974. In the unploughed experimental plots, conventional autumn ploughing to 20 - 25 cm was replaced by two or three stubble cultivations to approximately 10 cm depth. Preparation of the seedbed and sowing, on all plots, were carried out using conventional methods. Straw was not removed from any of the plots but was chopped at harvesting. The aim of these investigations was primarily to study the effects of 5 - 10 years shallow tilling on {{physical and chemical}} properties of soils. Soil physical investigations revealed several differences between unploughed and ploughed treatments. Some effects of <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> were: increased degree of compaction in the middle topsoil: improved saturated hydraulic conductivity in the lower topsoil and upper subsoil; reduced rate of infiltration in field measurements; a shallower and somewhat coarser seedbed; improved aggregate stability in the seedbed. In a pilot experiment during the summer 1984, it was also observed that the unploughed treatment offered a better protection against evaporation, particularly after rainfall. After approximately 10 years of <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> the content of ammonium lactate extractable phosphorus and potassium has increased in the surface layer and decreased in the middle and lower layers of the topsoil. Organic matter content has followed a similar pattern. <b>Ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> has not significantly influenced the organic matter, P or K contents of the subsoil. There was no apparent relationship between tillage method and pH in either top- or subsoil. In the discussion, results of these investigations are used to form the basis of a method to assess the suitability of a site for ploughless or conventional tillage...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} in 2006 – 2008 in a static field experiment started in 1993 in the Research Field Station at Lipnik near Stargard Szczeciński, on Eutric Cambisol soil. In soil samples taken from following layers:   0 – 10, 10 – 20, 20 – 30 cm of soil under ploughing, ploughless or direct drilling tillage systems, species composition and number of weed diaspores were evaluated. In the samples, in total there were diaspores of 17 weed species. Chenopodium album was the dominant weed species in all soil layers and tillage systems. The number of diaspores was significantly dependent on tillage system and soil layer. Irrespective of soil depth, the highest total number of diaspores (12251 pcs × m - 2) was in the treatment with the ploughing tillage system, while for the other treatments this number was significantly lower: by 14 % for <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> and by 51 % for the direct drilling treatment. Regardless of soil tillage system, the highest total number of diaspores (19936 pcs × m - 2) was in the top layer, while in the next layers this number was significantly lower (by 62 and 87 %, respectively). The largest number of weed diaspores was in the top layer of soil after long application of the <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> system...|$|E
40|$|Shallow {{cultivation}} to a {{depth of}} 5 - 7 cm has in the last years become a realistic alternative to common <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> (cultivation depth 1 0 - 15 cm), especially in Great Britain, France and Germany. Shallow cultivation means avoiding unnecessary soil loosening, preserving the soils natural structure, increasing activity in the top layer and decreasing fuel consumption with less power requirement. Two years ago VäderstadVerken AB developed a tillage tool for shallow cultivation called Rexius Carrier with System Disc. The tool consists of a heavy roller and a front tool called Systern Disc. The front tool includes two rows of concave, close mounted discs, which combined with a trave 1 ing speed of 10 - 14 km/h leaves a well leveled, 100 % work through, top layer. The aim of this thesis was to test shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier under Swedish conditions, as autumn cultivation and as spring cultivation after a catch crop. This thesis includes the results of three different series of field experiments. The first, "Minimized autumn tillage to a spring crop", R 2 - 4122, was started in the autumn 2000. The result of the trial showed the highest yield for mouldboard ploughing and the lowest for the shallow cultivation, with deeper <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> in between. The second series, "Spring seeding without autumn tillage, including a catch crop", R 2 - 4123, was started in the spring of 2001. The series contained three experiments on sites with different clay contents, and compared autumn and spring ploughing with <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> to different depths and with different tillage intensities. The shallow cultivation performed well in this comparison. Despite a less suitable seedbed, plant establishment and crop yield in the shallow cultivated plots was nearly as high as for autumn ploughing. The weed population was greatly reduced in the shallow cultivated plots. The spring ploughed plots had less sui 1 able seedbed properties, poorer germination, more weed and lower crop yield than autumn ploughed plots. The third series, "Shallow cultivation to winter seed", started in the autumn of 200 1. In this series conventional mouldboard ploughing was compared with shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier, chisel ploughing with and without roller and heavy disc harrow with and without roller. Before the second cultivation the germination of weeds and volunteers was counted, without any differences between different treatments. Before the seeding, the amount of straw and stubble on the surface was compared using digital image analysis. No differences between the treatments were found. After the seeding, the seedbed properties and the plant establishment was determined. Due to the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn, which had an equalizing effect on the analyzed parameters, {{no significant differences between the}} treatments were found. The trials has shown that only shallow cultivation before seeding can give good opportunities for the following crop. The trial R 2 - 4123 showed that shallow spring cultivation after a catch crop can maintain harvest yield compared to conventional mouldboard ploughing. Shallow autumn cultivation has a future as an alternative to conventional methods. The plant establishment were quite comparable despite the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} over eight consecutive years at three sites, on clay or clay loam soils. In a split-plot design, two main treatments (mouldboard ploughing to 25 cm depth and disc or springtine cultivation to 13 cm depth) were combined with two seedbed preparation treatments (three passes with a conventional harrow vs. one pass with a power take off (PTO) driven harrow). Seedbed characteristics and bulk soil properties investigated {{at one of the}} sites in 1991 were similar in the different treatments in the 0 - 13 cm layer. In the 13 - 25 cm layer shallow cultivation resulted in significantly higher bulk density, degree of compactness and penetration resistance, and lower root density than in mouldboard ploughing. A reduced number of tractor passes achieved by using the PTO driven harrow resulted in significantly lower bulk density and penetration resistance in the unploughed soil, while still providing an adequate seedbed. At 25 - 30 cm depth, the volume of pores with equivalent diameter > 100 um, saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability were higher with <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> than with conventional tillage. Pore continuity was greater in unploughed soil at all depths investigated. In unploughed plots there was a concentration of organic carbon and potassium in the upper 13 cm. Phosphorus distribution and pH were not altered by the tillage systems. The yield was improved by the PTO driven harrow both in ploughed and unploughed plots...|$|E
40|$|In 2011 reduced {{efficacy}} of grass weed herbicides to poverty brome (Bromus sterilis) {{was observed in}} oilseed rape on a site in East Hessen. The field was cultivated by using the <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> system more than 25 years. The site showed high densities of poverty brome (> 1000 plants/m²) prior to herbicide treatment. Poverty brome seeds were collected in 2012 in the hessian oilseed rape field and from a site in East Westphalia, where poverty brome appeared at low densities (10 plants/m²) and was not suspected to resistance. The seeds were sown in to pots and plants cultivated. The plants were treated with two application rates (normal dose, double dose) with herbicides of different HRAC-classes. The time of treatment was adjusted to the best expectable treatment/efficiency conditions of the individual herbicides (see chapter 3). Clear differences in efficacy that were caused by herbicide, the origins of poverty brome and the dosages were recorded via visual rating eight weeks after spraying. The herbicides Agil and Focus Ultra were able to control about 90 % of the poverty brome plants of the East Westphalia site origin. However, only 20 - 30 % of the Hessian plants could be knocked out by the same herbicides. The ACCase-gene of single powerty brome leaf samples from the hessian site was analyzed after resistance assessment.

40|$|A {{strictly}} controlled {{field experiment}} on traditional and reduced tillage systems {{as well as}} herbicide treatment was con-ducted at the Agricultural Experimental Station of Uhrusk in the years 2007 - 2011. In {{the last year of}} the experiment, the effect of different tillage systems on the level of weed infestation and biodiversity of weeds was determined in all the plots for the crop of common spring wheat Triticum aestivum L., spring du-rum wheat Triticum durum Desf., and oat Avena sativa L. at two growth stages: tillering (23 / 24 on BBCH scale) and dough stage (83 / 85). A higher number and higher air-dry weight of weeds were determined at tillering than at the dough stage. Long-term reduced tillage increased the number of weeds per 1 m 2 at the tillering stage, contrary to herbicide treatment. At the dough stage, a higher number of weeds was observed in the herbicide treatment and reduced tillage plots compared to traditional til-lage. The air-dry weight of weeds at the tillering and dough sta-ges of cereals was significantly higher in the case of herbicide treatment than under the traditional and reduced tillage systems. Weed communities in spring wheat, durum wheat and oat inclu-ded mostly annual weeds. A higher number of weed species was determined in the plot with long-term herbicide treatment than in the plots with reduced and traditional tillage systems.

40|$|Tillage-induced {{changes in}} pore-size {{distribution}} and aggregate stability of two soils were investigated for 7 con- secutive years from 1994 to 2000. The three tillage treatments were used: conventional tillage with mouldboard plough (CT), <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> with cultivator (PL) and direct drilling (DD). The experiments {{were conducted on}} loam soil (Eutric Cambisol) derived from boulder clay and silt loam soil (Haplic Luvisol) derived from loess. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm. Pore size distribution was calculated from the water retention curve. Water stability of aggregates (10 - 5, 5 - 1 and 20 mm) {{at a depth of}} 0 - 10 cm, varying initially from 0. 035 to 0. 062 m 3 m- 3, increased during seven years substantially in both the loam (from 1. 7 in DD to 3. 6 times in CT) and the silt loam (from 1. 3 in CT to 3. 4 times in PL and DD). The increase for the depth of 10 - 20 cm was relatively greater in silt loam (from 1. 7 in PL to 2. 8 times in DD) as compared with loam (from 1. 3 in DD to 2. 1 times in PL). During the first four years of the experiment, the contribution of mesopores (0. 2 - 20 mm) decreased in all treatments to higher extent in loam than in silt loam. Temporal changes in microporosity (< 0. 2 mm) were much smaller than for other size classes of pores. The differences between the treatments were more pronounced for the 0 - 10 cm than for the 10 - 20 cm depth. Irrespective of the treatments, the aggregates of 10 - 5 and 5 - 1 mm were more stable in the loam than in the silt loam soil. Improved water stability of aggregates of 10 - 5 and 5 - 1 mm under PL and DD suggest that the tillage systems are sustainable in soils conducive to soil erosion...|$|E
40|$|Arable land {{supplies}} {{food and}} it is therefore important to develop the production and land-use in a sustainable way. To grow crops for food should be both economical and environmentally sustainable and the soil structure and quality should be taken in consideration when cultivating our land. We need to find new approaches to maintain good soil structure, and minimized tillage systems have many advantages, including costs for the growing of crops, while leaving straw in the fields can reduce erosion and increase the biological activity and humus content of the soil. The texture has two important physical properties {{when it comes to}} indicate the soil quality those are aggregate stability and size distribution. The particle size distribution is the most essential physical property which defines the soil texture, and influences the soil properties the most. These two physical properties mentioned above reflects the resistance of soil erosion, especially in no-tillage system, which is why they are the most important factors when it comes to soil quality. The soil structure defines which different types of particles that are stored in the soil and it exert control over the physical, biological and chemical processes. It also explains how and where the particles are located, which is important for how suitable the soil is for growing crops. If the soil has a poor structure, it can affect the nutrient availability and the nutrient uptake negatively and increase the power requirement for tillage, increase the nutrient loss and the denitrification, which is negative from an environmental point of view. Organic matter, tillage system, biological activity etc. matters for the aggregate structure in a soil. There are natural structure building processes, such as root development and drying, but there is also structure depleting processes, which basically all the human activities are. A non-cultivated soil generally has a better structure due to the generally higher content of organic matter and less compaction than a cultivated soil has. Soil structure is being influenced by soil and crop management inputs and has an impact on soil quality. One of the factors that influence the quality is tillage. This input is an important factor and relevant in the point of sustainability, that is why the quality of the soil is depending on the choices of human activities. A soil with higher proportion of clay and humus usually increases the stability of structure and aggregates. Aggregate stability is characterized by the sensitivity to external influence. The essence of aggregate stability is the organic matter, because large parts of plants and roots acts like a barrier and prevent aggregates to break into smaller units with help from decomposing of microorganisms that provides with an adhesive effect. The factors that influences the soil aggregate stability is soil texture, soil structure, the different types of clay minerals, the content and different types of organic matter, cementing agents and which kind of crops that were grown through the history. Permeability is the property of a material that lets fluids to diffuse through the medium without being affected chemically or physically, that is the soil´s capacity to drain off water. The structure of a soil is influenced in both long and short term of tillage and cultivation measures, which in turn affects the soil physical properties. Vegetation and recycling of organic matter contributes to a better structure and physical environment. Soil cultivation measures do the opposite, even though tillage contributes to structural stabilization and structural-building processes. If the structure should be improved, the structure-building measures needs to be greater than the structure depleting measures. Adding organic matter can preserve soil structure and increase the crop safety. Measures to improve the structure and provide better conditions for the crops, is to return straw and crop residues to the soil, grow cover crops in the autumn and only apply shallow tillage, which could increase the humus content in the top layer. Increased humus content will give a lower bulk density, increased aggregate stability and increased porosity, which in turn give the soil increased water holding capacity and infiltration capacity. The macro pores is responsible for the soils capillary ability, it provides the plants with available moisture. If the moisture is in the narrow pores, micro pores, the plant roots needs to develop an increased suction force to be able to absorb the moisture. The greatest amount of plant available moisture is found in silty loam soils, while the soil with the least amount is sandy soils because of their inability to bind water due to its larger particles. Heavy rains can also damage the aggregates in the topsoil if the soil is uncovered or unfrozen, which is why organic matter and straw incorporation could prevent damage of this type. <b>Ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> and direct drilling gives favourable structure development in the topsoil, and green manure and cover crops are often suggested as effective methods to increase the organic matter, along with reduced tillage system. Though, the experiment at Aleksandras Stulginskis University in Lithuania shows that no-tillage system has the highest level of compaction of the soil compared to deep ploughing system. On the other hand, another experiment in Sweden, with <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> and straw incorporation, has showed that <b>ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> system gives a reduced compaction, though; straw treatment are facing problems, such as “straw stops” while cultivating the soil with different tillage methods. If the straw should be incorporated, it needs to be finely chopped and evenly spread evenly over the field. At Aleksandras Stulginskis University in Lithuania, a long-term field experiment has been running since 1999 in the Experimental Station, Kaunas district. The experiment is made by six different tillage systems: deep ploughing; shallow ploughing; shallow loosening with sweep cultivator and disc harrows; shallow loosening with rotor cultivator; catch crops & green manure incorporation with rotor cultivator; and no tillage. Another factor of this experiment is about straw incorporation and straw removal in the different tillage systems. The soil type of this field is sandy loam. The soil samples have been analysed in the laboratory of Aleksandras Stulginskis University to investigate which impact the different tillage systems and straw incorporation or straw removal have on the soil aggregate stability, soil structure and water capacity. The experiment showed that with straw incorporation in 0 - 10 cm depth there were less micro aggregates than in the treatment were straw was removed. The aggregate stability was higher in 10 - 25 cm depth with straw incorporation compared to straw removal. Shallow loosening was the treatment which gave the highest bulk density in both depths, which means that the soil with this treatment was more compacted than with deep ploughing. No-tillage treatment had lower bulk density in the deeper layer, which means that this soil had more porosity. Deep ploughing had a tendency {{not to be able to}} hold a high amount of water at 0 - 10 cm depth, up to - 300 hPa, while no-tillage treatment in the deeper layer could hold water the best at lower pressures. In the treatment with shallow loosening, the porosity decreased, while in the no-tillage treatment the porosity increased...|$|E
40|$|Good soil {{structure}} {{is important to}} have the right conditions for good crop development. In two field experiments, R 2 - 4111 and R 2 - 7115, the {{soil structure}} has been examined by a number of parameters. Project R 2 - 4111, started in 1999, investigates how the time of primary tillage affects the yield. Both tillage with a mouldboard plough and a stubble cultivator is tested at three different occasions, called early, normal and late tillage. Project R 2 - 7115, started in 1997, investigates how the tire inflation pressure affects the yield. Tillage with a mouldboard plough and a stubble cultivator tested with normal and low inflation pressures in the tires, also a treatment with permanent grassland is used as a comparison. Parameters that were compared were hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, tensile strength, aggregate stability, penetration resistance {{and the quality of the}} seedbed. Draught requirement was measured at each primary tillage occasion. The results showed no major differences in soil properties depending on tillage time or tire inflation pressure, but there were trends that the soil structure was poorer in treatments with normal inflation pressure and late tillage [...] Distinct differences were found between mouldboard plough and stubble cultivator treatments for some of the parameters. The stubble cultivated treatment had a higher proportion of soil aggregates > 5 mm and lower proportion of aggregates < 2 mm after sowing than the treatment with mouldboard plough. For the stubble cultivated plots the penetration resistance were higher at the depth of 10 - 30 cm. In the stubble cultivated treatments the bulk density was higher and the hydraulic conductivity lower, but the results for hydraulic conductivity were insecure because of the great variability for this property. In the treatment with mouldboard plough the aggregate stability was lower than for stubble cultivation. The tire inflation pressure affected the penetration resistance, where the treatment with low tire inflation pressure had a lower penetration resistance at the level of 12 - 25 cm. <b>Ploughless</b> <b>tillage</b> was cheaper than tillage with a mouldboard plough but between the different times of tillage there were only small differences in machinery costs. The treatment with low inflation pressure was more expensive to till than the treatment with normal inflation pressure. The early tillage in R 2 - 4111 has had the best yield as an average for several years and the late tillage the lowest yield. The time of tillage was most important in the stubble cultivated treatments. In experiment R 2 - 7115 there were no differences in yield between the tillage systems but the treatment with low inflation pressure has had the best yield as an average for several years. To a farmer with an aim to achieve as good economy as possible, these field trials show that tillage with a stubble cultivator on this soil reduces costs without lowering crop yield. Early tillage and low tire inflation pressure increases yield which may further improve the economy...|$|E
