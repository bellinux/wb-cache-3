5|$|The clutch {{is usually}} {{two or three}} buff-white eggs blotched with sepia or grey-brown, {{particularly}} at the wide end. The average egg size for Asian birds was 19.3x12.9mm (0.76x0.51in) with a weight of 1.7g (0.06oz). Both adults incubate the eggs for 16–19 days prior to hatching and feed the chicks about ten times an hour until they fledge and for several days after they can fly. The fledging time can vary from 22–24days to 25–30days, though the latter estimates <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> into account fledged young returning to the nest for food. If a nest is destroyed, or the breeding attempt otherwise fails, a replacement clutch may be laid, typically with fewer eggs. Two nests in Arabia were used in spring {{and again in the}} autumn, but it is not known if the same pair were involved.|$|E
25|$|However, Richard D. Gill {{has argued}} that Jaynes {{misunderstood}} Bell's analysis. Gill {{points out that in}} the same conference volume in which Jaynes argues against Bell, Jaynes confesses to being extremely impressed by a short proof by Steve Gull presented at the same conference, that the singlet correlations could not be reproduced by a computer simulation of a local hidden variables theory. According to Jaynes (writing nearly 30 years after Bell's landmark contributions), it would <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> us another 30 years to fully appreciate Gull's stunning result.|$|E
25|$|Following Meg Whitman's {{appointment}} as CEO of HP, {{in conjunction with}} an announcement of the company's plans to continue developing webOS as an open-source operating system, {{she said that the}} company would continue using the OS in devices, specifically resuming its use in tablets. She said this would not happen in 2012, but would <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> place in 2013. In February 2013, HP sold the source code and transferred the remaining webOS team to LG, so it is unlikely there will be a HP-produced webOS tablet.|$|E

25|$|Following Yves Leterme's resignation, King Albert asked Didier Reynders, the {{chairman}} of the Francophone liberal party MR and erstwhile informateur, to seek {{a way out of the}} stalemate. At first, the Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep (VRT) reported that Philippe Maystadt or Melchior Wathelet would <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> over, either as informateur or as royal mediator. The Flemish parties felt it was up to a member of CDH to take an initiative; however, the CDH wanted a Flemish politician to be involved in the mediation efforts as well. It was later reported that, according to observers, King Albert would probably ask Raymond Langendries (CDH) and Herman De Croo (Open Vld) to mediate.|$|E
25|$|On 28 September, Haig met General Hubert Gough (Fifth Army) and General Herbert Plumer (Second Army) {{to explain}} his intentions. After the {{victories}} of 20 and 26 September, the fine weather, the disarray of the German defenders and the limited prospect of German reinforcements from the Russian front, Haig decided that the attack on 4 October would conclude the period of strictly limited advances. The following step would be a deeper advance, with provision made for exploitation. Haig wanted reserve formations of infantry, artillery, cavalry and tanks {{to be ready to}} extend a successful attack. Gough and Plumer replied {{over the next couple of}} days, that they felt that Haig's proposals were premature and that exploitation would not be feasible until Passchendaele ridge had been captured from Passchendaele northwards to Westroosebeke. Gough and Plumer thought that this would <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> two more steps at three-day intervals and then another four days to repair roads over the captured ground. Haig considered that although a collapse of the German defence was a condition for exploitation of the attack due on 10 October which was not certain, he desired the arrangements to be made, since they would be available for a later date.|$|E
25|$|On 28 September, Sir Douglas Haig had met Plumer and the Fifth Army {{commander}} General Hubert Gough {{to explain}} his intentions, {{in view of the}} victories of 20 and 26 September, the fine weather, disarray among the German defenders and the limited prospect of German reinforcements arriving from the Russian front. Haig judged that the next attack, due on 6 October, would conclude the period of strictly limited advances. The following step would be a deeper advance, with provision made for exploitation. Haig wanted XV Corps on the Belgian coast and the amphibious force of Operation Hush readied, in case of a general withdrawal by the Germans. Reserve formations of infantry, artillery, cavalry and tanks were to be made ready behind the Fifth and Second armies, to exploit a successful attack. Gough and Plumer replied {{over the next couple of}} days, that they felt that the proposals were premature and that exploitation would not be feasible until Passchendaele ridge had been captured as far as Westroosebeke. Capturing the ridge would <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> two more steps at three-day intervals, followed by another four days to repair roads over the captured ground. Haig explained that although exploitation of the attack due on 10 October was not certain, he desired the arrangements to be made since they could be used at a later date.|$|E

500|$|In {{regards to}} the various stories {{throughout}} the episode, {{and the amount of}} time passing in each one of them, Cogman stated, [...] "The timelines between the various storylines don’t necessarily line up within a given episode. For instance, the “Northern Tour” Jon and Sansa embark on would <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> a couple weeks, but Arya’s storyline over the past few episodes only spans a few days. We realized a while ago that if we tied ourselves in knots trying to make all the “story days” line up between all the characters the momentum would suffer." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the {{workings}} of the plot remain elusive to most. Sharp digressed, [...] "o be honest it isn't the most accessible of films and for those unfamiliar with Suzuki's unorthodox and seemingly disjointed style it will <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> a couple of viewings before the bare bones of the plot begin to emerge." [...] As Zorn has put it, [...] "plot and narrative devices {{take a back seat to}} mood, music, and the sensuality of visual images." [...] Japanese film historian Donald Richie thus encapsulated the film, [...] "An inventive and ultimately anarchic take on gangster thrillers. [...] script flounders midway and Suzuki tries on the bizarre for its own sake." [...] David Chute conceded that in labeling the film incomprehensible, [...] "f you consider the movie soberly, it's hard to deny the bosses had a point". On a conciliatory note, Rayns commented, [...] "Maybe the break with Nikkatsu was inevitable; it's hard to see how Suzuki could have gone further in the genre than this." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{design team}} for the series {{conceived}} eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga's [...] and eccentric reputation, although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga's stylists or creative director Nicola Formichetti. Due to the outfits' unconventional appearances, Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes, as these rapid changes [...] "wouldn't be possible in real life". [...] "There's {{a moment in the}} episode," [...] Jean resumed, [...] "when she starts out with her hair down. Then, there's a curtain pulled in front of her, and in seconds, she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all hairsprayed up and big and frizzy. In real life, that would <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> 8 hours." [...] Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn, including her meat dress and her Kermit the Frog dress. [...] "We did a lot of research, looking back at her old outfits, and she's really been in a million different things, had a million different looks." ...|$|E
500|$|Still underground, Picard discovers a {{computer}} terminal, which he activates, causing a hologram of the salesman to appear and explain they are witnessing {{a demonstration of}} an intelligent weapon system which is able to upgrade in response to any enemy threat. Picard surmises that the Minosians and the Drake were destroyed by the weapons. He unsuccessfully attempts to coerce the hologram to end the demonstration. Data is able to locate Picard, and determines that while the sentries could be set to destroy their own power source, the resulting explosion would <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> out the whole area, including the away-team. Picard finally tells the salesman he will buy the system, causing the salesman to disappear and the probes on the planet to shut down. Meanwhile, La Forge uses the planet's atmosphere to reveal {{the location of the}} space-born probe and destroys it. [...] The away team returns to the star-drive section, where Picard allows La Forge to stay in command until they rendezvous with the saucer section, remarking that he left him with the ship intact and would like it returned in the same condition.|$|E

2500|$|In a more mixed review, Jim Farber {{from the}} New York Daily News writes that Grande's [...] "sexed-up" [...] vocals and range are shown off but the [...] "constant jerking {{back and forth}} between styles {{interrupts}} any sense of flow." [...] Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian praises Grande's vocals but feels that the songs are indistinct and have a [...] "facelessness" [...] to them. Annie Zaleski writes for The A.V. Club how it [...] "is so well-constructed and designed to succeed, it rarely loosens up enough to let any depth of character (or real surprises) surface", yet it [...] "further establishes Grande as a consummate performer and vocal interpreter." [...] Kitty Empire from The Observer notes that Grande's vocal ability is showcased but that the songs lack personality. Evan Sawdey, writing for PopMatters, comments that Grande is mimicking other artists, leaving her distinguished voice with only the support of hollow lyricism. In agreement, Will Robinson rates the album a 2.5 out of five for Sputnikmusic, telling how it [...] "ends up ringing hollow." [...] Adelle Platon writing for Vibe magazine, and she is positive towards the album's sound and compares Grande's vocals to those of Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera. Andrew Chan writing on behalf of Slant Magazine how [...] "she emphasizes the sheer fun of singing over any sense of emotional urgency", yet [...] "What her voice lacks in depth, texture, and variety will <b>probably</b> <b>take</b> time to acquire." ...|$|E
