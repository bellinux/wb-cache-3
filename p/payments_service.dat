40|$|On November 1, 2009, the Directive on <b>Payment</b> <b>Services</b> in the Internal Market (<b>Payment</b> <b>Services</b> Directive), which {{defines the}} legal {{framework}} {{for the establishment of}} a single market for <b>payment</b> <b>services</b> in the European Economic Area 2 and introduces a new category of <b>payment</b> <b>service</b> providers (known as “payment institutions”), was implemented in Austrian law by means of the Austrian <b>Payment</b> <b>Services</b> Act (Zahlungsdienstegesetz). The essential areas governed by the <b>Payment</b> <b>Services</b> Act are market access and licensing requirements for payment institutions (including the relevant supervisory provisions) as well as the issues of transparency, liability and recourse in the execution of <b>payment</b> <b>services.</b> The definition of payment institutions now allows nonbanks to provide <b>payment</b> <b>services</b> (subject to certain licensing and supervisory provisions), which – as classic banking transactions – were previously the exclusive domain of credit institutions in Austria. From the European Commission’s perspective, this change should facilitate access to the financial market for new <b>payment</b> <b>service</b> providers. Against this backdrop, this article provides an overview of the most important supervisory provisions in the <b>Payment</b> <b>Services</b> Act. The article then assesses the current significance of these newly defined payment institutions for the Austrian financial market and takes a look beyond Austria’s borders to discuss the situation in selected countries. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal {{taxation of savings}} intermediation and <b>payment</b> <b>services</b> in a dynamic general equilibrium setting, when the government can also use consumption and income taxes.
