40|$|<b>Pipe</b> flange <b>connections</b> with gaskets in {{chemical}} plants, electric {{power plants and}} other industrial plants are usually exposed to elevated internal pressure with cyclic thermal condition. It is important to investigate the sealing performance of <b>pipe</b> <b>connections</b> under long term severe thermal exposure swings to ensure operational safety. In this study, the effects of cyclic thermal conditions on the sealing performance and mechanical characteristics in larger and smaller nominal diameter of <b>pipe</b> flange <b>connection</b> are examined using FEM calculations. Helium gas leakage is predicted using the contact gasket stress obtained from the FEM results. On other hand, the leakage tests using the smaller nominal diameter of <b>pipe</b> flange <b>connection</b> were conducted to measure the amount of helium gas leakage and to compare with the predicted amount of gas leakage. As the results, the contact gasket stress distributions were changed dramatically under cyclic thermal condition and elevated internal pressure. In the <b>pipe</b> flange <b>connections</b> with smaller nominal diameter, the contact gasket stress was the smallest in the restart condition. On other hand, the minimum contact gasket stress in the <b>pipe</b> flange <b>connection</b> with larger nominal diameter was depending on the materials of <b>connection.</b> In the <b>pipe</b> flange <b>connection</b> with larger nominal diameter, the contact gasket stress distributed and changed in the radial direction due to the flange rotation.

An Annular BOP consists of a natural or synthetic rubber element with encased metal reinforcement sections. A hydraulic piston pushes the annular element up into a concaved cap which forces the element diameter to decrease in size. When the element diameter is closed sufficiently it forms a seal around the body of the pipe. The upset or larger diameter section of a <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> can be pulled or pushed through a closed annular element without damage and while still maintaining a gas tight seal.|$|E

50|$|Many class BTPs {{gained a}} further {{lease of life}} in the early 1900s by being {{converted}} to work the Steam Autocars (push-pull trains) then being introduced. A Steam Autocar consisted of a BTP with one or two coaches (in which case the engine was in the middle), the train was driven from a driving compartment in the leading coach, leaving the fireman on the footplate. The driver had control of the regulator and reverser by means of a mechanical connection running under the coach and connecting to the engine using a form of universal joints. The driver also had full (Westinghouse) brake control via a second air <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> to the engine. This high pressure air supply also worked a whistle mounted above the driving compartment. Finally there was speaking tube communication between the driver and fireman - although there is evidence that this was little used.|$|E

50|$|In India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh biogas {{produced}} from the anaerobic digestion of manure in small-scale digestion facilities is called gobar gas; {{it is estimated}} that such facilities exist in over 2 million households in India, 50,000 in Bangladesh and thousands in Pakistan, particularly North Punjab, due to the thriving population of livestock. The digester is an airtight circular pit made of concrete with a <b>pipe</b> <b>connection.</b> The manure is directed to the pit, usually straight from the cattle shed.

Deep wells and springs are commonly used as potable water supply. Local government, congressional initiative, regional and senatorial funds are used to develop these sources.

40|$|AbstractSize {{effect on}} {{explosion}} intensity of methane-air mixture in spherical vessels and pipes was studied in this paper. The experimental results suggested {{diameter of the}} spherical vessel, the length of <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> of single vessel {{and the length of}} <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> between two spherical vessels {{played a significant role in}} explosion intensity of methane-air mixture in spherical vessels and pipes. The maximum explosion pressure was almost constant, while the maximum rate of pressure rise decreased with an increasing diameter of the vessel. The maximum explosion pressure and the maximum rate of pressure rise in single vessel with <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> both decreased due to the increase of the length of <b>connection</b> <b>pipes.</b> There was a linear relationship between explosion intensity and the length. And the maximum explosion pressure and the maximum rate of pressure rise appeared at the end of <b>connection</b> <b>pipes.</b> For linked vessels, the explosion intensity in secondary vessel increased with an increasing length of <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> with linear relationships. The conclusions provided important references for safety design of explosion venting and explosion resistance...|$|R
40|$|In underbalanced {{drilling}} (UBD), {{bottom hole}} pressure (BHP) {{must be maintained}} in the defined limit. Maintaining underbalanced drilling conditions after <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> operation {{is required for the}} success of underbalanced drilling operations. Modeling and simulation of gas-liquid two phase flow in an UBD operation is very significant in order to accurately predict the wellbore pressure and other parameters of two phase flow. After <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> operation in UBD, upon restarting mud circulation system, frictional pressure influenced the BHP and the fluid slugs in the drill string are transferred into the annulus. Therefore, the hydrostatic pressure will increase and UBD <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> operations create a BHP vibration, which is a critical point. This particular time can reduce the benefits obtained to drill the well in an underbalanced environment. In this study, a mechanistic steady state gas-liquid two phase flow model was used to simulate the two phase flow after <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> operation in UBD. Simulation was carried out to predict the parameters; such as wellbore pressure, liquid holdup, and velocities of the two phases at different flow patterns, namely slug, bubble, churn, dispersed bubble, and annular flow. In order to predict wellbore pressure, a steady state model was developed to predict flow patterns, pressure gradient, and liquid holdup for gasliquid flow in vertical annulus and drill string. The model included flow pattern transition models and hydrodynamic models for individual flow pattern. The model equations along with appropriate constitutive relations formed a system of coupled drift flux, momentum, and energy equations, which were solved using the well known iterative Newton Raphson method. All model equations were implemented in a computer program named Fortran 95. The effect of gas and liquid flow rates, and choke pressure on the wellbore pressure, particularly in the BHP was evaluated numerically. In order to validate the results of the developed model, they were compared with actual field data and the results of the WELLFLO software using different mechanistic models. The results revealed that the two phase model developed can accurately predict wellbore pressure, particularly BHP, wellbore temperature, gas/liquid velocities, and two phase flow patterns...|$|E
