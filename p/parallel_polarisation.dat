40|$|For {{the upper}} ECW {{launcher}} on ITER, {{the use of}} a “remote steering antenna” based on the imaging properties of rectangular waveguides is planned. To characterise launchers of this type, low-power experiments on a 4 -side corrugated square waveguide with a scanning mirror at the input of the waveguide were performed in the frequency range of 140 to 160 GHz. It is shown, that elliptical polarisation needed for ECCD can be transmitted without depolarisation. The usable steering range of the antenna is at least – 10 ° < j £ + 10 °. Experiments with the scanning plane in the diagonal of the square waveguide led to a negligible increase the scanning range, and lobes in the upward and downward direction are detected at larger scanning angles. Mitre bends can be integrated into the waveguide without prohibitive extra loss, which is demonstrated by far-field measurements.

40|$|Polarised {{transmission}} FTIR microscopy studies (μ-FTIR) {{have been}} performed on a monodisperse 3 -amide oligomer. The oligomer is a model compound for nylon 6 6; it has essentially the same room temperature crystal structure, and it undergoes the same high temperature transition, the Brill transition, prior to melting. However, the oligoamide forms extended chain, rather than chain-folded, crystals, and so crystals are produced that are essentially 100 % crystalline, and of μm–mm size. Consequently, this material is ideally suited for polarised μ-FTIR single crystal studies. The thermal polarised FTIR behaviour of this material provides definitive proof that the Brill transition does not involve major rearrangement of hydrogen bonds, since the strong <b>parallel</b> <b>polarisation</b> of both the NH stretch and amide I bands are retained right up to melting. Quantitative infrared dichroism measurements indicate that a maximum of 5 ° rotation of the N–H bonds about the extended chain axis occurs prior to melting. These results strongly suggests that the equivalent Brill transition in nylon 6 6 also proceeds without significant hydrogen bond rearrangement.

The ERFs generated by the heat absorption process, which is the third source, are of a different nature.

40|$|Shear-wave {{splitting}} {{is measured}} at 17 seismic stations {{deployed in the}} Val DAgri by INGV, which recorded local back-ground seismicity from May 2005 to June 2006. The splitting results suggest {{the presence of an}} anisotropic upper crust (max hypocentral depth 15. 5 km). The dominant fast polarisation direction strikes NW-SE parallel to the Apennines orogen and is approximately parallel to the maximum horizontal stress in the region and also parallel to the strike of the main normal faults in the Val DAgri. The size of the delay times, average is 0. 1 second suggests 4. 5 % shear-wave velocity anisotropy. At stations located at the North West portion of the deployment average delay times are larger on the order of 0. 2 s. These parameters agree with an interpretation of seismic anisotropy in terms of the Extensive-Dilatancy Anisotropy model which considers the rock volume to be pervaded by fluid-saturated microcracks aligned by the active stress field. We cannot completely rule out the contribution of aligned macroscopic fractures as the cause of the shear wave anisotropy even if the <b>parallel</b> shear-wave <b>polarisations</b> we found are diagnostic of transverse isotropy with a horizontal axis of symmetry.

We adopt a Monte Carlo technique to simulate the Raman scattering of UV photons that are converted into optical photons around H alpha forming broad wings, and compute its polarisation. Noting that many symbiotic stars exhibit a bipolar nebular morphology and polarisation flip in the red wing part of the Raman scattered O VI features, {{we assume that the}} neutral scattering region is composed of the two components. The first component is a static cylindrical shell with finite thickness and the other component is a finite slab that is moving away with velocity v_p = 100 km s^- 1 along the symmetry axis of the first component. The cylindrical shell component yields polarisation in the direction parallel to the cylinder axis. The polarisation near the line-centre is weaker than in the far wing regions because of the large Rayleigh scattering numbers due to the large scattering cross sections near the line centre. The receding polar scattering component produces strong polarisation in the direction perpendicular to the cylinder axis. When the both scattering components coexist, the polarisation is characterised by weak <b>parallel</b> <b>polarisation</b> near the line-centre and strong perpendicular polarisation in the red part.

In particular, the effect of the body on the antenna performance with normal and <b>parallel</b> <b>polarisation</b> is studied and their capability in launching surface waves is evaluated. It is shown that both vertically and horizontally polarised antennas can launch a transverse magnetic (TM) Norton surface wave mode regardless of their polarisation states. However, horizontally polarised antennas do not launch the wave as strongly as vertically polarised antennas. Also, the change in the far field and near field behaviour of the antennas such as a dipole in proximity to the body is investigated and the observations lead to the design of a novel surface wave parasitic array. This new antenna is directive and can increase the path gain by almost 10 dB compared to other planar antennas. In addition, the effect of the polarization of the antenna on channel path gain is studied and channel cross polarization discrimination is quantified, using both simulation and measurement.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the phenomenon of}} high harmonic generation from atoms irradiated by intense, ultrashort laser pulses. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the benefits achieved by using multicolour driving fields. A theoretical description of few-cycle laser pulses is presented, together with their interaction with free-electrons and the role they play in various nonlinear optical processes. A number of numerical models are presented to simulate high harmonic generation from atomic systems. These are used to analyse and explain the temporal structure of the emitted high-frequency dipole radiation. Propagation of the macroscopic harmonic response through a gaseous volume is modelled and the role of phase-matching explained in detail. We consider focussing geometry in optimising the yield of particular harmonics, together with the effects of free-electrons within the interaction region. We discuss means by which multicolour fields may overcome some of the constraints of single-colour high harmonic generation. Using two delayed pulses of the same frequency and <b>parallel</b> <b>polarisation</b> we demonstrate significant cut-off extension without increasing total ionisation throughout the pulse, crucial for maintaining harmonic yield close to the saturation limit. We also explain the significant yield enhancements observed in recent experiments using two parallel colours of incommensurate frequency. Finally, we describe the use of a second, perpendicularly polarised colour in trajectory selection, allowing for a temporal filtering of harmonic emission. Using an ω + 1. 5 ω frequency ratio also allows for a reduction in the periodicity of emitted attosecond pulse trains, permitting the production of isolated attosecond pulses with longer driving fields. Furthermore, by controlling the relative phase between the two colours, the ellipticity of these attosecond pulses may also be controlled.

On KDP (KH 2 PO 4), the root member of the family, Busch and Scherrer discovered in 1935 the ferroelectric behaviour. A rich number of works concerning the ferroelectric - paraelectric phase transition of KDP investigated by {{a great variety of}} methods have been published. But the principal mechanism of the phase transition is still not understood. One of the basic problems here is the so called isotope effect. Just by an exchange of the protons with deuterium atoms Tc increases from 123 K (KDP) to 220 K (DKDP (KD 2 PO 4)). The present work is divided into two parts. The first part is regarded to the polymorphism of RDP and DRDP. Both are less detailed investigated then in KDP and DKDP. Therefor single crystal diffraction experiments with neutron and X-ray radiation have been undertaken. As a result two new structures have been discovered and disagreements in the polymorphism are understood. The second part concentrates on the paraelectric - ferroelectric phase transition. Here are first high resolution X-ray single diffraction experiments as a function of electrical field and temperature presented. Both parts of this work have revealed a new role of the hydrogen/deuterium atoms in the structure of all phases in RDP and DRDP. The hydrogen/ deuterium atoms were interpreted in former works as individual parts of the structure. But in contrast to this they are forming [PO 4 H 2]-groups. The former separation into ordered and disordered (H,D) -distributions is just a consequence of the in time and space averaging investigation methods. In terms of [PO 4 H 2]-groups the paraelectric - ferroelectric phase transition of RDP(II) /(I) is of disorder - order type. In the tetragonal HT-structure local orthorhombic short range clusters with a resulting dipol moment are formed. In approaching Tc, with decreasing temperature, these clusters are growing and the resulting polarisation increases. The clusters with anti <b>parallel</b> <b>polarisation</b> are arranged by long range dipol - dipol interactions. With a critical size the growing of the clusters is blocked and 180 °-twin lamellae of the ferroelectric phase are formed.

The radiance leaving {{the top of}} the atmosphere is partially polarised by both reflection at the surface and scattering within the atmosphere. Generally, the polarisation state is unknown and could degrade the accuracy of the concentration measurements. The sensitivity to polarisation is modelled for the proposed geoCARB instrument, which will include neither polarisers nor polarisation scramblers to select particular polarisation states from the incident radiation. The radiometric and polarimetric calibrations proposed for geoCARB are outlined, and a model is developed for the polarisation properties of the geoCARB spectrographs. This model depends principally upon the efficiencies of the gratings to <b>polarisations</b> <b>parallel</b> and perpendicular to the rulings of the gratings. Next, an ensemble of polarised spectra is simulated for geoCARB observing targets in India, China and Australia from geostationary orbit at longitude 110 ° E.

Nascent sulfur monoxide molecules and chlorine atoms were detected state-specifically under collision-free conditions for <b>parallel</b> and perpendicular <b>polarisation</b> geometries. Dissociation and detection were performed {{using the same}} laser. Polarisation-dependent and state-specific TOF profiles were converted into kinetic energy distributions using a least squares fitting method taking into account velocity-dependent spatial fragment anisotropies. Kinetic energy distributions are narrow and structureless for SO and bimodal for both spin–orbit states of Cl. The bimodality reflects the competition between two- and three-body decay: SOCl 2 + hn! SOCl+Cl and SOCl 2 + hn!SO+ 2 Cl. Chlorine atoms are preferentially released along the polarisation vector of the dissociation laser. The spatial distribution of Cl is characterised by an anisotropy parameter of 0. 8 0. 2 for the two-body decay and 0. 2 0. 2 for the three-body decay. SO molecules are isotropically released with low kinetic energy together with two ground state chlorine atoms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{simulations of}} isolated 3 D filaments in a slab geometry obtained using a 3 D reduced fluid code. First, systematic scans {{were performed to}} investigate how the dynamics of a filament are affected by its amplitude, perpendicular size and parallel extent. The perpendicular size of the filament {{was found to have}} a strong influence on its motions, as it determined the relative importance of <b>parallel</b> currents to <b>polarisation</b> and viscous currents, whilst drift-wave instabilities were observed if the initial amplitude of the blob was increased sufficiently. Next, the 3 D simulations were compared to 2 D simulations using different parallel closures; namely, the sheath dissipation closure, which neglects parallel gradients, and the vorticity advection closure, which neglects the influence of parallel currents. The vorticity advection closure was found to not replicate the 3 D perpendicular dynamics and overestimated the initial radial acceleration of all the filaments studied. In contrast, a more satisfactory comparison with the sheath dissipation closure was obtained, even in the presence of significant parallel gradients, where the closure is no longer valid. Specifically it captured the contrasting dynamics of filaments with different perpen- dicular sizes that were observed in the 3 D simulations which the vorticity advection closure failed to replicate. However, neither closure successfully replicated the Boltzmann spinning effects and associated poloidal drift of the blob that was observed in the 3 D simulations. Although the sheath dissipation closure was concluded to be more successful in replicating the 3 D dynamics, it is emphasised that the vorticity closure may still be relevant for situations where the parallel current is inhibited from closing through the sheath due to effects such as increased resistivity near the targets.

40|$|Waveguides for optical {{radiation}} and nanostructures {{are essential for}} new and future optical technologies. The generation of waveguides with femtosecond laser radiation by moving a focus is exemplarily demonstrated with longitudinaly written volume waveguides and ridge waveguides in thin films. Combining element of both waveguide types are periodic subwavelength structures on the surface (ripples, germ. Riffel, also laser induced periodical surface structures (LIPSS)) and in the volume (nanoplanes). The subwavelength ripples emerging at ablation with ultra short pulsed laser radiation are investigated in-depth in theory and experiments {{as well as their}} influence on the structure precision and their analogy with nanoplanes. The volume waveguides in fused silica (length 9 mm, diameter 1 - 5 µm) are homogeneous and continuous at fluences below ~ 5 kJ/cm³. Homogeneous monomode waveguides with a refractive index change Delta-n up to 2. 8 * 10 ^(- 4) and a damping below 2 dB/cm are demonstrated. The generation of surface ridge waveguides (pulse duration t= 100 fs, wavelenth l= 800 nm and 400 nm, NA 0, 55, width 100 µm in a 1 µm thick thin film of Er:ZBLAN on magnesium fluoride) are demonstrated. Due to ripples the orientation of the polarisation is essential. The achieved smoothness of the edges is 100 - 300 nm at a grove depth up to 1. 8 µm. A damping below 5 dB/cm is demonstrated and the possibility of a damping below 1 dB/cm is indicated. To complement the established models for classical ripples for the explanation of subwavelength ripples at pulse durations below a few nanoseconds some valuations are made such as the influence of longitudinal fields at tight focusing, near field scattering including resulting field enhancements and the significance of surface plasmons. For the first time it is suggested that for the modelling of the ripple spacing the dynamic variation of the dielectric function during the irradiation has to be taken into account. From the surface plasmon model constraints are elaborated for the real and imaginary part of the complex dielectric function of the material during the irradiation, under which ripples develop at domination of polaritons. To understand the initial becoming of the ripples a seed model is suggested, which is evaluated {{on the basis of the}} experimental results. The analogy between subwavelenth ripples on the surface and nanoplanes in the volume are discussed in relation to their phenomenology and a common model to explain their development. The experimental investiagtions of the subwavelenth ripples in this work give a contribution to the phenomenological description and the comprehension of the subwavelength ripples. Investigated variations are: wavelength l= 800 nm, 532 nm, 400 nm and 266 nm, linear und circular polarisation, repition rate between f= 1 kHz und 1 Hz, lateral pulse spacing, pulse energy, the surface morphology before the irradiation and the pulse duration between t= 80 fs and 40 ps. Investigated materials are: gold, copper, Silicon, lithium niobate, zirconium oxide, diamond, fused silica, sapphire, magnesium fluoride, lithium fluoride, ZBLAN, PTFE, human hair. The ripples are orientated perpendicular to the polarisation of the laser radiation and are coherently expanded at moving the focus. For the generation of grids this also is possible in two dimensions. The ripples predominantly evolve from ablation and not from relocation of material. The ripple spacing L depends on the material and the wavelength l. At l= 800 nm it was measured: dielectrics L= 190 to 330 nm (L/l= 0. 24 to 0. 41), metals and semiconductors L= 500 to 600 nm (L/l= 0. 63 to 0. 75). The ripple spacing gets smaller with the wavelength. The ratio L/l for l= 400 nm is bigger for dielectrics and silicon than at l= 800 nm. After five pulses the typical characteristics of ripples are accomplished. A surface structure, e. g. due to a previous pulse or a shallow scratch about perpendicular to the radiation promote the development of ripples. In silicon directly below the ablation threshold a lateral periodic modification of the density is observed. This has a periodicity comparable with the ripple spacing of silicon, indicating that Nanoplanes and subwavelenth ripples probably can be ascribed to the same principles, which is consistent with the suggested seed model. At a focus movement <b>parallel</b> to the <b>polarisation</b> “detached ripples” with their closest neighbour more than two focus diameters away are observed for the first time. Detached ripples can not be explained by the established models, but by the combined subwavelenght/nanoplanes model...|$|R
40|$|Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) is {{the most}} {{important}} plantation tree in New Zealand forestry, and factors that reduce the quality of wood cause significant economic loss. Two of {{the most important of these}} issues are compression wood and spiral grain. Compression wood is a type of reaction wood, formed when a tree moves away from the vertical, and is characterised by biochemical and structural changes within the wood that reduce its quality and value. Spiral grain, however, is the alignment of the wood grain in a helix around the tree’s axis and away from the vertical. Again, this reduces the structural qualities of the wood and thus its value. Spiral grain and compression wood are notorious for their deleterious effect on the quality of wood produced and are very important for the forest industry due to the huge economic loss they cause. The demand for reliable tools to evaluate these wood quality issues in clonal planting material at an early stage, within 3 years of germination rather than at 8 to 15 years as in current practise, is of ever increasing importance from plant breeders and other industry stake holders. Therefore this research was undertaken with an overall aim to develop quick, easy and reproducible techniques to evaluate young radiata pine clones (up to 3 years old) based on compression wood content and presence of spiral grain. This is important because a shortened breeding cycle could provide significant economic benefits to the forest industry. The incidence of these commercially important wood quality parameters has been studied in this thesis in research conducted on young trees (1 to 3 years old). The research described in this thesis used a variety of different imaging approaches to investigate wood structure, including polarised light and confocal microscopy, and X-ray tomography and circular polarised light scanning. The images achieved have been analysed using a range of different software, including Photoshop, ImageJ and Matlab bringing a quantification approach to the imaging. Compression wood was quantified in young clonal material using images collected with a commercial document scanner, and processed using image analysis tools available in Photoshop. An easy, reliable and robust, automatic image analysis protocol was successfully developed and tested for the detection and quantification of compression wood in these young trees. This new technique to detect and quantify compression wood was based on the thresholding of the blue channel of the scanned RGB image as this was demonstrated to contain the greatest image contrast. Development of this new technique may reduce the waiting time for screening clonal planting materials based on compression wood content. To understand the organisation of the grain at a cellular level within these young trees, confocal microscopy techniques were utilised. The cell wall characteristics and fluorescence properties of compression wood in comparison with normal wood were investigated using a new cellulose specific dye, pontamine fast scarlet 4 B. Staining protocols for this dye for confocal microscopy were optimised, and the potential of measuring the microfibril angle of the S 1 and S 3 layers of the pontamine treated opposite wood was demonstrated through either direct observations of these layers, or through the property of bifluorescence where the dye is excited only when aligned <b>parallel</b> to the <b>polarisation</b> of the incident light. Despite extensive work with confocal microscopy, this technique proved to be unsuitable for investigations of spiral grain because although it provided cellular detail, imaging was limited to the surface layers of sections, and the area over which observations were required was prohibitive. Instead of confocal microscopy, the incidence of spiral grain in young stems was investigated in two completely new ways. Resin canals, which are formed from the same cambial initials as the tracheids and which align with the grain, were used as a proxy to demonstrate the grain changes. A novel technique, using circular polarised light and a professional flatbed scanner, was developed to image whole serial transverse sections of the young stems to detect the resin canals. Using ImageJ, the number and location of resin canals was measured on vertical controls, and trees that had been rocked and leaned. The number and frequency of resin canals were less in tilted trees, especially in compression wood, compared to the higher number of canals formed in the rocked trees. More importantly, a combination of serial sectioning and this approach allowed a 3 -dimensional view of the orientation of resin canals inside a stem to be generated with ImageJ, and the angles of these canals could be measured using Matlab. The resin canals were oriented with a left-handed spiralling near the stem surface whereas the canals near to the pith were nearly straight, consistent with previous observations of the development of spiral grain in radiata pine. However, it was observed that while vertical trees had a symmetric pattern of grain and grain changes around the stem, this was not the case in tilted trees. In these, the opposite wood often had severe spiral grain visible through formation of twist whereas the compression wood formed on the lower side had bending. Consistent with this, grain associated with compression wood was significantly straighter than in opposite wood. This hitherto unknown link between the incidence of compression wood and spiral grain was investigated and explained on the basis of the characteristics of resin canals in these types of wood. X-ray micro-tomography was also used to investigate resin canals in the stubs from which serial sections were collected. The 3 D reconstructions of the resin canals showed exactly the same patterns as observed by polarised light scanning...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} {{investigation}} {{in this thesis}} is the fish canal lateral line organ (CLLO). The canal lateral line organ is distributed on the head (cephalic lateral line) and laterally along {{the body of the}} fish (trunk lateral line). The function of the CLLO is to detect water vibrations produced in the immediate surroundings of the fish by other swimming objects such as prey, a mate or a school of the same species. The main topic of this thesis focuses on: a) the temporal characteristics of the functioning of the CLLO, such as time delay and time resolution of detection by the CLLO; b) the spatial characteristics of the functioning of the CLLO, such as cues for discerning the position of an object (localisation) and the spatial resolution of detection by the CLLO. 	The canal lateral line organ in ruffe is a narrow canal below the skin or the scales of the fish. The sensory units of lateral line organs are neuromasts, groups of mechano-sensory hair cells. In the ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), the subject of experimental investigation in this thesis, neuromasts in the supra-orbital canal were investigated (Ø < 1 mm). The neuromasts in the cephalic CLLO were chosen due to their substantial size (Ø ~ 500 µm) and large number of hair cells (~ 2000). Neuromasts possess a gelatinous cupula which slides over the hair cells and reflects their mechanical properties. The canal has pores between subsequent neuromasts, enabling the exchange of fluid with the surroundings of the fish. 	Chapter 2 describes the setup and function of a Laser Interferometer Microscope (LIM) used as a displacement detection apparatus in the measurements described in Chapters 3 and 4. The LIM is based on the standard technique of laser interferometry and adapted to the particular purpose of measuring nanometer-scale displacements along the optical axis as well as at right angles to it. The LIM can be used in two modes: the referential and the differential. The differential mode is suited to measurements of the velocities or displacements of an object vibrating in the horizontal plane. Two laser beams with <b>parallel</b> optical <b>polarisation</b> and a frequency shift of 400 kHz are directed such that they interfere on the object of which the motion is to be measured. The interference beam reflected by the object is imaged onto a photo-multiplier, from which the electrical signal is both frequency- and phase-demodulated, enabling simultaneous measurements of the velocity and displacement of the object. The referential mode is suited to measurements of the displacements and velocities of an object vibrating along the optical axis. In this mode only one laser beam is reflected from the object, while the second beam, the reference beam, also with a frequency shift of 400 kHz travels directly through the microscope. The reflected and referential beams interfere on the photo-multiplier. The output of the demodulator simultaneously gives the displacement and velocity of the measured object vibrating in the vertical plane. The LIM used in our experiments enabled the measurement of displacement with an accuracy as small as 1. 5 nm and velocity with an accuracy of approximately 0. 6 µm/s (signal-to-noise = 1). 	The temporal characteristics of the lateral line are investigated in Chapters 3 and 4. Impulse responses of the cupula in the cephalic CLLO were measured and investigated for the first time (Chapter 3). In general, the canal fluid dynamics combined with the cupular dynamics impose the condition that the outside water acceleration is proportional to the displacement of the cupula. However, when the canal is exposed by removing the skin above the cupula being measured, and when a small vibrating stimulus sphere is placed in the canal in front of the cupula, then the cupular displacement is proportional to the velocity of the water surrounding the cupula. Therefore, a stimulus consisting of a step-displacement of the sphere was used, causing a step-displacement of the fluid surrounding the cupula and hence an impulse velocity. The displacement responses of the cupula to such stimuli are thus velocity impulse responses, revealing information about the time delay and the temporal resolution of the neuromasts. The displacements of the cupula were measured using the LIM in its differential mode. The impulse responses of the cupula resembled damped oscillations of which the initial phase follows the displacement of the fluid flowing past it. The time delay of such a response was within the accuracy of the time measurement (< 0. 1 ms). The inertial fluid forces, which are associated with the high frequency content of a step, are shown to cause a cupula to instantaneously respond to the fluid step displacement without delay and with the same displacement as the local fluid. The cupula oscillated with a resonance frequency calculated to be fr= 121 ± 56 Hz and with a quality factor Q = 1. 8 ± 0. 5. These values were in good agreement with those obtained using the control technique of sinusoidal stimuli combined with modelling of the data, where the resonance frequency and quality factor of the same cupula were estimated to be fr= 128 ± 60 Hz and Q = 1. 7 ± 0. 3, respectively. The relaxation time-constant of the impulse responses was determined to be τ = 4. 4 ± 2. 7 ms, reflecting the time that a cupula needs to recover to its equilibrium position after a displacement step. The main conclusion of this chapter is that the hydrodynamics of the peripheral lateral line organ does not impose a limit on the time resolution of detection by the cupula at the onset of a step displacement of the water. 	The temporal characteristics of the cupular dynamics are further investigated in Chapter 4. The influence of the mechano-transduction of the underlying hair cells to the timing of the impulse responses was studied by measuring the impulse responses of the cupula to fluid displacement steps with increasing magnitude. The displacement of the cupula is transferred into a deflection of the hair bundles, which are the sensory organelles of the hair cells. Their deflection causes opening of mechano-electrical transducer channels, which influence the overall stiffness of the hair bundle by decreasing it while the channels are opening. Previous investigations of the copular displacement induced by a series of sinusoidal fluid displacements revealed that the nonlinear mechanics of the cupula causes a shift in resonance frequency. Our measurements were in a good agreement with those studies, with an overall frequency shift of 12 ± 6 Hz over the whole range of stimulus magnitudes. Furthermore, we examined the extent of the influence of the non-linearities on the timing characteristics of the cupula. The period of the damped oscillation changes with increasing magnitude of the stimulus such that it first increases (when the amplitude of the copular displacement falls in the operational range of the mechano-transducer channels) and then decreases again. The total change in the period of oscillation is of the order of 1 ms for a period that was originally ≈ 8 ms. This change in period is small when compared to the relaxation time of the cupula, estimated earlier to be approximately 5 ms. The variation in the resonant frequency of the cupula imposed by the non-linearities is small compared to the variation in the resonant frequency of the cupula among different fish (60 Hz). Thus, the main conclusion is that the cupular non-linearities do not impose significant constraints on the temporal resolution of lateral line detection. Spatial characteristics of the CLLO are examined in Chapter 5. Previous studies showed that information on the distance of a vibrating source is represented in the overall pressure gradient (the so-called excitation pattern) which is detected by an array of neuromasts in the lateral line canal. However, a precise description, together with a quantitative interpretation of such patterns that allows a reconstruction of the location and vibration direction of the source, has not been given so far. In order to quantitatively interpret these excitation patterns along a lateral line array in terms of the position and direction of vibration of a source, we measured the extracellular receptor potentials (ERPs) for a single neuromast that were induced by a dipole source of which the position was changed in the horizontal plane. It is shown in Chapter 5 that the excitation patterns have characteristic shapes that are linearly scaled by a distance parameter $d$, which is equal to the shortest distance between the source and the lateral line. As a result, the excitation patterns can be described by a family of wavelet functions with the scale factor, d, together with a shift factor, b, which is the position of the source along the lateral line. The wavelet transform of a 1 -D excitation pattern is shown to reconstruct a 2 -D map of the dipole source. Several algorithms are discussed that could potentially be used by a fish to decode lateral line excitation patterns in order to localise a source and its axis of vibration. The related accuracy and the operational range of the source position detection of this decoding were determined. The length of the lateral line array, L, which is obviously limited by the body length of the fish, imposes an upper bound on the detection range of L/square root(2). The accuracy of the source location detection is limited by the inter-neuromast distance Dn. Therefore, the lower limit of the source detection distance is fixed at 2 Dn. ...|$|R
