Little experimental evidence exists to corroborate the strong epidemiological link between intervertebral disc herniations and vibration exposures using basic scientific approaches. The {{purpose of the current}} investigation was to provide some basic experimental evidence of the epidemiological link between intervertebral herniation and exposure to vibration. 	Partial intervertebral disc herniations were created in in-vitro porcine functional spinal units using a herniation protocol of repetitive flexion/extension motions under modest compressive forces. After herniation initiation, functional spinal units were exposed to 8 different vibration and <b>postural</b> <b>constraint</b> loading protocols consisting of two postural conditions (full flexion and neutral) and 4 vibration loading conditions (whole-body vibration, shock loading, static compressive loads, and whole-body vibration in addition to shock loading) to assess the effects of vibration and posture on functional spinal unit damage progression. There were three main outcome variables used to quantify damage progression; average stiffness changes, herniation distance progression (distance of tracking changes), and specimen height changes, while cumulative loading factors were considered. Additionally the concordance between two types of contrast enhanced medical imaging (Computed Tomography and discograms) was qualified to a dissection ‘gold standard’, and an attempt was made to classify disc damage progression via three categorical variables. 	Concordance to a dissection ‘gold standard’ was higher for the Computed Tomography medical imaging type that for the Discograms. The categorical criteria used to qualify disc damage progression were insufficiently sensitive to detect damage progressions illustrated through dissection and medical imaging techniques. The partial herniation loading protocol was quantified to be more damaging overall to the functional spinal units compared to the vibration and <b>postural</b> <b>constraint</b> loading protocols. However, the vibration and <b>postural</b> <b>constraint</b> loading protocols provided sufficient mechanical insult to the functional spinal units to progress damage to the intervertebral discs. Vibration loading exposures were found to alter specimen height changes and distance of tracking changes, however posture had no significant effects on these variables. Neither posture nor vibration loading had any meaningful significant effects on average stiffness changes...|$|E
40|$|Self-report data on {{musculoskeletal}} discomfort {{were collected}} from several hun-dred VDT users in two agencies of a state government. Aspects of worker posture and workstation design were objectively assessed for 40 of the VDT users. Multiple regression analyses were {{used to examine the}} relationship between these ergo-nomic variables and musculoskeletal discomfort. Effects of ergonomic factors on musculoskeletal discomfort were clearly evident in the analyses. Regression mod-els explained up to 38 % of the variance in discomfort at different body sites. Of special interest was that leg discomfort increased with low, soft seat pans, sug-gesting that <b>postural</b> <b>constraint</b> is more important than thigh compression as a risk factor for leg discomfort in VDT work. In addition, arm discomfort increased with increases in keyboard height above elbow level, supporting arguments for low placement of the keyboard. Finally, high levels of neck and shoulder girdle dis-comfort observed in the study population suggest the need for further attention to the control of cervicobrachial pain syndromes in VDT work...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCello bowing {{requires}} {{a very fine}} control of the musicians' gestures {{to ensure the quality}} of the perceived sound. When the interaction between the bow hair and the string is optimal, the sound is perceived as broad and round. On the other hand, when the gestural control becomes more approximate, the sound quality deteriorates and often becomes harsh, shrill, and quavering. In this study, such a timbre degradation, often described by French cellists as harshness (décharnement), is investigated from both signal and perceptual perspectives. Harsh sounds were obtained from experienced cellists subjected to a <b>postural</b> <b>constraint.</b> A signal approach based on Gabor masks enabled us to capture the main dissimilarities between round and harsh sounds. Two complementary methods perceptually validated these signal features: First, a predictive regression model of the perceived harshness was built from sound continua obtained by a morphing technique. Next, the signal structures identified by the model were validated within a perceptual timbre space, obtained by multidimensional scaling analysis on pairs of synthesized stimuli controlled in harshness. The results revealed that the perceived harshness was due to a combination between a more chaotic harmonic behavior, a formantic emergence, and a weaker attack slope...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a peculiar effect of initial aperture on the grip formation in reach-to-grasp movements. We compare these findings with the predictions of two models for prehension. The first is a very simple model that only describes {{the movements of the}} end-effectors. The second model is rather complex and takes <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> into account. Both models can account for many aspects of human grasping when the movement starts with the digits in contact. We compare the models' performance with published data on other initial configurations. Both models predict an effect of initial aperture that was not present in the data. The model that considers <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> does not perform better than the simple model. We conclude that such constraints are not responsible for the main characteristics of the reach-to-grasp movement...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{tendency}} to overestimate has consistently {{been reported in}} studies of reachability estimation. According {{to one of the}} more prominent explanations, the postural stability hypothesis, the perceived reaching limit depends on the individual’s perceived <b>postural</b> <b>constraints.</b> To test that proposition, the authors compared estimates of reachability of 38 adults (a) in the seated posture (P 1) and (b) in the more demanding posture of standing on one foot and leaning forward (P 2). Although {{there was no difference between}} conditions for total error, results for the distribution and direction of error indicated that participants overestimated in the P 1 condi-tion and underestimated in the P 2 condition. It therefore appears that perceived <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> could be a factor in judgments of reachability. When participants in the present study perceived greater postural demands, they may have elected to program a more conservative strategy that resulted in underestimation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceReaching and {{grasping}} {{movements have}} been studied mostly in seated contexts. There are several tasks, however, that also impose specific <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> that may affect the organization of these movements. For example, in rock climbing, a successful grasp is conditional of an accurate static and dynamic postural control. The purpose of our study was to analyze if <b>postural</b> <b>constraints,</b> imposed by rock climbing, would mask speed-accuracy tradeoff normally observed in pointing and grasping movements. More specifically, {{it was predicted that}} climbers, {{in order to reduce the}} duration of the presumably less stable tripodal phase, would shorten the duration of their reachings whatever the size of the hold. This time reduction would be incongruous with the longer end-phase control observed in seated conditions when precision requirements increase. Seven expert rock climbers performed grasping movements in two different postural conditions (easy and complex) towards holds of various depths (0. 8, 2 and 5 cm). As expected, the hold depth (precision requirements) did not influence the organization of movements until contact with the hold. More specifically, movement duration and velocity-time profiles of the reachings were not affected by the accuracy requirements but were shortened by an increased postural difficulty. The duration of force adjustments once a contact with the hold was established increased with a decreased target size and were not affected by the postural complexity. The present findings suggest a hierarchical processing of <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> and precision constraints. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Estimation {{of whether}} an object is {{reachable}} from a specific body position constitutes {{an important aspect}} in effective motor planning. Researchers who estimate reachability by way of motor imagery with adults consistently report the tendency to overestimate, with some evidence of a postural effect (postural stability hypothesis). This idea suggests that perceived reaching limits depend on an individual’s perceived postural constraints. Based on previous work with adults, the authors expected a sig-nificant postural effect with the Reach 2 condition, as evidenced by reduced overestimation. Furthermore, the authors hypothesized that the postural effect would be greater in younger children. They then tested these propositions among children aged 7, 9, and 11 years by asking them to estimate reach while seated (Reach 1) and in the more demanding posture of standing on 1 foot and leaning forward (Reach 2). Results indicated no age or condition differ-ence, therefore providing no support for a postural effect. When the authors compared these data to a published report of adults, a developmental difference emerged. That is, adults recognize the perceived <b>postural</b> <b>constraint</b> of the standing position resulting in under- rather than overestimation, as displayed in the seated con-dition. Although preliminary, these observations suggest that esti-mates of reach (action planning) continue to be refined between late childhood and young adulthood...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{postural}} {{state and}} hand preference as constraints on 1 -handed catching performance were investigated in different ability {{groups of children}} aged 9 - 10 years. On the basis of pretest data, the authors classified 48 participants into groups of good, intermediate, and poor catchers (n = 16 in each) {{and asked them to}} perform 1 -handed catches with their preferred and nonpreferred hands while standing and sitting. The good catchers' performance was not affected by the imposed postural constraints but did improve when they used the preferred hand. A similar effect of hand preference was evident in the intermediate and poor catchers, but there was also an effect of <b>postural</b> <b>constraint.</b> Independent of hand preference, intermediate catchers' performance while seated improved significantly compared with that during standing. For poor catchers, there was an interaction between hand preference and posture; significant improvement was evident only when they used the preferred hand in the sitting condition. The finding that manipulation of posture and hand preference affected performance outcomes indicates that perceptual skill is not the only influence on catching performance in children. Manipulation of those key constraints may facilitate the acquisition of catching skill, but {{more research is needed to}} determine the permanence of those effects...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{inherent}} postural constraints from a microscope, surgeons who perform minimally invasive surgeries may {{be exposed to}} prolonged static postures. As 3 D displays become more economically viable, {{their role in the}} healthcare industry may become more prominent. The purpose of this pilot-study is to assess the effect of stereoscopic displays on <b>postural</b> <b>constraint,</b> perceived effort, and performance during simulated microsurgery tasks. Ten subjects with no surgical experience performed microsurgical skills tests using four visualization methods: 2 D flat panel display, 3 D flat panel display, monoscopic microscope, and stereoscopic microscope. Body posture was measured via motion tracking equipment and task performance was captured through video analysis. Subjective data was gathered on posture, perceived effort, and equipment usability. Significant differences were found between all displays for each measured joint angle; however, all posture deviations can be classified as neutral. Participants were unable to perceive posture differences between the visualization methods. Task completion times were fastest for the monoscopic microscope; however, the differences were not significant. Total errors were significantly greater for the monoscopic microscope than the flat panel displays. Perceived effort ratings were not significantly different among visualization methods. This study demonstrates that 2 D and 3 D flat panel visualization methods may provide an alternative to microscopes during surgery; however, hardware improvements are needed before this technology is viable in the healthcare industry...|$|E

This study investigates {{the influence of}} <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> on eye and head latency during voluntary refixations in the horizontal plane in 14 normal subjects. Three postural conditions were presented, (1) {{sitting in a chair}} using only eye and head movements, (2) standing without feet movements and (3) standing with feet movement. Head–eye reorientations towards eccentric un-predictable locations were performed towards ± 45 ° and ± 90 ° targets and back towards a central, spatially predictable target. Results showed that <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> affected eye latency but only when subjects knew the future location of the target (recentering “return” trials). Specifically, relatively longer eye latencies were observed when subjects had to turn their feet back towards the predictable central target. These findings suggest that the additional CNS processing required to reduce degrees of freedom during predictive motion introduces delays to the eye movement in order to efficiently assemble the components of a new motor synergy...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{establish}} if and how the additional <b>postural</b> <b>constraint</b> of standing affects accuracy and precision of goal directed naturalistic actions. Forty participants, comprising 20 young adults aged 20 – 23 years and 20 children aged 9 - 10 years completed 3 manual dexterity tasks on a tablet laptop with a handheld stylus during two separate conditions [1] while standing [2] while seated. The order of conditions was counterbalanced across both groups of participants. The tasks were [1] a tracking task, where the stylus tracked a dot in a figure of 8 at 3 speeds [2] an aiming task where the stylus moved from dot to dot with individual movements creating the outline of a pentagram [3] a tracing task, where participants had to move the stylus along a static pathway or maze. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), movement time and path accuracy, respectively, were used to quantify the effect that postural condition had on manual control. Overall adults were quicker and more accurate than children when performing all 3 tasks, and where the task speed was manipulated accuracy was better at slower speeds for all participants. Surprisingly, children performed these tasks more quickly and more accurately when standing compared to when sitting. In conclusion, standing at a desk while performing goal directed tasks did not detrimentally affect children's manual control, and moreover offered a benefit...|$|E
40|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of prehension experiments, subjects are requested to grasp a static object and to transport it with respect to the body. There are grasping tasks, however, that have different grasping requirements. For example, in rock climbing, the goal is to grasp a hold to transport the body about the grasped object. Unlike simple reaching and grasping movements, the successful hand grip is not the goal of the task per se, and it is the postural stability that primarily determines {{the success or failure of}} the task. In the present experiment, we wanted to examine the influence of such <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> on the organization of reaching movements. Four expert climbers participated in the study. A climbing simulator, equipped with strain gauges, measured the vertical forces applied by the hands. The subjects performed grasping movements (one-reach and two-reach conditions) towards holds of various depths (easy and difficult holds) in two different postures (standing and climbing conditions). The results showed that the duration of the right-hand transport phase was similar whatever the condition. Unexpectedly, in the climbing condition, the duration of the left-hand transport phase was shorter when the subjects grasped a difficult than when they grasped an easy hold. This result suggests that, in extreme cases such as rock climbing, the <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> may prevail over accuracy constraints, since increasing accuracy requirements did not yield an increased duration of the transport phase...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether postural configuration {{has a significant}} effect upon the kinematics of arm movements when humans performed unconstrained reach movements to visual targets. Eight subjects were required to reach to static visual targets (unperturbed REACH movements) or correct reach movements when {{the position of a}} target unexpectedly changed during the execution of a planned movement (perturbed reaches, or online corrections, OC). Subjects were required to execute REACH and OC movements in sitting and standing (STAND) positions. The height of the targets, distance from the right shoulder (acromion) and eccentricity in terms of the body midline were standardized between the two postural conditions before movements begun. Unperturbed REACH movements were executed to a central target placed at 130 % of outstretched arm length, along the midline (0). Perturbed (OC) movements involved subjects initiating an arm movement to the 0 ° target upon its illumination. Two hundred milliseconds after the onset of the hand movement, the 0 ° target was extinguished and the target at 60 ° {{to the right of the}} midline (still at 130 % outstretched arm distance) illuminated. Subjects had to correct their reach movements online to the new target. Results demonstrated that, despite evident differences in postural kinematics between the four experimental conditions (e. g. pelvis obliquity and trunk/pelvis rotation), postural configuration had little or no effect upon the endpoint kinematics of the finger. Most importantly, the STAND position, with its greater <b>postural</b> <b>constraints,</b> did not affect the time taken to initiate an OC, nor did it lengthen the time taken to complete the REACH or OC movements.

40|$|Abstract — Measuring {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} characteristics of hand movement is a challenging task due to {{the large number of}} degrees of freedom (DOF) in the hand. This paper presents a multi-constrained inverse kinematics (IK) approach for hand motion estimation from motion capture data. The IK approach satisfies a set of prioritized motion and <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> for each hand joint and link. The high-priority constraint is fully satisfied, while the fulfilment of the lowpriority constraints is achieved as long as no conflict with the high-priority constraint exists. The proposed approach can aid marker-based motion capture technologies in accurately reconstructing discontinuities or erroneous marker trajectory segments resulting from occluded, missing, or flipped markers. The performance of the multi-constrained IK approach for the hand is tested for a full range of continuous hand motion. I...|$|R

Kinematic recordings of head movements were made with the newborn secured on a platform in the supine or semi-upright position, which alleviated biomechanical and <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> imposed by gravity. Newborns differed as to whether they had a vertex, Caesarean or breech delivery. The majority of infants maintained a right-sided preference in both positions, but it was strongly mediated by state.

For this purpose, one-handed catching performance was observed under different <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> in children aged 9 - 10 years. Two groups of eleven participants, classified as either good or poor catchers, performed one-handed catches under three different postural conditions: standing, sitting, and standing while pressing a button positioned to a postural support aid (PSA).

Second, poor catchers improved their performance by using the PSA, but not to the same performance as when sitting. Third, there was no effect of postural condition on the performance of the good catchers.

Elevated attentional demands for standing with fatigued plantar flexors have been demonstrated using a stimulus-response reaction-time paradigm. Recently, a direct relation between the regularity of center-of-pressure (COP) fluctuations {{and the amount of}} attention invested in posture was proposed, according to which more regular COP fluctuations are expected with muscle fatigue than without. To study this prediction, we registered anterior-posterior COP fluctuations for bipedal stance with eyes closed prior to and after a plantar-flexor muscle fatiguing exercise protocol in 16 healthy young adults. We quantified the magnitude of COP fluctuations with conventional posturography and its regularity with sample entropy. The magnitude of COP fluctuations increased significantly with fatigued plantar flexors. In addition, more regular COP fluctuations were observed with fatigued plantar flexors, as evidenced by significantly lower sample entropy values. These findings corroborated our hypotheses. Moreover, COP regularity assisted in qualifying the change in sway magnitude with fatigue. Whereas increased sway is customary taken to reflect impaired postural control, we interpret it as a functional, but attention-demanding adaptation to the alteration of important posture-specific information. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAction {{observation}} and action execution are tightly coupled on a neurophysiological and a behavioral level, such that visually perceiving an action can contaminate simultaneous and subsequent action execution. More specifically, observing {{a model in}} postural disequilibrium was shown to induce an increase in observers' body sway. Here we reciprocally questioned the role of observers' motor system in the contagion process by comparing participants' body sway when watching displays of antero-posterior vs. lateral imbalance. Indeed, during upright standing, biomechanical constraints differ along the antero-posterior (A-P) and medio-lateral (M-L) axes; hence an impact of observers' <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> on the contagion response would result in different reactions to both types of stimuli. In response to the displays, we recorded greater area of center of pressure (CoP) displacement when watching forward/backward compared to left/right imbalance. In addition, after normalizing A-P and M-L CoP displacements by a control condition (fixation cross), A-P CoP path length when viewing forward imbalance tended {{to be higher than}} M-L CoP path length when viewing imbalance to the left or right.

40|$|International audienceBeing able to {{estimate}} effort pain in patients {{is important for}} health care providers working in physical rehabilitation services. Previous {{studies have shown that}} clinicians and physiotherapists underestimate patients' pain. METHODS: The present study examined how two sources of visual information, namely body kinematics (movement speed and <b>postural</b> <b>constraints)</b> and facial expressions are integrated in order {{to estimate}} effort pain magnitude experienced by a paraplegic person performing a sitting pivot transfer. In addition, the effect of familiarity with paraplegia on judgment was assessed by comparing performance among physiotherapists, paraplegic patients and unfamiliar participants. Functional measurement was used to determine the psychophysical law of visual information integration carried by pain behaviours (guarding and facial expression). RESULTS: Results indicate that guarding behaviour (specified by movement speed) carried important information for perceived effort pain independently of familiarity. In contrast, facial expression of pain was relevant only to unfamiliar and physiotherapist participants and not to paraplegic participants. Even if physiotherapists underestimated effort pain as compared to the other groups, they relied more strongly on facial expression, than other participants, in their estimation of effort pain expressed by a paraplegic patient. CONCLUSIONS: These results bring further insights into understanding physiotherapists' perception of patients' pain. In order to improve their ability to adapt the difficulty of the rehabilitation sessions, they should learn to raise their global level of pain magnitude estimation (for example, by performing themselves the body movement) instead of overweighting facial pain expression signals...|$|R

One of our interrogations was to know if these differences {{could be due to}} the body posture. To address this question, this study compares humans with new data for gorillas during an unconstrained food prehension task in two body postures, a sitting and a quadrupedal one. The objective is to determine the behavioral and kinematic strategies (amplitudes and patterns of evolution of the articular angles) as well as differences and invariants of trunk and forelimb motions between species. The subjects were recorded by five cameras, and landmarks were digitized frame by frame to reconstruct 3 D movement. Our results show that (1) despite significant influences of body postures on ranges of motion in gorillas and humans, species preserve their specific forelimb joint and trunk contribution; (2) body posture has a limited effect on the basic pattern of wrist velocity. Our study indicates that different primate species have specific kinematic features of limb coordination during prehension, which dose not alter with changes in posture. Therefore, across varying species, it is possible to compare limb kinematics irrespective of <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> and unconstrained condition need to be explored in other primates to understand the evolution of primate prehension...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{vestibular}} system {{contributes to}} a wide range of functions from reflexes to spatial representation. This paper reviews behavioral, perceptive, and cognitive data that highlight the role of changes in internal spatial representation on the vestibular syndrome. Firstly, we review how visual vertical perception and postural orientation depend on multiple reference frames and multisensory integration and how reference frames are selected according to the status of the peripheral vestibular system (i. e., unilateral or bilateral hyporeflexia), the environmental constraints (i. e., sensory cues), and the <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> (i. e., balance control). We show how changes in reference frames are able to modify vestibular lesion-induced postural and locomotor deficits and propose that fast changes in reference frame may be considered as fast-adaptive processes after vestibular loss. Secondly, we review data dealing with the influence of vestibular loss on higher levels of internal representation sustaining spatial orientation and navigation. Particular emphasis is placed on spatial performance according to task complexity (i. e., the required level of spatial knowledge) and to the sensory cues available to de. ne the position and orientation within the environment (i. e., real navigation in darkness or visual virtual navigation without any actual self-motion). We suggest that vestibular signals are necessary for other sensory cues to be properly integrated and that vestibular cues are involved in extrapersonal space representation. In this respect, vestibular-induced changes would be based on a dynamic mental representation of space that is continuously updated and that supports fast-adaptive processes.

40|$|When {{holding a}} tablet {{computer}} with two hands, the touch keyboard configuration imposes <b>postural</b> <b>constraints</b> on the user {{because of the}} need to simultaneously hold the device and type with the thumbs. Designers have provided users with several possible keyboard configurations (device orientation, keyboard layout and location). However, potential differences in performance, usability and postures among these configurations have not been explored. We hypothesize that (1) the narrower standard keyboard layout in the portrait orientation leads to lower self-reported discomfort and less reach than the landscape orientation; (2) a split keyboard layout results in better overall outcomes compared to the standard layout; and (3) the conventional bottom keyboard location leads to the best outcomes overall compared to other locations. A repeated measures laboratory experiment of 12 tablet owners measured typing speed, discomfort, task difficulty, and thumb/wrist joint postures using an active marker system during typing tasks for different combinations of device orientation (portrait and landscape), keyboard layout (standard and split), and keyboard location (bottom, middle, top). The narrower standard keyboard with the device in the portrait orientation was associated with less discomfort (least squares mean (and S. E.) 2. 9 ± 0. 6) than the landscape orientation (4. 5 ± 0. 7). Additionally, the split keyboard decreased the amount of reaching required by the thumb in the landscape orientation as defined by a reduced range of motion and less MCP extension, which may have led to reduced discomfort (2. 7 ± 0. 6) compared to the standard layout (4. 5 ± 0. 7). However, typing speed was greater for the standard layout (127 ± 5 char. /min.) compared to the split layout (113 ± 4 char. /min.) regardless of device orientation and keyboard location. Usage guidelines and designers can incorporate these findings to optimize keyboard design parameters and form factors that promote user performance and usability for thumb interaction...|$|R
40|$|Most {{research}} on bimanual rhythmic coordination has occurred with {{the participants in}} a seated posture. Many activities of daily living, however, require the interaction of standing postural and manual tasks. A population of individuals that are ideal for studying the integration of a manual task into the ongoing control of posture are expert marching percussionists; they have learned to produce rhythmic movements accurately {{under a variety of}} temporal and <b>postural</b> <b>constraints.</b> The purpose of the current study was to investigate the integration of bimanual rhythmic movements and posture in expert marching percussionists. Participants (N= 11) were recruited from the University of Massachusetts Drumline, and were asked to perform three rhythmic tasks [1 : 1, 2 : 3, and 2 : 3 -F (2 : 3 rhythm played faster at a self-selected tempo) ] in one of three postures: sitting, standing on one foot, and standing on two feet. Discrete relative phase, postural time-to-contact, and coherence analysis, were used to analyze the performance of the manual task, postural control, and the integration between postural and manual performance. Across all three rhythms, discrete relative phase mean and variability (SD) results showed no effects of posture on rhythmic performance. The complexity of the manual task (1 : 1 vs 2 : 3) had no effect on postural time-to-contact. However, increasing the tempo of the manual task (2 : 3 vs. 2 : 3 =F) did result in a decreased postural time-to-contact in the two-footed posture). Coherence analysis revealed that the coupling between the postural and manual task significantly decreased as a function of posture (going from a two footed to a one footed posture) and rhythmic complexity (1 : 1 vs. 2 : 3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that expert marching percussionists systematically decouple postural and manual fluctuations in order to preserve the performance of the rhythmic movement task...|$|R
