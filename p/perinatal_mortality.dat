25|$|Several micronutrients are {{important}} {{for the health of}} the developing fetus, especially in areas of the world where insufficient nutrition is common. Women living in low and middle income countries are suggested to take multiple micronutrient supplements containing iron and folic acid. These supplements have been shown to improve birth outcomes in developing countries, but do not have an effect on <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality.</b> Many developed countries suggest that all women who may become pregnant or who are pregnant take a daily multivitamin containing folic acid and iron. In developed areas, such as Western Europe and the United States, certain nutrients such as Vitamin D and calcium, required for bone development, may also require supplementation. Vitamin E supplementation has not been shown to improve birth outcomes. Zinc supplementation has been associated with a decrease in preterm birth, but it is unclear whether it is causative. Daily iron supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anemia. Studies of routine daily iron supplementation for all pregnant women in developed countries found improvement in blood iron levels, without a clear clinical benefit.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Exploring the {{associations}} of regional differences in infant mortality with selected socioeconomic indicators and ethnicity could offer important clues for designing public health policy measures. METHODS: Data included <b>perinatal</b> and infant <b>mortality</b> in the 79 districts of the Slovak population in 2004. Linear regression {{was used to}} analyse the contribution of education, unemployment, income and proportion of Roma population on regional differences in <b>perinatal</b> and infant <b>mortality</b> rates. RESULTS: All the explored socioeconomic indicators and ethnicity individually contributed significantly to both <b>perinatal</b> and infant <b>mortality,</b> {{with the exception of}} income. In the model exploring the influence of all these variables together on <b>perinatal</b> and infant <b>mortality,</b> only the effect of the proportion of Roma population remained significant. This model explained 34. 9 % of the variance for perinatal and 36. 4 % of the variance for infant mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Living in Roma settlements indicates an accumulation of socioeconomic disadvantage. Health literacy, health-related behaviour and many other factors might contribute to the explanation of the differences in infant mortality, and a better understanding of these processes might help us to design tailored interventions...|$|R

We measured peri-natal and infant mortality rates {{in a rural}} district of Thailand and compared them with the official statistics to assess accuracy. All births and infant deaths in a rural district of Thailand over a one-year period were surveyed. The corre-sponding official statistics were also collected. The mothers or the relatives of all stillbirths and infant deaths were interviewed about the registration of the stillbirths or infant deaths.

25|$|A low {{socioeconomic}} status in a deprived neighborhood may include exposure to “environmental stressors and risk factors.” Socioeconomic inequalities are commonly {{measured by the}} Cartairs-Morris score, Index of Multiple Deprivation, Townsend deprivation index, and the Jarman score. The Jarman score, for example, considers “unemployment, overcrowding, single parents, under-fives, elderly living alone, ethnicity, low social class and residential mobility.” In Vos’ meta-analysis these indices are used to view the effect of low SES neighborhoods on maternal health. In the meta-analysis, data from individual studies were collected from 1985 up until 2008. Vos concludes that a correlation exists between prenatal adversities and deprived neighborhoods. Other {{studies have shown that}} low SES is closely associated with the development of the fetus in utero and growth retardation. Studies also suggest that children born in low SES families are “likely to be born prematurely, at low birth weight, or with asphyxia, a birth defect, a disability, fetal alcohol syndrome, or AIDS.” Bradley and Corwyn also suggest that congenital disorders arise from the mother’s lack of nutrition, a poor lifestyle, maternal substance abuse and “living in a neighborhood that contains hazards affecting fetal development (toxic waste dumps).” In a meta-analysis that viewed how inequalities influenced maternal health, it was suggested that deprived neighborhoods often promoted behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use. After controlling for socioeconomic factors and ethnicity, several individual studies demonstrated an association with outcomes such as <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> and preterm birth.|$|E

This {{is supported by the}} positive results of the NTP bioassays with Ni sub-sulfide and Ni oxide in rats and mice. The human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation. Nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen; there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder. In the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal, increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed. In rat studies, oral ingestion of water soluble nickel salts can trigger <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> effects in pregnant animals.

However, {{there are several}} predisposing factors for the increased risk of pregnancy related complications and deaths in developing countries.
