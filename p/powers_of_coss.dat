Coping strategies were measured using the Compass <b>of</b> Shame Scale (<b>CoSS)</b> and hypersexual behaviour was measured by the Hyper-sexual Behavior Inventory (HBI). A multivariate analysis of variance of between-group differences was signifi cant, and examination of post hoc univariate tests revealed that the sample of hypersexual patients defended against shame with higher levels of withdrawal and higher tendencies to attack self and others when compared with the control group. The effect sizes of these differences were moderate to large.

50|$|In March 1597, Scudamore {{was married}} to Mary Houghton, the {{daughter}} and co-heiress of Peter Houghton, a London alderman. She died in August 1598, and {{in the summer of}} 1598 he re-married to the widow of Sir Thomas Baskerville, coincidentally also named Mary. Mary (she is listed as Anne in some sources) was the only daughter of Sir Thomas Throckmorton <b>of</b> <b>Coss</b> Court, by his second wife. By her first husband, Mary had one son, Hannibal (5 April 1597 - 1668). Research suggests that his marriage with Lady Mary Scudamore was turbulent. For reasons that are uncertain, she was disliked by the Scudamore family, and Sir James's relatives pressured them to end the marriage. They separated in 1604. Scudamore tried to claim wardship of Hannibal Baskerville and Mary's dower, but by 1621, the case had finally been settled in Hannibal's favour.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis the {{development}} of new, efficient and bioorthogonal conjugation methods for the derivatization <b>of</b> cube-octameric silsesquioxanes (<b>COSS)</b> is described. The successful synthesis <b>of</b> an octaazide <b>COSS</b> scaffold allowed for the eightfold conjugation of an octa-RGD peptide via copper(I) -catalyzed alkyne-azide [3 + 2] cycloaddition (CuAAC) in a water-free system. As COSS cages are stable in acidic media and aldehydes are easily addressable in this environment, aminooxy-functionalized silsesquioxane derivatives promise high reaction rates upon oxime ligation. Thus, pendant aminooxy groups were introduced into an octaamino COSS precursor by amide coupling with protected aminooxy acetic acid. The subsequent oximation allowed the efficient conjugation {{with a number of}} peptidic molecules having up to 35 amino acids in their backbones, among them functional peptides as [KVSALKE] 5 or disulfide-rich miniproteins. The number of attached ligands was not only dependent on the reaction rate, but was also dictated by the steric and electrostatic repulsion of the ligands. Thus, this work showed different experimental approaches to the synthesis <b>of</b> biofunctionalized <b>COSS.</b> Furthermore, a peptide-COSS conjugate was used to demonstrate the possibility to address a central cellular process (DNA replication in higher cells), showing the great application potential of these nanoparticles. Additionally, a preparatory approach is described that might allow for the synthesis of alcohol- and aldehyde-derivatized COSS particles via biotransformation of halogenated silsesquioxanes using haloalkane dehalogenases. ...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{coherent}} state {{representation of the}} evolution operator {{with the help of}} the path–integral, we derive a formula for the low–lying levels E = ǫ 0 − 2 △ǫ cos(s + ξ) π of a quantum spin system. The quenching of macroscopic quantum coherence is understood as the vanishing <b>of</b> <b>cos(s</b> + ξ) π in disagreement with the suppression of tunneling (i. e. △ǫ = 0) as claimed in the literature. A new configuration called the macroscopic Fermi–particle is suggested by the character of its wave function. The tunneling rate (2 △ǫ) does not vanish, π not for integer spin s nor for a half–integer value of s, and is calculated explicitly (for the position dependent mass) up to the one–loop approximation. The question whether or not superpositions of macroscopically distinct quantum states exist in nature has attracted considerable attention in recent years owing mainly to the development of technology in mesoscopic physics. Thus Leggett et al. [1] predicted that the most intriguing quantum effect which could take place on the macroscopic scale is quantum tunneling[1]. Macroscopic magnetisation tunneling is a subject which is being investigated extensively and is of growing interest [2, 3]. In discussing this, it is essential to distinguish betwee...|$|R
40|$|Two-component signal {{transduction}} systems are commonly {{composed of a}} sensor histidine kinase and a cognate response regulator, modulating gene expression in response to environmental changes through a phosphorylation-dependent process. CosR is an OmpR-type response regulator essential for the viability of Campylobacter jejuni, a major foodborne pathogenic species causing human gastroenteritis. Although CosR is a response regulator, its cognate sensor kinase has not been identified in C. jejuni. In this study, DNA sequence analysis of the cosR flanking regions revealed that a gene encoding a putative sensor kinase, which we named cosS, is prevalent in non-thermotolerant Campylobacter spp., but not in thermotolerant campylobacters. Phosphorylation assays indicated that C. fetus CosS rapidly autophosphorylates and then phosphorylates C. fetus CosR, suggesting that the CosRS system constitutes a paired two-component {{signal transduction}} system in C. fetus. However, C. fetus CosS does not phosphorylate C. jejuni CosR, suggesting that CosR may have different regulatory cascades between thermotolerant and non-thermotolerant Campylobacter species. Comparison of CosR homolog amino acid sequences showed that the conserved phosphorylation residue (D 51), which is present in all non-thermotolerant Campylobacter spp., is absent from the CosR homologs of thermotolerant Campylobacter species. However, C. jejuni CosR was not phosphorylated by C. fetus CosS even after site-directed mutagenesis of N 51 D, implying that C. jejuni CosR may possibly function phosphorylation-independently. In addition, the results <b>of</b> <b>cosS</b> mutational analysis indicate...|$|R
