60|$|I must do him {{the justice}} to say, however, {{that when he}} {{made up his mind}} finally to settle in that town, it was under the {{impression}} that no newspaper, and consequently no editor, existed in that particular section of the country. In establishing 'The Tea-Pot' he expected to have the field all to himself. I feel confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis had he been aware that, in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, there lived a gentleman named John Smith (if I rightly remember), who for many years had there quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the 'Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis Gazette.' It was solely, therefore, on account of having been misinformed, that Mr. Bullet-head found himself in Alex-suppose we call it Nopolis, 'for short'--but, as he did find himself there, he determined to keep up his character for obst--for firmness, and remain. So remain he did; and he did more; he unpacked his <b>press,</b> <b>type,</b> etc., etc., rented an office exactly opposite to that of the 'Gazette,' and, on the third morning after his arrival, issued the first number of 'The Alexan'--that is to say, of 'The Nopolis Tea-Pot'--as nearly as I can recollect, this was the name of the new paper.|$|E

The Press produced all its books using a single size of this type, between 1900 and 1916, and is considered {{to have been a}} significant contributor to the Arts and Crafts movement. The founders were associated with William Morris and the Kelmscott <b>Press.</b> The Doves <b>type</b> was based on types used by Nicolas Jenson from the 1470s, similar to Morris's earlier Golden Type, and like it cut by punchcutter Edward Prince.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} by Paredes et al. (2000) of {{a persistent}} microquasar that is positionally coincident with an unidentified gamma-ray source has {{open the possibility}} that other sources in the Third EGRET Catalog could be interpreted as microquasars as well. In this letter we show that some variable unidentified EGRET sources in the galactic plane could be produced by faint, otherwise undetected microquasars with precessing jets. When the jet points towards the observer, gamma-ray emission resulting from upscattered stellar photons could be detectable yielding a variable source with weak or undetectable counterpart at longer wavelengths. Strategies for detecting these``microblazars'' with forthcoming satellites are briefly discussed.

50|$|The first editor, Samuel Stillman Parker (1776-1811), was {{a doctor}} who trained under his father the Reverend Isaiah Parker, MD of Harvard, Massachusetts. Samuel S.

A variety of circumstantial {{evidence}} suggests that Isaiah Parker purchased a printing <b>press,</b> <b>type,</b> paper, and book stock from John Mycall of Newburyport, Massachusetts in 1798 in partial exchange for land in Harvard. The elder Parker's name appeared in the 1800 Boston Directory as the newspaper's publisher and editor. However, the paper's first 2 October 1799 masthead shows that Samuel S. Parker was the original editor. Samuel S. Parker sent the Constitutional Telegraphe to presidential candidate Thomas Jefferson gratis.|$|E

On September 23, 1960, http://www.nevadaobserver.com/Chronological%20History%20of%20La%20Cosa%20Nostra%20(1988).htm Squillante disappeared. According to some accounts, Squillante was handcuffed live to the steering wheel of a rusty Chevrolet and the car was moved into a baling <b>press</b> <b>type</b> compactor. The metal was then melted down in an open hearth furnace. However, some newspaper accounts of that period claim that Squillante was actually seen on September 30 at 2 a.m. driving around the Bronx neighborhood in his brother-in-law's car. In any case, Squillante's body was never found and no murder suspects were ever arrested.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} block was from CZ which had an over square bore x stroke. Carburetors were either Jikov (tickler choke) or Pacco (<b>press</b> <b>type</b> choke) {{of which the}} former was exclusively for Roadking while the latter was used for Classic models. The spark plugs were of cold type and the bike also featured a semi-automatic or auto clutch, where a cam inside the gearbox housing automatically activated the clutch through a cam which is unique to this and other Yezdi models in India. The familiar Jawa-CZ twin exhaust ports made the unmistakable sound when the exhaust flute mufflers and end-cores were removed. Another unique feature of the bike was that the kick-starter and the gear shared the same rod as with all Yezdi models. Once the gear rod is reversed it doubles as a kicker and once started it automatically returns to the original position. The lever has an internal cam which engages/disengages the clutch when the gear is shifted thereby precluding {{the need for a}} hand-clutch.|$|E

50|$|The press style used is {{in direct}} {{correlation}} {{to the end}} product. <b>Press</b> <b>types</b> are straightside, BG (back geared), geared, gap, OBI (open back inclinable) and OBS (open back stationary). Hydraulic and mechanical presses are classified by the frame the moving elements are mounted on. The most common are the gap-frame, also known as C-frame, and the straightside press. A straightside press has vertical columns {{on either side of}} the machine and eliminates angular deflection. A C-frame allows easy access to the die area on three sides and require less floor space. A type of gap-frame, the OBI pivots the frame for easier scrap or part discharge. The OBS timed air blasts, devices or conveyor for scrap or part discharge.|$|R
