40|$|Facies and {{fracture}} {{network modeling}} need robust, realistic and multi scale methods that can extract and reproduce complex relations in geological structures. Multi Point Statistic (MPS) algorithms {{can be used}} to model these high order relations from a visually and statistically explicit model, a training image. FILTERSIM as a pattern based MPS method attracts much attention. It decreases the complexity of computation, accelerates search process and increases CPU per-formance compare to other MPS methods by transferring training image patterns to a lower dimensional space. The results quality is not however as satisfactory. This work presents an improved version of FILTERSIM in which pattern extraction, persisting and <b>pasting</b> <b>steps</b> are modified to enhance visual quality and structures continuity in the realiza-tions. Examples shown in this paper give visual appealing results for the reconstruction of stationary complex struc-tures...|$|R
40|$|Geologic {{modeling}} of complex structures needs realistic algorithms that can extract and reproduce position-dependent statistical relations in these phenomena. For this purpose, methods based on Multi Point Statistics (MPS) {{should be developed}} because spatial patterns such as curvilinearity cannot be recognized via two-point statistical concepts. MPS extracts high order spatial relations from a Training Image (TI) as a visually and statistically explicit model and some regional images in non-stationary cases. In this work a novel pattern to pattern filter-based algorithm is first presented for {{modeling of}} stationary spatial structures. Then for non- stationary images, in an automatic preprocessing step, one scale and azimuth for each node in final realization map is inferred from regional/auxiliary images. These values are used in patterns similarity measurements and <b>pasting</b> <b>steps</b> in a multi-scale simulation process. Performance of proposed algorithms is investigated by applying the methods on several binary 2 D training images. In comparison, lower running time and better visual quality in all cases is clear. In the final non-stationary images, spatial statistics of training images and physical features of regional images are reproduced and traditional methods related concepts such as search tree and realization zoning and their unintended effects are eliminated.

40|$|Two {{nonparametric methods}} for the {{identification}} of subgroups with outstanding outcome values are described and compared {{to each other in}} a simulation study and an application to clinical data. The Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) searches for box-shaped areas in the given data which exceed a minimal size and average outcome. This is achieved via a combination of iterative peeling and <b>pasting</b> <b>steps,</b> where small fractions of the data are removed or added to the current box. As an alternative, Classification and Regression Trees (CART) prediction models perform sequential binary splits of the data to produce subsets which can be interpreted as subgroups of heterogeneous outcome. PRIM and CART were compared in a simulation study to investigate their strengths and weaknesses under various data settings, taking different performance measures into account. PRIM was shown to be superior in rather complex settings such as those with few observations, a smaller signal-to-noise ratio, and more than one subgroup. CART showed the best performance in simpler situations. A practical application of the two methods was illustrated using a clinical data set. For this application, both methods produced similar results but the higher amount of user involvement of PRIM became apparent. PRIM can be flexibly tuned by the user, whereas CART, although simpler to implement, is rather static...|$|R
30|$|Of course, {{significant}} interpretations {{will only}} {{be drawn from the}} assessment of all the available data. Epigraphy, for example, has demonstrated the growth of the imperial domain at Loron, which could explain—at least partially—why a new source of raw material was exploited at this particular {{time in the history of}} the workshop. The merit of adding analytical techniques to the arsenal of traditional archaeological methods is to open new avenues of inquiry. This appears, indeed, to be the case here, with the examination of raw material collection and <b>paste</b> preparation <b>steps</b> in ceramic production, which are not commonly studied due to the scarcity of archaeological evidence.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of tomato <b>paste</b> {{processing}} <b>steps</b> on pesticides with active ingredient endosulfan and deltamethrin were investigated in Biga/Canakkale. Residue data were obtained by analyzing samples taken during harvesting, taken after washing and chopping, taken after pulping (pulp and pomace) and taken from the tomato paste with GC-ECD. In {{the process of making}} tomato paste, washing decreased endosulfan and deltamethrin, 30. 62 % and 47. 58 %, respectively. Pre-heating, pulping, evaporation and half-pasteurization increased deltamethrin 2. 33 % while decreasing endosulfan 66. 5 % after washing. The whole process decreased endosulfan and deltamethrin, 76. 8 % and 46. 3 %, respectively. The residues were mostly collected in pomace...|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{a second}} level of {{explanation}} {{relates to the}} technology of amphora production in the workshop and its evolution through time. Clay bodies are seldom made from a naturally occurring single source of clay sediment. Sometimes quite numerous and complex <b>paste</b> preparation <b>steps</b> are introduced in the chaîne opératoire of the ceramic product. Amphora production is generally regarded as involving minimal paste preparation since the quantities of raw materials needed to ensure a large output would be considerable. Potters are thus supposed to select the most convenient clay material available i.e. one that needs little or no preparation. Nevertheless, this rather simplistic view should not dismiss the fact that addition or removal of non-plastics and clay mixing might have taken place, sometimes in sizeable proportions, which would greatly affect chemical results. This could also explain observed differences in K 2 O and CaO contents.|$|R
30|$|Planar linear {{discrete}} {{systems with}} constant coefficients and weak delay are considered. The characteristic equations of such systems are identical with {{those for the}} same systems but without delayed terms. In this case, the space of solutions with a given starting dimension is <b>pasted</b> after several <b>steps</b> into a space with dimension less than the starting one. In a sense this situation copies an analogous one known from the theory of linear differential systems with constant coefficients and weak delay when the initially infinite dimensional space of solutions on the initial interval on a reduced interval, turns (after several steps) into a finite dimensional set of solutions. For every possible case, general solutions are constructed and, finally, results on the dimensionality of the space of solutions are deduced.|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of solid/liquid suspensions is largely {{influenced by the}} size and concentration of the solid particles. This work deals exclusively with ceramic suspensions used in the Portuguese ceramic industry, i. e., several Portuguese clays and feldspars, and also suspensions made of mixtures of these two materials. The flow tests conducted showed that, generally, the suspensions had a pseudoplastic character, approaching Newtonian behaviour as concentration decreased, though, in some cases, a real plastic behaviour was also observed {{as in the case}} of very fine clays with a wide particle size distribution and high solids content. Moreover, it was possible to relate, for each material, both the flow behaviour index and the fluid consistency coefficient with the solids concentration and particulate size. As the particle diameter decreases the suspensions become less Newtonian: the flow behaviour index decreases and the consistency coefficient increases. A similar trend was detected, for each material, with the increase of solids concentration. However, with the results obtained, it was not yet possible to establish an analytical correlation between those variables but, nevertheless, since the ceramic industry deals with very complex suspensions, additional information on the {{rheological behaviour}} of the <b>pastes</b> is a <b>step</b> forward to more predictive flow calculations...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a novel suspended membrane resistive gas sensor on a ceramic substrate. The sensor is designed and simulated to be fabricated by combining laser milling techniques, conductive ceramic technology, thin film technology, and semiconductor metal oxides. Trenches are created in the alumina substrate in order to define the geometry of the heater using laser processing of the substrate. The heater is completed by filling the trenches with conductive ceramic paste and then baking to remove the solvent from the <b>paste.</b> The next <b>step</b> consists of polishing the surface to obtain a surface roughness small enough for thin film technology. A dielectric (SiO 2 or ceramic) material is then deposited, acting as hot plate and also as electrical isolation between the heater and sensing electrode. The sensing electrode consists of an interdigitated resistor made of Au or Pt with thickness in the range of 2000 - 3000 Å. The gas sensitive layer (SnO 2) is deposited by screen printing or spinning. When heated it react with gas molecules and changes its resistivity, thereby acting as a sensor. The final step involves releasing the sensor, enabling it to be suspended on four bridges, to minimise the dissipation of the heat in the substrate. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{a double}} glass system with PbO base and ZnO base of Cu paste is designed, {{prepared}} and printed with narrow line {{screen printing process}} on polycrystalline Si solar cell which has already finished the back Al printing and deposition of double anti-reflection coatings (DARCs). And then, a two-step firing process is applied to sinter the front electrode and obtain the ohmic contact between front electrode and solar cell. The first step of firing is conducted in air atmosphere. In this process, PbO-based glass frit etched the DARCs and Ag recrystallized at the surface of Si, constructing the preliminary contact. The second step of firing is conducted in a reducing atmosphere (H 2 /N 2  =  5 / 95). In this process, the CuO is reduced into Cu which is sintered with ZnO based-glass. Ag nanoparticles recrystallized in the glass layer at interface due to the interactions between H 2, Ag and PbO-based glass frit and the volatility of Pb, improve the Ohmic contact between electrode and solar cell. According to our investigation, {{a model of the}} reaction mechanisms in the double glass system of Cu paste in each sintering stage is proposed. And we have shown that Ohmic contact and good sheet resistance for the Cu front electrode with Pb-free could both be obtained by applying the newly-invented Cu <b>paste</b> and two <b>steps</b> of firing process. The lowest sheet resistance and contact resistance for such a Cu front electrode measured are 0. 090  Ω/□ and 0. 0040  Ω/□, respectively...|$|R
