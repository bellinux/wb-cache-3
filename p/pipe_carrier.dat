40|$|Aboriginal peoples {{are part}} of the history and culture of Canada. The history is a tragedy as the Europeans exerted control of the land, {{resources}} and Aboriginal peoples themselves. The years of control, oppression and assimilation have caused historical trauma, scarring generations of Aboriginal peoples in physical, emotional, mental and spiritual ways. In spite of the trauma, the literature suggests that Aboriginal traditions are being passed on to future generations. Traditionally, the knowledge and traditions of Aboriginal cultures have been passed on through stories and experiences. This indigenous knowledge is part of the collective wisdom and culture of our world. It is important to ensure the knowledge is being passed on to ensure Aboriginal cultures thrive and the diversity of the world continues (Davis 2009). This thesis explores the dynamics of the passing on of the traditional Aboriginal teachings in an urban setting. Specifically, it explores the role of <b>Pipe</b> <b>Carriers,</b> how they acquired their knowledge and how they are passing it on to the next generation. This information is discussed {{in the context of the}} history of colonization and the health care needs of Aboriginal peoples today. This study is important as it builds on previous research that has documented the intricacies of the Aboriginal cultures and the impact of colonization on Aboriginal peoples. Previous research has also documented the disparity between the health of the general population and Aboriginal peoples, the inability of the health care system to meet the needs of Aboriginal peoples, and the growing percentage of Aboriginal peoples in Winnipeg. The existing literature on these topics, combined with the lack of literature on the role of <b>Pipe</b> <b>Carriers</b> as traditional healers, provide the justification for this study...|$|R

40|$|The Nu MI beamline {{discussed}} {{here is a}} modular optics design, characterized by 4 sections: MI {yields} beamline matching; periodic FODO cells; a special insertion to traverse the <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe,</b> and a versatile final focus section to produce the desired spot-size on the target.

25|$|Heat is {{transferred}} either by conduction or convection. When water is heated, kinetic energy {{is transferred}} by conduction to water molecules throughout the medium. These molecules spread their thermal energy by conduction and occupy more space than the cold slow moving molecules above them. The {{distribution of energy}} from the rising hot water to the sinking cold water contributes to the convection process. Heat is transferred from the absorber plates of the collector in the fluid by conduction. The collector fluid is circulated through the <b>carrier</b> <b>pipes</b> to the heat transfer vault.

30|$|An {{analysis}} method for the buckling process of a pipe section with a random pipelay imperfection is proposed. Four basic lateral modes, acquired by finite-element (FE) eigenvalue buckling analysis, are combined {{to provide the}} needed grid configurations for describing a real pipelay imperfection and an arc-length algorithm is {{used to analyze the}} snap-through process of the shell-element-grid model under nonlinear frictional boundary conditions. This paper also presents evaluation methods for the lateral buckling of two types of pipe-in-pipe systems that are used in the offshore oil and gas industry. For evaluating the buckling and postbuckling of compliant pipe-in-pipe systems FE analyses were carried out to judge the occurrence of the system buckling and furthermore to check postbuckling stresses induced in the buckles. The calculated results of the modified Riks algorithm indicate that only when high temperature would not trigger an abrupt short-wavelength buckle and when no yielding has been induced in the unavoidable long-wavelength buckles, the thermal stability and safety of compliant pipe-in-pipe systems can be proved. In the non-compliant pipe-in-pipe systems, firstly small-amplitude buckles of the <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> may occur in the annulus between <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> and casing pipe and the contact forces between the spacers and the casing pipe may drive the buckle of the pipe-in-pipe systems on the seabed. Based on the classical analytical solution of pipe buckling, four potential buckling modes corresponding to finite-element models are developed to evaluate the stability and the postbuckling strength of such pipe-in-pipe systems.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} {{outlines}} {{the advantages of}} using trenchless methods for the rehabilitation of pipelines made of steel, concrete, cast iron etc. The authors describe causes of <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> ageing and methods of their inspection and renovation. The technical aspects of choosing the renovation methods are also presented. The paper includes a decision-making flowchart for choosing the <b>carrier</b> <b>pipes</b> renovations. Design/methodology/approach: The 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s saw an explosion of new pipe installation and repair techniques which minimize the need to dig continuous trenches to bury the pipeline, so called ‘trenchless technologies’. The trenchless technologies have been widely applied for the rehabilitation of various pipelines such as sewage systems, gas pipelines or water supply systems. There has been characterized the swagelining technology {{which is based on}} one of the metal working technologies and namely the sinking of pipes. Findings: The PE pipe stress in the drawing die zone has been analyzed and an attempt has been made to analyze the mechanisms causing the elastic recovery of PE pipes. There have also been presented the diameter changes as the parameter of the elastic recovery which is a result of our own research conducted in accordance with the program developed. Research limitations/implications: Each pipeline renovation method has its advantages and disadvantages, possibilities and limitations, depending on the application. Practical implications: The work is an example of analysis of chosen trenchless renovation on the example of swageling technology. Originality/value: The trenchless renovation of pipelines certainly will be more readily used in the future because of wearing out of pipelines. The other reason is the lack of space for new utilities, increasing costs and road-surface restoration requirements...|$|R
