40|$|Introduction: An intact <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> {{is crucial}} to proper {{function}} of a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT). Failure of the <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> or disruption of the inflation tubing results in cuff deflation which may lead to inadequate ventilation and aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. We describe a method that we employed using readily available components to repair a <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> and inflation tubing, and report {{on the effectiveness of}} the repair method, as tested in vitro.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> design {{on the ability of}} {{experienced}} anaesthetists to assess and inflate tracheal tube cuffs to safe pressures. A model trachea was designed, incorporating a degree of compliance and an air leak, to evaluate six different <b>pilot</b> <b>balloons</b> grafted onto identical tracheal tubes. <b>Pilot</b> <b>balloons</b> were inflated to one of four pressures and anaesthetists were asked to estimate whether the pressure was acceptable, too low or too high. Anaesthetists were then asked to inflate the cuff of each tube. Overall, 103 (42. 9 %) of anaesthetists' assessments of tracheal tube cuff pressures were correct (33 % correct would be expected by chance, p = 0. 002). Pressures generated by anaesthetists inflating tracheal tube cuffs were very variable. Median (IQR [range]) pressures for each <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> ranged from 29 (17 - 43 [9 - 56]) cmH(2) O to 74 (49 - 114 [4 - 140]) cmH(2) O (p < 0. 001). The design of the <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> significantly affects anaesthetists' ability to inflate tracheal tube cuffs to safe pressures...|$|R

40|$|We have {{assessed}} {{the feasibility of}} retrograde nasotracheal intubation using a flexometallic tracheal tube with a detachable <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> and connector {{in a study of}} 20 consecutive adult patients undergoing oropharyngeal surgery. The technique consisted of: (1) laryngostope-guided orotracheal intubation; (2) insertion of an 18 -gauge Foley catheter through the nose and retraction into the mouth; (3) detachment of the anaesthesia circuit, <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> and connector; (4) insertion of the Foley catheter tip into the proximal end of the tracheal tube and inflation of the Foley catheter cuff; (5) withdrawal of the Foley catheter and attached tracheal tube back through the nose; (6) deflation of the Foley catheter cuff; and (7) reattachment of the <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon,</b> connector and anaesthesia circuit. The technique was successful at the first attempt in all patients. Mean time taken to insert the Foley catheter and retract it into the mouth was 19 (range 12 - 30) s. Mean time taken from disconnection to reconnection of the anaesthesia circuit was 8 (6 - 10) s. Heart rate increased after intubation, but there were no significant changes in arterial pressure. Nasal bleeding, airway problems and hypoxic events did not occur. No anatomical abnormalities or nasal trauma were detected at rhinoscopy. We conclude that retrograde nasotracheal intubation is feasible using a flexometallic tracheal tube with a detachable <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> and connector...|$|R
40|$|Low-level wind {{observations}} {{were made by}} manual <b>theodolite</b> readings of <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> positions. Simultaneous readings were made from three theodolites with time intervals ranging from 5 to 60 sec. and for altitudes up to 8, 428 ft. above the surface. The theodolite readings were analyzed as three simultaneous double theodolite observations of the wind vectors between the successively observed positions of the <b>balloons.</b> If the <b>theodolite</b> readings were completely accurate, {{each of the three}} simultaneous wind vectors would be identical. The differences between the magnitudes and directions of the horizontal components of the simultaneous wind vectors were used as a measure of the observational accuracy of the balloon movements. Twenty-sec. intervals between theodolite readings were found to give the greatest accuracy; the accuracy decreased rapidly as the time interval was shortened but the accuracy was nearly the same as the time interval was increased.

40|$|Estimation of cuff {{pressure}} by palpating the <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> is not accurate {{to determine the}} cuff pressure of endotracheal tube (ETT). Hence, this study we conducted to compare the accuracy of indirect measurements between <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> palpation method (MP) and passive release technique (MSP). This was a single blind randomized crossover study performed in june 2014 at Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung, in which patients received each technique and as a control group. Subjects were 94 patients aged 18 − 65 years old with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I−III who underwent surgery requiring tracheal intubation. These subjects were randomized into two groups. After induction of anesthesia, the cuff was inflated with two different techniques: <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> palpation technique (n= 48) and passive release technique (n= 46). Data were statistically analyzed using independent t-test and chi-square test. The mean cuff pressures of group MP was 57. 7 ± 26. 0 cmH 2 O and for group MSP was 28. 7 ± 4. 5 cmH 2 O, whereas the precision of measurements in the MSP group was 56. 5 % and 6. 2 % in the MP group (p< 0. 001). It is conclude that the palpation method for cuff inflation are inadequate. Therefore, {{it is suggested that}} the endotracheal tube cuff pressure must be kept within the optimal range using a standard manometer...|$|R
