25|$|With the {{completion}} of grouping in 1923, GWR's collection of 0-6-0 tank locomotives was expanded with the stock from 28 acquired companies. The acquired tank locomotives came from different manufacturers, were a mixture of side, saddle and <b>pannier,</b> and varied widely by size and state of repair. In addition, GWR's stock was wearing out, and the variety of classes was problematic for maintenance and rostering. Collett had to produce a new standard design for 0-6-0 <b>pannier</b> tanks. The result was the 5700 class.|$|E
25|$|LT kept eleven {{locomotives}} {{for use in}} departmental work. From 1956 {{these were}} replaced by ex-GWR 0-6-0PT <b>pannier</b> tanks, {{to be replaced by}} diesel-hydraulic locomotives DL81 to DL83 in 1971.|$|E
25|$|The 5700s {{were never}} fitted remote control gear for working autotrains. This {{was left to}} smaller <b>pannier</b> {{locomotives}} that followed; the 5400 class (introduced in 1930) and the 6400 Class (introduced in 1932).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Panniers</b> mount {{on either}} side of the rear of the {{motorcycle}} roughly underneath (but not interfering with) the seating position of the pillion passenger. [...] "Hard" [...] <b>panniers</b> commonly come in an injection molded plastic such as ABS, and [...] "soft" [...] <b>panniers</b> come in some form of textile (e.g. Cordura) or leather. <b>Panniers</b> are nearly always detachable and often lockable, both of their mountings and their closure. Suitcase-like <b>panniers,</b> side-loading, are ideal for carrying clothing into hotel rooms while top-loading hard <b>panniers</b> are more suitable for shopping trips.|$|R
50|$|Traditional <b>panniers</b> {{for animal}} {{transport}} are typically made of canvas, leather, or wicker. Modern <b>panniers</b> may be rectangular boxes of hard-sided plastic. <b>Panniers</b> are loaded {{in such a}} manner as to distribute weight evenly {{on either side of the}} animal. For horse packing, and when carrying particularly heavy loads on other animals they are supported by a pack saddle to distribute weight more evenly across the back of the animal. In some cases, additional items are placed on the back of the animal, between the <b>panniers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The rear {{bodywork}} {{included a}} pair of integral <b>panniers</b> and a rear mount for a spare wheel. The <b>panniers</b> were accessed by unlatching a panel under the pillion.|$|R
25|$|There are {{a number}} of types of tank locomotive, based on the {{location}} and style of the water tanks. These include the side tank, the saddle tank, the <b>pannier</b> tank, the well tank and others.|$|E
25|$|The Lickey was {{transferred}} to the Western Region in 1958 and the 3F tanks were replaced by GWR 9400 Class <b>pannier</b> tanks and 92079 was replaced by classmate 92230, which did not acquire the headlight.|$|E
25|$|The Great Western Railway (GWR) 5700 Class, or 57xx class, is a {{class of}} 0-6-0 <b>pannier</b> tank steam locomotive, built between 1929 and 1950. 863 were built, making them the most {{prolific}} class of the GWR, {{and one of the}} most numerous classes of British steam locomotive.|$|E
50|$|<b>Panniers</b> may {{be mounted}} to {{front and rear}} luggage {{carriers}}. Removable <b>panniers</b> hook onto {{the top edge of}} the carrier and then are held in place by a spring or elastic cord that hooks near the wheel axle at the bottom. Some luggage carriers have an extra, lower, rail to hang <b>panniers</b> on, this provides better stability and more space on the platform.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} styles of bicycle <b>panniers.</b> Touring <b>panniers</b> are usually sold in pairs, {{intended}} to hold enough equipment for self-sustained tours over days or weeks. The most common setup {{is to use}} a pair of smaller <b>panniers</b> (10 to 15 liters each) mounted on a low rider and a pair of larger ones on the rear carrier (20 to 30 liters each).|$|R
50|$|On a motorcycle, modern <b>panniers</b> are {{normally}} hard-shell cases mounted behind {{the seat and}} on either-side of the rear wheel, attached to a framework (which bolts to the motorcycle frame) known as a carrier. Modern <b>panniers</b> are made to be quickly-detachable.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to those mainly passenger locomotives, many new classes of freight engines were produced: the <b>pannier</b> tank locomotives of the GWR and the Garratt heavy freight 2-6-0+0-6-2 locomotive of the LMS (although the latter were not a huge success {{and only a few}} were built) being two examples.|$|E
25|$|The early 0-6-0 tank engines were {{fitted with}} either saddle tanks (wrapped over the boiler) or side tanks (mounted {{at the side}} of the boiler and {{reaching}} down to the running platform). GWR first fitted <b>pannier</b> tanks (mounted on the side of the boiler but not reaching down to the running platform) in 1898 to nine 4-4-0 tank locomotives and, in 1901, to five 0-6-0T locomotives which were also fitted with Belpaire fireboxes. The shape of the Belpaire firebox gives a larger surface area which improves heat transfer and steam production, but their rectangular shape made them difficult to combine with saddle tanks. Locomotives fitted with <b>pannier</b> tanks have a lower centre of gravity than those with saddle tanks (enabling higher speeds on curves), and access for maintenance is easier than for those fitted with side tanks.|$|E
25|$|The 9700 Class, or 97xx class, <b>pannier</b> {{tanks were}} a direct {{development}} of the 5700 class. The prototype for the class, No. 8700 (later No. 9700), was a rebuilt 5700 locomotive. They were specifically for working on the Metropolitan/Hammersmith & City lines between Paddington Stations and Smithfield Meat Market. They replaced Metro and 633 class locomotives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Panniers</b> {{are usually}} built to attach to a rear rack or front rack already fitted to the bicycle. Removable <b>panniers</b> hook {{onto the top}} edge of the rack and are often held in place by a latch or elastic mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle <b>panniers</b> are {{generally}} hard box containers with lids, made of metal or hard plastic. The <b>panniers</b> may be permanently {{fixed to the}} motorcycle or may be removable. Soft cases may be leather or fabric usually without permanent mountings and are often called saddlebags or 'throwovers'.|$|R

25|$|No. 9642 was {{withdrawn}} in 1964 {{and sent to}} Hayes Scrapyard, near Bridgend. Rather than being scrapped, {{it was used to}} shunt other locomotives being scrapped. It was due to be scrapped in 1967, but a last minute intervention resulted in its being bought (1968) and restored by the South Wales <b>Pannier</b> Group, becoming the first of the class to be preserved.|$|E
25|$|Between 1959 and 1965 the National Coal Board (NCB) bought five 5700s from BR for use at pits in South Wales, {{continuing}} {{a tradition of}} the GWR selling withdrawn <b>pannier</b> tank locomotives to the NCB. The engines retained their BR numbers. The NCB locomotives did not receive maintenance to match GWR standards and were run into the ground, saving the cost of expensive overhauls.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, {{an episode}} of the long-running UK TV sitcom Last of the Summer Wine was filmed partly along the Worth Valley route, in which the three main {{characters}} Compo, Foggy and Clegg visit and then to attempt to stop a runaway steam train having pulled the brake on purpose (and then only to drive upwards and downwards). The locomotive used was <b>Pannier</b> 5775 in its London Transport guise as L89.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} Commander were built. The P52 was a single-seat model {{equipped}} for police use. The second was the dual-seat P53 civilian tourer. Both the P52 and P53 had <b>panniers</b> integral with their fibreglass bodywork. The P53 bodywork was later revised to have detachable Krauser K2 <b>panniers.</b>|$|R

25|$|Similarly, the 0-6-0 tank {{locomotives}} {{became the}} most common locomotive type on all railways throughout the 20th century. All of the Big Four companies {{to emerge from the}} Railways Act, 1921 grouping used them in vast numbers. The Great Western Railway, in particular, had many of the type, most characteristically {{in the form of the}} <b>pannier</b> tank locomotive that remained in production well past railway nationalisation in 1948.|$|E
25|$|The {{first batch}} of 300 {{locomotives}} built between 1929 and 1931 included a medium height chimney, a mid-boiler dome, safety valve with cover, and an enclosed cab. The boiler included a top-feed (between the chimney and dome). They {{were similar in}} appearance to older 0-6-0 tank engines that had been rebuilt as <b>pannier</b> tanks, particularly the later rebuilds of the 2721 class. The 2721 class was itself a development of the 1854 class, which in turn {{was based on the}} 645 class.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the largest}} {{locomotives}} are permanently coupled to a tender {{that carries the}} water and fuel. Often, locomotives working shorter distances {{do not have a}} tender and carry the fuel in a bunker, with the water carried in tanks placed next to the boiler either in two tanks alongside (side tank and <b>pannier</b> tank), one on top (saddle tank) or one underneath (well tank); these are called tank engines and usually have a 'T' suffix added to the Whyte notation, e.g. 0-6-0T.|$|E

50|$|By the mid-18th century a woman took {{up three}} times as much space as a man and always {{presented}} an imposing spectacle. At their most extreme <b>panniers</b> could extend the skirt several feet at each side. By the 1780s, <b>panniers</b> were normally worn only to very formal gowns and within court fashion.|$|R

25|$|The Nimrod {{featured}} a large crew {{of up to}} 25 personnel, although a typical crew numbered roughly 12 members, most of which operated the various onboard sensor suites and specialist detection equipment. A {{significant proportion of the}} onboard sensor equipment was housed outside the pressure shell inside the Nimrod's distinctive <b>pannier</b> lower fuselage. Sensor systems included radar, sonar, and the magnetic anomaly detector; a 'sniffer' could detect exhaust fumes from diesel submarines as well. The Nimrod and its detection capabilities was an important component of Britain's military defence {{during the height of the}} Cold War.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{completion}} of infrastructure work, such as {{the replacement of the}} water tower at Dereham and the provision of an inspection pit, steam passenger services returned to the Dereham to Wymondham Abbey section on Sunday 30 April 2006. These were operated by Great Western Railway <b>pannier</b> tank number 9466 from the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The ownership of the section of railway line between Dereham and North Elmham, part of that originally authorised by the Norfolk Railway Extensions, Dereham, Wells and Blakeney Branch Act 1846, was passed to the Mid-Norfolk Railway in October 2001.|$|E
25|$|Cars {{could also}} be transported through the Severn Tunnel. In the 1950s three trains a day made round trips between Severn Tunnel Junction and Pilning. The {{vehicles}} were loaded onto open flat bed carriages and pulled by a small <b>pannier</b> tank locomotive, although sometimes they were joined to a scheduled passenger train. The prudent owner paid to cover the vehicle with a sheet, as sparks often flew when the steam locomotive tackled the slope leading to the tunnel exit. A railway coach was provided for passengers and drivers. Reservations could be made and the fee for the car was about thirty shillings (£1.50) in the early 1950s.|$|E
