50|$|The Honda CBR600F4 was {{produced}} between 1999 and 2000. It {{is the last}} of the CBR600 series of Honda sportbikes to be carbureted. An aluminium twin spar frame which reduced frame weight was used, and the engine crankcase was designed to share swing-arm pivot. Through a reduction of internal friction and weight, combined with larger valves, shorter stroke, and a bigger bore, higher revs were enabled. The spark <b>plug</b> <b>caps</b> had Ignition coils built into them. Slightly larger carbs were added and the oil cooler was now located by the oil filter. A new suspension had larger 43 mm forks and used Fireblade parts. The front brakes were upgraded, and the rear rim increased to 5.5” with new 3-spoke wheels. The F4 was fitted with Honda’s HISS engine immobiliser system.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the diminutive endo/epiphytic red alga Pihiella liagoraciphila was examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. The {{structure of}} the pit plugs consisted of a <b>plug</b> core with <b>cap</b> membranes but no cap layers, thus supporting the independence of this species from the Ahnfeltiales, {{to which it is}} most closely related in a molecular phylogeny but whose members have pit <b>plugs</b> without <b>cap</b> membranes. Hair cells were common and prominent and were characterized by exceptionally large pit plugs and an unusual membranous lattice adjacent to the pit plugs. The presence of large, degenerating pit plugs on the flanks of the cells subtending hair cells indicates that the hair cells can regenerate by division of the subtending cell, which acts as an initial. Sporangia also appear to regenerate from their stalk cells. These findings have implications for understanding the incompletely known life history of P. liagoraciphila...|$|R

40|$|Morphological, ultrastructural, and cytochemical {{characteristics}} of the red alga Plocamium cartilagineum from Antarctica have been studied and {{compared with those of}} the same species from the Mediterranean Sea. Distinct regions with possibly different functions were recognisable in the bushy thallus of Plocamium cartilagineum. Chloroplasts were concentrated in the outermost cell layer, while in the other cortex cells abundant floridean starch accumulated. No starch was found in the large medullary cells, characterised by the insertion in their walls of several large and lenticular pit connections devoid of <b>plug</b> <b>caps</b> and proteic in nature. Sulphated polysaccharides were distributed in the extracellular compartments of all the regions of the thallus, except in the surface layer. These acidic phycocolloids were particularly concentrated in the cell wall proper, which also exhibited a well organised fibrillar component probably consisting of cellulose. The distinctive feature of the Antarctic thalli, compared with the Mediterranean ones, was the lack, in the former, of recognisable phycobilisomes on the thylakoid surfaces. This peculiarity had already been noticed in the other Antarctic red alga Iridaea cordata, collected, like Plocamium cartilagineum, in summer and from ice free waters. The loss of phycobilisomes may be a defence mechanism activated by benthic shade-adapted red algae from Antarctica to protect the photosynthetic apparatus against damage from high light intensities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Louisiana red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, {{which was}} {{introduced}} into Egypt in the 1980 s, {{has since become}} widespread across the country. Burrowing behavior of P. clarkii, was investigated in irrigation canal of three different sites (Abou-Kabir, Abou-hammad and Belbies) at Sharkia Governorate from January 2014 to December 2015. Most burrows were simple in their morphology and few of them had two types of chimney (plugged and open). Open chimney was present at 100 cm of the edge side of irrigation canal, while <b>plugged</b> <b>cap</b> chimney was located inside the agriculture soil. Result indicated that {{a great number of}} P. clarkii were observed migrating across roadways to find the main irrigation canal, during their crossing many of them were killed by cars. The highest mean numbers of burrows and population density of P. clarkii were recorded at Abou-Kabir followed by Abou-hammad while Belbies was the lowest one in this respect during two successive years of 2014 and 2015. Furadan 10 G is routinely applied in Egypt rice fields was examined in the laboratory against P. clarkii in trial to control its explosive populations in certain closed habitats. Data showed that after 96 h, at the higher concentrations (70 ppm) 100 and 90 % of mortality were recorded for adult males and females of P. clarkii, respectively while at lower concentrations (50 ppm) the mortality was 70 and 60 % for both sexes respectively.

40|$|International audienceAn {{authoritative}} case of Vulcanian eruptive dynamics is {{the series}} of 88 explosions that occurred between August and October 1997 at Soufrière Hills volcano on Montserrat Island. The state of the magmatic column just before a Vulcanian explosion is still poorly understood, but conditions the eruptive style. This study establishes such a pre-explosive stratigraphy by 1) documenting the textures covering {{the range of the}} 1997 products, 2) quantitative analysis of H 2 O content in interstitial glass measured by Karl–Fischer Titration, and 3) combining these data with a simple model linking pre- and post-explosive vesicularities. The model shows that syn-explosive degassing affects greatly the way porosity evolves by decompression during an explosion. The stratigraphy reconstruction shows a three-part vertical layering of the conduit prior to explosion with overall denser values than those previously suggested. A dense and strongly degassed <b>plug</b> <b>caps</b> the column. It is underlain by a shallow transition zone featuring complex mingling between vesicular and dense magma up to 10 MPa. At higher pressure, up to 80 MPa, lies a more homogeneous zone of relatively dense (10 – 20 vol. %) magma, which was emplaced under partly open-system degassing. This conduit stratigraphy gives the vision of a strongly heterogeneous magma column immediately prior to its disruption. Our analysis suggests that fragmenting such a composite magma cannot happen in a single coherent pulse, but rather as stages. The transition zone contains heterogeneous amounts of exsolved gas that could explain the pulsatory nature of the Vulcanian jets {{at the beginning of the}} explosions. This contrasts with the nearly constant vesicularities of the deeper part of the pre-explosive magma column, which are propitious to a general, short-lived disruption...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The crystal {{structure}} of selenomethionine-substituted malate synthase G, an 81 kDa monomeric enzyme from Escherichia coli {{has been determined}} by MAD phasing, model building, and crystallographic refinement to a resolution of 2. 0 Å. The crystallographic R factor is 0. 177 for 49 242 reflections observed at the incident wavelength of 1. 008 Å, and the model stereochemistry is satisfactory. The basic fold of the enzyme {{is that of a}} â 8 /R 8 (TIM) barrel. The barrel is centrally located, with an N-terminal R-helical domain flanking one side. An inserted â-sheet domain folds against {{the opposite side of the}} barrel, and an R-helical C-terminal domain forms a <b>plug</b> which <b>caps</b> the active site. Malate synthase catalyzes the condensation of glyoxylate and acetyl-coenzyme A and hydrolysis of the intermediate to yield malate and coenzyme A, requiring Mg 2 +. The structure reveals an enzyme-substrate complex with glyoxylate and Mg 2 + which coordinates the aldehyde and carboxylate functions of the substrate. Two strictly conserved residues, Asp 631 and Arg 338, are proposed to provide concerted acid-base chemistry for the generation of the enol(ate) intermediate of acetyl-coenzyme A, while main-chain hydrogen bonds and bound Mg 2 + polarize glyoxylate in preparation for nucleophilic attack. The catalytic strategy of malate synthase appears to be essentially the same as that of citrate synthase, with the electrophile activated for nucleophilic attack by nearby positive charges and hydrogen bonds, while concerted acid-base catalysis accomplishes th...|$|R

For the acclimatization, in vitro ipê-roxo plants were transplanted into 56 -cm 3 plastic tubes containing vermiculite and Plantmax® at a 2 : 1 ratio which had been previously autoclaved at 121 oC and 1 atm for 20 minutes. Once transplanted, the plants were irrigated with different concentrations of the MS medium (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 % and 150 %), using distilled water as control. After 30 days, the effects of seal type and substrate type on pre-acclimatization were examined. Cotton can be recommended where Plantmax® or vermiculite is used as substrate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the change in water surface elevation and chloride concentration in the surficial, Mid Hawthorn, and Lower Hawthorn aquifers in the Cape Coral peninsula between 1980 and 1999. Seawater intrusion is a major concern in the Cape Coral area because the city is surrounded by open bodies of saline or brackish waters: Matlacha Pass to the west, San Carlos Bay to the south and Caloosahatchee River to the east. Prior to 1980, the principal groundwater withdrawals were from the Mid Hawthorn aquifer, with some smaller withdrawals from the surficial and Lower Hawthorn aquifers. Since 1980, many wells in the City of Cape Coral have been <b>plugged</b> and <b>capped,</b> decreasing the movement of water between the aquifers. In addition, withdrawals have primarily shifted to the Lower Hawthorn, which is now the principal water supply for the City of Cape Coral. Between 1980 and 1999 the water surface elevation in the surficial aquifer has remained relatively stable and chloride concentrations have decreased. During the same period, chloride concentrations have remained stable within the Mid Hawthorn aquifer. However, the potentiometric surface of the Mid and Lower Hawthorn has decreased and the chloride concentrations in the Lower Hawthorn in the vicinity of the City 2 ̆ 7 s wellfield have increased as a direct result of increased withdrawals. In addition, the area of highest chloride concentration within the City has moved west from its historic location, toward the City 2 ̆ 7 s reverse osmosis plant. The facility is roughly at the center of the wellfield that supplies water to the plant from the Lower Hawthorn. The potentiometric surface of the Mid Hawthorn has also decreased in the outlying areas of the Cape, mostly to the south and east, due to downward seepage into the Lower Hawthorn and well field pumping to the south in Ft.
