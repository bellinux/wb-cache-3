Conventionally, for induction heating load, the output power control is achieved using the pulse with modulation based converters. The conventional converters do not guarantee the zero voltage switching condition {{required for the}} minimization of the switching losses. In this paper, <b>pulse</b> <b>mask</b> control scheme for the power control of induction heating load is proposed. This power control strategy allows the inverter to operate closer to the resonant frequency, to obtain zero voltage switching condition. The proposed high frequency AC power conversion circuit has lesser total harmonic distortion in the supply side. Modeling of the IH load, design of conversion circuit and principle of the control scheme and its implementation using low cost PIC controller are briefly discussed. Simulation results obtained using the Matlab environment are presented to illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>pulse</b> <b>mask</b> scheme. The obtained results indicate the reduction in losses, improvement in the output power and lesser harmonic distortion in the supply side by the proposed converter. The hardware results are in good agreement with the simulation results. ...|$|E

The auditory nerve compound action potential evoked by an acoustic probe was forward-masked by a train of charge-balanced biphasic current <b>pulses.</b> <b>Masking</b> {{as a function of}} probe frequency reflected the excitation pattern of the response to the masker and resembled the spectrum of the electrical stimulus. Both pulse rate and pulse width influenced the degree of masking. The vibration of a region of the basilar membrane was estimated by recording the local cochlear microphonic evoked by biphasic pulses. The amplitude of the cochlear microphonic was proportional to the amplitude of the spectral component of the electrical stimulus to which the local cochlear microphonic was tuned.

40|$|Publisher’s {{permission}} requested and denied. Many cochlear prostheses employ charge-balanced biphasic current pulses. These pulses {{have little}} energy at low frequencies resulting in limited stimulation of low frequency hearing by mechanical {{responses to the}} electrical stimulus. However, if electro-mechanical transduction within the cochlea is nonlinear, electrical stimulation with asymmetric, charge-balanced current pulses {{may result in a}} mechanical response with significantly more low frequency energy. We estimated the mechanical response at low frequencies to pulsatile electrical stimulation of the cochlea. The auditory nerve compound action potential evoked by low frequency tones was forward-masked by a train of symmetric or asymmetric current <b>pulses.</b> <b>Masking</b> by asymmetric current pulses was not significantly different from <b>masking</b> by symmetric <b>pulses</b> matched for pulse duration and charge. In conclusion, {{there appears to be no}} advantage to using asymmetric current pulses for the mechanical stimulation of residual low frequency hearing by electrical stimulation of the cochlea.

40|$|Abstract Canaries (Serinus canaria) {{were kept}} singly in cages {{placed in an}} artificially illu-minated, {{soundproof}} cabinet. Perch-hopping activity was recorded {{by means of a}} computer system. In three series of experiments, the activity rhythms of the birds were entrained to 24 hr by light-dark (LD) cycles with 4, 12, or 20 hr of light (L), respectively. The intensity of illumination was 10 lux in L and 0. 25 lux in darkness (D). Under LD 4 : 20 and 12 : 12, the intensity of D was increased daily at the same zeitgeber time to 1 lux for 1 hr (L pulse) during about 8 consecutive days. This sequence was followed by 8 days without L pulses before giving another series of L pulses at a different zeitgeber time. Under LD 20 : 4, the intensity of L was decreased to 1 lux for 1 hr (D pulse). The activity of all birds was more or less increased by the L <b>pulses</b> (positive <b>masking)</b> and decreased by the D <b>pulses</b> (negative <b>masking).</b> The level of masking activity during the L and D pulses depended on the circadian phase at which the pulses were administered. Positive <b>masking</b> by L <b>pulses</b> was minimal about 5 hr after the beginning of D, and increased steadily thereafter.

40|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) {{can be used}} to mask visual stimuli, disrupting {{visual task}} performance or preventing visual awareness. While TMS masking studies generally fix stimulation intensity, we hypothesized that varying the intensity of TMS <b>pulses</b> in a <b>masking</b> paradigm might inform several ongoing debates concerning TMS disruption of vision as measured subjectively versus objectively, and pre-stimulus (forward) versus post-stimulus (backward) TMS masking. We here show that both pre-stimulus TMS pulses and post-stimulus TMS <b>pulses</b> could strongly <b>mask</b> visual stimuli. We found no dissociations between TMS effects on the subjective and objective measures of vision for any masking window or intensity, ruling out the option that TMS intensity levels determine whether dissociations between subjective and objective vision are obtained. For the post-stimulus time window particularly, we suggest that these data provide new constraints for (e. g. recurrent) models of vision and visual awareness. Finally, our data are in line with the idea that pre-stimulus masking operates differently from conventional post-stimulus masking...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} {{is based}} on an imaging method using dual-frequency band pulses for imaging of nonlinear scatters from stiff particles like micro calcifications. The pulse complex consist of a high-frequency imaging pulse and a low-frequency manipulation pulse which overlap in time. The frequency ratio between the two pulses is in the range of 10 : 1. This technique has already demonstrated to perform well while imaging resonant nonlinear scatters from such as micro bubbles. However, imaging of lower intensity nonlinear scatters from stiff particles has not yet been achieved. It can be shown that the magnitude and the polarity of the nonlinear scatters follows the magnitude and the polarity of the low-frequency pulse. Imaging of stiff particles requires higher manipulation pressure, but the manipulation pressure does not change the scattering only. The co-propagating high frequency pulse observes a non homogeneous low frequency pressure and becomes distorted. This distortion of the high frequency <b>pulse</b> <b>masks</b> the nonlinear scattering, and to achieve sufficient suppression of the linear scattering the distortion must be corrected for. In this thesis two agar based phantoms have been made. In both phantoms reverberation layer(s) of plastic was mounted. Steel wires with diameters 0. 5 mm, 0. 3 mm were positioned below the plastic layer(s) together with calcium particles of bead size 190 micrometer. Images of both phantoms have been compared using conventional B-mode imaging and the presented method. In the first phantom, Phantom A, the SNR for two steel wires and a calcium particle were increased by 8 - 9 dB while class 3 reverberations were suppressed down to the backscatter noise level. Similarly for the second phantom, Phantom B, class 1, 2 reverberations were suppressed and the SNR for two steel wires were increased by 11 - 12 dB. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{different}} way to increase the energy within a coherent processing interval (CPI) is suggested – many short dense pulses with inter-pulse coding instead of few widely-spaced long pulses with intra-pulse coding. Long coded <b>pulses</b> re-sult in <b>masking</b> targets at close range and suffer from poor Doppler tolerance. We overcome the range ambiguity, in-herent to dense pulses (high PRF), by inter-pulse coding. Ideal range response (no ambiguity, no sidelobes) can be obtained, e. g., by using a binary periodic Ipatov sequence for inter-pulse coding. The periodic property is maintained {{as long as the}} number of transmitted periods exceeds the number of processed periods by at least two. 1...|$|R

40|$|Summary. A {{flexible}} and robust approach is {{proposed for the}} investigation of underlying hormone secretion-generating mechanism. Characterizing hormone time series is a difficult task as most hormones are secreted in a pulsatile manner and <b>pulses</b> are often <b>masked</b> by the slow decay. We model hormone concentration as a filtered counting process where the intensity function of the counting process is modeled nonparametrically using periodic splines. The intensity function and parameters are estimated {{using a combination of}} weighted least squares and pseudo-likelihood based on the first two moments. Our method uses concentration measurements directly which avoids the difficult task of estimating pulse numbers and locations. Both simulations and applications suggest that our method performs well for estimating the intensity function of the pulse-generating counting processes.

40|$|Behavioral {{measures}} of spatial selectivity in cochlear implants are important both for guiding the programing of individual users’ implants {{and for the}} evaluation of different stimulation methods. However, the methods used are subject to a number of confounding factors that can contaminate estimates of spatial selectivity. These factors include off-site listening, charge interactions between masker and probe <b>pulses</b> in interleaved <b>masking</b> paradigms, and confusion effects in forward masking. We review the effects of these confounds and discuss methods for minimizing them. We describe one such method in which the level of a 125 -pps masker is adjusted so as to mask a 125 -pps probe, and where the masker and probe pulses are temporally interleaved. Five experiments describe the method and evaluate the potential roles of the different potential confounding factors. No evidence was obtained for off-site listening of the type observed in acoustic hearing. The choice of the masking paradigm was shown to alter the measured spatial selectivity. For short gaps between masker and probe pulses, both facilitation and refractory mechanisms had an effect on masking; this finding should inform the choice of stimulation rate in interleaved masking experiments. No evidence for confusion effects in forward masking was revealed. It is concluded that the proposed method avoids many potential confounds but that the choice of method should depend on the research question under investigation...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the effectiveness of}} silicon phase masks to implement spatially resolved, multispectral imaging capabilities {{in the range of}} terahertz frequencies, using a standard setup of basic interest for time-domain spectrometry with a single-cell source and a single-cell detector. Our principle primarily aims at the development of robust and inexpensive systems. It consists of appropriate space-to-time encoding, in order to ensure single-scan triggering and then take advantage of rapid and self-consistent measurements in the two-dimensional space. The process enables very efficient discrimination giving access to a relevant spatial resolution in the analysis of small size, planar assemblies made of inhomogeneous materials. Benchmark results are provided to validate the concept, thanks to prototyping phase masks with 2  ×  2 pixels, prior evidencing actual performance limitations in the case of 3  ×  3 pixels. Due to the frequency bandwidth of 0. 1 – 1. 5  THz in our setup and to the available operating conditions, currently acceptable pixel resolutions lie in the range of 3 – 4  mm. Numerical modeling by means of finite elements helps to discuss these numbers and to investigate the relevant theoretical issues, figuring the main propagation issues in connection with a sub-picosecond seed <b>pulse</b> throughout various <b>masks.</b> This involves diffraction and trailing edge effects when crossing the mask together with residual, parasitic reflections. Finally, we give a consistent prospective for improved performance, via realistic updates regarding the architecture of the setup and complementary post-processing.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{implement}} a new eye tracking mask which could be used to guide the laser beam in automated non-mechanical excimer laser assisted penetrating keratoplasty. Materials and methods: A new trephination mask design with an elevated surface geometry has been proposed with a step formation between conical and flat interfaces. Two recipient masks of 7. 5 / 8. 0 mm have been manufactured and tested. The masks have outer diameter of 12. 5 mm, step formation at 10. 5 mm, and slope of conical surfaces 15 °. Its functionality has been tested in different lateral positions and tilts on a planar surface, and pig eye experiments. After successful validation on porcine eyes, new masks have been produced and tested on two patients. Results: The build-in eye tracking software of the MEL 70 was always able to capture the masks. It has been shown that the unwanted pigmentation/pattern induced by the laser <b>pulses</b> on the <b>mask</b> surface does not influence the eye-tracking efficiency. The masks could be tracked within the 18 × 14 mm lateral displacement and up to 12 ° tilt. Two patient cases are demonstrated. No complications were observed during the surgery, although it needs some attention for aligning the mask horizontally before trephination. Stability of eye tracking masks is emphasized by inducing on purpose movements of the patient head. Conclusion: Eye-tracking-guided penetrating keratoplasty was successfully applied in clinical practice, which enables robust tracking criteria within an extended range. It facilitates the automated trephination procedure of excimer laser-assisted penetrating keratoplasty...|$|R
40|$|Cochlear {{implants}} {{stimulate the}} auditory nerve with amplitude-modulated (AM) electric pulse trains. Pulse rates > 2, 000 {{pulses per second}} (pps) have been hypothesized to enhance transmission of temporal information. Recent studies, however, have shown that higher pulse rates impair phase locking to sinusoidal AM in the auditory cortex and impair perceptual modulation detection. Here, we investigated the effects of high pulse rates on the temporal acuity of transmission of pulse trains to the auditory cortex. In anesthetized guinea pigs, signal-detection {{analysis was used to}} measure the thresholds for detection of gaps in pulse trains at rates of 254, 1, 017, and 4, 069 pps and in acoustic noise. Gap-detection thresholds decreased by an order of magnitude with increases in pulse rate from 254 to 4, 069 pps. Such a pulse-rate dependence would likely influence speech reception through clinical speech processors. To elucidate the neural mechanisms of gap detection, we measured recovery from forward masking after a 196. 6 -ms pulse train. Recovery from masking was faster at higher carrier <b>pulse</b> rates and <b>masking</b> increased linearly with current level. We fit the data with a dual-exponential recovery function, consistent with a peripheral and a more central process. High-rate pulse trains evoked less central masking, possibly due to adaptation of the response in the auditory nerve. Neither gap detection nor forward masking varied with cortical depth, indicating that these processes are likely subcortical. These results indicate that gap detection and modulation detection are mediated by two separate neural mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|In this study, short latency {{vestibular}} evoked potentials (VsEPs) {{were recorded}} in five guinea pigs in response to alternating linear acceleration pulses with and without acoustic masking. A steel bolt was implanted in the skull and coupled to a shaker. Linear acceleration pulses (n = 400) in upward, downward or alternating directions were given, with a peak acceleration of 4 g after 0. 5 msec. Tests were repeated with acoustic masking, after modiolus destruction and after application of KCl in the vestibule. Stimuli of the vestibular nerve were recorded with a platinum electrode in the bony facial nerve canal in the bulla. Unilateral linear acceleration showed a shallow plateau at 0. 5 msec, which disappeared with alternating acceleration impulses and after modiolus destruction. Therefore all further tests were done with alternating impulses. After a latency time of 0. 8 msec a multiwave response was seen, with a first positive peak P 1 at 1. 16 ms. These were followed by other positive and negative peaks (N 1, P 2, N 2, P 3, N 3). With the elimination of cochlear influences by using acoustic masking, P 1 remained stable, while subsequent peaks were altered or eliminated. After modiolus destruction, the P 1 peak remained, although with a smaller amplitude due to vestibular damage. After application of a saturated KCl solution in the vestibule all responses, including P 1, disappeared, thus confirming the vestibular origin of these responses. We conclude that the onset latency of the VsEP and the peak latency and level of the first positive peak P 1 in response to alternating linear acceleration <b>pulses</b> without acoustic <b>masking,</b> measured in the facial canal, are good and stable parameters of vestibular function in guinea pigs...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide, Cochlear Implants (CIs) {{have already}} {{partially}} restored hearing to over 219000 profoundly hearing-impaired people. CIs attempt {{to stimulate the}} survival Auditory Nerve (AN) fibers directly by means of electrical pulses. Electrical stimulation is provided via an array of electrodes implanted inside the cochlea, which directly activates the AN fibers by means of biphasic Symmetric (SYM) pulses, i. e. an initial phase followed by a second phase with the same amplitude but with opposite polarity. Because electrical stimulation is delivered extracellularly, AN fibers could become depolarized and hyperpolarized at several neural sites and the excitation may be substantially different depending on AN status, electrode-neuron interface, and polarity. The necessity of charge balanced stimulation has precluded the use of monophasic stimuli (pulses consisting only in one phase) to study polarity effects in human CI users {{and most of the}} research concerning polarity effectiveness has been investigated in animal and computational models. However, recently, asymmetric charge-balanced pulse shapes and CI devices with recording capabilities have allowed researchers to study polarity effectiveness on CI users either by means of Electrically evoked Compound Action Potential (ECAP) or by means of behavioral measurements. Contrary to the majority of the results obtained with animals and computational models, those studies suggest that the positive (anodic) current stimulates the AN more effectively than the cathodic one in human CI users. The studies presented in this document aim to examine how neurons at different sites are affected by different stimulus shapes as well as the potential benefits of combining non-standard pulse shapes by means of objective ECAP and Electrically evoked Auditory Brainstem Response (EABR) as well as behavioral experiments. In chapter 2 we study whether the high sensitivity to the anodic current observed formerly for an electrode {{in the middle of the}} array, can be generalized to stimulation at the base and apex of the CI array. Threeexperiments studied the effect of stimulus polarity on the ECAP obtained with the masker-probe paradigm on different sites along the cochlea in CI users. The results of all the experiments extend those of a previous study, showing that the AN in humans is preferentially activated by anodic stimulation, to different sites along the cochlea by means of Monopolar (MP) stimulation. In chapter 3 we present a quantitative analysis of ECAP responses in order to determine an objective detection criterion based on the statistical properties of the noise. The study quantitatively investigates the properties of the Background Noise (BN) and the remaining post average Residual Noise (RN) in ECAP responses recorded from human CI users with the Across-sweeps Noise Estimator (ASNE) method. The analysis of the statistical properties of the noise indicated that a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 1. 7 dB as a detection criterion corresponds to a false positive detection rate of 1 % with the used measurement setup. In chapter 4 we study whether the high sensitivity to the anodic current is also observed in Bipolar (BP) stimulation mode. Spreads of Excitation (SOEs) produced by different <b>masking</b> <b>pulse</b> shapes presented in MP and BP mode are examined by means of the ECAP, obtained using the forward-masked paradigm in human CI users. The SOEs obtained with the MP masker showed a main excitation peak close to the masker electrode, whereas SYM maskers produced bimodal excitation patterns showing two peaks close to the electrodes of the masker channel. The SOEs obtained using Symmetric with a long Inter-Phase Gap (SYM-IPG) (for which the maskers second phase is responsible for most of the masking) and Pseudomonophasic (PS) maskers were more pronounced close to the masker electrode for which the effective phase was anodic. These results showed that the anodic polarity is the most effective one in BP mode and that the bimodal patterns produced by SYM maskers could be partially reduced by using asymmetric pulses. Chapter 5 investigates polarity effects at the level of the brainstem. Previous behavioral studies showing that the human AN of CI users is mainly excited by the anodic polarity have only been obtained with asymmetric PS, and it was assumed that only the short high-amplitude phase was responsible for the excitation. Similarly, in our previous studies it has been shown that ECAPs could only be obtained in response to the anodic phases of asymmetric pulses. However, it is possible that ECAP responses to cathodic responses were not detected due to the characteristics of the effective place of excitation across and along the AN fibers. In this chapter we measured EABRs to SYM and asymmetric pulse shapes presented for both polarities. It is shown that responses were time-locked to the short high-amplitude phase of asymmetric pulses, and were smaller, but still measurable, when that phase was cathodicthan when it was anodic. A behavioral experiment studied the polarity sensitivity at different intensities by means of a loudness balancing task between asymmetric stimuli of opposite polarity. The results showed that cathodic stimuli required higher amplitudes than anodic stimuli to reach the same loudness at different stimulus levels. This study provides the first evidence that cathodic stimulation can excite the auditory system of human CI listeners, and confirms that this stimulation is nevertheless less effective than for the anodic polarity. nrpages: 245 status: publishe...|$|R
