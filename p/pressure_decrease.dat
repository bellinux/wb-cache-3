5|$|Luminosity {{has been}} {{reported}} in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature, moisture, and pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003 near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a 100 mbar (hPa) (2.95 inHg) <b>pressure</b> <b>decrease.</b> The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar (hPa) (25.10 inHg) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.|$|E
500|$|On {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression moved northwestward at , partially {{under the influence}} of a mid- to upper-level low near the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. Deep convection and banding features increased, and the depression intensified into a tropical storm early on September10. Upon being designated, the cyclone was named Linda by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). As upper-level outflow became well-established, the storm began to strengthen quickly. By September11, an intermittent eye appeared, by which time the NHC estimated that Linda reached hurricane status. The storm began to rapidly intensify; its small eye became well-defined and surrounded by very cold convection. In a 24‑hour period, the minimum pressure dropped , or an average drop of [...] per hour. Such intensification met the criterion for explosive deepening, an average hourly <b>pressure</b> <b>decrease</b> of at least [...] By early September12, Hurricane Linda reached Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and around 0600UTC, Linda attained estimated peak winds of 185mph (295km/h) about 145mi (235km) southeast of Socorro Island. Its maximum sustained winds were estimated between 180mph (285km/h) and 195mph (315km/h), based on Dvorak T-numbers of 7.5 and 8.0 respectively, and gusts were estimated to have reached 220mph (350km/h). The hurricane's pressure is estimated at , making Linda the most intense Pacific hurricane at the time. When the storm was active, its pressure was estimated to have been slightly lower, at [...]|$|E

50|$|Common {{household}} tower {{fans are}} also cross-flow fans. Much {{of the early}} work focused on developing the cross-flow fan for both high and low-flow-rate conditions, and resulted in numerous patents. Key contributions were made by Coester, Ilberg and Sadeh, Porter and Markland, and Eck. One phenomenon particular to the cross-flow fan is that, as the blades rotate, the local air incidence angle changes. The result is that in certain positions the blades act as compressors (pressure increase), while at other azimuthal locations the blades act as turbines (<b>pressure</b> <b>decrease).</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is based on}} the differential in atmospheric pressure, directly correlated with the observer's frequency of and level of experience in high-altitude metabolism. As the external <b>pressure</b> <b>decreases,</b> the difference in pressure between the gas within the body and the atmosphere outside is higher, and the urge to expel gas to relieve the pressure is greater. Consistent with Boyle's law, controlling for dietary variance, the amount of gas produced is constant in mass, but the volume increases as the external <b>pressure</b> <b>decreases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both {{coffee and}} tea have tannins, which is {{responsible}} for the astringent taste, but tea has nearly three times smaller tannin content than coffee. Thus, decaffeination of tea requires more care to maintain tannin content than decaffeination of coffee in order to preserve this flavor. Preserving tannins is desirable not only because of their flavor, but also because they have been shown to have anticarcinogenic, antimutagenic, antioxidative, and antimicrobrial properties. Specifically, tannins accelerate blood clotting, reduce blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>decrease</b> the serum lipid level, produce liver necrosis, and modulate immunoresponses.|$|E
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to quote specific dump rates even for specific types of aircraft since the dumped fuel is not pumped but delivered by gravity feed {{so as to be}} more independent of electrical systems, which might be unavailable in a fuel dump scenario. This means the actual rate depends on the pressure exerted by the fuel head: the more fuel on board, the higher the rate at which it flows out. This also means that the dump rate is not constant, but decreases while dumping because the fuel head and its <b>pressure</b> <b>decrease.</b>|$|E
50|$|Air {{pollutant}} concentrations {{expressed as}} mass per unit volume of atmospheric air (e.g., mg/m3, µg/m3, etc.) {{at sea level}} will decrease with increasing altitude. The concentration decrease is directly proportional to the <b>pressure</b> <b>decrease</b> with increasing altitude. Some governmental regulatory jurisdictions require industrial sources of air pollution to comply with sea level standards corrected for altitude. In other words, industrial air pollution sources located at altitudes well above sea level must comply with significantly more stringent air quality standards than sources located at sea level (since {{it is more difficult}} to comply with lower standards). For example, New Mexico's Department of the Environment has a regulation with such a requirement.|$|E
