5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} getting rid of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or <b>pyrethroid</b> insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E
40|$|Synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> {{form the}} main class of {{synthetic}} organic insecticides, which are applied in agriculture, household, and public health. Synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> account form more than 30 % of insecticide use worldwide, thereby they gradual replace chemicals of {{insect pest control}} as organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides. <b>Pyrethroids</b> are synthetic derivates of natural pyrethrins. In comparison with natural pyrethrins have <b>pyrethroids</b> greater photostability, greater resistence to degradation and greater insecticidal activity. <b>Pyrethroids</b> are labeled as potent neurotoxicants, which interact with sodium channels. <b>Pyrethroids</b> occur in abiotic and biotic environmental matrices.

Many residents resist DDT spraying, objecting to the lingering smell, stains on walls, and the potential exacerbation of problems with other insect pests. <b>Pyrethroid</b> insecticides (e.g. deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin) can overcome some of these issues, increasing participation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> are {{pesticides}} {{derived from}} naturally occurring pyrethrins, taken from pyrethrum of dried Chrysanthemum flowers. They are chemically {{designed to be}} more toxic with lower break down times and are formulated with synergists increasing potency and compromising the body’s ability to detoxify the pesticide. Though claimed to be selectively toxic to insects, synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> are extremely toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish in concentrations {{similar to those used}} for controlling mosquito, black fly and tsetse fly larvae, which are the actual targets of <b>pyrethroids.</b> Many <b>pyrethroids</b> have been linked to the disruption of the endocrine system, reproduction and sexual development, interference with the immune system and the induction of breast cancer. The widespread use of <b>pyrethroids</b> is a major problem as they pollute the agricultural lands and water resources and affect non-target organisms and humans. Recent studies show that some microbes are able to degrade synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> by esterase production and this application is proposed as an inexpensive and simple method. In the present work, the aspects related to the toxicity and biodegradation of synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> are discussed...|$|R
25|$|<b>Pyrethroids</b> are direct stimulators {{of sodium}} {{channels}} in neuronal cells, inducing rapid depolarization and spastic paralysis leading to death. The effect is {{specific to the}} parasite since the drugs used are only slowly absorbed by the host and rapidly metabolized once absorbed. Cypermethrin (Excis, Betamax) and deltamethrin (Alphamax) are the two <b>pyrethroids</b> commonly used to control sea lice. Resistance to <b>pyrethroids</b> {{has been reported in}} Norway and appears to be due to a mutation leading to a structural change in the sodium channel which prevents <b>pyrethroids</b> from activating the channel. Use of deltamethrin has been increasing as an alternate treatment with the rise in resistance observed with emamectin benzoate.|$|R
40|$|Neuroexcitatory {{symptoms}} of acute poisoning of vertebrates by <b>pyrethroids</b> {{are related to}} the ability of these insecticides to modify electrical activity {{in various parts of the}} nervous system. Repetitive nerve activity, particularly in the sensory nervous system, membrane depolarization, and enhanced neurotransmitter release, eventually followed by block of excitation, result from a prolongation of the sodium current during membrane excitation. This effect is caused by a stereoselective and structure-related interaction with voltage-dependent sodium channels, the primary target site of the <b>pyrethroids.</b> Near-lethal doses of <b>pyrethroids</b> cause sparse axonal damage that is reversed in surviving animals. After prolonged exposure to lower doses of <b>pyrethroids</b> axonal damage is not observed. Occupational exposure to <b>pyrethroids</b> frequently leads to paresthesia and respiratory irritation, which are probably due to repetitive firing of sensory nerve endings. Massive exposure may lead to severe human poisoning symptoms, which are generally treated well by symptomatic and supportive measures...|$|R
25|$|The Bellus–Claisen {{rearrangement}} is {{the reaction}} of allylic ethers, amines, and thioethers with ketenes to give γ,δ-unsaturated esters, amides, and thioesters. This transformation was serendipitously observed by Bellus in 1979 through their synthesis of a key intermediate of an insecticide, <b>pyrethroid.</b> Halogen substituted ketenes (R1, R2) are often used in this reaction for their high electrophilicity. Numerous reductive methods {{for the removal of}} the resulting α-haloesters, amides and thioesters have been developed. The Bellus-Claisen offers synthetic chemists a unique opportunity for ring expansion strategies.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the level}} of damage an {{infestation}} can result in, much has been done over the years in the effort to manage, reduce, and eliminate the horn fly. Traditional methods were through the use of pour-ons, backrubbers and face powder bags, with products such as Co-Ral which is available as dust for face/horn flies. Self-applicator methods such as dust bags and backrubbers are used mainly for range or pasture herds, and are placed so that the animal cannot avoid coming into contact with it, such as at a gate through which animals pass. More recently, control of the horn fly by using ear tags on cattle has been extremely successful. The ear tags are made of a PVC matrix impregnated with <b>pyrethroid,</b> and can be effective for between 16 and 24 weeks. Originally, the ear tags were developed and used against such pests as ticks and by 1983 50% of cattle had ear tags. Long periods of such dosing resulted in the elimination of 95-99% of susceptible flies, but this strong selective pressure ended up resulting in the development of resistant strains of the flies. To combat this, the use of organophosphates and piperonyl butoxide as a synergist are now recommended to be alternated with <b>pyrethroid</b> to help slow resistance. In addition, methoprene in the form of sustained release bolus (a rounded mass of food or pharmaceutical preparation ready to swallow) inhibits the emergence of an adult insect from a pupal case or an insect larva from an egg for up to 7 months.|$|E
25|$|These can {{contribute}} to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example. The blowfly traps contain a liquid that smells like the rotting flesh of a carcass {{and the structure of}} the trap is designed to prevent the flies from escaping once attracted in. Horse-flies can be controlled by traps that attract the flies to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area wide control of tsetse-flies targets (these do not trap the flies) that combine a rectangle of dark blue or black cloth and often an attractant chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host. When the flies land on the cloth they contact the synthetic <b>pyrethroid</b> that is impregnated into the cloth.|$|E

50|$|The {{two types}} of <b>pyrethroids</b> are the ones with an α-cyanogroup and the ones without an α-cyanogroup.

The <b>pyrethroids</b> with an α-cyanogroup block the closing of the sodium-channel permanently, causing the membrane to be permanently depolarized.

The <b>pyrethroids</b> without an α-cyanogroup, to which bifenthrin belongs, are only able to bind to the sodium channel transiently.

25|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) cotton {{was developed}} to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to {{a small fraction of}} insects, most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life. The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called Bt cotton, to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed <b>pyrethroid</b> resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.|$|E
25|$|These usually {{consist of}} netting made of {{synthetic}} fibers or fine metal mesh that is fitted to the ventilation slats / windows of housing for livestock animals. The fiber netting can be impregnated with insecticides {{such as the}} synthetic <b>pyrethroid</b> deltamethrin that acts rapidly when flies such as Stomoxys or Glossina species land on it. Valuable horses in areas infested with Culicoides midges or Simulium black-flies can be protected with commercially available shields made of cloth that fit over head, neck and back. Flies such as the Musca, Stomoxys and Haematobia species have larval habitats amongst livestock dung and soiled bedding found around livestock farms. There is scope for reducing fly infestation by clearing these wastes to composting containers or areas. However, for many types of dipteran fly the larvae inhabit areas such as bogs (Culicoides), swamps (mosquitoes), or rivers (Simulium) that are impractical to treat under typical commercial constraints within agriculture.|$|E

40|$|Neurotoxicity and {{mechanistic}} {{data were}} collected for six alpha-cyano <b>pyrethroids</b> (beta-cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenpropathrin and lambda-cyhalothrin) and up to six non-cyano containing <b>pyrethroids</b> (bifenthrin, S-bioallethrin [or allethrin], permethrin, pyrethrins, resmethrin [or its cis-isomer, cismethrin] and tefluthrin under standard conditions. Factor analysis and multivariate dissimilarity analysis were employed to evaluate four independent data sets comprised of (1) fifty-six behavioral and physiological parameters from an acute neurotoxicity functional observatory battery (FOB), (2) eight electrophysiological parameters from voltage clamp experiments conducted on the Na(v) 1. 8 sodium channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes, (3) indices of efficacy, potency and binding calculated for calcium ion influx across neuronal membranes, membrane depolarization and glutamate released from rat brain synaptosomes and (4) changes in chloride channel open state probability using a patch voltage clamp technique for membranes isolated from mouse neuroblastoma cells. The <b>pyrethroids</b> segregated into Type I (T [...] syndrome-tremors) and Type II (CS syndrome [...] choreoathetosis with salivation) groups based on FOB data. Of the alpha-cyano <b>pyrethroids,</b> deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin and cypermethrin arrayed themselves strongly in a dose-dependent manner along two factors that characterize the CS syndrome. Esfenvalerate and fenpropathrin displayed weaker response profiles compared to the non-cyano <b>pyrethroids.</b> Visual clustering on multidimensional scaling (MDS) maps based upon sodium ion channel and calcium influx and glutamate release dissimilarities gave similar groupings. The non-cyano containing <b>pyrethroids</b> were arrayed in a dose-dependent manner along two different factors that characterize the T-syndrome. Bifenthrin was an outlier when MDS maps of the non-cyano <b>pyrethroids</b> were based on sodium ion channel characteristics and permethrin was an outlier when the MDS maps were based on calcium influx/glutamate release potency. Four of six alpha-cyano <b>pyrethroids</b> (lambda-cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and fenpropathrin) reduced open chloride channel probability.

2500|$|Since this fly {{tends to}} lay its eggs in wool, {{a simple and}} {{effective}} {{way to reduce the}} incidence of infection is to shear ewes regularly. Enacting simple sanitary measures can also reduce blow fly strike. Timely and proper disposal of carcasses and proper removal of feces can aid in significantly reducing strike. Moving sheep from warm, humid, and sheltered areas to more open areas can also help to reduce blow fly strike, for this eliminates conditions conducive to fly development. Trapping systems such as sticky paper may also be used to control fly numbers. Treating a flock with chemical agents can be costly, but can aid greatly in maintaining the resistance of the flock to L. sericata. Plunge dipping in diazinon can directly kill the fly on contact.
