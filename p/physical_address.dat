5|$|Several {{flavors of}} the Linux kernel exist for each port. For example, the i386 port has flavors for IA-32 PCs {{supporting}} <b>Physical</b> <b>Address</b> Extension and real-time computing, for older PCs, and for x86-64 PCs. The Linux kernel does not officially contain firmware without sources, although such firmware {{is available in}} non-free packages and alternative installation media.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} {{makes all}} decisions by itself {{to lessen the}} chance of being weakened by a misinformed decision. Applications known to be safe are allowed Internet access, and vice versa for malicious applications. Unknown ones are analyzed and blocked if they exhibit malicious behavior. In both PC Magazine and PC Pro testing, the firewall did not incorrectly block any safe applications from Internet access. All malware was blocked by the firewall. PC Magazine testing reflected the same results. The firewall also stealthed all ports. Exploits were blocked by the intrusion prevention system, which prevents threats from leveraging vulnerabilities. The system is updated whenever a vulnerability is identified for Windows-based computers. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful; registry changes, process termination, and simulated mouse clicks all failed. Disabling Windows services {{had no effect on}} the firewall since it works at the kernel driver level. This version automatically adjusts configuration for different networks based on the <b>physical</b> <b>address</b> of the gateway rather than IP addresses.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Beach {{is home to}} two universities: Regent University, {{a private}} {{university}} founded by Christian evangelist and leader Pat Robertson, which has historically focused on graduate education but has recently established an undergraduate program as well. Atlantic University, associated with the Edgar Cayce organization, the Association for Research and Enlightenment (ARE), offers M.A. degrees in Transpersonal Studies, with many New Age subjects thanks to its Edgar Cayce link. Old Dominion University and Norfolk State University are in nearby Norfolk and both the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech operate satellite campuses in Virginia Beach. Tidewater Community College, a major junior college, also has its largest campus located in the city. Virginia Wesleyan College, a private liberal arts college, {{is located on the}} border with Norfolk with the <b>physical</b> <b>address</b> of the school being in Norfolk, but the majority of the campus being in Virginia Beach. ECPI University's main campus is located here as well. Additional institutions of higher education are located in other communities of greater Hampton Roads.|$|E
50|$|A page {{table is}} the data {{structure}} {{used by a}} virtual memory system in a computer operating system to store the mapping between virtual <b>addresses</b> and <b>physical</b> <b>addresses.</b> Virtual addresses are used by the accessing process, while <b>physical</b> <b>addresses</b> are used by the hardware, or more specifically, by the RAM subsystem.|$|R

25|$|The {{program counter}} is a 64-bit {{register}} which contains a longword-aligned virtual byte address, that is, the low two {{bits of the}} program counter are always zero.

A lock flag and locked <b>physical</b> <b>address</b> register are used by the load-locked and store-conditional instructions for multiprocessor support.

50|$|In computing, an {{input-output}} {{memory management}} unit (IOMMU) is a {{memory management unit}} (MMU) that connects a direct-memory-access-capable (DMA-capable) I/O bus to the main memory. Like a traditional MMU, which translates CPU-visible virtual <b>addresses</b> to <b>physical</b> <b>addresses,</b> the IOMMU maps device-visible virtual addresses (also called device addresses or I/O addresses in this context) to <b>physical</b> <b>addresses.</b> Some units also provide memory protection from faulty or malicious devices.|$|R

Other modules, like the hybrid controller or battery controller in a Prius, respond at 07E9h, 07EAh, 07EBh, etc. These are 8h higher than the <b>physical</b> <b>address</b> the module {{responds to}}. Even though the number of bytes in the returned value is variable, the message uses 8 data bytes regardless (CAN bus protocol form Frameformat with 8 data bytes).|$|E
25|$|The kernel has {{full access}} to the system's memory and must allow {{processes}} to safely access this memory as they require it. Often {{the first step in}} doing this is virtual addressing, usually achieved by paging and/or segmentation. Virtual addressing allows the kernel to make a given <b>physical</b> <b>address</b> appear to be another address, the virtual address. Virtual address spaces may be different for different processes; the memory that one process accesses at a particular (virtual) address may be different memory from what another process accesses at the same address. This allows every program to behave as if it is the only one (apart from the kernel) running and thus prevents applications from crashing each other.|$|E
25|$|TOPS-20 (and {{possibly}} TENEX) used a 0 to 2 level {{tree that}} has similarities to a B-tree. A disk block was 512 36-bit words. If the file {{fit in a}} 512 (29) word block, then the file directory would point to that physical disk block. If the file fit in 218 words, then the directory would point to an aux index; the 512 words of that index would either be NULL (the block isn't allocated) or point to the <b>physical</b> <b>address</b> of the block. If the file fit in 227 words, then the directory would point to a block holding an aux-aux index; each entry would either be NULL or point to an aux index. Consequently, the physical disk block for a 227 word file could be located in two disk reads and read on the third.|$|E
