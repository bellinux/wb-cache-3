5|$|On 11 February 2008 the Australian Family Association (AFA), was {{publicly}} {{outraged that}} Underbelly would be screening at 8:30pm, well {{within reach of}} children, after clips of the series were leaked onto the internet. The clips highlighted the use of extreme profanities, and scenes that show a violent bashing, a cold-blooded murder, and a sexual encounter. The Nine Network defended the timeslot and the M classification, saying the clips, leaked from the Network's production department, were indeed from the series, {{but not all of}} them made the final cut. The Network set its own classification, under the accepted rules of the Australian Commercial Television Code of Conduct. The Australian Family Association threatened to take the matter to Communications Minister Stephen Conroy if the content of the show was anything near that of an unauthorised <b>promotional</b> <b>clip</b> leaked from Nine's production department.|$|E

The video was issued officially on disc eight of Harrison's Apple Years 1968–75 box set in September 2014. Described as [...] "a hoot" [...] by Robert Rodriguez, it conveys what Harrison deemed the [...] "comical" [...] aspect of the song.

500|$|Last Order: Final Fantasy VII was {{produced}} and scripted by Madhouse {{and directed by}} Morio Asaka. The decision to create Last Order arose from the positive reaction towards a popular <b>promotional</b> <b>clip</b> created by Madhouse for the game Before Crisis. Madhouse was chosen to produce the OVA partly because of their success with the clip and because the president of Madhouse was very enthusiastic about the project. However, {{the main reason for}} choosing Madhouse was that the company [...] "understood the significance" [...] of making a Final Fantasy VII animation, as it was considered a large responsibility to animate [...] "the most popular game in the FF [...] series." [...] Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for the Final Fantasy VII series and co-director of Advent Children, acted as the supervising director. He had the right to reject or accept concept drawings for Last Order. As a result, Nomura had a large quantity of images redrawn, to the extent that [...] "the entire production was in jeopardy." ...|$|E

Shooting in natural outdoor sets {{is very important to}} me, compared to working on a sound stage." [...] It took place in Germany, at the Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam-Babelsberg, in a filming location at an old forest near Berlin (production designer Stephen Scott said that he searched for and found what he believed looked like a [...] "medieval forest" [...] free of human interference) and in the city of Braunschweig in Lower Saxony. After the film was delayed to 2013, the crew did a [...] "couple" [...] of re-shoots, including [...] "a little bit" [...] in the deserts of California (filming the post-ending scene, an extended version of which was also released in a <b>promotional</b> <b>clip</b> [...] "The Desert Witch").|$|E

500|$|The Beatles hired Michael Lindsay-Hogg {{to shoot}} a <b>promotional</b> <b>clip</b> for [...] "Hey Jude", after he had {{previously}} directed a clip for [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] in 1966. They settled {{on the idea of}} shooting with a live, albeit controlled, audience. In the clip, the Beatles are first seen by themselves, performing the initial chorus and verses, and then are joined by the audience who appear as the last chorus concludes and coda begins; the audience sings and claps along with the Beatles through the song's conclusion. Hogg shot the clip at Twickenham Film Studios on 4 September 1968, with McCartney himself designing the set. Tony Bramwell, a friend of the Beatles, later described the set as [...] "the piano, there; drums, there; and orchestra in two tiers at the back." [...] The event marked Starr's return to the group, after McCartney's criticism of his drumming had led to him walking out during a session for the White Album track [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R." [...] During his two-week absence, Starr announced that he had left the band.|$|E
500|$|Jarrett Wieselman of the New York Post has {{compared}} Morris as Brittany to Lynch as Sue, {{and noted}} that she has [...] "emerged {{as one of the}} funniest second bananas on TV right now". Wieselman wrote that since her introduction, Brittany has been given [...] "more and more to do [...] less and less to think", and that the result has been [...] "one of the most clueless characters that's ever figured out how to dress herself in the morning." [...] E! Online's Megan Masters has also compared Brittany to Sue, and stated that Brittany's one-liners [...] "easily rival" [...] Sue's. She deemed Brittany [...] "brainlessly brilliant", and thanked the Glee producers for creating her: [...] "Never before have we had the pleasure of enjoying such a ridiculously dumb—yet always loveable—character on television." [...] When a <b>promotional</b> <b>clip</b> for the episode [...] "Sectionals" [...] indicated that Brittany and Santana had slept together, Dorothy Snarker, when writing for lesbian entertainment website AfterEllen.com, praised the pairing and referred to it by the portmanteau [...] "Brittana". Snarker called the two her [...] "new favourite Glee pairing", and commented: [...] "While Heather Morris (Brittany) and Naya Rivera (Santana) have had minimal screen time, they’ve made it count. Heather in particular has brought the laughs as the Cheerio least likely to get a Mensa invitation. Never mind Finn and Rachel – I’m on Team Brittana now." ...|$|E
500|$|Press {{releases}} describe Gwen {{in light}} of contradictions between her heroic and conventionally feminine roles in the series; despite becoming a [...] "tough, ruthless warrior, who loves {{the thrill of the}} fight" [...] Gwen remains a [...] "funny, salty, earthy woman who loves home and family". Children of Earth sees Gwen become pregnant by husband Rhys; a storyline which IGN writer Asham Haque thought provided [...] "one of the few hope-giving threads" [...] in the serial. She gives birth to a baby girl, Anwen, between the third and fourth series. Both Eve Myles and creator Russell T Davies have described this plot development as emblematic of a contradiction at the heart of Gwen's character. Myles, believing that motherhood gives Gwen a greater sense of responsibility, says it makes Gwen [...] "even more human, and yet even more of a wonder woman". Whilst talking about the show's fourth series, Davies suggested that it would be [...] "irresistible" [...] to use the image of [...] "Gwen Cooper with baby in one arm and gun in the other" [...] as promotion. The production team have continued to emphasise this contradictory aspect to Gwen's character, which has proved popular with critics and viewers. For example, a <b>promotional</b> <b>clip</b> for Miracle Day features Gwen firing from her gun in one hand while protectively holding her baby in the other. Zap2it's Mikey O'Connell praised this as one of the trailer's best aspects, praising Gwen as [...] "the coolest mum ever." [...] Reviewing the opening episodes of Miracle Day Mary McNamara [...] of the Los Angeles Times identified [...] "the dark humor" [...] of the sequence as representative of [...] "the top notes of the British Torchwood". The Daily Telegraphs Catherine Gee praised the dichotomy between the character's two roles, stating that [...] "Eve Myles's homely yet badass agent is incredibly charming".|$|E
