5|$|Concurrent <b>programming</b> languages, libraries, APIs, and {{parallel}} <b>programming</b> models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} for <b>programming</b> parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory <b>programming</b> languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP {{are two of the}} most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API. One concept used in <b>programming</b> parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.|$|E
