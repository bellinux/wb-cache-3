40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to provide {{information}} about number of people exposed to different levels of the total mean PM 10 concentration and to calculate population weighted concentration both as a total value and for individual chemical species (<b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> secondary aerosols and sea salt aerosol). The study area is Poland for the year 2007. Concentration of PM 10 was provided with the Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange model (FRAME) at a 5 km x 5 km spatial resolution. The FRAME simulations included anthropogenic emissions, as well as sea salt aerosol and wind blown dust. We have found that the entire population is exposed to PM 10 concentration above 5. 0 µg m- 3, which is suggested to have adverse impact on human health. Total population weighted concentration is higher than average PM 10 concentration and equals 14. 3 µg m- 3. <b>Primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> has the highest contribution in total population weighted concentration (49 %) and is followed by secondary inorganic aerosols...|$|E
40|$|Many of the nation's largest airports, {{including}} Los Angeles International Airport, the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport {{are located}} within areas {{designated by the}} EPA as having ambient particulate matter concentrations that exceed National Ambient Air Quality standards. When inhaled, fine particulate matter can enter the blood stream from the lungs and {{increase the risk of}} illness and premature mortality. This thesis examines the potential of two jet fuel types, ultra low sulfur jet fuel and synthetic paraffinic kerosene, to reduce aviation's contribution to ambient particulate matter concentrations. Scaling factors were developed for airport criteria pollutant emissions to model alternative jet fuels in aircraft and ground support equipment. These linear scaling factors were based on currently published studies comparing standard diesel and jet fuels with alternative jet fuels. It was found that alternative jet fuels lower or maintain all air pollutant emissions considered (<b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> sulfur oxides, nitrous oxides, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide) for both aircraft and ground support equipment. To quantify the potential benefits of changing fuel composition on ambient particulate matter concentrations, a study of the Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport was completed using both emissions inventory analysis and atmospheric modeling. The atmospheric modeling captures both <b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> and other emissions that react in the atmosphere to form secondary particulate matter. It was found that the use of an ultra low sulfur jet fuel in aircraft gas turbines could reduce the <b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> inventory by 37 % and synthetic paraffinic kerosene could reduce the <b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> inventory by 64 %. The atmospheric modeling predicts that an ultra low sulfur jet fuel in aircraft could reduce ambient particulate matter concentrations due to aircraft by up to 57 % and synthetic paraffinic kerosene could reduce particulate matter concentrations due to aircraft by up to 67 %. Thus, this study indicates that the majority of air quality benefits at Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport that could be derived from the two fuels considered can be captured by removing the sulfur from jet fuel through the use of an ultra low sulfur jet fuel. by Pearl Donohoo.

40|$|By {{extending}} {{the method of}} Stedman (1998), daily data of atmospheric concentrations of gravimetric PM 10, black smoke (BS) and sulphate aerosol (SA) from national networks were analysed to determine the trends in time of the contribution of different sources of <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> to total PM 10 measured in central Edinburgh. Since BS is an indicator of combustion-related <b>primary</b> sources of <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> the quantity obtained by subtraction of daily BS from daily PM 10 {{is indicative of the}} contribution to total PM 10 from other primary sources and from secondary aerosol. This PM 10 -BS statistic was regressed on SA, since SA is an indicator of variation in secondary aerosol source. For Edinburgh, SA is a considerably better indicator of PM 10 -BS during summer than winter (reflecting the much greater photochemical generation of secondary aerosol in summer) and there is evidence that the contribution of other secondary aerosol (presumably nitrate aerosol) has increased relative to SA between 1992 and 1997. The concentration of non-combustion <b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> material (marine aerosol, suspended dust) to PM 10 in Edinburgh has not changed over this period but is about twice that calculated as the U.

40|$|The {{effect of}} fuel ethanol content (10, 85 and 100  %) on primary {{emissions}} and on subsequent secondary aerosol formation was investigated for a Euro 5 flex-fuel gasoline vehicle. Emissions were characterized during a New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) using a comprehensive set-up of high time-resolution instruments. A detailed chemical {{composition of the}} exhaust particulate matter (PM) was studied using a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS), and secondary aerosol formation was studied using a potential aerosol mass (PAM) chamber. For the primary gaseous compounds, an increase in total hydrocarbon emissions {{and a decrease in}} aromatic BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) compounds was observed when the amount of ethanol in the fuel increased. In regard to particles, the largest <b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> concentrations and potential for secondary particle formation was measured for the E 10 fuel (10  % ethanol). As the ethanol content of the fuel increased, a significant decrease in the average <b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> concentrations over the NEDC was found. The PM emissions were 0. 45, 0. 25 and 0. 15  mg m − 3 for E 10, E 85 and E 100, respectively. Similarly, a clear decrease in secondary aerosol formation potential was observed with a larger contribution of ethanol in the fuel. The secondary-to-primary PM ratios were 13. 4 and 1. 5 for E 10 and E 85, respectively. For E 100, a slight decrease in PM mass was observed after the PAM chamber, indicating that the PM produced by secondary aerosol formation was less than the PM lost through wall losses or the degradation of the primary organic aerosol (POA) in the chamber. For all fuel blends, the formed secondary aerosol consisted mostly of organic compounds. For E 10, the contribution of organic compounds containing oxygen increased from 35  %, measured for primary organics, to 62  % after the PAM chamber. For E 85, the contribution of organic compounds containing oxygen increased from 42  % (primary) to 57  % (after the PAM chamber), whereas for E 100 the amount of oxidized organics remained the same (approximately 62  %) with the PAM chamber when compared to the primary emissions...|$|E

In linear models most pollutants showed negative or null association with all-cause, cardiovascular or respiratory mortality.

40|$|Purpose of review: Air {{pollution}} significantly affects health, causing up to 7 million premature deaths annually with an {{even larger}} number of hospitalizations and days of sick leave. Climate change could alter the dispersion of <b>primary</b> pollutants, particularly <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> and intensify the formation of secondary pollutants, such as near-surface ozone. The purpose of the review is to evaluate the recent evidence on the impacts of climate change on air pollution and air pollution-related health impacts and identify knowledge gaps for future research. Recent findings: Several studies modelled future ozone and <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> concentrations and calculated the resulting health impacts under different climate scenarios.

Analysis of the disagreements between the existing emission inventories for the Kola region combined with forward and inverse ensemble dispersion modelling, analysis of observation time-series and model-measurement comparison showed that the emission of the Nikel metallurgy plant was missing or strongly under-estimated in the major European emission inventories, such as EMEP, EDGAR, TNO-GEMS, and PAREST-MEGAPOLI. In some cases it was misplaced or mis-attributed to other sources of the region. A more consistent inventory of the anthropogenic emissions of SO x and PM has been compiled for the Peninsula, compared with the existing estimates and verified by means of dispersion modelling. In particular, the SILAM model simulations for 2003 and 2006 with the revised emission data showed much smaller under-estimation of SO 2 concentrations at 8 Finnish and Norwegian observational stations. For the nearest site to the plant the 10 -fold underestimation turned to a 1. 5 -fold over-prediction.

In this work we model fine particle organic matter emitted by sea spray processes and its influence on the aerosol chemical properties at the global scale using the off-line global Chemistry-Transport Model TM 5. TM 5 is coupled to a microphysical aerosol dynamics model providing size resolved information on particle masses and numbers. The mass of the emitted sea spray particles is partitioned between water insoluble organic matter (WIOM) and sea salt components in the accumulation mode using a function that relates the emitted organic fraction to the surface ocean chlorophyll-a concentrations. The global emission in the sub-micron size range of organic matter by sea spray process is 8. 2 Tg yr- 1, compared to 24 Tg fine yr- 1 sea-salt emissions.

The lower load case features wider mixture stratification, with a more confined, lower temperature burning zone. In both cases, a strong temperature drop establishes between the hot core and the cylinder walls. Higher levels of oxygen correspond to regions of lower temperature near the walls and vice-versa.

Exposure is calculated with high spatial resolution using atmospheric dispersion models. Attributed premature mortality is calculated separately for the main local sources and the contribution from long-range transport (LRT), applying different relative risks. In general, the main part of the exposure is due to LRT, while for black carbon, the local sources are equally or more important. The major part of the premature deaths is in our assessment related to local emissions, with road traffic and residential wood combustion having the largest impact.

The chemical profile determined here is very similar to those obtained for diesel emissions with high concentrations of EC relative to OC (EC/OC = 1. 8) and low concentrations of the higher molecular weight PAH.

To evaluate {{the performance of the}} FARM model in order to simulate the air quality situation of the selected periods, a comparison of modelled results against observed air quality data was carried out for both <b>primary</b> pollutants and <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> next to the measurement stations. Farm performed well in simulating especially ozone (O 3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) concentrations, showing a good reproduction of both daily peaks and their daytime variations.

Depending on the altitude of injection of these emissions, the pollutants follow different pathways: directly along the coast or over land towards the Sahel before to be vertically mixed in the convective boundary layer and transported to the south-west and over the cities. In July 2014, the maximum increase in surface concentrations is ~[*] 150 [*]μg[*]m − 3 for CO, ~[*] 10 to 20 [*]μg[*]m − 3 for O 3 and ~[*] 5 [*]μg[*]m − 3 for PM 10. The analysis of the PM 10 chemical composition shows that this increase is mainly related to an increase of <b>Particulate</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>Matter</b> and <b>Particulate</b> Organic <b>Matter...</b>|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{candidate}} policies {{designed to}} address the impact of aviation on the environment requires a simplified method to estimate pollutant emissions for current and future aircraft gas turbine engines under different design and operating assumptions. A method for NOx and CO emissions was developed in a previous research effort. This thesis focuses on {{the addition of a}} soot mechanism to the existing model. The goal is to estimate soot emissions of existing gas turbine engines within soot measurement uncertainties, and then to use the method to estimate the performance of potential future engines. Soot is non-volatile <b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter.</b> In gas turbine engines the size rarely exceeds l [mu]m. The soot is composed almost exclusively of black carbon, is an aggregate of nearly spherical carbon primary particles, and exhibits fractal behavior. Results of other studies regarding soot nucleation, growth, oxidation, and coagulation rates are integrated within a network of perfectly-stirred reactors and shown to capture the typical evolution of soot inside a gas turbine combustor, with soot formed in the early parts of the combustor and then oxidized. The soot model shows promising results as its emissions estimates are within the measurement uncertainties. Nevertheless, model uncertainties are high. They are the consequence of the large sensitivity to input variables. Therefore, the validity of the model is limited to cases with available engine data. More engine data are needed to develop and assess the soot model. by Bastien Martini. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2008.

40|$|Evidence {{shows that}} smoke from fires (wildfi re, {{controlled}} burning, and agricultural burning) is contributing signifi cantly to fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and haze in many {{urban and rural}} areas, affecting health, visibility, and ecosystems. In addition to the <b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> directly emitted by fires, gaseous organic compounds are emitted that transform into “secondary” particulate matter downwind from fires, which contributes notably to PM 2. 5 and haze. States and tribes are required to implement programs to reduce emissions {{to meet the requirements}} of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) National Ambient Air Quality Standards and Regional Haze Rule, and central to any meaningful implementation plan is an understanding of which sources contribute to these pollutants. Air quality regulators must be able to correctly identify the sources so that managers can implement emission reduction strategies that will assist in the attainment of air quality standards. This project has developed new methodologies and tools for use by experts to better quantify what portion of fi ne particulates comes from fire, and of that amount, to determine how much comes from wildfire, prescribed fire, and agricultural burning. This information can then be directly used by air quality regulators to develop and implement plans to reduce PM 2. 5 and haze below regulated thresholds. However, information gaps remain: secondary particulate matter is not currently properly accounted for in estimates of contributions from fires and other sources, and information classifying fire type has not been integrated into emissions inventories. Several entities are currently working towards routine generation of this much needed information...|$|E
40|$|In the {{prospect}} of limited energy resources and climate change, effects of alternative biofuels on primary emissions are being extensively studied. Our two {{recent studies have shown}} that biodiesel fuel composition has a significant impact on <b>primary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> emissions. It was also shown that particulate matter caused by biodiesels was substantially different from the emissions due to petroleum diesel. Emissions appeared to have higher oxidative potential with the increase in oxygen content and decrease of carbon chain length and unsaturation levels of fuel molecules. Overall, both studies concluded that chemical composition of biodiesel is more important than its physical properties in controlling exhaust particle emissions. This suggests that the atmospheric aging processes, including secondary organic aerosol formation, of emissions from different fuels will be different as well. In this study, measurements were conducted on a modern common-rail diesel engine. To get more information on realistic properties of tested biodiesel particulate matter once they are released into the atmosphere, particulate matter was exposed to atmospheric oxidants, ozone and ultra-violet light; and the change in their properties was monitored for different biodiesel blends. Upon the exposure to oxidative agents, the chemical composition of the exhaust changes. It triggers the cascade of photochemical reactions resulting in the partitioning of semi-volatile compounds between the gas and particulate phase. In most of the cases, aging lead to the increase in volatility and oxidative potential, and the increment of change was mainly dependent on the chemical composition of fuels as the leading cause for the amount and the type of semi-volatile compounds present in the exhaust...|$|E
40|$|The {{trade of}} goods among regions or nations {{associated}} with large environmental consequences. Yet balancing economic gains and environmental consequences induced by trade is still hindered {{by a lack}} of quantification of these two factors, especially for the environmental problems those are more locally oriented, such as the atmospheric pollution. Based on an environmental input-output analysis for 2010, we contrast economic gains (value added) against atmospheric pollutant emissions (sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitric oxide (NOx), <b>primary</b> fine <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (PM 2. 5) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC)) and the widely concerned CO 2 emissions associated with international and interprovincial exports from Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the most polluted area in China. Our results show that exports contributed 55 - 62 % of BTH's production emissions and 54 % of its total value added. BTH's large exports of metals and metal products, nonmetal mineral products, chemical and transportation and warehousing, generated a larger share of pollutant emissions (36 - 46 % of BTH's total) than that of value added (17 %) along the supply chain. Most of BTH's embodied emissions in exports go to neighboring provinces and the developed east coastal regions in China, although the economic returns are comparatively low. Among BTH, industrial production in Beijing and Tianjin lead to more pollutant emission than value added in Hebei, due to reliance on pollution-intensive product imports from Hebei. Our results call for refocusing and restructuring of BTH's industry and trade structures to balance the economic gains and environmental losses for each region...|$|R
