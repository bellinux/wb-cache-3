40|$|AbstractPolymers {{reinforced}} {{with a certain}} type of nano fillers labelled polymer nanocomposites is become as an area of research among several researchers. Polypropylene (PP) as matrix and Spheri glass 3000 (SG) as reinforcing filler was considered in study. The polymer nanocomposites was prepared by melt intercalation method with help of twin screw extruder. The percentage of SG was varied at four different levels (i. e. 1. 25, 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 wt. %). The PP/SG glass 3000 mixture was processed in twin screw extruder with different zones like conveying zone, melting zone, mixing zone and <b>plasticizing</b> <b>zone</b> which helps in achieving homogenous dispersion of SG in PP. The processing parameters of the extruder were studied and the optimal parameters like screw speed (65 rpm), inlet feed (7 rpm), degassing pressure (40 mm of Hg) and high density cartridge heater (HDCH) temperature profile (180 °C- 230 °C) were selected to obtain PP/SG nanocomposites. The structure formed was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) which shows an exfoliated structure and the dispersion studies were carried out using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE SEM) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUnder cyclic loading, the <b>plasticized</b> <b>zone</b> becomes complicated; it {{contains}} in particular a second <b>plasticized</b> <b>zone,</b> {{resulting from the}} local compression which occurs {{at the time of}} the closing of the crack to each cycle. The two plastic zones, monotonous (rm) and cyclic (rc), are proportional to (Kmax/Re) 2 et (ΔK/Re) 2, respectively. The objective of this work is to study the evolution of the fatigue crack grown rate (FCGR) and the influence of the plastic zone size (rc), which represents the seat of the residual stresses, on this evolution in the case of 12 NC 6 steel. Generally, the plastic zone size increases with the crack advance. The FCGR can be correlated with the energy absorptive in these plastic zones...|$|R

In the present work, investigation {{is carried out}} on Friction Welding of AISI 1030 steel and hybrid AA 6063 - 6 SiCp- 3 Grpcomposite, {{that are difficult to}} weld by fusion welding technique. Silicon carbide and graphite particle reinforced AA 6063 matrix hybrid composite was developed successfully using stir casting method and the joining feasibility of AISI 1030 steel with AA 6063 - 6 SiCp- 3 Grp hybrid composite was tried out by friction stud welding technique. During friction stage of welding process, the particulates (SiC & Graphite) used for reinforcement, tend to increase the viscosity and lead to improper mixing of matrix and reinforcement. This eventually results in lower strength in dissimilar joints. To overcome this difficulty AA 1100 interlayer is used while joining hybrid composite to AISI 1030 steel. Experimentation was carried out using Taguchi based design of experiments (DOE) technique. Multiple regression methods were applied to understand the relationship between process parameters of the friction stud welding process. Micro structural examination reveals three separate <b>zones</b> namely fully <b>plasticized</b> <b>zone,</b> partially deformed zone and unaffected base material zone. Ultra fine dynamically recrystallized grains of about 341  nm were observed at the fully <b>plasticized</b> <b>zone.</b> EDX analysis confirms the presence of intermetallic compound Fe 2 Al 5 at the joint interface. According to the experimental analysis using DOE, rotational speed and interlayer sheet thickness contribute about 39 % and 36 % respectively in determining the impact strength of the welded joints. It is found that joining with 0. 5  mm interlayer sheet provides efficient joints. Developed regression model could be used to predict the axial shortening distance and impact strength of the welded joint with reasonable accuracy...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a 3 D coupled thermo-mechanical {{finite element}} model is {{developed}} to predict and analyze the defect formation during friction stir welding based on coupled Eulerian Lagrangian method. The model is validated by comparing the estimated welding temperature, processed zone shape and void size with those obtained experimentally. The results compared indicate that the simulated temperature and the data measured are in good agreement with each other. In addition, the model can predict the <b>plasticized</b> <b>zone</b> shape {{and the presence of}} a void in the weld quite accurately. However, the void size is overestimated. The effects of welding parameters and tool pin profile are also analyzed. The results reveal that welding at low welding speed or high tool rotational speed could produce a smaller void. Moreover, compared to a smooth tool pin, a featured tool pin can enhance plastic flow in the weld and achieve defect-free weldment. The results are helpful for the optimization of the welding process and the design of welding tools...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPart II of {{this study}} {{presents}} a modeling framework that is shown to successfully simulate {{all aspects of the}} inhomogeneous bending of tubes associated with Lüders banding reported in Part I. The structure is discretized with solid finite elements using a mesh that is fine enough for Lüders bands to develop and evolve. The material is modeled as a finitely deforming, J 2 type, elastic–plastic solid with an “up–down–up” response over the extent of the Lüders strain, followed by hardening. Regularization of the solution was accomplished by introducing a mild rate dependence of the material. Simulation of the rotation controlled bending experiments confirmed most of the experimental observations and revealed additional details of the localization. Thus, the initial uniform-curvature elastic regime terminates with the nucleation of localized banded deformation on the tensioned and compressed sides of the tube. The bands appear in pockets that propagate into the hitherto intact part of the structure while the moment remains essentially unchanged. The tube develops two curvature regimes; a relatively high curvature in the Lüders deformed section and a low curvature in the unaffected one. Simultaneously, the <b>plasticized</b> <b>zone</b> develops higher ovalization and wrinkles with a wavelength that corresponds to the periodicity of the banded pockets. For tubes with lower D/t and/or shorter Lüders strain the higher curvature eventually spreads to the whole structure at which point homogenous bending resumes. For tubes with higher D/t and/or longer Lüders strain the localized curvature, ovalization, and wrinkle amplitude are larger and cannot be sustained; the tube collapses prematurely leaving behind part of its length essentially undeformed. For every tube D/t there exists a threshold of Lüders strain separating the two types of behavior. This bounding value of Lüders strain was studied parametrically...|$|R
