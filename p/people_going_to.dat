5|$|Large swells {{produced}} by the storm resulted in about 1,000 lifeguard rescues in Orange County, California. High temperatures in southern California, exceeding 100°F (37.7°C) in places, and cool ocean temperatures led to an estimated 575,000 <b>people</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> beaches during the Labor Day weekend. One incident required 25 rescues as dozens of people were overwhelmed by 810ft (2.43m) waves. Officials in San Bernardino County advised residents to take precautions {{for the possibility of}} flooding as a result of moisture from the remnants of Howard. Following wildfires in 2003, foothills were highly susceptible to flooding. Residents were advised to have sandbags ready, ensure their emergency supplies were stocked and have an evacuation plan. Despite all the preparations undertaken, Howard did not produced any rainfall in California. The moisture also enhanced rainfall across portions of Arizona. This led to minor rainfall accumulations throughout the state.|$|E
25|$|For braver souls, {{impatient}} with efforts to abolish slavery within the law, {{there were always}} illegal methods. Slaves escaped independently; most often they were young males, as they could move more freely than women with children. Free blacks and white supporters of abolition of slavery gradually organized a number of safe places and guides, creating the Underground Railroad to help slaves gain safety in Northern states. The many Indian trails and waterways of Maryland, {{and in particular the}} countless inlets of the Chesapeake Bay, afforded numerous ways to escape north by boat or land, with many <b>people</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Pennsylvania as the nearest free state. Supporters would shelter refugees, and sometimes give them food and clothing.|$|E
25|$|Investment {{in public}} {{transport}} also has secondary {{positive effects on}} the local economy, with between $4 and $9 of economic activity resulting from every dollar spent. Many businesses rely on access to a transit system, in particular in cities and countries where access to cars is less widespread, businesses which require large numbers of <b>people</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a same place {{may not be able}} to accommodate a large number of cars (concert venues, sport stadia, airports, exhibitions centres,...), or businesses where people are not able to use a car (bars, hospitals, or industries in the tourism sector whose customers may not have their cars). Transit systems also have an effect on derived businesses: commercial websites have been founded, such as Hopstop.com, that give directions through mass transit systems; in some cities, such as London, products themed on the local transport system are a popular tourist souvenir. Research in the Washington, DC area shows that public transport does a better job of providing high-skill residents with access to high-skill jobs than it does mid-skill residents to mid-skill jobs and low-skill residents to low-skill jobs.|$|E

25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of <b>people</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is still very much in evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are not going to make it go away by themselves. Politicians past and present have been accused of short-sightedness in speculating that they would.|$|E

2500|$|Although Heim {{has said}} that the big butcher dogs, Metzgerhund, became extinct after foreign imports became more popular, there is {{speculation}} over whether farmers would get an expensive foreign dog. In 1889 an International Dog Show was held in Winterthur, northern Switzerland; various Sennenhunde were exhibited. Raber is sure the dogs were present in 1900 as draft dogs for peddlers and <b>people</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> market, watch dogs for farmers and drover’s dog for butchers; they were rarely tri-colored. Everywhere the dogs had short, rough coats; nearly all were brown, yellow or black with white and brown markings. Lons' description of the northern and central German butcher dog also fits the Sennenhunde at the beginning of pure breeding; this applies to the Austrian butcher dog of Linz, and the French and Belgian Matin. It is to their credit that Heim and Schertenleib selected one variation of the butcher dog [...] possible the most beautiful [...] and started it on the road to a pure breed.|$|E
2500|$|Proposed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in May 2005, {{a smoking}} ban that {{prohibited}} films {{and television shows}} from displaying actors or actresses smoking went into effect on 2 October 2005. [...] The Indian government felt that films were glamorizing cigarettes, and with nearly 15 million <b>people</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see Bollywood films on a daily basis, then Health Minister Anubumani Ramadoss claimed that the ban would [...] "protect {{the lives of millions}} of people who could become addicted to smoking under the influence of movies." [...] Under the smoking ban, smoking scenes in any movie was prohibited, including any old or historical movies where, some argued, smoking was necessary to make the depiction accurate. If producers wished to show a character smoking, the scene would have to be accompanied by a note saying that smoking is injurious to health, along with disclaimers {{at the beginning and end}} of films.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1939, Strathmore {{set off on}} {{a three-week}} cruise to the eastern Mediterranean, but shortly after she had passed Gibraltar there came an Admiralty signal {{ordering}} non-essential British ships {{to get out of}} the Mediterranean. The cruise was diverted to Rabat and from there it was intended to proceed to Bermuda, but after only one day at sea there came a signal that war was imminent, and the ship returned to Tilbury, with a blackout being imposed after dark. [...] On 31 March 1940, towards the end of the [...] "Phoney War", the vessel was requisitioned on the orders of the Ministry of Shipping, which later became the Ministry of War Transport, and during the rest of the Second World War she served as a troop ship, with no major incidents in that role. On 21 July 1941 Strathmore sailed from Newfoundland carrying 3,800 Canadian soldiers to Britain. In February 1947 she sailed from Southampton bound for Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, carrying some 2,000 <b>people</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> China, including missionaries, colonial police, business men, and their families, many returning home after being displaced by the war.|$|E

2500|$|Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club {{argued that}} {{through the use of}} a spoken {{introduction}} and other exposition-filled dialogue, the film fails by [...] "baldly revealing up front everything that the novel is trying to get you to wonder about and to explore slowly". Youyoung Lee wrote in a December 2007 Entertainment Weekly that the film [...] "leaves out the gore", such as the book's ritualistic heart-eating that concludes the bear fight, [...] "to create family-friendlier fare". Lee also said that the film [...] "downplays the Magisterium's religious nature", but Robinson argued that the depiction of the Church in the film is as [...] "a hierarchical organization of formally robed, iconography-heavy priests who dictate and define morality for their followers, are based out of cathedrals, and decry teachings counter to theirs as 'heresy.'...doing ugly things to children under cover of secrecy". Robinson then asks, [...] "Who are most <b>people</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> think of besides the Catholic Church?" [...] The film gives more prominence to scenes showing the Magisterium officials' perspective than the novel. The novel rarely mentions explicitly the Magisterium's intentions, relying on the gossip of others, and the comments of Mrs. Coulter.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 2013, an {{interview}} was published quoting Ewen confirming {{that the group}} had split.

[...] "I think it's unfair to fans and we should be honest. The band being over is definitely not my choice.

Frazer said [...] "it's a tongue-in-cheek gesture. It's to give Irish people a sense of how we feel. I would be very offended if I was living in Ireland and someone came and asked me to take the flag down. That’s exactly how we feel in Belfast. People keep telling us we're still part of the UK, yet here we are without a flag". In 2006, a march in Dublin, organised by Love Ulster, had sparked riots. The Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson condemned the clashes, while his colleague, Phil Hamilton, criticised the PSNI for not deploying enough officers to the Short Strand area on 12 January to prevent violence.
