40|$|Selecting an {{appropriate}} contractor {{is essential for}} the success of any construction project. Contractor <b>prequalification</b> <b>procedure</b> makes it possible to admit for tendering only competent contractor. Prequalification is a multi-criteria decision problem that is, in essence, largely dependent on the uncertainty and vagueness in the nature of construction projects and subjective judgement of the decision-maker. This paper presents a systematic <b>prequalification</b> <b>procedure,</b> based on Fuzzy Set Theory, whose main differences and advantages in comparison with other models are the use of an algorithm to handle the inconsistencies in the fuzzy preference relation when pair-wise comparison judgements are used and the use of linguistic assessment or exact assessment of performance of the contractors on qualitative or quantitative criterion, respectively. Finally, a case study for the rehabilitation project of a building at Technical University of Cartagena is presented to illustrate the use of the proposed model and to demonstrate its effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|The subcontractor’s {{selection}} {{problem is}} currently {{treated as a}} supply chain problem with a <b>prequalification</b> <b>procedure</b> to balance the main objectives of the client: cost, quality, and time. Unfortunately, most of the selection processes are analysed under the same methodology without considering that variations in project, type of activity, and other attributes should affect the chosen method. To provide a novel form of treating subcontractor’s selection, we proposed an additive sorting method to categorize activities to be outsourced in civil construction based on ROR-UTADIS method, which is a modification of the UTADIS method that includes new forms of supplying preference information. It was applied {{in the construction of}} a brewery in Brazil. It was perceived that the method is applicable and intuitive for decision makers, even though {{there are quite a few}} points to be taken, analysed to avoid misclassification...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} beam-to-column joints for seismic {{applications}} is not properly addressed in {{current version of}} Eurocodes. EN 1998 - 1 allows using dissipative beam-to-column joints in seismic resistant steel frames. However, {{due to the lack}} of analytical tools able to predict the seismic performance of such connections the EN 1998 - 1 prescribes design supported by testing, resulting in an expensive and time-consuming approach. On the other hand, also for full-strength joints reliable design tools are necessary because, owing to the variability of steel strength, these connections could not have enough overstrength and the plastic rotation capacity of the joint assembly must be prequalified by relevant tests. In order to overcome such limitations, the aim of Equaljoints project was to develop a <b>prequalification</b> <b>procedure</b> for typical joints used in the EU practice, on the basis of experimental, numerical and analytical investigations. Design tools and prequalification charts are provided, including general requirements, limitations, step-by-step design procedure and qualification data...|$|E
40|$|Selection of {{competent}} contractors {{for construction}} projects is usually accomplished through competitive bidding or negotiated contracting {{in which the}} contract bid price is the basic criterion for selection. The evaluation of contractor's safety performance is still not a typical criterion in the selection process, despite the existence of various safety <b>prequalification</b> <b>procedures.</b> There is a critical need for practical and automated systems that enable owners and decision makers to evaluate contractor safety performance, among other important contractor selection criteria. These systems should ultimately favor safety-conscious contractors to be selected by the virtue of their past good safety records and current safety programs. This paper presents an exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach to develop a framework for an automated decision support system that evaluates contractor safety performance based on a multitude of indicators and metrics that have been identified through {{a comprehensive review of}} construction safety research, and a survey distributed to domain experts. The framework is developed in three phases: (1) determining the indicators that depict contractor current and past safety performance; (2) soliciting input from construction safety experts regarding the identified indicators, their metrics, and relative significance; and (3) designing a decision support system using relational database models to integrate the identified indicators and metrics into a system that assesses and rates the safety performance of contractors. The proposed automated system is expected to hold several advantages including: (1) reducing the likelihood of selecting contractors with poor safety records; (2) enhancing the odds of completing the project safely; and (3) encouraging contractors to exert more efforts to improve their safety performance and practices in order to increase their bid winning opportunities which can lead to significant safety improvements in the construction industry. This should prove useful to decision makers and researchers, alike, and should help improve the safety record of the construction industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} of a suitable contractor for a construction project {{is one of the}} most important decisions a client can make for the development of the project. <b>Prequalification</b> is a <b>procedure</b> to examine and gauge the competency and skills of contractors to successfully complete a project if it is given to them. However, the evaluation employed for some prequalification is still ambiguous or highly subjective. This study aims to investigate the shortcoming of the current prequalification evaluation for contractor selection. The methodology of the study is based on a comprehensive literature review and expert survey whereby the criticality of data, obtained from the literature was analysed using expert in the field. Among the prequalification criteria, the current evaluation that employed for management capability is highly ambiguous. Two important shortcomings of current prequalification models regarding the evaluation of management capability were identified. First, the models are not comprehensive since all the variables related to the management capability are not included. Secondly, the models focused almost exclusively on time and cost performance as outcome variables, which may not be enough to evaluate the management capability of contractors. Better evaluation methods have to be developed to assess the management capability prequalification as it has a major impact on time and cost performance of contractors. Therefor future study must be conducted to develop a model that evaluates the management capability of contractors based on the relative variables for the purpose of improving current prequalification selection...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} report presents findings {{from a study}} of prequalification in architectural competitions. The aim was to develop knowledge of how organizers select architects/teams to invited competitions. <b>Prequalification</b> is a <b>procedure</b> of selection used early in the competition process for identifying suitable candidates for the following design phase. Usually three to six architectural firms/teams are invited to develop design solutions for the competition task. The research question is about how the organizers find these candidates.   There are ten competitions examined in the study. Five municipal competitions and five organised by government clients. The reason for the selection of cases {{is that the public}} sector is a major organizer of competitions in Sweden. The methodology of the investigation is a combination of mapping, case studies and document review. Results show that there are 375 applications from architects in the competitions. 43 architect firms/teams (11 %) have been invited to competitions. The vast majority of the applications (84 %) came from Sweden. This is {{explained by the fact that}} organizers require Swedish as the competition language.   All the organizers used a selection process that included two distinct phases. The clients start by checking whether the applications meet the requirements specified in the invitation. This is followed by an evaluative phase with assessment of the architectural offices professional profile, supported by relevant reference projects and personal references. Decisive in the final assessment is the organizer’s evaluation of the candidates’ ability to produce the project with architectural quality, to combine creative solutions with functional demands and to cooperate with developers and contractors. The assessment in the second evaluative phase is performed with the support of three different methods: voting among reviewers, scoring merits in applications or by an overall assessment of candidates.

40|$|G 450 steel to AS 1397 is a {{cold-reduced}} {{sheet steel}} with in-line galvanizing. Its grade is 450 MPa yield and 480 MPa tensile strength. It {{is widely used}} in Australia for purlins, and {{is being used to}} fabricate lightweight portal frames, often by welding. The effects of welding on G 450 sheet steel in the heat affected zone with respect to the connection strength were unknown. In the present work, transverse and longitudinal fillet, and flare-bevel welded connections in 1. 5 and 3. 0 mm G 450 steel were tested to failure. The test results are used to check the relevant design rules in the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structures AS/NZS 4600. It was found that the current design rules are not adequate for certain connection configurations in G 450 steel to achieve the target safety index of 3. 5. Reduced resistance (capacity) factors are proposed for some connections. It was also found that the current design rule for longitudinal flare-bevel welded connections is unnecessarily conservative. The quality of welded connections in thin sheet steels produced by industry fabricators was investigated. The need to complement the macrotest with the destructive prying test as part of the <b>prequalification</b> <b>procedure</b> for such connections is demonstrated. Part {{of the results of the}} present work has recently been incorporated into the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members with a lowering of the thickness to 2. 5 mm above which weld throat failure should be checked...|$|E
