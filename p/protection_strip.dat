A computational analysis based on the Fast Fourier Transform technique is presented. The particular application of the present method is in the understanding of the foreign object damage problem of composite fan blades. The method is completely general and may be applied to the study of other stress wave propagation problems in a half space. Results indicate that for the protective strip to be effective in reducing impact stresses in the composite the thickness must be equal or greater than the impact contact dimension. Large interface shear stresses at the strip - composite boundary can be induced under impact...|$|E
40|$|The new Forest Code (NCF) which {{substitutes}} the Law No. 4. 771, Old Forestry Code (ACF), {{regulates the}} definition of Permanent Preservation Areas (APP’s) of waterway marginal ranges, considering that currently their delimitation must be done {{from the edge of}} the regular bed rail (LR), differently from the ACF, which indicated the APP range beginning from the larger hydrological river bed (LMH). The objective was to compare the application of the NCF in river ciliary range, opposite to the Old Code, as well as the difference between themselves, in a typically rural basin. The Arroio Grande study case was used, the extent of the LR was defined, as well as of LMH and its respective APP range, thus, forming the Permanent Protection Range (FPP). Within each <b>protection</b> <b>strip,</b> it was utilized the land use analysis and also its commonest difficulties that define the boundaries of the APP defining bed. Through the maps which were obtained, the APP of the Arroio Grande must be 50 m from the LR rail, which is bounded through this river, and includes river shores and islands. The NCF brings as a contribution to permit the owners the adequacy of degraded areas using a minor range of preservation and facilitating {{the definition of}} LR by satellite images. Thus, one can compare the laws through the maps and conclude that the NCF has brought some progress such as the ease of in the demarcation of APP, but it is milder compared to the size of the protected area...|$|E

25|$|According to {{historian}} Lisa Levenstein, {{who works}} largely in fields pertaining to women's history, {{the feminist movement}} in the late 1970s briefly attempted a program to help older divorced and widowed women.

The program, however, encountered sharp criticism from young activists who gave priority to poor minority women rather than the middle class. By 1980, NOW downplayed the program as it focused almost exclusively on the ERA. Schlafly moved into the vacuum.

40|$|People with {{learning}} difficulties are considerably {{more likely to}} experience sexual violence than non-disabled people, and for this reason they are often described as 'vulnerable'. However, the use of this label can in fact increase risk. This book argues that by seeing adults {{with learning}} difficulties as vulnerable and in need of <b>protection,</b> they are <b>stripped</b> of their autonomy and left with fewer skills that are needed to protect themselves from harm. Their different treatment, such as segregation and over-protection, can in fact increase their 'vulnerability'. The author discusses a range of social processes, such as sex education, self-determination, friendships, sexual relationships and social inclusion, and examines the risk and benefits associated with each. Drawing on the everyday experiences of 29 adults with learning difficulties, the author illustrates how people with learning difficulties can be capable of safeguarding themselves from harm, and makes a range of suggestions for enabling them to become better equipped at managing risk themselves. ...|$|R

40|$|Remnant forest strips are {{frequently}} proposed as valuable conservation tools in fragmented tropical landscapes, yet we currently lack evidence {{to evaluate their}} potential conservation value for native biota. We examined the potential value for understorey forest birds of 30 -year-old riparian and terra firme (unflooded) primary forest strips within a large silvicultural landscape in the north-east Brazilian Amazon, where the matrix is dominated by Eucalyptus plantations. We conducted mist-netting in eight forest strips connected to continuous forest (four of each forest type), {{with a total of}} 24 replicate sampling sites located near to (< 1 km), far from (2. 5 - 9 km), and within undisturbed forest controls (i. e. 16 samples within the strips, and 8 in controls). Bird communities in both strip types changed with increasing distance along forest remnants into the plantation matrix. Matrix-embedded samples were characterised by a higher representation of birds typical of secondary growth forest but not those typical of the Eucalyptus-dominated matrix. While the long-term viability of the bird populations in these remnants remains unclear, our data demonstrate that forest strips can provide important habitat for many bird species that are otherwise rarely found outside primary forest. Forest strips therefore provide an important tool to enhance biodiversity conservation in plantation landscapes. The relative practical ease with which these areas can be selected and maintained means that the <b>protection</b> of forest <b>strips</b> as part of a wider conservation strategy is likely to have particular appeal to policy makers and landscape managers working in the human-dominated tropics.

40|$|ObjectiveCalcification is {{the main}} cause of {{structural}} valve deterioration; however, other causes of failure have been identified, and among them, dehiscence of a commissure from the stent has been reported in several models of porcine valves. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the rate and mode of occurrence of this complication in first- and second-generation porcine bioprosthetic explants. MethodsAmong 586 porcine xenografts explanted and analyzed at the Institute of Pathological Anatomy of the University of Padua, 17 (2. 9 %) have been replaced for incompetence because of commissural dehiscence. All these explants were in the mitral position, with the exception of a Carpentier-Edwards supra-annular aortic valve prosthesis. ResultsDehiscence was observed in 9 (1. 9 %) of 455 Hancock standard explants, in 1 (3. 2 %) of 31 Hancock II, in 3 (8. 6 %, 2 standard and 1 supra-annular) of 35 Carpentier-Edwards, in 1 (2. 4 %) of 42 Bioimplants, and in 3 (50 %) of 6 Xenotech after a mean time function of 157 ± 50, 156, 96 ± 29, 143, and 130 ± 8 months, respectively. Dehiscence was the sole cause of incompetence in 6 cases. An impending commissural dehiscence caused by blood creeping was observed in one case. This might be an explanation for the dehiscence other than excessive trimming of the aortic wall. ConclusionsCommissural dehiscence is an uncommon and peculiar mode of failure of porcine valves implanted in the mitral position and was observed earlier and more frequently with Carpentier-Edwards porcine explants (P <. 05). We speculate that pericardial <b>strip</b> <b>protection</b> of the suture between the Dacron fabric and porcine aortic wall, as used in the Biocor porcine valve, might prevent this complication...|$|R
40|$|Argentine and American {{courts have}} a similar {{understanding}} of privacy and Privacy Right. However, the theoretical frameworks and actual rulings in both countries differ in their perspectives and foundations. We provide here a comparative mapping of key conceptual elements of Privacy Right as addressed by the courts of both legal traditions, focusing on family issues. What makes the legal protection of privacy inappropriate, as argued here, is the conceptual framework of Privacy Right. When exploring the causes of this inadequacy, {{it is found that}} a largely unconscious process [...] whereby privacy is frequently associated with other concepts, feelings and actions, such as integrity, autonomy, identity and data protection [...] , turns Privacy Right into a conflicted right. Notwithstanding, privacy is considered to be the backbone of Western societies and, in many ways, the actual democratic standing of a nation depends upon the way it is protected. The conflicting status of privacy is particularly clear in the field of Family Law, where a strict conceptualization of privacy is required in order to assure compatibility between the proper functions of the family members and State regulations. While civil tradition seeks the norms that will best address the protection of privacy, common-law tradition struggles to find cases that will provide the background for its adequate protection. Based on civil and constitutional law analysis, we are contending here that privacy can be clearly and properly addressed by establishing a legal standard that will consider illegal to use a personâ€™s privacy as entertainment without consent. It is also argued here that a clear conceptualization of Privacy Right will allow for the establishment of legitimate limits in State regulation of the family. The worth of considering privacy as opposed to an object of curiosity, contempt and entertainment is that a clear conceptualization can be drawn allowing an unconditioned <b>protection</b> of privacy, <b>stripped</b> of all other philosophical, political and even social considerations...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate the ecological consequences of buffer strip retention on riparian and terrestrial biodiversity. Earlier studies on forest buffer strips have evaluated their effectiveness in relation to water quality and aquatic biota. However, forests along streams are species rich habitats for many organism groups. Buffer strip management {{is assumed to be}} important also for protecting such species. Current approaches to biodiversity-oriented forest management practices need to be scientifically evaluated. In this thesis the effects on bryophytes and land snails have been evaluated. A before-and-after experiment along 15 small streams in northern Sweden showed that buffer strips of 10 m {{on each side of the}} stream moderated the negative effects exhibited at the clear-cuts. The number of land snail species remained similar as to before logging and the number of vanished bryophyte species was lower in the buffer strips than in the clear-cuts. The ground moisture influenced the survival rate of land snails at the clear-cuts. At mesic sites many species vanished but at wet sites the snail fauna was unaffected by the logging. Many bryophyte species, most of them liverworts, decreased or disappeared in the buffer strips. These were mostly growing on substrates elevated from the forest floor, such as logs, stumps and tree-bases. A number of nationally red-listed species, sensitive for changes in microclimate, were among those decreasing most. Thus, for the species in most need of <b>protection</b> the buffer <b>strips</b> were too narrow. An experiment with bryophyte transplants followed over a season showed that wet ground moisture moderated the negative edge effects in narrow buffer strips. On the other hand, the growth in mesic and moist sites was almost as low as in comparable clear-cuts. Microclimatic edge effects are stronger at south facing than north-facing edges of forest clear-cuts. This was shown in an experiment using bryophyte growth as an indicator of differences in microclimate. However, the depth of edge influence seemed to be similar between north- and south-facing forest edges, > 30 m for one species. An explanation for this could be that wind penetrates deeper into edges than solar radiation and has a more variable direction. In conclusion, narrow buffer strips consist entirely of edge habitat. For many species the environment in buffer strips is good enough for persistence. For others, most notably bryophyte species on convex substrates, wider buffer strips are needed to ensure long-term survival...|$|R
