Approximately 14% of Scotland is wooded, much of it forestry plantations, but prior to human clearing {{there would have been}} much larger areas of boreal Caledonian and broad-leaved forest. Although much reduced, significant remnants of the native Scots Pine woodlands can be found in places. 17% of Scotland is covered by heather moorland and <b>peatland.</b> Caithness and Sutherland have some {{of the largest and most}} intact areas of blanket bog in the world, supporting a distinctive wildlife community. 75% of Scotland's land is classed as agricultural (including some moorland) with urban areas accounting for around 3% of the total. The number of islands with terrestrial vegetation is nearly 800, about 600 of them lying off the west coast. Scotland has more than 90% of the volume and 70% of the total surface area of fresh water in the United Kingdom. There are more than 30,000 freshwater lochs and 6,600 river systems.|$|E

40|$|Northern <b>peatlands</b> can emit {{large amounts}} of carbon and harmful smoke {{pollution}} during a wildfire. Of particular concern are drained and mined <b>peatlands,</b> where management practices destabilize an array of ecohydrological feedbacks, moss traits and peat properties that moderate water and carbon losses in natural <b>peatlands.</b> Our results demonstrate that drained and mined <b>peatlands</b> in Canada and northern Europe can experience catastrophic deep burns (> 200 t C ha(- 1) emitted) under current weather conditions. Furthermore, climate change will cause greater water losses in these <b>peatlands</b> and subject even deeper peat layers to wildfire combustion. However, the rewetting of drained <b>peatlands</b> and the restoration of mined <b>peatlands</b> can effectively {{lower the risk of}} these deep burns, especially if a new peat moss layer successfully establishes and raises peat moisture content.

40|$|<b>Peatlands</b> are lands with a {{naturally}} accumulated peat layer at their surface. In their natural state, <b>peatlands</b> support a large range of habitats {{and provide a}} home for unique biodiversity. Even though <b>peatlands</b> extend over a relatively {{small portion of the}} earth’s land surface, they hold a large pool of carbon. Along with storing large quantities of carbon, <b>peatlands</b> also {{play an important role in}} the retention, purification and release of water and in the mitigation of droughts and floods. When drained, <b>peatlands</b> become net sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Because of drainage, organic soils are currently the third-largest emitter of GHGs in the Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use sector.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{summarizes the}} literature dealing with diversity of protist organisms in <b>peatlands.</b> First part presents brief general characteristics of <b>peatlands</b> for {{the acquisition of}} basic knowledge about this ecosystem.

This work concludes that the community of protist organisms in <b>peatlands</b> is different from those observed in other ecosystems. The composition {{of the community of}} protists in <b>peatlands</b> is very heterogeneous, because it depends on the type of microbiotop and prevailing physicochemical conditions.

40|$|Most studies about carbon {{dynamics}} of <b>peatlands</b> have {{been focused on}} boreal, subarctic and tropical <b>peatlands.</b> However, there is limited data about carbon {{dynamics of}} alpine <b>peatlands,</b> like Zoige <b>peatlands</b> on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which are sensitive to climate change and human disturbance. We studied the role of these peat deposits on the Zoige as a C reserve and sink by measuring peat depth, radiocarbon age and peat and C accumulation rates at 7 sites. The peat depths of the sample sites ranged from 0. 20 to 6. 0 m; the basal age on the plateau varied from 1635 to 14095 cal yr BP; the peat accumulation rates ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 85 mm yr(- 1), and the C accumulation rates from 5 to 48 g m(- 2) yr(- 1). Based on data of field studies and remote sensing, we regarded that with 3179 km(2) of intact <b>peatlands,</b> about 1426 km(2) of degraded <b>peatlands,</b> and the total area of Zoige <b>peatlands</b> was 4605 km(2). The current peat C stock of Zoige <b>peatlands</b> was 0. 477 Pg (ranging from 0. 206 to 0. 672 Pg). We also estimated that <b>peatlands</b> covered an area of about 5091 krn(2) on the QTP and sequestered 0. 543 Pg C, 88 % in Zoige and the rest {{in other parts of}} the plateau. Human activities, together with the ubiquitous warming on the plateau (temperature increased by 0. 2 degrees C per decade over the past 50 years) not only shrank the area of intact <b>peatlands,</b> but also caused substantial carbon releasing from <b>peatlands.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|Sphagnum is a genus of {{approximately}} 380 accepted species of mosses, {{commonly known as}} peat moss. Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16–26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions. Hence, as sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for {{a wide array of}} <b>peatland</b> plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants. Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions. Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, so any one <b>peatland</b> may have a number of different Sphagnum species.|$|E

40|$|Commentary A recent {{publication}} in Plant and Soil (Leppänen et al. 2015) {{reports on the}} effect of peat moss species and water table on the N 2 fixation rate in boreal <b>peatlands</b> and forests. The lack of CH 4 -stimulated N 2 fixation led the authors to conclude that methanotrophs do not contribute significantly to the N-supply of the mosses. This is in contrast to other studies in <b>peatlands</b> which suggest that methanotrophs may be responsible for the “unaccounted” N-input. The importance of <b>peatlands</b> in the global carbon cycle, combined with the crucial role of N not only in ombotrophic <b>peatlands</b> but also in thawing permafrost warrants a synthesis of these controversies. Evidence for and against diazotrophic N-provision by aerobic methanotrophs in <b>peatlands</b> Ombrotrophic <b>peatlands</b> are nitrogen poor environments, relying solely on atmospheric N deposition. Yet, there is an imbalance in atmospheric N deposition and N accumulation in Sphagnum mosses, with N accumulation by far exceeding N-depositio...|$|R

25|$|Though they do {{regularly}} {{nest in the}} marsh-like <b>peatland</b> of the boreal forest, golden eagles are {{not generally}} associated with wetlands and, in fact, they can be found near {{some of the most}} arid spots on earth. In the wintering population of Eastern United States, however, they are often associated with steep river valleys, reservoirs, and marshes in inland areas as well as estuarine marshlands, barrier islands, managed wetlands, sounds, and mouths of major river systems in coastal areas. These wetlands are attractive due to a dominance of open vegetation, large concentrations of prey, and the general absence of human disturbance.
