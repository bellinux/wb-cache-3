5|$|The {{principal}} <b>political</b> <b>actors</b> at {{the time}} of the coup had been active during the independence movement and the republic's first few years. Antanas Smetona had served as Lithuania's first president between April 1919 and June 1920; he then withdrew from formal political involvement, although he published political criticism, for which he served a brief prison term in 1923. Augustinas Voldemaras represented Lithuania at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918 and later served as Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He resigned from the government in 1920, although he continued to write and publish political criticism, for which he also was sentenced to a short prison term. Kazys Grinius had chaired a post-World War I repatriation commission, and went on to serve as head of the 6th Cabinet of Ministers and in the First and Second Seimas. Mykolas Sleževičius served as prime minister in 1918 and 1919, oversaw the organization of the Lithuanian armed forces in 1920, and was a member of the Second Seimas between 1922 and 1926.|$|E

It originated from traditional business marketing strategies applied to politics, largely for the purpose of winning elections. <b>Political</b> parties and <b>actors</b> can choose between two fundamental methods: leading the market or following the market. Leading the market involves fulfilling underlying demands of principle, and a <b>political</b> <b>actor</b> would essentially assume the position of one who leads on their own ideas and principles.

5000|$|Political {{psychological}} rationalization (PPR) is {{a phenomenon}} seen in political warfare and election campaign rhetoric, meant to displace a perceived fault, short coming, mistake, or problem from one <b>political</b> <b>actor,</b> and attach it to another <b>political</b> <b>actor,</b> generally an opponent. While not truly rationalization {{in the context of}} psychology—where a problem, short coming, mistake, or fault is justified and allowed to endure—PPR maintains the negative connotation of the original flaw, transfers that connotation to a target actor, and then seeks to destroy the flaw (and consequently the actor) through association with said flaw, but with a political purpose and focus. Political psychological rationalization exploits a number of psychological principles to manipulate the perceptions of different actors including groupthink, cognitive dissonance, and other forms of psychological manipulation. An example of PPR would be [...] "Candidate A" [...] accusing [...] "Candidate B" [...] of having an onerous tax policy for not cutting taxes while Candidate A had already raised taxes previously in his or her career, but having accused Candidate B of having an onerous tax policy is seen as being in favor of cutting taxes. Use of PPR can also run the risk of backfiring against the broadcaster if knowledge of hypocritical behavior {{on the part of the}} displacing <b>political</b> <b>actor</b> becomes known. In cases where this has happened, the original negative association can become reoriented back to the initiating <b>political</b> <b>actor.</b> As tool of political warfare, PPR has been used by a wide array of factions, ideologies, actors, and regimes including fascists, communists, religious extremists, electoral campaign rhetoric, and non-governmental organizations.|$|R

The commission also advocated negotiations in Europe to reduce political tensions among the states and <b>political</b> <b>actors</b> that could have a potential for military conflict. In the early 1980s, Sweden was one of 58 nations signatory to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. In compliance with the Convention, Sweden adopted the Nuclear Activities Act and the Nuclear Activities Ordinance in 1984. The Acts were designed to prevent unlawful dealings with nuclear material and thereby ensure the safety of nuclear activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} the fall of Magloire and the {{election}} of Duvalier in September 1957 was a chaotic one, even by Haitian standards. Three provisional presidents held office during this interval; one resigned and the army deposed the other two, Franck Sylvain and Fignolé. Duvalier {{is said to have}} engaged actively in the behind-the-scenes intrigue that helped him to emerge as the presidential candidate that the military favored. The military went on to guide the campaign and the elections in a way that gave Duvalier every possible advantage. Most <b>political</b> <b>actors</b> perceived Duvalier—a medical doctor who had served as a rural administrator of a United States-funded anti-yaws campaign before entering the cabinet under Estimé—as an honest and fairly unassuming leader without a strong ideological motivation or program. When elections were finally organized, this time under terms of universal suffrage (both men and women now had the vote), Duvalier, a black, painted himself as the legitimate heir to Estimé. This approach was enhanced by the fact that Duvalier's only viable opponent, Louis Déjoie, was a mulatto and the scion of a prominent family. Duvalier scored a decisive victory at the polls. His followers took two-thirds of the legislature's lower house and all of the seats in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 and 1991, peace {{negotiations}} with several smaller guerrilla movements resulted in their demobilization and transformation into civilian <b>political</b> <b>actors.</b> The first guerrilla group to demobilize following {{a peace agreement}} with the Colombian government was the 19th of April Movement (M-19), which demobilized and surrendered its weapons in exchange for blanket amnesty for all actions committed {{as part of the}} conflict. Other guerrilla groups which demobilized along similar conditions included most fronts of the Popular Liberation Army (EPL) and the Movimiento Armado Quintin Lame (MAQL). However, repeated attempts at finding a negotiated settlement through formal peace talks {{between the government and the}} FARC have all been unsuccessful. Prior to the current peace process, the most recent attempt at peace talks with the FARC was the 1999-2002 peace process under the government of President Andrés Pastrana, who had conceded a demilitarized zone to the FARC to facilitate peace talks within Colombian territory. Although the peace process continued for three years, no kind of agreement was reached between the two sides. Pastrana formally broke off all talks and ordered the military to retake control of the demilitarized zone on February 20, 2002, a few months before the 2002 presidential elections. The FARC had used the demilitarized zone as a safe zone to keep hostages, negotiate prisoner exchanges, train troops and plan offensive actions.The paralyzed peace process coincided with an escalation of the conflict, owing to a variety of factors including the rapid numerical and geographic expansion of paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) who opposed the government's negotiations with the FARC. The 1998–2002 period was one of the most violent periods in recent Colombian history, with the national homicide rate increasing from 58.92 (1998) to 69.69 per 100,000 inhabitants (2002). In addition, there were 390 attacks on civilian settlements - the majority of them by the FARC; over 3,000 kidnappings each year between 1998 and 2002 and 898 massacres - mostly committed by paramilitary groups - killing over 5,400 people.|$|E

Rabelais and La Fontaine are by an as yet unidentified author. Shelley was the only contributor to Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia to give such pride of place to female biographical subjects. In these volumes, [...] "she stretched the definition of 'Eminent Literary Men' not just by including two more women but by her choice of a quartet of French revolutionary personalities who were <b>political</b> <b>actors</b> more than, or as much as writers: Condorcet and Mirabeau, Mme Roland and Mme de Staël".

500|$|The Instruments of Accession were limited, {{transferring}} {{control of}} only three matters to India, and would by themselves have produced a rather loose federation, with significant differences in administration and governance across the various states.

This {{was not an easy}} task. While some princely states such as Mysore had legislative systems of governance that were based on a broad franchise and not significantly different from those of British India, in others, political decision-making took place in small, limited aristocratic circles and governance was, as a result, at best paternalistic and at worst the result of courtly intrigue. Having secured the accession of the princely states, the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 turned to the task of welding the states and the former British provinces into one polity under a single republican constitution.|$|E

2500|$|BSP is {{believed}} to have suffered both electoral (reduced support among its core sympathizers) and political losses (losing ground to new populist and nationalist parties) due to its supposed role in the entrenchment of the [...] "Who" [...] model (Bulgarian: моделът [...] "КОЙ"), which is assumed to have been exemplified by the Oresharski government. References to this model - implying inappropriate interlinkages between government, big business, media and other [...] "shadowy forces" [...] which bring about an erosion of constitutional and democratic practices - were frequently made during the anti-Oresharski demonstrations. The protests also intensified the split between two main wings of BSP - the one loyal to Sergei Stanishev and the one taking cues from Georgi Parvanov, with the latter group forming the political project ABV in January 2014, which officially became a full-fledged political party in June of the same year. The protests are believed to have been a factor in making <b>political</b> <b>actors</b> more reluctant to include the MRF as part of governing coalitions.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} why the military tends to commit a coup in reaction to the rise of leftist popular forces, and why the military officers in the post-coup period are inclined to implement politico-economic policies which most benefit the business elite {{at the expense of the}} economically underprivileged classes, this study proposed the Interactive Model. This model critically examines the explanatory effectiveness of the structuralist approach, such as the Bureaucratic-Authoritarian model and Middle-Class Coup (or, Veto-Coup) hypothesis, in solving the above mentioned questions, but does not underrate its theoretical usefulness. In this study, which is primarily based on the voluntaristic approach focusing on the creative role of <b>political</b> <b>actor,</b> a synthetical framework of analysis is introduced. Regarding the officer corps as the prime <b>political</b> <b>actor,</b> the Interactive Model claims that the officers' political will, ideology, and commitment to their corporate interests play the most decisive role in bringing about radical political change like coup and the post-coup regime transformations. In the meantime, structural factors, such as political disorder, deteriorating class conflicts, and belief in economic rationality, are believed to indirectly influence the <b>political</b> <b>actor.</b> Four countries, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, and Thailand, were comparatively studied in this study. As coup-maker, officers are found to have violently reacted to the rise of the Left primarily because leftist forces posed a threat to their corporate interests. In the post-coup period, officers in power, as the state-manager, usually sided with the dominant economic powers, but tension often arises between the two. This study argues that these conflicting phenomena need to be understood with reference to the state-manager's ideology and political interest...|$|R
