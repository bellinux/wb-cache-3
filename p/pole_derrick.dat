5000|$|The {{gin pole}} is {{considered}} a form of derrick, called standing derrick or <b>pole</b> <b>derrick,</b> distinguished from sheers (or [...] "shear legs") by having a single boom rather than a two-legged one.|$|E
50|$|Gin <b>pole</b> <b>derrick</b> (also {{known as}} {{standing}} derrick or <b>pole</b> <b>derrick)</b> is a derrick without a boom with single tower or mast supported by 4 guy wires (two side guys, fore guy and rear guy). Its guys are so arranged from its top as to permit leaning the mast in any direction. The {{base of the}} tower is hinged {{and the top of}} the tower is connected to a pulley system for load lifting. As this is a simple derrick system, it is considered to be used by some agencies as an improvised rescue derrick in an emergency situation where no suitable rescue derrick or crane is available.|$|E

Three more automobiles can be seen parked in {{what appears to be}} a small parking lot on the left side of the road, behind a utility <b>pole.</b> Numerous oil <b>derricks</b> can be seen in the middle distance, extending to the horizon. Several of the derricks on the left hand side of the road can be seen emitting what appears to be steam or smoke into the air. Another cloud of what appears to be steam or smoke can be seen in the distance on the right, past the two cars in the foreground. Several more cars are driving on the road, in the distance. Several small buildings can be seen on the left and right sides of the road.; legible signs read: "Bargains Reutler", "Hahn", "Real Estate"...|$|R
5000|$|Shear {{legs are}} a lifting device {{related to the}} gin <b>pole,</b> <b>derrick</b> and tripod (lifting device). Shears are an A-frame {{of any kind of}} {{material}} such as timbers or metal, the feet resting on or in the ground or on a solid surface which will not let them move and the top held in place with guy-wires or guy ropes simply called [...] "guys". Shear legs only need two guys whereas a gin pole needs at least three. The U. S. Army Field Manual FM 5-125 gives detailed instruction on how to rig shears.|$|E
