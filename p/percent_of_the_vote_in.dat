5|$|The {{race was}} never close, and the Nixon/Agnew ticket won 49 states and over 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> gaining re-election. Trying to {{position}} {{himself as the}} frontrunner for 1976, Agnew campaigned widely for Republican candidates, something Nixon would not do. Despite Agnew's efforts, Democrats easily held both houses of Congress, gaining two seats in the Senate, though the Republicans gained twelve in the House.|$|E
5|$|Cook County Commissioner Forrest Claypool filed nominating {{petitions}} {{to run as}} {{an independent}} candidate for assessor. Berrios dropped a challenge to Claypool's nominating petitions after Berrios' lawyers examined Claypool's 90,000 signatures, 65,000 more than required. Berrios prevailed in the November 2010 general election with 46 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> a field that also included Republican Sharon Strobeck-Eckersall. Claypool attributed his defeat to his failure to get enough suburban support to offset Berrios' organization in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Yale Law School, Clinton {{returned}} to Arkansas {{and became a}} law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52percent to 48percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election, Clinton was elected.|$|E

5|$|Eva Perón then {{created the}} Female Peronist Party, the first large female {{political}} {{party in the}} nation. Navarro and Fraser write that by 1951, the party had 500,000 members and 3,600 headquarters across the country. Navarro and Fraser write that while Eva Perón did not consider herself a feminist, her impact on the political life of women was decisive. Thousands of previously apolitical women entered politics because of Eva Perón. They were the first women active in Argentine politics. The combination of female suffrage {{and the organization of}} the Female Peronist Party granted Juan Perón a large majority (sixty-three <b>percent)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the 1951 presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|Neal has won {{re-election}} in every term since. Former Springfield mayor Theodore Dimauro, reflecting sentiments that Neal had {{an unfair advantage}} in the previous election, ran as a challenger in the 1990 Democratic primary. Dimauro's campaign was sullied by a false rumor he spread about the Bank of New England's financial situation, and Neal won the primary easily. He was unopposed in the general election, winning 68 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>In</b> 1992 his popularity was threatened by the House banking scandal, {{in which he had}} made dozens of unpenalized overdrafts at the House Bank. After narrowly defeating two Democratic opponents, he was challenged by Republican Anthony W. Ravosa, Jr., and Independent Thomas R. Sheehan. Neal won with 53 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Palmer and Buckner {{both had}} {{developed}} reputations as independent executives {{while serving as}} governors of their respective states. Because they had served on opposite sides during the Civil War, their presence on the same ticket emphasized national unity. The ticket was endorsed by several major newspapers including the Chicago Chronicle, Louisville Courier-Journal, Detroit Free Press, Richmond Times, and New Orleans Picayune. Despite these advantages, the ticket was hurt by the candidates' ages, Palmer being 79and Buckner 73. Further, some supporters feared that voting for the National Democrat ticket would be a wasted vote and might even throw the election to Bryan. Ultimately, Palmer and Buckner received just over one <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the election.|$|E

5|$|In April 1973, anti-Chogyal {{agitation}} {{broke out}} and protestors demanded popular elections. The Sikkim police {{were unable to}} control the demonstrations, and Dorji asked India to exercise its responsibility for law and order and intervene. India facilitated negotiations between the Chogyal and Dorji, and produced an agreement, which envisaged {{the reduction of the}} Chogyal to the role of a constitutional monarch and the holding of elections based on a new ethnic power-sharing formula. The Chogyal's opponents won an overwhelming victory, and a new Constitution was drafted providing for Sikkim {{to be associated with the}} Republic of India. On 10 April 1975, the Sikkim Assembly passed a resolution calling for the state to be fully integrated into India. This resolution was endorsed by 97 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> a referendum held on 14 April 1975, following which the Indian Parliament amended the constitution to admit Sikkim into India as its 22nd state.|$|E
