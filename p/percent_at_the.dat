25|$|The {{main targets}} of the {{concession}} were to increase service coverage from an initial 46 percent and to reduce water losses from 61 percent.

In 2008 service coverage reached only 64 percent and water losses were reduced to only 50 percent. During the same period, water tariffs increased threefold. This increase was partly due to increases in the cost of electricity and bulk water purchases which are passed through by the private companies to the customers.|$|E
