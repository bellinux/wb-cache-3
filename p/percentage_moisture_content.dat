40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a research programme on the estimation of moisture content in timber using ultrasonics, by developing working relationships between ultrasonic wave velocity, temperature and <b>percentage</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> in timber samples during kiln drying. A detailed experimental programme was undertaken to develop relationships between ultrasonic wave propagation velocity and temperature, and between velocity and <b>percentage</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> for a large number of timber samples. The experimental programme was primarily restricted to samples of jarrah timber, but the procedures can be applied to other species. The results show conclusively that both temperature and moisture content {{have a significant effect on}} the ultrasonic wave propagation velocity in timber, whereas material density does not. Thus, ultrasonics can be used to monitor variations in <b>percentage</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> during the drying process in a kiln environment. A simple field-testing procedure has been developed for monitoring moisture content in timber using ultrasonics either manually (with a hand calculator) or incorporated into a computer program for on-line monitoring. The procedure is based on simple quadratic equations derived from a statistical regression analysis of velocity and temperature relationships, and velocity and percentage moisture-content relationships. To overcome any measurement inaccuracies due to density variations or other factors, the recommended procedure involves the initial calibration of each sample board. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: There is a {{recognised}} {{relationship between}} dry weather conditions and {{increased risk of}} anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Previous studies have identified 28 day evaporation as an important weather-based predictor of non-contact ACL injuries in professional Australian Football League matches. The mechanism of non-contact injury to the ACL is believed to increased traction and impact forces between footwear and playing surface. Ground hardness and the amount and quality of grass are factors that would most likely influence this and are inturn, related to the soil moisture content and prevailing weather conditions. This paper explores the relationship between soil moisture content, preceding weather conditions and the Clegg Soil Impact Test (CSIT) which is an internationally recognised standard measure of ground hardness for sports fields. Methodology: The 2. 25 kg Clegg Soil Impact Test {{and a pair of}} 12 cm soil moisture probes were used to measure ground hardness and <b>percentage</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Five football fields were surveyed at 13 prescribed sites just before seven football matches from October 2008 to January 2009 (an FC Women’s WLeague team).

All non-contact injuries occurring during match play and their location on the field were recorded. Results/conclusions: Ground hardness varied between CSIT 5 and 17 (x 10 G) (8 is considered a good value for sports fields).

40|$|Abstract — The <b>percentage</b> of <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} indexes in maize quality evaluation. Maize with high <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> will not stay for extended periods; hence it is important to have accurate prediction of <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> As aflatoxin contamination in maize is of major concern, the necessity for suitable methods to predict <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> with less time and higher accuracy assumes greater importance. Hence, Three Term Backpropagation network is proposed as a prediction tool for <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> on maize. The new model is an improvement on Two Term Back propagation by the addition of an extra parameter, the proportional factor, which increases the convergence speed and reduces learning stalls in the conventional neural network. The experimental results are conducted using semi-annual datasets obtained from a maize thermal dryer. The results show that the proposed model outperforms Two Term Back propagation and other prediction methods like empirical correlation, analytical models (tank in series) and genetic algorithm which were used as prediction tools.

The protein content in the three species (with proximate) also gave 2. 21, 2. 30 and 2. 70 % for Pisifera, Dura and Tenera respectively while the iodine values which were determined using Wijis method gave results to be 44. 38, 46. 93 and 44. 05 for Pisifera, Dura and Tenera in that order. The acid value and the saponification values were determined (by titrametric method) in the three species which gave acid value results to be 0. 65, 0. 67 and 0. 57 mgkOH/g for Pisifera, Dura and Tenera respectively while the saponification values where 191. 45, 185. 77 and 188. 48 mgKoH/g for Pisifera, Dura and Tenera in that order. Also the <b>percentage</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> gave 0. 05, 0. 04 and 0. 05 for the three species in same order above. The dietary magnesium for the Pisifera, Dura and Tenera in that order were 0. 95, 1. 13 and 0. 37 mg/dm 3 and 0. 08, 0. 24 and 0. 05 mg/dm 3 for dietary zinc. The Dietary calcium level were 0. 46, 0. 41 and 0. 34 mg/dm 3 and the potassium 0. 46, 0. 39 and 0. 48 mg/dm 3 for Pisifera, Dura and Tenera respectively. The iron concentration levels were 38. 30, 67. 70 and 78. 30 mg/dm 3 for the three in the same order above...|$|E
40|$|In this {{experiment}} we tried checked {{if there was}} variation in the oil <b>percentage</b> and <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> in sunflower seed localized {{in different parts of}} sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) head. Twenty heads from 'Record' variety, and ten from 'URL III' variety, both open-pollinated materials, were sampled. Each head was divided into three concentric ring-shaped zones and four samples were taken from each head, i. e., one from the central zone, one from the perimeter, and one from the intermediate zone. A fourth sample was taken from the mixture of the seeds from the hole head. The results obtained with these materials showed that the samples must be taken from the intermediate zone, if the results are to be used for selection of plants of better oil quantity. To analyze the <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> the seed sample should be taken from the hole head...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the influence of spray drying conditions on the physical properties of mango powder. The process was carried out on a mini spray dryer and maltodextrin 10 DE was used as carrier agent. Three tests were made. Solubility, dissolution and <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> were analyzed as responses. Solubility was positively affected by inlet air temperature while dissolution and <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of powders were negatively affected by inlet air temperature. An increase in maltodextrin concentration increases the solubility of the mango powders and decreases {{the dissolution of the}} powders. From the result obtain the inlet air temperature of 160 oC and 15 % of maltodextrin addition is the optimum value for this study. For the solubility test, the optimum value is at temperature of 170 oC and 20 % of maltodextrin addition which the percentage of solubility is 81. 76. The inlet air temperature of 150 oC and maltodextrin addition of 10 % is the optimum value for the dissolution test. For <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> analysis, the optimum value is at inlet air temperature of 160 oC and 15 % maltodextrin addition which the <b>percentage</b> of <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is 2. 38...|$|R
40|$|Proximate {{analysis}} was determined in wet cat food of fish flavour. From the Food Regulation 1985, the basic nutrient content required in food labeling is amount of energy, protein, carbohydrates and fat. The study presents, the determination <b>percentage</b> of <b>Moisture</b> <b>Content,</b> Crude Protein, Digestible Protein, Crude Fat, Carbohydrate, Crude Ash and pH in three brands of wet cat food sample. The wet cat food samples are then further analysed their significant value between Premium, Normal and Economy brand with AAFCO standard. From the study conducted, {{it shows that}} {{there were significant differences}} between the three brands of samples in term of Crude Protein, Digestible Protein, Crude Fat and Crude Ash. There were significant differences in terms of <b>Moisture</b> <b>Content</b> and Carbohydrate for Premium-Normal and Premium-Economy brands but no significance difference for Normal-Economy brand. Value of pH showed that significance difference between Premium-Normal brand meanwhile no significance differences between Premium-Economy and Normal-Economy brands. ...|$|R
