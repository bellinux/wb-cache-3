Obstructions of biliary ducts, idiopathic pancreatitis {{may be related}} with biliary origin which needs identification for acute treatment. We searched for the predictivity of biochemical markers in early acute biliary pancreatitis. Patients and Methods. Serum levels of AST (Aspartate Transaminase),ALT (Alanine Transaminase), ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase), GGT (Gamma Glutamyl Transferase), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase), amylase, lipase, CRP (C-Reactive Protein) and WBC (White Blood Cell) were measured in 157 patients with acute pancreatitis. Biliary and nonbiliary pancreatitis were differentiated by Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), Intraoperative Cholangiopancreatography (IOC). Cut-off <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> biochemical markers with sensitivity, specifity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were determined after identification of significant variables.

40|$|Objective The Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) is {{established}} as a core metric in psychiatric research. This study aims to test the validity of CGI as a clinical outcome measure suitable for routine use in a private inpatient setting. Methods The CGI was added to a standard battery of routine outcome measures in a private psychiatric hospital. Data were collected on consecutive admissions {{over a period of}} 24 months, which included clinical diagnosis, demographics, service utilization and four routine measures (CGI, HoNOS, MHQ- 14 and DASS- 21) at both admission and discharge. Descriptive and comparative data analyses were performed. Results Of 786 admissions in total, there were 624 and 614 CGI-S ratings completed at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> and discharge, respectively, and 610 completed CGI-I ratings. The admission and discharge CGI-S scores were correlated (r = 0. 40), and the indirect improvement measures obtained from their differences were highly correlated with the direct CGI-I scores (r = 0. 71). The CGI results reflected similar trends seen in the other three outcome measures. Conclusions The CGI is a valid clinical outcome measure suitable for routine use in an inpatient setting. It offers a number of advantages, including its established utility in psychiatric research, sensitivity to change, quick and simple administration, utility across diagnostic groupings, and reliability in the hands of skilled clinicians. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Rationale: Medication errors {{can lead}} to {{preventable}} adverse drug events (pADEs) that have significant cost and health implications. Errors often occur at care interfaces, and various interventions have been devised to reduce medication errors at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> to hospital. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the incremental costs and effects [measured as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) ] of a range of such interventions for which evidence of effectiveness exists. Methods: A previously published medication errors model was adapted to describe the pathway of errors occurring at admission through to the occurrence of pADEs. The baseline model was populated using literature-based values, and then calibrated to observed outputs. Evidence of effects was derived from a systematic review of interventions aimed at preventing medication error at hospital admission. Results: All five interventions, for which evidence of effectiveness was identified, are estimated to be extremely cost-effective when compared with the baseline scenario. Pharmacist-led reconciliation intervention has the highest expected net benefits, and a probability of being cost-effective of over 60 % by a QALY value of £ 10 000. Conclusions: The medication errors model provides reasonably strong evidence that some form of intervention to improve medicines reconciliation is a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The variation in the reported effectiveness of the few identified studies of medication error interventions illustrates the need for extreme attention to detail in the development of interventions, but also in their evaluation and may justify the primary evaluation of more than one specification of included interventions.

40|$|Background: Neonatal deaths mostly {{occur within}} the first one week and first 24 hours of life {{from a variety of}} conditions. Objective: To examine the role of {{significant}} hypothermia and hypoglycaemia, in addition to some other factors, in neonatal mortality occurring {{within the first}} 24 hours of admission. Methods: A prospective study of newborn infants hospitalized within the first 24 hours of life in a Nigerian Special Care Baby Unit. The axillary temperature and serum glucose at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> were recorded for consecutive admissions. Significant hypothermia (axillary temperature < 36 C) and hypoglycaemia (random blood glucose < 40 mg/dl) were related to the risk of death within the first 24 hours of admission using bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Out of 277 infants, 24. 2 % and 27. 3 % had significant hypothermia and hypoglycaemia respectively. The overall mortality rate was 21. 6 % (49 / 227); 38. 8 % (19 / 49) of the infants died within the first 24 hours of admission. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) among infants with co-existing significant hypothermia and hypoglycaemia was 41. 2 % compared to 0. 9 % among infants with neither significant hypothermia nor hypoglycaemia. Death within the first 24 hours of admission was significantly associated with hypoglycaemia, significant hypothermia, asphyxia and apnea using both bivariate and multivariate analysis.

The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the point-of-admission serum electrolyte profile of children with dehydration due to acute diarrhoea. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the serum electrolyte levels of 185 children with dehydration due to acute diarrhoea were assessed at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> at the Diarrhoea Treatment and Training Unit of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital. The age of the study population ranged from 29 days to 59 months. Results: Out of a total of 185 subjects, 30 (16. 2 %), 114 (61. 6 %), and 41 (22. 2 %) had severe, moderate and mild dehydration, respectively. In addition, hyponatraemic dehydration was the most common type of dehydration, accounting for 60. 5 % of cases. Metabolic acidosis and hypokalaemia occurred in 59. 5 % and 44. 3 % of cases, respectively. Only the serum bicarbonate level was significantly affected by degree of dehydration (p = 0. 001). Age of more than 12 months and presence of vomiting were significantly associated with hyponatraemia (p = 0. 005 & p = 0. 02), while age of less than or equal 12 months and absence of vomiting were associated with metabolic acidosis (p = 0. 04 & p = 0. 03).

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the nature, causes, and impact of medical student attrition in Nigeria. Method: A pilot analysis was undertaken using the records of students who failed at medical school as a result of inability to pass the second MBBS examination at Ebonyi State University, Abakaliki, Nigeria, between 2002 and 2007. Some of these students were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Results: Data analysis showed that 58 (7. 8 %) of the students admitted into preclinical class withdrew from their study. Thirty-six (62. 1 %) were males and the rest were females. Thirteen of those withdrawn were interviewed, and 53. 8 % of them believed they had poor academic ability, while 15. 4 % attributed their withdrawal to family pressure. No record of guidance or counseling session programs was noted for these students either at the point of withdrawal from the faculty and on the choice of a new career path.

40|$|Purpose A Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and or High Dependency Unit (HDU) is a locked, {{intensive}} treatment facility available to people experiencing acute psychiatric distress. For {{many people who}} access public mental health services in Australia, the PICU/HDU is the primary <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission,</b> and should represent and facilitate timely assessment and an optimum treatment plan under a recovery framework. Nurses are the largest health discipline working in this specialty area of care. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative study aimed to investigate the skills, experience, and practice, of nurses working in the PICU/HDU {{in relation to a}} recovery model of care. Identifying how nurses provide care in the PICU/HDU will inform a clinical practice guideline to further support this specialty area of care. Four focus groups were facilitated with 52 registered nurses attending. Findings The nurse participants identified specific skills under four distinct themes; Storytelling, Treatment and recovery, Taking responsibility, and Safeguarding. The skills highlight the expertise and clinical standard required to support a recovery model of care in the PICU. Research limitations/implications – The research findings highlight urgency for a National PICU/HDU clinical practice guideline. Practical implications A PICU/HDU practice guideline will promote the standard of nursing care required in the PICU/HDU. The PICU/HDU needs to be recognised as a patient centred, therapeutic opportunity as opposed to a restrictive and custodial clinical area. Social implications Providing transparency of practice in the PICU/HDU and educating nurses to this specialty area of care will improve client outcome and recovery.

The initial assessment of patients with chest pain, potentially due to AMI, includes a history and physical assessment, 12 -lead electrocardiograph (ECG) and measurement of biochemical markers such as CK, CK-MB, troponins, and myoglobin. The primary therapeutic goals of management for patients with AMI are to promptly restore perfusion to the myocardium and to prevent or limit myocardial cell death. Continuous mon-itoring of myocardial perfusion status is, therefore, {{an essential component of}} ongoing management for patients with AMI. Critical care nurses can have an important role in recognising and monitoring ischaemia. Traditionally, the 12 -lead electrocardiograph (ECG) has been used diagnostically to detect myocardial ischae-mia or infarction, manifested by changes in the ST-seg-ment andyor T-wave.

Design/methodology/approach – Two sets of the authors' own primary survey data were used: a group of randomly selected high school students in Shaanxi Province and a census of all freshmen entering into four universities in Sichuan, Anhui and Shaanxi. The intention was to show if the rate of the rural poor attending universities is lower than that of urban students and that of rural non-poor; also to identify the barriers to education (if they exist) that are keeping enrollment rates low for the rural poor. The authors used ordinary least squares method to make the estimations.

40|$|In New Zealand many {{adolescents}} {{in need of}} acute mental health care are admitted to adult mental health units. This situation results in mental health nurses working in the inpatient setting, working with increasing numbers of adolescent patients. Nurses are therefore often presented {{with the challenge of}} how to meet, and address, the specialised health needs of this particular group of health consumers. Nurses whose experience lies in adult mental health and who are not accustomed to nursing adolescents, may easily become frustrated or bewildered by the adolescent patient. Adolescent behaviour can be misinterpreted by nurses, and their physical appearances can misguide nurses into treating them either like a child or an adult. These misconceptions can often {{have a negative effect on}} the adolescent patient, and may impinge on their mental health as well as affecting their developmental growth. This research paper reports on an exploration of the key elements nurses need to be aware of to effectively nurse {{adolescents in}} an adult inpatient unit. It describes the developmental needs and significant influences that affect this age-group, that when incorporated into nursing care, nurses can gain a therapeutic relationship with the adolescent. By means of a literature review, sharing my experience in nursing adolescents and through vignettes of practice, an illustration of some common situations that may occur during the adolescent's inpatient stay are described. These situations are explored and a perspective is offered on how nurses may be effective in their nursing of an adolescent patient from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> through to discharge. More research is needed on adolescent mental health nursing, however nurses will be able to use this report as a helpful resource in their current practice...|$|E
40|$|The Australian Pharmaceutical Advisory Committee {{guidelines}} {{call for}} a detailed medication history to be taken at the first <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> to an Emergency Department (ED). The elderly, in particular those residing in Residential Aged Care Facilities and those with a non-English speaking background, {{have been identified as}} patient groups vulnerable to medication misadventure. Objective: to analyse the incidence of discrepancies in medication histories in these demographic groups when pharmacist elicited medication histories were compared with those taken by ED physicians. It also aimed to investigate the incidence of medication related ED presentations. Methods: The study was conducted over a six week period and included 100 patients over the age of 70, who take five or more regular medications, have three or more clinical co-morbidities and/or have been discharged from hospital in three months prior to the study. Results: Twenty four participants were classified as ‘language barrier’; 12 participants were from residential aged care facilities, and 64 participants were classified as ‘general’. The number of correctly recorded medications was lowest in the ‘language barrier’ group (13. 8 %) compared with 18 % and 19. 6 % of medications for ‘general’ patients and patients from residential aged care facilities respectively. Seven of the patients (29. 2 %) with ‘language barrier’; 1 from a residential aged care facility (8. 3 %) and 13 of the (20. 3 %) patients from the ‘general’ category were suspected as having a medication related ED presentation. Conclusion: This study further highlights the positive contribution an ED pharmacist can make to enhancing medication management along the continuum of care. This study also confirms the vulnerability of patients with language barrier to medication misadventure and their need for interpreter services at all stages of their hospitalisation, in particular at the point of ED presentation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{older person}} with {{dementia}} has a limited life expectancy and the dying trajectory can be protracted and unpredictable. For good end-of-life care, early communication, exploration of residents??? wishes, and identification {{of someone who}} can represent them, are important. In care homes the timing of these discussions, and who is involved is variable. Person-centred approaches to dementia care assume that people with dementia can actively participate in decisions about their lives. Less well understood is how this can inform end-of-life care decision making and complement information provided in advance care plans completed prior to, or at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> to a care home. Objectives: To explore how older people with dementia discuss their priorities and preferences for end-of-life care. Methods: An exploratory, qualitative study that used guided conversations with 18 people with dementia, living in six care homes. Participants were asked about their life in the care home, their health, thoughts for the future, and wishes surrounding end of life. Data were analysed thematically. Results: People with dementia's accounts {{of life in the}} care home, what they valued, and the impact of having dementia on how they participated in decision making, provided key insights into care preferences. Three linked themes that had relevance for thinking and talking about end of life were identified: ???dementia and decision making???, ???everyday relationships??? and ???place and purpose???. Older people with dementia's accounts of everyday experiences of care, key relationships with family and care home staff members and whether they accepted the care home as their home demonstrated what was important for them now and for the future. Conclusion: For older people living with a diagnosis of dementia, the experience of living and dying in a care home is inextricably linked. End-of-life care planning and decision making by health care professionals, care home staff and family could be enriched by exploring and documenting the preoccupations, key relationships and wishes about everyday care of people with dementi...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary role}} <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> control in Quality of Service enabled {{networks}} is {{to control the}} amount of traffic injected into the network so that congestion is avoided and certain performance requirements are met. We consider engineered and provisioned IP Differentiated Services networks able to support realtime traffic and we address the placement <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> control at the traffic aggregation <b>points</b> <b>of</b> the network, and the granularity <b>of</b> the <b>admission</b> control logic. Regarding the first issue, we show that sophisticated admission control schemes that take into account statistical multiplexing gains need only be employed at the first traffic aggregation points. Further downstream, peak rate admission control will suffice. With respect to the second issue, we propose a framework for admission control, which involves a combined approach of traffic descriptor and measurement–based techniques. 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT First-generation college {{students}} earn college {{degrees in the}} United States at much lower rates when compared to non-first-generation {{college students}}. These students frequently face different challenges accessing and completing college degrees than those encountered by their peers with college-educated parents. A key challenge for {{institutions of higher education}} (IHE) is to develop effective policies, programs, and resources that support college completion among first generation college students. First-generation students are far from a homogenous group. Rather, they exist on a spectrum of familial experiences with higher education. For instance, important differences may exist between students who have a parent who did not complete high school and those that have some college, or even postsecondary graduate education experience. Students’ familiarity with higher education institutions and processes, as well as their social networks and family resources greatly influences first-generation college students’ success in college. Yet, typically, first-generation college students are broadly defined as students whose parents did not earn a college degree. This definition fails to acknowledge potentially meaningful differences in student backgrounds. Moving forward, developing definitions for first-generation college students that more clearly describe their parents’ educational backgrounds holds promise for improving higher education institutions’ abilities to better align their support efforts with student needs. This study takes first steps to explore the application of alternative ways of defining first-generation college students, as well as understanding how IHEs currently identify first-generation college students at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> and track students once they matriculate. Specifically, in this dissertation I developed a typology of possible definitions for identifying first-generation college students. Subsequently, I conducted a national survey of public, four-year, baccalaureate degree-granting IHEs where I applied this typology to better understand institutional policies and practices for identifying and tracking first-generation college students. The study’s findings show that IHEs tend to adopt one of two general definitions for first-generation college student. The first definition {{does not take into account}} whether or not students’ parents participated in higher education, while the second lumps together students with and without parents with any exposure to college, but without a college degree. The processes and IHE administrative offices used to track first-generation college students from matriculation to graduation is institutional specific and not uniform across IHEs. The analysis shows that many IHEs are trying to identify and support first-generation college students. However, differences in definitions used by institutions poses challenges for the field, at large, in its efforts to understand the needs of this group of students, as well as makes it difficult for institutions to align supports and services with student needs. Taken together, this exploratory study raises important questions for policymakers and educational leaders who are interested in expanding college access and success for first-generation college students...|$|R
