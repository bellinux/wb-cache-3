In his annual budget address on October 13, 2010, Daley projected a deficit for 2010 of $655 million, the largest in city history.

25|$|The {{size of the}} 10c {{piece was}} too close to that of the dollar - in fact, it was so close that it was {{possible}} to put two 10c pieces in a <b>parking</b> <b>meter</b> together and receive $1 worth of parking time, or jam the meter and make parking free anyway. The advent of pay & display metering in larger cities, whereby one is required to use another meter if the first one is jammed, has largely stopped this practice.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June 1969 in Greenwich Village, New York, the New York City police raided a gay bar, {{a routine}} {{practice}} at the time. The establishment, the Stonewall Inn, was a well known LGBT establishment located on Christopher Street. The bar {{was made up of}} two former horse stables which had been renovated into one building in 1930. Like all gay bars of the era, it was subject to countless police raids, as LGBT activities and fraternization were still largely illegal. But this time, when the police began arresting patrons, the customers began pelting them with coins, and later, bottles and rocks. The lesbian and gay crowd also freed staff members who had been put into police vans, and the outnumbered officers retreated inside the bar. Soon, the Tactical Patrol Force (TPF), originally trained to deal with war protests, were called in to control the mob, which was now using a <b>parking</b> <b>meter</b> as a battering ram. As the patrol force advanced, the crowd did not disperse, but instead doubled back and re-formed behind the riot police, throwing rocks, shouting “Gay Power!”, dancing, and taunting their opposition. For the next several nights, the crowd would return in ever increasing numbers, handing out leaflets and rallying themselves. In early July, {{due in large part to}} the riots in June, discussions in the gay community lead to the formation of the Gay Liberation Front. Soon the word “Stonewall” came to represent fighting for equality in the gay community. And in commemoration, Gay Pride marches are held every year on the anniversary of the riot.|$|E

Robert Douglas compared the piece to Chicken Shack by Archibald Motley, stating [...] "both artists have fulfilled the mission of celebrating black life."

40|$|Cars {{are a great}} modern convenience, but {{the number}} of car owners has grown {{exponentially}} {{in the past couple of}} decades. In busy cities, it is almost impossible to find temporary parking and people often take advantage of the current <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> knowing that there will be a slim chance of being penalized for their actions. This project aims to alleviate this problem by developing a system that will allow the authorities to effectively and efficiently monitor the parking resources within a city.

In 2008, as Chicago struggled to close a growing budget deficit, the city agreed to a 75-year, $1.16 billion deal to lease its <b>parking</b> <b>meter</b> system to an operating company created by Morgan Stanley. Daley said the [...] "agreement is very good news for the taxpayers of Chicago because it will provide more than $1 billion in net proceeds that can be used during this very difficult economy." [...] The agreement quadrupled rates, in the first year alone, while the hours which people have to pay for parking were broadened from 9 a.m. – 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. – 9 p.m., and from Monday through Saturday to every day of the week. Additionally, the city agreed to compensate the new owners for loss of revenue any time any road with parking meters is closed by the city for anything from maintenance work to street festivals.
