40|$|In the Congo Basin {{where most}} timber species are light-demanding, the low logging intensities {{commonly}} implemented (1 - 2 trees harvested ha? 1) {{do not provide}} sufficient canopy gaps to ensure species regeneration. The regeneration of light-demanding timber species may therefore benefit from more intensive logging, or from post-harvest treatments such as thinning by <b>poison</b> <b>girdling</b> that increases light penetration. Little is known {{of the impact of}} post-harvest treatments on the floristic composition of tropical moist forests. This study therefore aimed to assess the effects of low and high selective logging (? 2. 33 and 4. 73 trees harvested ha? 1, and ? 4. 96 and 9. 16 m 2 ha? 1 of basal area removed (logging + damage), respectively) - followed or not by thinning (? 21. 14 trees thinned ha? 1, and ? 6. 57 m 2 ha? 1 of basal area removed) - on the floristic composition of a tropical moist forest in the Central African Republic, from 7 to 23 years after logging. We analyzed abundance data for 110 tree genera recorded every year for 14 years in 25 one-hectare permanent subplots. We used multivariate analysis to detect floristic variations between treatments and we assessed changes in floristic composition throughout the period. We compared floristic composition recovery between thinned and unthinned subplots, using unlogged subplots as a reference characterizing the pre-logging floristic composition. Logging and thinning had little impact on the floristic composition of the subplots as quantified 7 to 23 years later, though they did increase the proportion of pioneer species. Surprisingly, additional thinning at both logging levels failed to further distance floristic composition from that of the unlogged subplots, though it did increase disturbance intensity. Floristic composition recovery appeared to be facilitated when thinning was associated with logging. Thinning seemed to favor the growth and survival of non-pioneer species, to the detriment of pioneer species. These non-pioneer species could either be non-pioneer light demanders or shade-bearers. One explanation for this is that thinning by tree-poison girdling increased light availability without causing major damage to the forest, and thus increased the growth and survival of advance regeneration. The resulting enhanced competition then reduced the survival of pioneer species. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Stump removal {{was found}} to {{significantly}} reduce killing by Fomes annosus in second rotation crops of pine. <b>Poisoning</b> and <b>girdling</b> of trees prior to felling and also stump poisoning failed to control the disease. In this experiment {{no significant differences were}} detected in the susceptibility of Scots and Corsican pine to attack. Increasing periods of delay before replanting resulted in less mortality. An equation is presented, based on factors of the first rotation crop which may be used to predict losses likely to occur when a site is replanted. Root attack by F. annosus results in reduced growth and yield as well as mortality. The results from the experiment are discussed in terms of the management of pine crops attacked by F. annosus in Thetford Chase...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the sawing properties of triclopyr poisoned rasamala logs compared to the girdled and normal ones. The effect of sawing pattern on sawing properties were also observed. The log samples used in this experiment comprise of 18 pieces which were collected from three different groups of tree (<b>poisoned</b> and <b>girdled</b> in one year periode, and control). Six logs of each group were sawn in two sawing patterns, namely live sawing and semi-quarter sawing. Parameters of sawing observed include recovery, productivity, power con- sumption, and sawn timber defects, particulary splits and bowing. The results of study revealed that moisture content of poisoned logs was 20 % lower than the normal one. Mean-while, both moisture content of <b>girdled</b> logs and <b>poisoned</b> ones are not significantly diferent. Poisoning treatment on rasamala trees in comparison to girdled and normal ones did not show significant difference in any sawing properties, except sawing productivity. The sawing recovery, power consumption, splits and bowing of sawn timber were 62 %; 32. 37 watt sec. /cm 2, 5. 21 cm and 3. 91 cm, respectively. The live sawing could increase the pro- ductivity as much as 0. 18 m 3 /hour higher than semi-quarter sawing...|$|R
