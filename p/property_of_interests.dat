We propose an {{approach}} to subgroup discovery using distri-bution rules (a kind of association rules with a probability distribution on the consequent) for numerical <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The objective inter-est of the subgroups is measured through statistical goodness of fit tests.

40|$|Although {{there is}} {{extensive}} literature in software defect prediction techniques, {{machine learning approaches}} {{have yet to be}} fully explored and in particular, Subgroup Discovery (SD) techniques. SD algorithms aim to find subgroups of data that are statistically different given a <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> [1, 2]. SD lies between predictive (finding rules given historical data and a <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest)</b> and descriptive tasks (discovering interesting patterns in data). An important difference with classification tasks is that the SD algorithms only focus on finding subgroups (e. g., inducing rules) for the <b>property</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and do not necessarily describe all instances in the dataset. In this preliminary study, we have compared two well-known algorithms, the Subgroup Discovery algorithm [3] and CN 2 -SD algorithm [4], by applying them to several datasets from the publicly available PROMISE repository [5], as well as the Bug Prediction Dataset created by D’Ambros et al.
