The main character is Batman (Roger Craig Smith), a superhero trained to the peak of human physical perfection and an expert in martial arts who is aided by his butler, Alfred Pennyworth (Martin Jarvis).

The most powerful man in the city and ruler of Gotham's criminal underworld, Black Mask has vast wealth and resources, has eliminated his opposition and is consolidating his power. His ebony mask conceals his identity, allowing him to operate publicly as Roman Sionis (head of Janus Cosmetics). Black Mask has a bounty on Batman, which attracts eight accomplished assassins: the physically compelling Bane (JB Blanc); expert marksman Deadshot; veteran mercenary Deathstroke (Mark Rolston); [...] poisonous contortionist Copperhead (Rosa Salazar); the <b>pyromaniac</b> Firefly (Crispin Freeman); the highly charged Electrocutioner (Steven Blum); deformed criminal Killer Croc (Khary Payton), and master martial artist Shiva (Kelly Hu).|$|E

5000|$|Pyromania {{was thought}} in the 1800s to be a concept {{involved}} with moral insanity and moral treatment, but had not been categorized under impulse control disorders. Pyromania {{is one of the}} four recognized types of arson: for profit, to cover up an act of crime, for revenge, and pyromania. Pyromania is the second most common type of arson. Common synonyms for <b>pyromaniacs</b> in colloquial English include firebug (US) and fire raiser (UK), but these also refer to arsonists. Pyromania is a rare disorder with an incidence of less than one percent in most studies; also, <b>pyromaniacs</b> hold a very small proportion of psychiatric hospital admissions [...] Pyromania can occur in children as young as age three, though such cases are rare. Only a small percentage of children and teenagers arrested for arson are child <b>pyromaniacs.</b> A preponderance of the individuals are male; one source states that ninety percent of those diagnosed with pyromania are male. Based on a survey of 9,282 Americans using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, impulse-control problems such as gambling, pyromania and compulsive shopping collectively affect 9% of the population [...] A 1979 study by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration found that only 14% of fires were started by <b>pyromaniacs</b> and others with mental illness [...] A 1951 study by Lewis and Yarnell, one of the largest epidemiological studies conducted, found that 39% of those who had intentionally set fires had been diagnosed with pyromania.|$|R

2500|$|In 1984, Toole {{confessed to}} two unsolved {{northwest}} Florida slayings, {{including one of}} the I-10 murders. During an interview, he admitted to killing 18-year-old David Schallart, a hitchhiker he picked up east of Pensacola. Schallart's body, bearing five gunshot wounds in {{the left side of}} the head, was found on February 6, 1980, approximately [...] off I-10's eastbound lane, [...] east of Chipley. The second confession involved the death of 20-year-old Ada Johnson. Toole confessed that he shot her in the head on a road outside of Fort Walton Beach after kidnapping her at gunpoint at a Tallahassee nightclub. Psychiatrists Dr. Urbina and Dr. Sanches testified at Toole's 1984 Florida Supreme Court appeal that he was extremely impulsive and exhibited antisocial behavior as a result of a personality disorder and that he was a <b>pyromaniac.</b> The court found sufficient evidence that Toole was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually however, Undertaker {{lost his}} {{patience}} {{and refused to}} allow Bearer to manage him any longer, leading to Bearer's exposure of the secret. At the time, Undertaker denied charges of committing the arson/murder, claiming his younger half-brother, a <b>pyromaniac,</b> was the culprit and due to the incident couldn't possibly even be alive (it's {{important to note that}} approximately {{a year and a half}} later from this point, during the latter part of 1998, Undertaker exposes himself as dishonest by shamelessly confessing to committing the arson/murder, shortly prior to his 1999 heel turn as the dark priest of The Ministry of Darkness and regarded his brother the weakest). Bearer accused The Undertaker of not only being a [...] "murderer", but a [...] "liar" [...] while The Undertaker denied the charges. The Undertaker thought his younger half-brother, Bearer's illegitimate son, had been dead for years, that is, until Bearer introduced Kane at [...] on October 5, 1997, costing The Undertaker the victory in the first-ever Hell in a Cell match against Shawn Michaels. In keeping with the notion that Kane had been scarred by the fire—and to conceal Jacobs' identity—the character wore a mask, sported long hair, and wore red and black ring attire that almost covered his entire body.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1997, Paul Bearer {{attempted}} to rejoin The Undertaker, using the ultimatum of revealing The Undertaker's [...] "deepest, darkest secret" [...] to the world. Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family funeral home business {{when he was}} a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to having proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though horribly scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire all the way into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a <b>pyromaniac,</b> had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was actually his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family. It was during this time that The Undertaker also made an appearance in Michinoku Pro Wrestling, defeating Hakushi in a singles match.|$|E

2500|$|From April 1997, the WWF [...] "slowly and meticulously" [...] {{built to}} {{the debut of}} Jacobs's new character. At , The Undertaker {{launched}} a fireball {{into the face of}} former manager, Paul Bearer, who had unsuccessfully attempted to assist his protege, Mankind to victory in their WWF Championship match. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Mankind reintroduced Bearer, whose face was heavily bandaged due to the burns The Undertaker had inflicted. The injury prompted Bearer to attempt to reunite with Undertaker after a long period of mutual hostility, using the ultimatum of revealing The Undertaker's [...] "biggest secret". During the cryptic interview, Bearer likened the fire that had burned his face to a fire that had occurred during The Undertaker's childhood. When Undertaker continually refused to once again align with Bearer, Bearer began tormenting him by telling him that his long-lost brother, Kane (later revealed as Bearer's son and the Undertaker's half-brother), was coming to the WWF to challenge him. In the ensuing months, Bearer implied that The Undertaker had accidentally killed his family by starting a fire at their funeral home, with the exception of Kane, who was left physically and mentally scarred by the event. Undertaker claimed that Kane, a <b>pyromaniac,</b> was the one who started the fire and could not possibly have survived (however, this was exposed as a falsehood in October 1998 when Undertaker confessed to burning down the home, shortly prior to his 1999 gimmick as the [...] "dark priest" [...] of The Ministry of Darkness).|$|E

I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with...

I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing.

50|$|Pyromania is {{an impulse}} control {{disorder}} {{in which individuals}} repeatedly fail to resist impulses to deliberately start fires, in order to relieve tension or for instant gratification.
