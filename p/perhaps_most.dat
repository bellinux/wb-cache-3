5|$|A {{variety of}} groups ranging from {{government}} institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson's {{life and work}} since her death. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> significantly, on June 9, 1980, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17¢ Great Americans series postage stamp was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued Carson postage as well.|$|E
5|$|Domitian firmly {{believed}} in the traditional Roman religion, and personally {{saw to it that}} ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter, <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small chapel dedicated to Jupiter Conservator was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to Jupiter Custos.|$|E

5|$|Eggleston {{published}} {{a total of}} 17 books throughout his life; these included seven on Canadian history, five on its politics and three personal memoirs. He further published poetry anthologies in 1927, and again in 1978 with his wife Magdalena Raškevičiutė, herself a noted Lithuanian-Canadian author, to commemorate their fiftieth wedding anniversary. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> notable of their children was classical pianist and composer Anne Eggleston (1934– 1994), who through her association with The Royal Conservatory of Music became a distinguished contemporary of figures including Robert Fleming, John Weinzweig, Oskar Morawetz and Godfrey Ridout.|$|E
5|$|In British service, the Westland Sea King {{provided}} {{a wide range}} of services in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. As well as wartime roles in the Falklands War, the Gulf War, the Balkans conflict, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War, the Sea King is <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> well known in its capacity as a Royal Navy Search and Rescue (red and grey livery) and RAF Search and Rescue Force (yellow livery) helicopter. The Sea King was also adapted to meet the Royal Navy's requirement for a ship-based airborne early warning platform.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006 {{the book}} Game of Shadows, written by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, was {{released}} amid {{a storm of}} media publicity including the cover of Sports Illustrated. Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of Sports Illustrated. The book alleges Bonds used stanozolol {{and a host of}} other steroids, and is <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds's steroid use.|$|E

5|$|Jarre {{was raised}} in Lyon by his mother and grandparents, and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was {{introduced}} {{to a variety of}} art forms, including those of street performers, jazz musicians, and the artist Pierre Soulages. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus is <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> {{distinctive}} for its skull ornamentation, {{including the}} swollen and fused nasals and the frontal horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures {{are likely to}} {{have played a role in}} intraspecific competition, although their exact function within that context is unknown. The hollow cavity inside the frontal horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the ornamentation of Majungasaurus individuals, there is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Other accomplishments during Brittain's {{administration}} {{included a}} doubling of Georgia Tech's enrollment, the first ROTC unit in the Southern United States, accreditation for the Institute by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, {{and the creation of}} a new ceramic engineering department, building, and major that attracted the American Ceramics Society's national convention to Atlanta. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> significantly, Brittain is attributed with providing the vision and securing the finances to move Georgia Tech away from its roots as a teaching-oriented trade school and towards a new focus on science and technology research.|$|E

5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> important, the Analytical Review {{provided}} {{a forum for}} radical political and religious ideas. Although it aimed at impartiality, its articles were often critical of the British government and supportive of the French revolutionaries. While the journal had low circulation numbers for its day, it still influenced popular opinion and was feared by the conservative government of William Pitt the Younger. In late 1797, the Anti-Jacobin, the self-styled nemesis of the Analytical Review, was founded by supporters {{of the government and}} other reactionary interests; it criticized the radical politics of the Analytical and monitored it for unpatriotic and irreligious sentiments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> importantly, Pinckney's Treaty granted both Spanish and American ships {{unrestricted}} navigation rights {{along the}} entire Mississippi River, as well as duty-free transport for American ships through the Spanish port of New Orleans, opening much of the Ohio River basin for settlement and trade. Agricultural produce could now flow on flatboats down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and on to New Orleans and Europe. Spain and the United States further agreed to protect the vessels of the other party anywhere within their jurisdictions and to not detain or embargo the other's citizens or vessels.|$|E
5|$|Siward is <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> {{famous for}} his {{expedition}} in 1054 against Macbeth, King of Scotland, an expedition that cost Siward his eldest son, Osbjorn. The origin of Siward's conflict with the Scots is unclear. According to the Libellus de Exordio, in 1039 or 1040, the Scottish king Donnchad mac Crínáin attacked northern Northumbria and besieged Durham. Within a year, Mac Bethad had deposed and killed Donnchad. The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh, and though no {{connection between the two}} events is clear it is likely that they were linked.|$|E

5|$|The Bonville-Courtenay feud {{is often}} given {{as an example}} of the degree to which law and order and respect for the king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often {{considered}} it a cause of the later Wars of the Roses; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> well known for culminating in an armed encounter at Clyst (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near Exeter, which resulted in loss of life.|$|E
5|$|The Magdeburg class {{introduced}} several {{significant improvements}} over earlier designs, including {{a more effective}} bow shape that improved seakeeping and a cut-down quarterdeck that allowed for more efficient handling of the ships' mines. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> importantly, a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive capabilities of the new ships. They also had much more powerful turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations.|$|E
5|$|The name of Zobel is, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>most</b> {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E

5|$|The {{significance}} of the events at Beaumont-Hamel {{on the first day}} of the Battle of the Somme was <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> strongly felt by the Dominion of Newfoundland, as it was the first great conflict experienced by that dominion. Newfoundland was left with a sense of loss that marked an entire generation. The effects on the post-war generation were compounded by chronic financial problems caused both by Newfoundland's large debt from the war, and a prolonged post-war economic recession due to a decline in the fisheries.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} Saint Lucia Jazz Festival that is a major attraction, and a {{well-known}} part of the local music scene.

5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had left behind a team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players were good, but unsuited to the single-wing offense that his predecessor had employed. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> importantly, Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy wrote that he considered the 1940 Stanford backfield—quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic—as the greatest in history. While he believed the Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the caveat that this held true only in the Stanford players' employment in the T-formation.|$|E
