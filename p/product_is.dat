5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final <b>product</b> <b>is</b> served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the <b>product</b> <b>is</b> served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the <b>product</b> <b>is</b> heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated <b>product</b> <b>is</b> then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be {{produced}} by oxidising the ephedrine analogue 4-methylephedrine using potassium permanganate dissolved in sulfuric acid.
