25|$|In RTOG {{clinical}} trial 0129, {{in which all}} patients with advanced disease received radiation and chemotherapy, a retrospective analysis (recursive-partitioning analysis, or RPA) at three years identified three risk groups for survival (low, intermediate, and high) based on HPV status, smoking, T stage and N stage (see Ang et al., Fig. 2). HPV status was the major determinant of survival, followed by smoking history and stage. 64% were HPV+ and all were in the low and intermediate risk group, with all non-smoking HPV+ patients in the low risk group. 82% of the HPV+ patients were alive at three years compared to 57% of the HPV- patients, a 58% reduction {{in the risk of}} death. Locoregional failure is also lower in HPV+, being 14% compared to 35% for HPV-. HPV positivity confers a 50–60% lower risk of disease progression and death, but the use of tobacco is an independently negative prognostic factor. A pooled analysis of HPV+OPC and HPV-OPC patients with disease progression in RTOG trials 0129 and 0522 showed that although less HPV+OPC experienced disease progression (23 v. 40%), the median time to disease progression following treatment was similar (8 months). The majority (65%) of recurrences in both groups occurred within the first year after treatment and were locoregional. HPV+ did not reduce the rate of metastases (about 45% of patients experiencing progression), which are predominantly to the lungs (70%), although some studies have reported a lower rate. with 3-year distant recurrence rates of about 10% for patients treated with <b>primary</b> <b>radiation</b> or chemoradiation. Even if recurrence or metastases occur, HPV positivity still confers an advantage.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is {{developed for the}} investigations and numerical calculations of primary radiation-induced point defect production in graphite collimator material for LHC due to formation of secondary fast particles in different nuclear reaction channels during irradiation of this material with the 450 GeV protons. On the basis of calculated elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections of neutrons on carbon atoms from the database ENDF-VII (neutron energies up to 150 MeV) and the data obtained using FLUKA, (neutron energy over 150 MeV) the numerical calculations of generation rates for <b>primary</b> point <b>radiation</b> defects are made due to formation of secondary fast neutrons. It is shown that the greatest generation rate of point radiation defects in graphite materials is determined by secondary pions with the generation rate of point defect formation {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the production rates of point defects due to secondary fast neutrons and other fast secondary particles. So the generation rate of <b>primary</b> point <b>radiation</b> defects in the interaction of pions and electrons with graphite collimator materials of LHC are comparable in order of magnitude (0. 004 dpa/s per bunch) for each type of secondary particles. The contribution of secondary electrons and pions in the generation rate of <b>primary</b> point <b>radiation</b> defect formation is higher comparing with the contribution of secondary neutrons and protons and this val ue is varied from 5 to 10 times on average.

40|$|We {{consider}} the three-dimensional motion of a massless particle {{in a regular}} polygon formation of N primary bodies, {{one of which is}} located at the system's center of mass. Assuming that the central <b>primary</b> is a <b>radiation</b> source, we apply the simplified theory suggested by Radzievskii, in order to study the effect of radiation pressure in the three-dimensional dynamics of the system. We particularly study the evolution of the zero-velocity surfaces for various values of the radiation coefficient b 0 and investigate also the cases with b 0 > 1 (that is, radiation surpasses gravity) since for these cases, significant changes in the dynamics occur. We then locate numerically the onset of three-dimensional periodic motion from planar periodic motion by calculating the orbits' vertical critical stability. Many families of three-dimensional periodic motions are presented and the regions of the three-dimensional space where these motions take place, are determined. We subsequently investigate how the bifurcations from planar to three-dimensional periodic orbits are affected by the increase of the <b>primary's</b> <b>radiation</b> coefficient and how the overall dynamics of the system is affected by the value of the primaries' number N. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company...|$|R

50|$|To {{get around}} the {{secondary}} electron generation, it will be imperative to use low-energy electrons as the <b>primary</b> <b>radiation</b> to expose resist. Ideally, these electrons should have energies {{on the order of}} not much more than several eV in order to expose the resist without generating any secondary electrons, since they will not have sufficient excess energy. Such exposure has been demonstrated using a scanning tunneling microscope as the electron beam source. The data suggest that electrons with energies as low as 12 eV can penetrate 50 nm thick polymer resist. The drawback to using low energy electrons is {{that it is hard to}} prevent spreading of the electron beam in the resist. Low energy electron optical systems are also hard to design for high resolution. Coulomb inter-electron repulsion always becomes more severe for lower electron energy.|$|E
50|$|The {{relatively}} small number of atomic absorption lines (compared to atomic emission lines) and their narrow width (a few pm) make spectral overlap rare; there are only few examples known that an absorption line from one element will overlap with another. Molecular absorption, in contrast, is much broader, so that {{it is more likely that}} some molecular absorption band will overlap with an atomic line. This kind of absorption might be caused by un-dissociated molecules of concomitant elements of the sample or by flame gases. We have to distinguish between the spectra of di-atomic molecules, which exhibit a pronounced fine structure, and those of larger (usually tri-atomic) molecules that don’t show such fine structure. Another source of background absorption, particularly in ET AAS, is scattering of the <b>primary</b> <b>radiation</b> at particles that are generated in the atomization stage, when the matrix could not be removed sufficiently in the pyrolysis stage.|$|E
50|$|In LS AAS {{the high}} {{resolution}} {{that is required}} for the measurement of atomic absorption is provided by the narrow line emission of the radiation source, and the monochromator simply has to resolve the analytical line from other radiation emitted by the lamp. This can usually be accomplished with a band pass between 0.2 and 2 nm, i.e., a medium-resolution monochromator. Another feature to make LS AAS element-specific is modulation of the <b>primary</b> <b>radiation</b> and the use of a selective amplifier that is tuned to the same modulation frequency, as already postulated by Alan Walsh. This way any (unmodulated) radiation emitted for example by the atomizer can be excluded, which is imperative for LS AAS. Simple monochromators of the Littrow or (better) the Czerny-Turner design are typically used for LS AAS. Photomultiplier tubes are the most frequently used detectors in LS AAS, although solid state detectors might be preferred because of their better signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
