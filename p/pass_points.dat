The winning bidder may also choose [...] "no trump", where aces are high and all jacks are treated as off-trump coloured jacks, i.e. beat a ten but lose to a queen. The minimum bid starts at three and subsequent bidders must out-bid the highest previous bid or <b>pass.</b> <b>Points</b> are scored for each trick taken, not merely by the contractor but by all players. The contractor is of course vulnerable however, and {{if he or she}} fails to take the number of tricks bidden, he or she loses that number of points. A player wishing to bid all eight tricks calls [...] "shooter", and if successful gains not eight but 12 points. Score is kept on paper and the game is played to 31. A player bidding less than eight and subsequently winning all eight tricks will only score eight points.|$|E

Multi-photo combined adjustment model of airborne SAR images is built. Multi-photo combined adjustment conditions {{are given in}} this paper. This method is applicable to multi-temporal, multi-side-looking-orientation, multiflight-height, multi-resolution SAR Images. Two adjustment experiments have been done with one-meter resolution airborne SAR images in Chengdu study site. In the two experiments, the GCPs and the <b>Pass</b> <b>Points</b> are distributed rationally in each image. The two experimental {{results show that the}} coordinate accuracy of <b>Pass</b> <b>Points</b> is feasible for 1 : 10 000 scale ortho-image making and topographic map updating. There are four images in the first experiment, and nine GCPs and ten <b>Pass</b> <b>Points</b> are used.

Unlike previous incarnations ofhacking, current attacks on computer systems areprofessionally coordinated, multifaceted, and motivated by thepromise of profits on a massive scale. With millions of newelectronic devices connecting to the internet every day, hackersare increasingly focused on {{a new type of}} target: mobile andembedded systems. Such systems include point-of-saleterminals, wireless routers, smart phones, networked officemachines such as printers, and even the utility infrastructure. <b>Pass</b> <b>points</b> scheme is one of the techniques used inAuthentication using Graphical Images. In this method, usersclick on images rather than typing a long and complexalphanumeric password with the computer keyboard. Psychological studies have shown that people can rememberpictures better than text. During the time of registration a usermay choose several areas (click points) on an image. In order tolog in the user has to click close to the chosen click points, e. g. within 0. 25 cm to 0. 50 cm from the click point, because userscannot click exactly on the same pixel on which they haveclicked at the time of registration. This margin of error aroundthe click point is called Tolerance. Existing <b>Pass</b> <b>points</b> schemeuses a fixed tolerance (say 20 X 20 pixels) over a number ofclicks by the user. But by varying the tolerance (i. e.,decrementing the tolerance level) as users click on more points,the information left to an attacker is reduced. We have alsointroduced multiple graphical passwords approach to countershoulder surfing attack. Cutting-edge hackers are acutelyaware that many of the security procedures and applications inuse today have been designed for PC workstations, and arethus unable to thwart attacks on mobile and embedded systems.

40|$|Digital photogrammetric systems, such as softcopy stereo workstations, are {{beginning}} to replace analytical plotters for the extraction of cartographic data. They should {{not be viewed as}} mere upgrades, however; their potential lies in increased automation and providing added value by expanding the domain of applications and products beyond regular mapping. This dissertation explores the development of automated tools for model setup and mensuration on such systems, specifically pass point selection and matching for use in aerotriangulation, and refinement of automatically produced digital elevation models (DEM 2 ̆ 7 s). The goal is to maximize the potential for success of the automated tools by maintaining operator involvement for high-level tasks. ^ Digital image matching and automated blunder detection techniques, which are crucial for automating photogrammetric processes, are reviewed. An algorithm for automatically selecting and matching conjugate <b>pass</b> <b>points</b> is developed. The human operator selects areas of high information content, and an interest operator is used to choose candidate <b>pass</b> <b>points.</b> An adaptive area-based hierarchical correlation algorithm with optional least squares matching refinement is employed to locate the conjugate points. A subset of these points is selected and used in a relative orientation employing automated blunder detection to remove any previously undetected mismatches. Testing {{of a wide variety of}} interest operators, matching variations, and blunder detection methods is performed to refine the algorithm. The high quality and robustness of the final version is ascertained by tests on an extensive set of real image pairs and triplets. ^ Orthophotos made from the left and right images of a stereopair will exhibit differences at locations where the DEM is in error. These mismatches are determined with adaptive area-based matching and converted to elevation corrections, which are applied to the DEM to improve its quality. Since the procedure is inexact, it is by necessity iterative. The algorithm is tested on a number of real image pairs, and its performance is evaluated by comparison with manually measured DEM 2 ̆ 7 s. In most cases, a reduction in the magnitude of error in the DEM 2 ̆ 7 s, and thus the time required for manual editing, is noted. ...|$|E
40|$|Existence and {{regularity}} of minimizers in elliptic free boundary {{problems have}} been extensively studied in the literature. We initiate the corresponding study of higher critical points by considering a superlinear free boundary problem related to plasma confinement. The associated energy functional is nondifferentiable, and therefore standard variational methods cannot be used directly to prove the existence of critical points. Here we obtain a nontrivial generalized solution $u$ of mountain pass type as the limit of mountain <b>pass</b> <b>points</b> of a suitable sequence of $C^ 1 $-functionals approximating the energy. We show that $u$ minimizes the energy on the associated Nehari manifold and use this fact {{to prove that it}} is nondegenerate. We use the nondegeneracy of $u$ to show that it satisfies the free boundary condition in the viscosity sense. Moreover, near any free boundary point that has a measure-theoretic normal, the free boundary is a smooth surface, and hence the free boundary condition holds in the classical sense.

A pair of black-and-white aerial photographs of a city, taken at a scale of 1 : 8000, was selected and scanned at a resolution of 25 pm. Eighteen image points were measured with the ISDM module of an Intergraph digital photogrammetric workstation (DPW), and the bundle adjustment of a single model was performed using WuCAPS scps (Wuhan GPS supported bundle block adjustment software). In processing various PEG compressed images with Q-factors from 1 to 100, {{the accuracy of the}} 30 coordinates of the <b>pass</b> <b>points</b> was assessed and compared with that obtained from the original images (i. e., without compression). The empirical results show that, when the compression ratios are under 10, the compressed image is near-lossless.

However, no indication can be found from the results that a compression of 10 is the critical value or the optimum compression level for PPD.

Control points and <b>pass</b> <b>points</b> were marked on glass plates made from B&W copy negatives of IR color transparencies. A wild PUG- 3 and TA 1 /p monocomparator {{were used to}} mark and measure the points on the glass plates. Each plate was measured twice in the same orientation for a check on accuracy and operator error. The 22 photographs were adjusted to 41 ground control and tie points and the block adjustment was performed in a secant plane coordinate system to eliminate the effect of earth curvature. Standard deviations of the residuals of the control and tie points were 12. 8 m, 10. 8 m, and 4. 5 m for the X, Y, and Z coordinates respectively. The 12. 8 m and 10. 8 m figures correspond to an identification accuracy of 0. 1 mm on the U- 2 RC- 10 plates. The standard deviations of the residuals encountered in the ERTS- 1 resectioning were: (1) 0. 16 mm assuming uncorrected perspective geometry and (2) 0. 12 mm when the polynomial adjustment was added in.

Users preferred Cued Click Points (CCP) to <b>Pass</b> <b>Points</b> selecting and remembering only one point per image was easier, and that seeing each image triggered their memory of where the corresponding point was located. Purely automated attacks against Pass Points-style graphical passwords is introduced and evaluated. For generating these attacks, a graph-based algorithm is developed to efficiently create dictionaries based on heuristics such as click-order patterns (e. g., five points all along a line). Some of methods combine click-order heuristics with focus-of-attention scan-paths generated from a computational model of visual attention, yielding significantly better automated attacks than previous work. One resulting automated attack finds 7 %- 16 % of passwords for two representative images using dictionaries of approximately 2 26 entries (where the full password space is 2 43). Relaxing click-order patterns substantially increased the attack efficacy albeit with larger dictionaries of approximately 2 35 entries, allowing attacks that guessed 48 %- 54 % of passwords (compared to previous results of 1 % and 9 % on the same dataset for two images with 2 35 guesses). These latter attacks are independent of focus-of-attention models, and are based on image-independent guessing patterns.

40|$|The Australian Geographic Reference Image (AGRI) is a {{national}} satellite image mosaic that covers the vast Australian continent. Formed from 9560 ALOS PRISM images, AGRI provides a spatially correct reference image at 2. 5 m resolution, with 1 -pixel accuracy. The production of AGRI was made feasible by {{the development and implementation}} of a long-strip adjustment technique that facilitated a refinement in the georeferencing process of orbit and attitude parameters for orbital segments comprising 50 or more images. The strip of images is effectively treated as a single image. The ground control requirements for such full-pass georeferencing, which does not require the measurement of tie or <b>pass</b> <b>points,</b> amount to only 4 – 8 GCPs for the complete strip rather than 4 or more per image within the strip. Once the adjusted orbit parameters are obtained, the georeferencing and orthorectification process can revert to a fully automatic image-by-image computation. This paper first overviews AGRI and then describes the longstrip adjustment technique that made its production possible. Testing and validation are then discussed via the example of the georeferencing of a 1527 km single strip of 55 PRISM images.
