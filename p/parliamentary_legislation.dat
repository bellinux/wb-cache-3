5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>legislation,</b> {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E

Known worldwide as a ‘federation sui generis’, India has the unique distinction {{of having a}} federal form of government with a strong unitary bias. This study analyses the sufficiency of the Indian Constitutional provisions and the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>legislations</b> in providing a comprehensive and lasting solution {{to the problems of}} interstate rivers in India. The basic philosophies behind the international water sharing laws have been analysed with a view to resolving the interstate water disputes in India. The Constitutional provisions relating to the Centre-state relations are discussed with special emphasis on the provisions relating to the water disputes. The relevant <b>parliamentary</b> <b>legislations</b> have been critically examined. Finally, an action plan has been suggested to resolve the conflicts pertaining to the interstate rivers in India.

5|$|Leading {{figures in}} the new Parliament {{included}} Lord Melville, a Rye House Plotter who joined William's court in 1683 and the Earl of Stair, {{a former member of}} James VII's administration. In 1689 Melville became Secretary of State over Scotland, with Stair appointed Lord Advocate. The first session ended in a stalemate between Crown and Parliament over the abolition of Episcopacy and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body used by the Scottish Crown to control legislation. Parliament refused to approve taxes or accept nominations for legal officers, closing the law courts. William retaliated by withholding Royal Assent which prevented the implementation of <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Boston Massacre, {{known as}} the Incident on King Street by the British, was an {{incident}} on March 5, 1770, in which British Army soldiers shot and killed people while under attack by a mob. The incident was heavily publicized by leading Patriots, such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, to encourage rebellion against the British authorities. British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 {{in order to protect}} and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>legislation.</b> Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and repeatedly hit by clubs, stones and snowballs. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident.|$|E
5|$|The year 1823 saw the {{founding}} of the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery (later the Anti-Slavery Society), and the publication of Wilberforce's 56-page Appeal to the Religion, Justice and Humanity of the Inhabitants of the British Empire in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies. In his treatise, Wilberforce urged that total emancipation was morally and ethically required, and that slavery was a national crime that must be ended by <b>parliamentary</b> <b>legislation</b> to gradually abolish slavery. Members of Parliament did not quickly agree, and government opposition in March 1823 stymied Wilberforce's call for abolition. On 15 May 1823, Buxton moved another resolution in Parliament for gradual emancipation. Subsequent debates followed on 16 March and 11 June 1824 in which Wilberforce made his last speeches in the Commons, and which again saw the emancipationists outmanoeuvred by the government.|$|E

25|$|After the {{war ended}} there was a {{discussion}} as to what Stavanger's two airports should be used for. A government proposition from 1947 called for Sola to be converted to a civilian airport and Forus to become a military air station. Parliament supported the notion on 12 December and granted NOK1 million for construction to start on 1 February 1948. However, the infrastructure at Forus was in worse condition than the authorities had anticipated. In violation with the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>legislation,</b> the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Transport and Communications struck a deal on 22 May, whereby both the military and civilian operations would be located at Sola.

500|$|Military use of castles rapidly {{decreased}} over subsequent years, {{although some}} were adapted {{for use by}} garrisons in Scotland and key border locations {{for many years to}} come, including during the Second World War. Other castles were used as county gaols, until <b>parliamentary</b> <b>legislation</b> in the 19th closed most of them down. For a period in the early 18th century, castles were shunned in favour of Palladian architecture, until they re-emerged as an important cultural and social feature of England, Wales and Scotland and were frequently [...] "improved" [...] during the 18th and 19th centuries. Such renovations raised concerns over their protection so that today castles across the British Isles are safeguarded by legislation.

500|$|The appellants' primary {{argument}} was that legislation passed using the Parliament Act 1911 is delegated and therefore {{could not be}} used to amend the procedure of enactment. However, their Lordships disagreed with this claim {{on the basis of the}} clear language in the Act. Lord Bingham found that the phrase [...] "become an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified" [...] denoted primary legislation. [...] "The meaning of the expression 'Act of Parliament' is not doubtful, ambiguous or obscure ... It is used, and used only, to denote primary legislation ... The 1911 Act did, of course, effect an important constitutional change, but the change lay not in authorising a new form of sub-primary <b>parliamentary</b> <b>legislation</b> but in creating a new way of enacting primary legislation." [...] Lord Nicholls agreed that the 1911 Act provided [...] "a second, parallel route" [...] of making Acts of Parliament and that [...] "it would be inconsistent with [...] intention to interpret [...] as subject to an inherent, overarching limitation comparable to that applicable to delegated legislation." [...] Lord Steyn, Lord Hope and Lord Brown concurred in similar terms.|$|E

500|$|A major {{opponent}} {{representing the}} popular factions {{in the province}} was Elisha Cooke, Jr., a politician and major landowner in Maine, which was then part of Massachusetts. [...] Cooke's opposition was rooted in disagreements on the currency, and the matter of logging in the Maine territory. [...] During the Dudley administration logging interests had widely flouted the 1711 White Pine Act, British <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>legislation</b> that reserved large trees on ungranted public lands for the government's use as ship masts. Shute sought {{to crack down on}} this behavior, earning the enmity of Cooke and others. [...] Cooke's early challenges to the law were legal in nature, but rapidly became political. [...] In 1718 Cooke was nominated to serve on the Governor's Council by the assembly, but Shute vetoed the choice. [...] The assembly then appointed Cooke to be its speaker in 1720. [...] This began a constitutional argument about the governor's powers, for Shute refused to accept Cooke's appointment, claiming it was within his authority to veto it. [...] The assembly, for its part, refused to appoint anyone else, and the following year seated a different speaker before Shute was given notice of his election.|$|E

2500|$|The {{essential}} {{principles of}} English contract law, however, remained stable and familiar, as an offer for certain terms, mirrored by an acceptance, supported by consideration, and free from duress, undue influence or misrepresentation, would generally be enforceable. The rules were codified and exported across the British Empire, as {{for example in}} the Indian Contract Act 1872. Further requirements of fairness in exchanges between unequal parties, or general obligations of good faith and disclosure {{were said to be}} unwarranted because it was urged by the courts that liabilities [...] "are not to be forced upon people behind their backs". <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>legislation,</b> outside general codifications of commercial law like the Sale of Goods Act 1893, similarly left people to the harsh realities of the market and [...] "freedom of contract".

Apesar da propriedade sobre os africanos importados desde 1831 ser aceita em transações comerciais e ser garantida pelo governo, o receio demonstrado pelos senhores de escravos em petições e as justificativas apresentadas no debate do projeto da lei de 1871 indicam que ela era considerada instável.

Despite the fact that successive governments guaranteed slave property and that it served as legal in commercial transactions, the fears demonstrated by slaveowners in petitions and the arguments presented in the debate of the Free Womb bill in 1871 indicate that property over the Africans imported since 1831 was considered unstable.
