Five samples were taken from each of the following sources: Benue Brewery Limited (point source); Benue Links Limited (heavy concentration of people) non- point source; Makurdi Abattoir (point source); Makurdi water works, non-point source; Wadata (heavy concentration of people) non-point source. The process of field sampling, laboratory analysis and regression modeling of flow depth and pollution concentration revealed the following: Pollution in River Benue is influenced by natural regimes such as rainfall and discharges; <b>physical</b> and chemical <b>pollutions</b> increased with rainfall while microbial pollution is inversely proportional to rainfall. Microbial pollution of the river is more severe than <b>physical</b> and chemical <b>pollution</b> and has more effect on public health.

Combined effects of noise and of other <b>physical</b> <b>pollutions</b> on people may cause amplification of their negative impact. If the noise pollution level from the object in a residential area exceeds the permissible levels (MPL), noise protection measures can be initiated. Today, the most common design decisions for noise protection are sound absorbing construction, noise screens and barriers, acousting housings, soundproff cabins.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{questions}} arise {{when trying to}} estimate {{the interaction between the}} geological environment and the infrastructure of urban areas. This interaction is very complicated in terms of the various interrelations and complexities. On the other hand, other specialists, whose fields of interest are quite distant, need this kind of information. Consequently, the estimation of the engineering geological conditions of urban areas by traditional components of the geological environment: geological structure, relief, hydrogeological conditions, geotechnical parameters of soil as well as geological phenomena and processes, would be incomplete. It is also necessary to present information about an area’s historical development, chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>pollution</b> peculiarities, technological load intensity, groundwater protection and stability of soils. Our experience in the research of urban areas in Lithuania has enabled us to build up a complex geological and infrastructure based environmental investigation scheme. The composite parts of the investigations are presented in the scheme.

Finally, the division of areas (based not only on the geological information but also on the infrastructure load influence) was used to evaluate the urban areas and to forecast a dynamic area development...|$|E

Turbidity, an important marine <b>physical</b> <b>pollution</b> parameter, affects the growth of mangroves, causes loss of swamps and poses threat to aquatic life. The work presented discusses the effect of 'variations in sampling time' on Turbidity regression model using Remotely Sensed Data.

40|$|Urban {{stormwater}} runoff is a {{major cause}} of water quality degradation and impairment of beneficial uses of the nation's rivers and lakes. Stormwater quality management to address these pollution concerns differs by watershed, receiving waters characteristics, and the responsible agencies. Limited resources, legal authority, and insufficient funding often lead to inconsistent water quality outcomes. In this dissertation, stormwater management planning is examined to identify critical components necessary to ensure that water quality goals are attained and beneficial uses are preserved. Four types of evaluation methods are reviewed: chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>pollution</b> control, biological character and processes of the receiving water, ecological health of the receiving water, and economic performance. A genetic algorithm (GA) based watershed management optimization model is developed to evaluate stormwater management alternatives for a watershed. The optimization model is used to study how characteristics of watershed, receiving water, and stormwater quality management practices (SWQ-MPs) might influence stormwater quality management decisions and furthermore, how these factors might be considered and incorporated into the stormwater quality planning process. Consideration of maintenance in managing stormwater quality is evaluated using an economic method to optimally schedule maintenance and incorporate maintenance aspects into management practice design. The optimal maintenance schedule can be either incorporated into the development of stormwater management plans to aid in the iii selection of economically efficient management practices or used to preserve the performance of existing facilities to protect receiving water quality and beneficial uses.

40|$|An {{increase}} in public awareness regarding {{the negative impact}} of traditional power-generating methods, especially coal and oil-fired power stations, on the environment has created a demand for developing and using environmentally friendly renewable energy. Wind power is a popular and safe form of renewable energy. It can be economically viable, does not produce any <b>physical</b> <b>pollution</b> and can contribute radically to the reduction in air pollution. In the UK, the demand for wind energy is mounting. However, achieving the goal set by the EU will require a substantial expansion. Planning and environmental restrictions and conflicts would inevitably accompany this growth. A questionnaire targeting relevant public and private sectors in the UK has revealed the lack of coherent national criteria for locating wind farms. Using information from the questionnaire and the available published literature, simple Geographical Information System (GIS) -assisted wind farm location criteria were developed for the UK. A GIS (IDRISI) was employed to apply these criteria using two different methods to combine information layers for a site in Lancashire. The first considered all the layers as being equally important and gave them equal weight. The second grouped the layers and graded them according to perceived importance. The outputs were composed of classes from 0 to 10, where 0 represents ideal locations and 10 represents unsuitable locations.

Clothing influences the comfort of the surgical team to a considerable degree: in fact, in some surgery (orthopaedics, neurosurgery and so on), surgeons and assistants must wear paper overalls beneath non-breathable plastic overalls and protective masks and caps; then, if X-rays are needed during surgery, the second surgeon and the assistants must also wear lead overalls and lead thyroid collars and gloves while the anaesthetists and nurses will keep on wearing non-breathable paper overalls.

40|$|One of {{the main}} concept {{objectives}} of smart cities {{is to create a}} quality living environment that is long-term sustainable and economically justified. In that context, modern cities are aware of the exposure to various forms of physical and non-physical pollution that needs to be remediated, eliminated or reduced. To achieve {{that it is necessary to}} quality determine the sources and reasons of each pollution. The most prominent examples of <b>physical</b> <b>pollution</b> that affects the quality of life of citizens in cities are light and noise pollution. Noise pollution or noise, is mostly the consequence of road and rail traffic in cities and it directly affects the health of citizens. Traffic control, reduction of peak congestion, dispersion and traffic redirection or building protective barriers, are ways that cities use to reduce the amount of noise or its effects. To make these measures efficient it is necessary to obtain the information related to the level of noise in certain areas, streets, cities. To achieve this, smart cities use noise mapping. The city of Zagreb since 2012, participates in the i-SCOPE project (interoperable Smart City services trough Open Platform for urban Ecosystems). i-SCOPE delivers an open platform on top of which it develops, three "smart city" services: optimization of energy consumption through a service for accurate assessment of solar energy potential and energy loss at building level, environmental monitoring through a real-time environmental noise mapping service leveraging citizen's involvement will who act as distributed sensors city-wide measuring noise levels through an application on their mobile phones and improved inclusion and personal mobility of aging and diversely able citizens through an accurate personal routing service. The students of Faculty of Geodesy University of Zagreb, who enrolled in the course Thematic Cartography, were actively involved in the voluntary data acquisition in order to monitor the noise in real time. In this paper are presented the voluntary acquisitioned data of noise level measurement in Zagreb through a mobile application named Noise Tube, which were used as the basis for creating the dynamic noise map.

40|$|All mine dumps are a {{point source}} of either physical, {{chemical}} or both forms of pollution. <b>Physical</b> <b>pollution</b> includes the physical site {{coverage of the}} dump, slumping of parts of the dams and dust that may originate from it (air pollution). Chemical pollution from, or related to the mine dumps include the dominant acid drainage (which contains heavy metals), radioactivity, electromagnetic radiation, noise and chemicals released from the mineral processing stage. In {{one way or the}} other, exposure to these pollution forms is detrimental to the human health and his environment. It is this fact that urges the public, government and the responsible mining companies to find ways of monitoring the pollution and stopping it, preferably at the source. Where it can not be stopped, techniques of reducing it, or containing it have been, and are still being developed. Personal protection is the priority. Pollution exposure to the general public is minimised as much as possible. Pollution control techniques that employ less expensive, natural, self-sustaining elements suitable for the environment such as wetlands and vegetation are recommended. The artificial short term and often expensive alternatives are of secondary priority. However, choice of which technique to use is based on the merit of each problem, knowing that chemicals act faster but are effective for a short period as compared to the natural systems. Pollution management is the critical part of the whole process. This involves decision making on courses of action and financial allocation {{on the part of both}} the polluter and the monitoring department/agent. The ability to effectively manage pollution programmes is achieved these days with the aid of computers. It is emphasised that pollution control should be handled in an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach manner. This is because pollution is a question of life and death, hence every individual remains accountable to it.
