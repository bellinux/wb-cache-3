5|$|The initial XJ220 {{concept car}} was {{unveiled}} {{to the public}} at the 1988 British International Motor Show, held in Birmingham, England. Its positive reception prompted Jaguar to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> into production; some 1500 deposits of £50,000 each were taken, and deliveries were planned for 1992.|$|E
5|$|Trains {{passing through}} Baltimore {{at that time}} could not proceed {{directly}} through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at President Street Station {{on the east side}} of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on Pratt Street by horsepower to Camden Station on the west side of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops. The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail. The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.|$|E
25|$|Before the South African Grand Prix, Hunt {{was confronted}} by customs {{officials}} who searched his luggage, finding no illegal substances except a publication that contravened the strict obscenity laws of South Africa. Hunt was later released, and tested at Kyalami where his McLaren M26 suffered a loose brake caliper which cut a hole {{in one of the}} tyres. He recovered and <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> on pole position. The race saw Hunt suffer a collision with Jody Schekter's Wolf and another with Patrick Depailler's Tyrrell, but he still managed to finish 4th.|$|E

25|$|Midway {{through the}} second week of practice, Roger Penske consummated a deal with Al Sr. to drive the third car. Penske promised Unser a well-funded effort, and a brand new Cosworth engine, the same chassis/engine {{combination}} that had won the previous four Indy 500s. The year-old March was removed from a Penske Racing display at a Sheraton hotel in the team's hometown of Reading, Pennsylvania, and hurriedly prepared for a return to active competition. Unser easily <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in the field on the third day of time trials.|$|E
25|$|Mark Webber was {{the early}} pace setter in this 15 minute knock-out, but an amazing lap by Nico Rosberg easily secured his place into Q3. Button was {{struggling}} {{all through the}} session and ran wide and almost <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> into the wall on his final lap. He eventually finished a dismal twelfth. And with Barrichello having to drop 5 places down the grid after changing his gearbox before qualifying it wasn't looking to good for Ross Brawn's team. Barrichello left it late and jumped from eleventh to sixth to book {{his place in the}} top 10 shootout. The others to be knocked out were; Nakajima (P11), Räikkönen (P13), Buemi (P14) and Trulli in P15.|$|E
25|$|On January 10, 2007, at {{the launch}} of the 908 HDi FAP {{diesel-powered}} Le Mans prototype, Villeneuve was confirmed as one of Peugeot Sport's nine drivers for the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans. This was his first drive in a sportscar since working with Toyota in 1992. For the race, Villeneuve shared the No.7 car with Marc Gené and Nicolas Minassian. Villeneuve set the fastest time of the three drivers in qualifying to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> into fourth place on the starting grid. The car ran second for much of the race before pitting with engine problems at 12:39 pm. The car was officially retired at 1.42pm with only 100 minutes left of the race, after the team decided the problem could not be fixed.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{dual-mode}} ignition, the KR200 had a steering bar reminiscent of {{that of an}} aircraft. To steer the KR200, the driver would swivel the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel. The mechanism was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small amounts of movement, unlike other common steering mechanisms which involved reduction gearing. The gearshift lever had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in neutral regardless of what gear {{it had been in}} before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} was a project begun by General Motors as the M-car. When {{they realized that}} the project {{was not going to}} be profitable enough, the entire unfinished design was sold to Suzuki in return for a five per cent stake in the company. Suzuki completed the design and development work and <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> on sale from October 1983 in the Japanese market, as the Cultus. This is also why the car's design was such a natural fit in the General Motors lineup, with a clear GM corporate look. The model was also exported worldwide by Suzuki and assembled by a number of General Motors franchises, often undergoing badge engineering. The first-generation Swifts all share the SA model code prefix and was Suzuki's first earnest entry into a class of car with larger dimensions and engines than of the kei class Suzuki Fronte. Three- and four-cylinder versions of the G engine family were available, although some secondary markets installed Suzuki's one-liter four-cylinder F10A engine in a model which carries the SA410 chassis code.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{ordered a}} recall of 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokees and other cars that use an {{electronic}} gear shifter because it sometimes {{does not go}} into (or does not remain in) the park position, despite the operator's best intentions.

5000|$|Another burnout {{technique}} {{is aimed at}} cars with insufficient power to perform a burnout from a standing-still position. It involves <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> into reverse, reversing at a higher speed than normal and then quickly <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> into first gear and hitting the accelerator. A variant {{of this is to}} reverse at an angle which will result in two (for cars with limited slip differentials) distinctive skidmarks once <b>the</b> <b>car</b> pushes forward — in Arab parts of the world, this trick is called the [...] "88", as the skidmarks resemble two number-eights in Arabic ("٨٨"). In the United States these marks are referred to as [...] "fishhooks", a very accurate description of the skidmarks as <b>the</b> <b>car</b> will leave a longer mark when the vehicle's velocity becomes aligned with its forward direction. During this stunt the vehicle always experiences a (not necessarily constant) acceleration vector pointing along <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> forward direction, but the velocity vector will reverse direction from initially pointing backwards to forward, leaving the [...] "hook" [...] mark.|$|R
50|$|Hard Drivins {{approach}} to collisions or unrealistic events - <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> back on <b>the</b> road {{at a standstill}} - was the norm for driving games until later games such as Cruisin USA and its successors introduced intentionally artificial physics to force a car to always stay near the road and land right-side up pointing forward.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} Toronado {{began as}} a design painting by Oldsmobile stylist David North in 1962. His design, dubbed the [...] "Flame Red Car", was for a compact sports/personal car never intended for production. A {{few weeks after the}} design was finished, however, Oldsmobile division was informed it would be permitted to build a personal car in the Riviera/Thunderbird class for the 1966 model year, and North's design was selected. For production economy, the still-unnamed car was to share the so-called E-body shell with the redesigned 1966 Buick Riviera, which was substantially bigger than North had envisioned. Despite the efforts of Oldsmobile and General Motors styling chief Bill Mitchell to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> on the smaller A-body intermediate, they were overruled for cost reasons.|$|E
2500|$|The car {{was taken}} to Pendine Sands in South Wales and saw a more {{successful}} result with the first of Campbell's nine records. The record was achieved on 24 September 1924, with a speed of 146.16mph (235.23km/h) and an officially sanctioned time. After this he <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> up for sale for £1,500, but decided to keep it for a further attempt on hearing that Parry-Thomas was also planning a record attempt with 'Babs'. Blue Bird returned to Pendine in 1925, and on 21 July it raised this record to 150.766mph (242.628km/h), {{the first time a}} car had exceeded [...] The best run over the mile had reached , a figure that appeared in contemporary motoring adverts for oil and sparkplugs. To commemorate this achievement Campbell had commemorative models of Blue Bird made.|$|E
2500|$|The {{track is}} on a former Royal Canadian Air Force airbase {{constructed}} during the Second World War and later used by British Aerospace as a manufacturing and test facility. The track's main route, marked by painted lines and simple {{structures such as}} stacks of tyres, was designed by test drivers from Lotus. The layout of the track is designed to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> through various conditions, ranging from provoking understeer to testing brake balance and tyres. The track is approximately [...] long. It {{is considered to be}} an equaliser for cars since, according to Richard Hammond, both 0–60 miles per hour (0–96.6km/h) times and top speed are totally meaningless. The track also incorporates a drag strip; although this is not used for timed segments, it does feature in some challenges and other features on the show.|$|E

2500|$|Nissan Kohki (Nissan's {{power train}} {{engineering}} and manufacturing facility) originally tested a twin turbocharged 2350cc bored and stroked {{version of the}} RB25 engine. This set up produced [...] and used a RWD drivetrain. Under Group A regulations, a turbocharged engine must multiply its engine displacement by 1.7, putting the new Skyline in the 4000 cc class, and requiring the use of 10-inch-wide tyres. Knowing {{that they would be}} required to use 10-inch-wide tyres, Nissan decided to make the car all wheel drive. Nissan developed a special motorsport-oriented AWD system for this purpose called the ATTESA E-TS. Although this assisted with traction, it made the car [...] heavier; the added weight put the GT-R at a disadvantage to other cars in the 4000 cc class. Nissan then made the decision to increase the displacement to 2600 cc, and <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in the 4500 cc class, with the car's weight near-equal to competing cars. The 4500 cc class also allowed for 11-inch-wide tyres. New engine block and heads were then developed to better match the increased displacement. The result was a 600 horsepower car. [...] Later REINIK (Racing & Rally Engineering Division Incorporated Nissan Kohi) produced Group A racing engines between [...] depending on track conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the Impala were first {{depicted}} in the comic mini-series Supernatural: Origins, in which John Winchester takes ownership of the car from Mary's uncle after accidentally getting him killed during a hunt. However, fans responded negatively to this, as John is shown with the Impala in the teaser for the pilot episode, which is chronologically set before the comic series. Because of this, the comic was altered for the trade paperback version, with the Impala's true origins later being depicted in the series' fourth season. Having been sent back to 1973 by the angel Castiel, Dean convinces his father to purchase the Impala over a 1964 VW Van. The car's origins were further explored during the season five finale, in which a frame story surrounded {{the plot of the}} episode tracking the Impala's history from its manufacture, through several previous owners, up until the present day. According to Chuck Shurley, the brothers have [...] "made it their own", and they are shown as kids sticking an army man into an ash tray that remains there (Sam), putting blocks into the heating vents (Dean) and carving their initials into the car. The Impala later proves important when seeing the old army man allows Sam to overpower Lucifer during the final confrontation. According to Chuck, as they have the Impala, the Winchesters never consider themselves truly homeless. In the seventh season, after two Leviathans go on a killing spree in an identical Impala, Sam and Dean are forced to <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> into storage and use various other cars as they are too identifiable with the Impala. Dean later pulls it out of storage to confront Dick and has the demon Meg crash it into Sucrocorp to create a distraction. Starting in season 8, Sam and Dean are once again using the Impala as their car. The Impala was stolen by the angel Gadreel while possessing Sam, once again forcing Dean to use a stolen car, but it was quickly recovered and proved instrumental in tracking down the rogue angel.|$|E
