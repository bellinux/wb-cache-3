40|$|<b>Anti-dumping</b> <b>duties,</b> {{safeguards}} and countervailing duties are collectively, {{within the}} context of the WTO, referred to as „trade remedies. ‟ More specifically, the imposition of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> is a remedial measure for dealing with imports that cause or threatens to cause injury to local producers. Under the WTO framework, Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Agreement on the Implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 provides the rules for applying <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> by member countries. Nigeria has been a member of the WTO since 1995 and can only apply <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> provided it adheres to the rules governing anti-dumping. The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether the <b>proposed</b> <b>Anti-dumping</b> and Countervailing Bill, 2010 is consistent with WTO jurisprudence on anti-dumping. This study also highlights landmark developments in South Africa‟s anti-dumping system with a view to providing direction to Nigeria in order for its proposed national legislation on anti-dumping to be WTO compliant.

40|$|This paper {{studied the}} effects of {{anti-dumping}} measures on the imports to investigate whether the trade restriction effect of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> is dominant. Our results indicate that a 1 % increase in the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> decreases the import of the targeted product by about 0. 43 ~ 0. 51 %. The actual statistics, however, show that the total import of the targeted products increased by about 30 percent while an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> was in force. That indicates that an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> is just a temporary import relief. This paper also investigated whether an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> is terminated in {{the case that the}} injury would not be likely to continue or recur if the duty were removed. The hazards model estimates show that increase in market share, MFN tariff rate, and dumping margin decrease the hazard of termination of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty,</b> but the increase in value added increases the hazard of termination. Generally speaking, this result indicates that the WTO member countries have regulated the overuse of an anti-dumping measure. The findings of this paper show that there is a country- and industry-wise heterogeneous characteristic in the effect as well as termination of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) (Anti-Dumping Agreement) {{permits the}} {{imposition}} of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> for as long {{and to the extent}} necessary to counteract dumping which is causing injury, subject to the proviso that they must be terminated after five years unless a sunset review has been initiated. A sunset review has the purpose of either permitting or terminating the continuation of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty.</b> This is significant because if the sunset review is not initiated prior to the expiry of the five-year period, the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> will be terminated. Therefore, this places an emphasis on the determination of the precise date of commencement of the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties.</b> This is because an incorrect determination of the date of {{the imposition of}} the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> has obvious financial implications for the interested parties. The Supreme Court of Appeal in South Africa has delivered two salient judgments in this regard: firstly, in Progress Office Machines CC v SARS 2008 2 SA 13 (SCA) (POM), and then more recently, in Association of Meat Importers v ITAC 2013 4 All SA 253 (SCA) (AMIE). This paper contends that these two judgments are in conflict and are riddled with inconsistencies. Secondly, the paper contends that the SCA has in the recent AMIE case virtually rewritten its earlier judgment of Progress Office Machines. Lastly, the paper shows that the approach of South African courts to whether the Anti-Dumping Agreement is binding on South African law is fraught with uncertainty and ambivalence.

40|$|On the 26 th of November 2013 the European Commission {{concluded}} that solar glass origi- nating from the People’s Republic of China had been {{dumped into the}} European market. The Commission imposed a provisional <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> on subsequent imports. This thesis eval- uates the expected and actual welfare implications for consumers in the German market after the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> was introduced. As Europe’s largest solar energy producer, German data on solar energy production, sampled between 2011 and 2014, as well as price levels and installation rates for solar energy provides a robust framework of analysis. By way of a mul- tiple regression analysis, {{it is found that}} the introduction of the Commission’s <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> had a statistically insignificant effect on the production of solar electricity in the German market. Through the continued growth in solar energy production, it is found that German consumers are inelastic to changes in the price of solar energy. Prior literature underlines the prevalence of consumption preferences for consumers who exhibit the ’warm-glow’ effect and derive utility out of altruism towards the environment. The heightened consumption of solar energy in spite of rising prices underlines this effect. These conclusions enable further consider- ation for the duty’s implications for market welfare in the country, and also its implications for the wider European community. It is concluded, in contrast with classical theory on industrial organisation, that European consumers were made no worse off {{as a result of the}} <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty,</b> and that producers benefited...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} how {{anti-dumping}} legislation was implemented in Canada {{and in the}} European Communities. This comparison of Canadian and EC anti-dumping law aims at examining how the Anti-Dumping Code was transposed and applied in each jurisdiction by looking at each step of an anti-dumping investigation, starting with the initiation of an investigation, the calculation of the normal value and of the export price, {{the determination of the}} dumping margin, the finding of injury, and ending with other related matters such as anti-absorption and anti-circumvention rules. Having looked at Canadian and EC anti-dumping law as such, this paper examines the compatibility of anti-dumping actions with the creation of free trade areas and the effect of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> on such free trade areas. It looks specifically at the EC and the NAFTA examples. Both the NAFTA and the EC treaty create, generally speaking, a free trade area, however the approach taken vis-a-vis <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> within the free trade area is different in each case: while the EC abolished <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> within the free trade area, these duties are maintained under the NAFTA regime...|$|R

40|$|<b>Anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} applied trade defence instrument, {{not only in the}} European Union, but also globally. 1 In the European Union, they are imposed after an investigation by the Commission, in which the Commission tries to ascertain whether a specifi c product has been imported into the Community at a price below its "normal value" (i. e. has been "dumped"), whether this has caused or threatens to cause "material injury" to the Community industry, and, lastly, whether it is in the Community interest to impose an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty.</b> All three elements are problematic in one way or the other. Recent reform discussions focused on the defi nition of the "Community industry" and the "Community interest", which are increasingly problematic concepts in times of globalization, as Community undertakings outsource production world-wide and commercial policy is burdened with non-economic policy goals.

40|$|To {{understand}} the role of trade policies in the crisis of 2008, this paper constructs the overall trade restrictiveness indices {{for a wide range}} of countries using their tariff schedules in 2008 and 2009. The index summarizes the trade policy stance of a country, taking into account the share of each good in trade as well as its corresponding import demand elasticity. Results show that there is no widespread increase in protectionism via tariff policies since the global financial crisis has unfolded. While many countries have adjusted tariffs upward on selected products, only a handful of countries, such as Malawi, Russia, Argentina, Turkey and China focus on products that have significant impacts on trade flows. The United States and the European Union, by contrast, rely mainly on <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> to shield domestic industries. Overall, while the rise in tariffs and <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> in these countries may have jointly caused global trade to drop by as much as US$ 43 billion during the crisis period, it explains less than 2 percent of the collapse in world trade.

40|$|A large {{literature}} {{studies the}} effects of trade policy changes on developing-country exports on household incomes, and recent contributions have increasingly addressed {{the effects of}} administered protection, such as <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties.</b> In 2003 the United States imposed anti-dumping tariffs on imports of catfish from Vietnam ranging from 37 to 64 percent. As a result, Vietnamese exports of catfish to the U. S. market declined sharply, thus providing {{a unique opportunity to}} study the effects of U. S. trade policy changes on Vietnamese families. Using data on Vietnamese households, the authors study the responses of catfish producers in the Mekong delta of Vietnam between 2002 and 2004. The evidence suggests that the rate of growth of income of households that depended on catfish sales was significantly affected. In addition, the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> triggered significant exit from catfish farming. Households adjusted by moving out of catfish aquaculture and into wage labor markets and agriculture, but not into other aquaculture activities. Finally, the evidence also suggests that households found it difficult to change their catfish production levels, and that performance in aquaculture affects other household economic activities.
