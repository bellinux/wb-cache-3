5|$|Some enzymes do {{not need}} {{additional}} components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as <b>pyruvate</b> <b>carboxylase).</b>|$|E

In this work, we combined a nutrient substitution approach with a metabolic engineering strategy that improves glucose utilization efficiency.

An established mode of controlling the microenvironment in sensory ganglia is the uptake of substances by specialized transporters which carry neurotransmitters into cells when coupled with Na+ and Cl−. Transporters for glutamate and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been found in SGCs. They appear to be actively engaged in the control of the composition of the extracellular space of the ganglia. The enzyme glutamine synthetase, which catalyzes the conversion of glutamate into glutamine, is found in large amounts in SGCs.

Here we describe the design, development, and evaluation of a rationally designed bisubstrate inhibitor of MtBPL.

We show that the inhibitor decreases in vivo protein biotinylation of key enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and that the antibacterial activity is MtBPL dependent. Additionally, the gene encoding BPL was found to be essential in M.  smegmatis. Finally, the X-ray cocrystal structure of inhibitor bound MtBPL was solved providing detailed insight for further structure-activity analysis. Collectively, these data suggest that MtBPL is a promising target for further antitubercular therapeutic development...|$|R

Understanding of lipid metabolism in microalgae is important to isolate oleaginous strain capable of overproducing lipids. It has been reported that reducing starch biosynthesis can enhance lipid accumulation. However, the metabolic mechanism controlling carbon partitioning from starch to lipids in microalgae remains unclear, thus complicating the genetic engineering of algal strains. We here used "dynamic" metabolic profiling and essential transcription analysis of the oleaginous green alga Chlamydomonas sp.

These results, showing salinity-induced starch-tolipid biosynthesis, will help increase our understanding of dynamic carbon partitioning in oleaginous microalgae. Moreover, we successfully determined the changes of several key lipid-synthesis- related genes (e. g., acetyl-CoA <b>carboxylase,</b> <b>pyruvate</b> decarboxylase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetylCoA synthetase and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase) and starch-degradation related genes (e. g., starch phosphorylases), which could provide a breakthrough in the marine microalgal production of biodiesel...|$|R
40|$|The liver plays {{a central}} role in the control of blood glucose {{homeostasis}} by maintaining a balance between glucose production and utilization. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a bile acid-activated nuclear receptor. Hepatic FXR expression is regulated by glucose and insulin. Here we identify a role for FXR in the control of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism. When submitted to a controlled fasting-refeeding schedule, FXR-/- mice displayed an accelerated response to high carbohydrate refeeding with an accelerated induction of glycolytic and lipogenic genes and a more pronounced repression of gluconeogenic genes. Plasma insulin and glucose levels were lower in FXR-/- mice upon refeeding the high-carbohydrate diet. These alterations were paralleled by decreased hepatic glycogen content. Hepatic insulin sensitivity was unchanged in FXR-/- mice. Treatment of isolated primary hepatocytes with a synthetic FXR agonist attenuated glucose-induced mRNA expression as well as promoter activity of L-type <b>pyruvate</b> kinase, acetyl-CoA <b>carboxylase</b> 1, and Spot 14. Moreover, activated FXR interfered negatively with the carbohydrate response elements regions. These results identify a novel role for FXR as a modulator of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism...|$|R

The characteristic "Kranz" anatomy of most C(4) leaves was discovered in the 1890 s, but the genetic basis of these traits remains poorly defined. Oat × maize addition lines allow the effects of individual maize (Zea mays; C(4)) chromosomes to be investigated in an oat (Avena sativa; C(3)) genetic background. Here, we have determined {{the extent to which}} maize chromosomes can introduce C(4) characteristics into oat and have associated any C(4) -like changes with specific maize chromosomes.

Maize genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate <b>carboxylase,</b> <b>pyruvate,</b> orthophosphate dikinase, and the 2 '-oxoglutarate/malate transporter are expressed in oat and generate transcripts of the correct size.

Mutants usually either died after depletion of seed reserves (about 18 days after planting), or survived with slow growth up to 7 or 8 weeks. Both the activity and quantity of ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) were low in the mutants (5 - 25 % of the normal siblings on a leaf area basis) {{and the loss of}} Rubisco tended to parallel the reduction in photosynthetic capacity. The Rubisco content in the mutants was often marginal for photosynthetic carbon gain, with some leaves and positions along a leaf having no net photosynthesis, while other leaves had a low carbon gain. Conversely, the activities of C 4 cycle enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate <b>carboxylase,</b> <b>pyruvate,</b> Pi dikinase, NADP-malate dehydrogenase, and NADP-malic enzyme, were the same or only slightly reduced compared to the normal siblings. The mutants had about half as much chlorophyll content per leaf area as the normal green plants. However, the Rubisco activity in the mutants was low on both a leaf area and chlorophyll basis. Low Rubisco activity and lower chlorophyll content may both contribute to the low rates of photosynthesis in the mutants on a leaf area basis...|$|R

Based on this strain, we engineered C. glutamicum {{for the production}} of isobutanol from glucose under oxygen deprivation conditions by inactivation of l-lactate and malate dehydrogenases, implementation of ketoacid decarboxylase from Lactococcus lactis, alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH 2) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and expression of the pntAB transhydrogenase genes from Escherichia coli. The resulting strain produced isobutanol with a substrate-specific yield (YP/S) of 0. 60 ± 0. 02 mol per mol of glucose. Interestingly, a chromosomally encoded alcohol dehydrogenase rather than the plasmid-encoded ADH 2 from S. cerevisiae was involved in isobutanol formation with C. glutamicum, and overexpression of the corresponding adhA gene increased the YP/S to 0. 77 ± 0. 01 mol of isobutanol per mol of glucose. Inactivation of the malic enzyme significantly reduced the YP/S, indicating that the metabolic cycle consisting of <b>pyruvate</b> and/or phosphoenolpyruvate <b>carboxylase,</b> malate dehydrogenase, and malic enzyme is responsible for the conversion of NADH+H+ to NADPH+H+. In fed-batch fermentations with an aerobic growth phase and an oxygen-depleted production phase, the most promising strain, C. glutamicum ΔaceE Δpqo ΔilvE ΔldhA Δmdh(pJC 4 ilvBNCD-pntAB) (pBB 1 kivd-adhA), produced about 175 mM isobutanol, with a volumetric productivity of 4. 4 mM h− 1, and showed an overall YP/S of about 0. 48 mol per mol of glucose in the production phase...|$|R

40|$|The amphibious {{leafless}} sedge Eleocharis vivipara develops C 4 -like traits {{as well as}} Kranz anatomy under terrestrial conditions, but {{it develops}} C 3 -like traits without Kranz anatomy under submerged conditions. When submerged plants are exposed to aerial conditions, they rapidly produce new photosynthetic tissues with C 4 -like traits. In this study, experiments were performed to determine whether abscisic acid (ABA), a plant stress hormone, could induce the formation of photosynthetic tissues with Kranz anatomy and C 4 -like biochemical traits under water in the submerged form. When the submerged plants were grown in water containing 5 &mgr;M ABA, they developed new photosynthetic tissues with Kranz anatomy, forming well-developed Kranz (bundle sheath) cells that contained many organelles. The ABA-induced tissues accumulated large amounts of phosphoenolpyruvate <b>carboxylase,</b> <b>pyruvate</b> orthophosphate dikinase, and NAD-malic enzyme at the appropriate cellular sites. The tissues had 3. 4 to 3. 8 times more C 4 enzyme activity than did tissues of the untreated submerged plants.

This was carried out to identify the sites at which N assimilation is acting to regulate carbon metabolism. Over 120 seconds following NH 4 + addition we found that: (a) N accumulated in glutamine while glutamate and α-ketoglutarate levels fell; (b) ATP levels declined within 5 seconds and recovered within 30 seconds of NH 4 + addition; (c) ratios of pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate, malate/phosphoenolpyruvate, Glc- 1 -P/Glc- 6 -P and Fru- 1, 6 -bisphosphate/Fru- 6 -P increased; and (d) as previously seen, photosynthetic carbon fixation was inhibited. Further, we monitored starch degradation during N assimilation over a longer time course and found that starch breakdown occurred {{at a rate of}} about 110 micromoles glucose per milligram chlorophyll per hour. The results are consistent with N assimilation occurring through glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase at the expense of carbon previously stored as starch. They also indicate that regulation of several enzymes is involved in the shift in metabolism from photosynthetic carbon assimilation to carbohydrate oxidation during N assimilation. It seems likely that <b>pyruvate</b> kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate <b>carboxylase,</b> and starch degradation are all activated, whereas key Calvin cycle enzyme(s) are inactivated within seconds of NH 4 + addition to N-limited S. minutum cells. The rapid changes in glutamate and triose phosphate, recently shown to be regulators of cytosolic pyruvate kinase, are consistent with them contributing to the short-term activation of this enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Four {{species of}} the genus Flaveria, namely F. anomala, F. linearis, F. pubescens, and F. ramosissima, were {{identified}} as intermediate C 3 -C 4 plants based on leaf anatomy, photosynthetic CO 2 compensation point, O 2 inhibition of photosynthesis, and activities of C 4 enzymes. F. anomala and F. ramosissima exhibit a distinct Kranz-like leaf anatomy, {{similar to that of}} the C 4 species F. trinervia, while the other C 3 -C 4 intermediate Flaveria species possess a less differentiated Kranz-like leaf anatomy. Photosynthetic CO 2 compensation points of these intermediates at 30 °C were very low relative to those of C 3 plants, ranging from 7 to 14 microliters per liter. In contrast to C 3 plants, net photosynthesis by the intermediates was not sensitive to O 2 concentrations below 5 % and decreased relatively slowly with increasing O 2 concentration. Under similar conditions, the percentage inhibition of photosynthesis by 21 % O 2 varied from 20 % to 25 % in the intermediates compared with 28 % in Lycopersicon esculentum, a typical C 3 species. The inhibition of carboxylation efficiency by 21 % O 2 varied from 17 % for F. ramosissima to 46 % for F. anomala and were intermediate between the C 4 (2 % for F. trinervia) and C 3 (53 % for L. esculentum) values. The intermediate Flaveria species, especially F. ramosissima, have substantial activities of the C 4 enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate <b>carboxylase,</b> <b>pyruvate,</b> orthophosphate dikinase, NADP-malic enzyme, and NADP-malate dehydrogenase, indicating potential for C 4 photosynthesis.

A. ficoides and A. tenella exhibited a less distinct Kranz-like leaf anatomy with substantial accumulation of starch both in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Photosynthetic CO 2 compensation points of these two intermediate species at 29 °C were much lower than in C 3 plants and ranged from 18 to 22 microliters per liter. Although A. ficoides and A. tenella exhibited similar intermediacy in г, the apparent photorespiratory component of O 2 inhibition in A. ficoides is lower than in A. tenella. The г progressively decreases from 35 microliters per liter at lowest light intensity to 18 microliters per liter at highest light intensity in A. tenella. It was, however, constant in A. ficoides at 20 to 25 microliters per liter between light intensities measured. The rates of net photosynthesis at 21 % O 2 and 29 °C by A. ficoides and A. tenella were 25 to 28 milligrams CO 2 per square decimeter per hour which are intermediate between values obtained for Tridax procumbens and A. pungens, C 3 and C 4 species, respectively. The activities of key enzymes of C 4 photosynthesis, phosphoenolpyruvate <b>carboxylase,</b> <b>pyruvate</b> Pi dikinase, NAD malic enzyme, NADP malic enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in the two intermediates, A. ficoides and A. tenella are very low or insignificant.

40|$|The {{activities}} of key C 4 enzymes in gel-filtered, whole-leaf extracts and the photosynthetic characteristics for reciprocal F 1 hybrids of Flaveria pringlei (C 3) and F. brownii (C 4 -like species) were measured {{to determine whether}} any inherited C 4 -photosynthetic traits are responsible for their reduced CO 2 compensation concentration values (AS Holaday, S Talkmitt, ME Doohan Plant Sci 41 : 31 - 39). The {{activities of}} phosphoenolpyruvate <b>carboxylase,</b> <b>pyruvate,</b> orthophosphate dikinase, and NADP-malic enzyme (ME) for the reciprocal hybrids are only about 7 to 17 % of those for F. brownii, but are three- to fivefold greater than the activities for F. pringlei. The low activities of these enzymes in the hybrids {{appear to be the}} result of a partial dominance of F. pringlei genes over certain F. brownii genes. However, no such dominance occurs with respect to the expression of genes for NADP-malate dehydrogenase, which is as active in the hybrids as in F. brownii. In contrast to the situation with the enzymes above, cytoplasmic factors appear to determine the inheritance of NAD-ME. The NAD-ME activity in each hybrid is comparable to that in the respective maternal parent. Pulse-chase 14 CO 2 incorporation analyses at ambient CO 2 levels indicate that the hybrids initially assimilate 7 to 9 % of the total assimilated CO 2 into C 4 acids as compared to 3. 5 % for F. pringlei. In the hybrids, the percentage of 14 C in malate decreases from an average of 6. 5 to 2. 1 % after a 60 -second chase in 12 CO 2 /air. However, this apparent C 4 -cycle activity is too limited or inefficient to substantially alter CO 2 exchange from that in F. pringlei, since the values of net photosynthesis and O 2 inhibition of photosynthesis are similar for the hybrids and F. pringlei. Also, the ratio of the internal to the external CO 2 concentration and the initial slopes of the plot of CO 2 concentration versus net photosynthesis are essentially the same for the hybrids and F. pringlei. At 45 micromoles CO 2 per mole and 0. 21 mole O 2 per mole, the hybrids assimilate nearly fivefold more CO 2 into C 4 acids than does F. pringlei. Some turnover of the malate pool occurs in the hybrids, but the labelling of the photorespiratory metabolites, glycine and serine, is the same in these plants as it is in F. pringlei. Thus, although limited C 4 -acid metabolism may operate in the hybrids, we conclude that it is not effective in altering O 2 inhibition of CO 2 assimilation. The ability of the hybrids to assimilate more CO 2 via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase at low levels of CO 2 than does F. pringlei may result in an increased rate of reassimilation of photorespiratory CO 2 and CO 2 compensation concentrations below that of their C 3 parent. If the hybrids do possess a limited C 4 cycle, it must operate intracellularly. They are not likely to have inherited an intercellular compartmentation of C 4 enzymes, since F. brownii has incomplete compartmentation of key C 3 and C 4 enzymes...|$|R
