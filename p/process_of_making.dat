5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids are the {{structural}} units (monomers) {{that make up}} proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy {{of one of the}} organism's genes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> beer {{is known}} as brewing. A {{dedicated}} building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer {{can be made in}} the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea, {{in their}} usual home strip of blue, kicked-off the match and {{immediately}} lost possession when Walcott dispossessed Matic. Walcott sent {{the ball to}} Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose cross on the right forced a punch from Thibaut Courtois. Francis Coquelin conceded a free kick in the sixth minute having fouled Willian inside Chelsea's half, though nothing came of the set piece. Fàbregas went down under the challenge of Per Mertesacker in Arsenal's penalty area soon afterwards, but his appeal for a penalty kick was turned down by referee Anthony Taylor and play resumed. Chelsea, having settled the slower of the two teams, began to dominate ball possession and won two early corners, {{both of which were}} easily dealt with. In the 17th minute, Nacho Monreal's charge forward was stopped by Cahill; the Chelsea defender in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> that challenge had suffered a nose bleed. A free kick for Arsenal presented a chance for Walcott to score, but his header goalwards was saved.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, {{under the}} urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and to begin the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations {{as to whether or}} not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection. Historical significance to the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E

40|$|The term {{technical}} is used widely {{in relation to}} art and art history today, yet {{we do not have}} a history of the shifting meaning of the term technique in the arts and sciences. Although related forms were occasionally used in European languages before around 1700, the word technique was a neologism in the vernacular that started to appear sparsely in treatises on arts and sciences only from the middle of the eighteenth century. Rooted in the Greek techne, which was translated routinely as “art” until the mid–eighteenth century, technique referred to both <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> or doing and their products. Yet from around 1750, a distinction <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>making</b> or doing from the resulting artwork appears to have arisen in German philosophies of art.
