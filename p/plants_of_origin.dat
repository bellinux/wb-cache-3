Morphine in particular was used much more widely after {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe, and the practise of local anaesthesia by infiltration was another step forward in medicine resulting from the hypodermic needle, discovered at around {{the same time that it}} was determined that cocaine produced useful numbing of the mucous membranes and eye.|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{damage or}} {{oxidative}} injury arising from free radicals or {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) now appears the fun-damental mechanism underlying a number of human neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, inflammation, viral infec-tions, autoimmune pathologies and digestive system disorders. Free radicals are generated through normal metabolism of drugs, environmental chemicals and other xenobiotics as well as endogenous chemicals, especially stress hormones (adrenalin and noradrenalin). Accumulated evidence suggests that ROS can be scavenged through chemoprevention utilizing natural antioxidant compounds present in foods and medicinal plants.

40|$|Two new 27 -nor-triterpene glycosides, tomentosides A (1) andB(2), were {{isolated}} from Peruvian “Uña de Gato ” (cat’s claw, plant of origin: Uncaria tomentosa), a traditional herbal medicine in Peru. Their structures {{were determined by}} spectroscopic analysis and chemical interconversions. This is the first report of naturally occurring pyroquinovic acid glycosides. “Uña de Gato ” (cat’s claw) 1 is a Peruvian traditional herbal medicine used for treating various ailments. Recently, some bioactivities of this herbal medicine, including antiinflammatory activity, 2 have been reported. The <b>plants</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of “Uña de Gato ” are Uncaria tomentosa (Willd.) D. C. and U. guianensis (Aubl.) Gmel. (Rubiaceae), which are distributed in the South American continent.

40|$|Ensifer meliloti (formerly Sinorhizobium meliloti) {{was first}} {{considered}} as a specific microsymbiont of Medicago, Melilotus and Trigonella. However, strains of E meliloti were recovered from root nodules of various legume species and their symbiotic status still remains unclear. Here, we further investigate the specificity of these strains. A collection of 47 E meliloti strains isolated In Tunisia from root nodules of Medicago truncatula, Medicago sativa, Medicago ciliaris, Medicago laciniata, Medicago marina, Medicago scutellata, Phaseolus vulgaris, Cicer arietinum, Argyrolobium uniflorum, Lotus creticus, Lotus roudairei, Ononis natrix, Retama raetam, Genista saharae, Acacia tortilis, Hedysarum carnosum and Hippocrepis bicontorta were examined by REP-PCR fingerprinting, PCR-RFLPs of the 16 S- 23 S rDNA IGS, the nifH gene and nifD-K intergenic spacer, and sequencing of 16 S rRNA and nodA genes. Their nodulation range was also assessed by cross-inoculation experiments. No clear correlation was found between chromosomal backgrounds and host <b>plants</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The nodulation polyvalence of the species E meliloti {{was associated with a}} high symbiotic heterogeneity. On the basis of PCR-RFLP data from the nifH gene and nifD-K intergenic spacer, E. meliloti strains isolated from non-Medicago legumes harboured distinct genes and possessed wider host ranges. Some strains did not nodulate Medicago species. On the basis of nodA phylogeny, the majority of the Tunisian strains, including strains from Medicago, harboured distinct nodA alleles more related to those found in E medicae than those found in E meliloti. However, more work is still needed to characterize this group further. The diversity observed among M. laciniata isolates, which was Supported by nodA phylogeny, nifH typing and the efficiency profile on M. ciliaris., indicated that what was thought to be bv. medicaginis is certainly heterogeneous...|$|E

60|$|These {{plants were}} all kept under a net, {{so that the}} {{capsules}} which they produced must have been all spontaneously self-fertilised. The eight crossed plants produced twenty-one such capsules, of which only twelve contained any seed, averaging 8.5 per capsule. On the other hand, the eight self-fertilised plants produced no less than thirty-six capsules, of which I examined twenty-five, and, {{with the exception of}} three, all contained seeds, averaging 10.63 seeds per capsule. Thus the proportional number of seeds per capsule produced by the <b>plants</b> <b>of</b> crossed <b>origin</b> to those produced by the <b>plants</b> <b>of</b> self-fertilised <b>origin</b> (both lots being spontaneously self-fertilised) was as 100 to 125.
