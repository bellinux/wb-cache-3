5000|$|Crossobothrium antonioi is a {{recently}} discovered {{species in the}} genus Crossobothrium, which belongs to the order Tetraphyllidea. It is a parasitic tapeworm that infects Notorynchus cepedianus, the broadnose sevengill shark. C. antonioi was discovered {{off the coast of}} Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. C. antonioi was recovered from the spiral intestine of N. cepedianus and named after the lead researcher's father, Antonio Ivanov. C. antonioi is the smallest species in its genus and about 47.4-51.5 mm long; other species in the genus are about twice as long as C. antonioi. It has 4 stalked bothridia ("sucking grooves") on its scolex. Its proglottids, which are the segments of tapeworms that contain the reproductive structures, are longer than wide when immature, and become wider than long at maturity. [...] However, the proglottids at each stage are generally the same shape. C. antonioi also have crenulated bothridial margins and a microthrix pattern that varies from other species in Crossobothrium. [...] The most notable and unique quality of C. antonioi is the large amount of <b>testes</b> <b>per</b> mature proglottid. C. antonioi has more than 700 <b>testes</b> <b>per</b> proglottid, whereas other Crossobothrium species have ~150-300 <b>testes</b> <b>per</b> proglottid.|$|R

40|$|A high {{prevalence}} of intersex or testicular oocytes (TO) in male smallmouth bass within the Potomac River drainage has raised concerns {{as to the}} health of the river. Studies were conducted to document biomarker responses both temporally and spatially to better understand the influence of normal physiological cycles, as well as water quality and land-use influences. Smallmouth bass were collected over a 2 -year period from three tributaries of the Potomac River: the Shenandoah River, the South Branch Potomac and Conococheague Creek, and an out-of-basin reference site on the Gauley River. The {{prevalence of}} TO varied seasonally with the lowest prevalence observed in July, post-spawn. Reproductive maturity and/or lack of spawning the previous spring, as well as land-use practices such as application of manure and pesticides, may influence the seasonal observations. Annual, seasonal, and site differences were also observed in the percentage of males with measurable concentrations of plasma vitellogenin, mean concentration of plasma vitellogenin in females, and plasma concentrations of 17 β-estradiol and testosterone in both sexes. Bass collected in the South Branch Potomac (moderate to high prevalence of TO) had less sperm <b>per</b> <b>testes</b> mass with a lower percentage of those sperm being motile when compared to those from the Gauley River (low prevalence of TO). An inverse relationship was noted between TO severity and sperm motility.

40|$|A {{new species}} of Acanthobothrium in Dasyatis longus from Chamela Bay, Jalisco, Mexico, {{is a member of}} a presumed clade of species {{diagnosed}} by being anapolytic or nearly so, having more than 100 <b>testes</b> <b>per</b> proglottis, with immature and mature proglottides wider than long to square, aspinose scolex, muscular bothridia fused to the scolex at their posterior ends, H- to V-shaped ovaries, relatively short symmetrical to asymmetrical ovarian arms that extend anteriorly to, or nearly to, the cirrus sac, and vitellaria arranged in fields rather than a single row of follicles. The new species most closely resembles Acanthobothrium terezae from the freshwater stingray Potamotrygon motoro in the following characters: bothridial hooks longer than 200 μm with inner hooks having bent asymmetrical prongs, an average of 130 - 140 <b>testes</b> <b>per</b> proglottis, and shallow genital atria located posterior to midline of proglottis.

The new species is unique among all described species of Acanthobothrium by having a cleft in the posterior margin of each apical bothridial pad. The apparent close relationship of the new species to one inhabiting a Neotropical freshwater stingray provides support for the hypothesized Pacific marine ancestry of Neotropical freshwater stingrays and raises the possibility that the Neotropical freshwater stingrays may not be monophyletic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the reproductive risk associated with exposure of adult male Fisher- 344 (F- 344) rats to inhaled benzo(a) pyrene (BaP), a ubiquitous environmental toxicant present in cigarette smoke, automobile exhaust fumes and industrial emissions. Rats were assigned randomly to a treatment or control group. Treatment consisted of exposure of rats via nose-only inhalation to 75 μg BaP/m 3, 4 hours daily for 60 days, while control animals were unexposed (UNC). Blood samples were collected immediately on day 60 of exposures (time 0) and subsequently at 24, 48, and 72 hours, to assess the effect of exposures to BaP on plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations. Mean testis weight, total weight of tubules and total tubular length <b>per</b> paired <b>testes</b> were reduced 33 % (P< 0. 025), 27 % (P < 0. 01) and 39 %, respectively in exposed rats (P < 0. 01) compared with UNC rats.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} age and season on Sertoli cell number <b>per</b> paired <b>testes,</b> ratio of germ cells per Sertoli cell, and daily sperm production, testes were obtained from 184 adult (4 - 20 yr) stallions at slaughter throughout one year. Numbers of Sertoli cells or germ cells were derived from nuclear volume density, volume of individual nuclei, and parenchymal volume. Germ cell to Sertoli cell ratios were calculated from cell numbers. Regression {{analysis was used to}} detect age-related differences In the breeding season (May-Jul) or throughout the year. A two-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate time periods (Nov-Jan, Feb-Apr, May-Jul, and Aug-Oct) and age groups (4 - 5. 5, 6 - 12. 5, or 13 - 20 yr). Paired parenchymal weight and daily sperm production per horse increased significantly with age. Neither regression nor analysis of variance revealed an effect of age on Sertoli cell number. While season contributed ( 0. 05) age X season interaction or age effect on Sertoli cell number. In testes obtained from adult stallions, age had no effect on the number of Sertoli cells per horse, the ratio of maturation-phase spermatids to Sertoli cells, or the ratio of all stage VIII germ cells to Sertoli cells. Given no age effect within a given season on Sertoli cell number per horse, the number of Sertoli cells in the recrudesced testis of the breeding season probably is not significantly different for a given stallion between 4 and 20 yr of age...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of xenoestrogens: {{diethylstilbestrol}} (DES) and zearalenone (ZEA) on rat's pubertal testis and to compare it with the effect of natural estrogen - 17 beta-estradiol (E). Male Wistar rats were daily, subcutaneously injected at 5 th- 15 th postnatal days (p. d.) with E (1. 25 or 12. 5 mug) or DES (1. 25 or 12. 5 mug) or ZEA (4 or 40 mug) or vehicle. At 16 th p. d. testes were dissected, weighted, and paraffin embedded. Following parameters were assessed: diameter and length of seminiferous tubule, numbers of spermatogonia A+intermediate+B (A/In/B), preleptotene spermatocytes (PL), leptotene+zygotene+pachytene spermatocytes (L/Z/PA) and Sertoli cells <b>per</b> testis. <b>Testes</b> weight, seminiferous tubule diameter and length were decreased by both doses of E, DES and ZEA. DES effect was the strongest, but its influence on testis weight and seminiferous tubule length, on the contrary to E and ZEA, was not dose-dependent. Similarly, DES in both doses had the most severe negative impact on the number of germ and Sertoli cells. The negative influence of E on germ cells was less pronounced. The negative effect of ZEA was seen only after administration of the higher dose on spermatogonia number, while DES and E decreased A/In/B number more evidently. Sertoli cell number were decreased after both doses of E. ZEA 40 decreased Sertoli cell number while ZEA 4 had no effect. Conclusion: exposure of prepubertal male rat to DES has the strongest detrimental effect on the developing testis in comparison to E and ZEA. Both, E and DES, decreased number of germ and Sertoli cells, diminished seminiferous tubule diameter, length and testis weight. ZEA had much more weaker effect than the potent estrogens...|$|R
40|$|Three {{species of}} proteocephalid cestodes were {{collected}} from Colombian siluriform fishes. Goezeella siluri Fuhrmann, 1916 is reported from Ageneiosus caucanus for the first time, and Colombia is a new locality. Goezeella siluri has a metascolex, biloculate suckers, and cortical gonads. Proteocephalideans possessing uniloculate suckers and cortical gonads represent two groupings. Those species possessing metascolices represent the genus Spatulifer Woodland, 1934, containing the species surubim, piramutab, piracatinga, rugosa, and rugata. Those lacking metascolices belong in Monticellia LaRue, 1911, comprising coryphicephala, lenha, megacephala, and spinulifera. New combinations include Spatulifer piramutab for Goezeella piramutab, S. piracatinga for Monticellia piracatinga, S. rugosa for M. rugosa, and S. rugata for M. rugata. Nomimoscolex alovarius sp. n. from Pimelodus clarias most closely resembles N. kaparari by having fewer than 100 <b>testes</b> <b>per</b> proglottid and exhibiting two papilla-like protuberances on each sucker, but the new species differs by having 63 - 100 rather than 40 total lateral uterine branches, single lateral vitelline fields rather than dorsal and ventral lateral fields, anteriorly expanded ovarian lobes, and by lacking an expanded apical portion of the scolex.

To date, studies of precopulatory strategies have largely focused on visual ornaments (e. g., coloration) or weapon morphology (e. g., antlers, horns, and canines). However, vocalizations can also {{play an important}} role in both male competition and female choice [3, 4 and 5]. We investigated variation in vocal tract dimensions among male howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.), which produce loud roars using a highly specialized and greatly enlarged hyoid bone and larynx [6]. We examined the relative male investment in hyoids and testes among howler monkey species in relation to the level of male-male competition and analyzed the acoustic consequences of variation in hyoid morphology. Species characterized by single-male groups have large hyoids and small testes, suggesting high levels of vocally mediated competition. Larger hyoids lower formant frequencies, probably increasing the acoustic impression of male body size and playing a role analogous to investment in large body size or weaponry. Across species, as the number of males <b>per</b> group increases, <b>testes</b> volume also increases, indicating higher levels of postcopulatory sperm competition, while hyoid volume decreases. These results provide the first evidence of an evolutionary trade-off between investment in precopulatory vocal characteristics and postcopulatory sperm production...|$|R
40|$|The {{fecundity}} of clonal {{animals and}} plants {{is determined by the}} number of gravid modules (polyps, zooids, shoots, ramets) and their reproductive output. We examined the fecundity of modules (polyps) and colonies of six reef-building corals (Acropora hyacinthus, A. nana, A. gemmifera, A. millepora, Goninstrea retiformis, and Stylophora pistillata) to explore how modularity influences reproductive strategies and the evolution of life histories in clonal animals. In unitary, aclonal organisms, fecundity often reaches a plateau or declines in old age. In contrast, we found that fecundity of colonies was indeterminate because vegetative growth can lead to an indefinite number of repeated, reproductive modules. However, colony fecundity was not a simple linear function of the number of modules. The species ranking of polyp fecundities (G. retiformis > the Acropora species > S. pistillata) was very different from the ranks of size-specific colony fecundities (A. hyacinthus, A. millepora, A. gemmifera > A. nana and G. retiformis). Colony fecundity for small S. pistillata was the lowest of all, but large colonies were more fecund {{than any of the other}} species at a comparable colony size (despite Stylophora having the lowest polyp fecundity). This contrast highlights clearly the effects of modularity on the reproductive biology and life histories of clonal organisms. The volume of eggs and testes, and the number of eggs and <b>testes</b> <b>per</b> polyp varied greatly among species (20 -, 13 -, 17 -, and 3 -fold, respectively). Egg volume was smallest for S. pistillata (the only brooder in the study) and for G. retiformis (which also had the most eggs per polyp, indicating a trade-off between egg size and number). The total reproductive volume per polyp (egg and testes combined) varied three-fold among the six species, and was correlated with a similar range of polyp diameters. In some cases, components of polyp fecundity depended on colony size; egg size in A. hyacinthus and A. nana and the number of planulae per polyp in S. pistillata increased by two- to fourfold with a one to two order of magnitude change in colony size. However, egg size was constant for the other species. Similarly, colony size had no effect on egg or <b>testes</b> number <b>per</b> polyp or <b>testes</b> volume <b>per</b> polyp for any species. We also found striking differences in sex allocation, which may relate to the fertilization biology of these hermaphroditic species. The ratio of total egg volume to <b>testes</b> volume <b>per</b> polyp varied fivefold, and was lowest for S. pistillata (a brooder) and G. retiformis (which produced the most and smallest eggs). The ratio increased with colony size for all species, especially A. hyacinthus. An early investment predominantly in testes allows sex to commence without the initial expense of egg production, perhaps so that colony growth can continue to a larger, safer size. All species had a characteristic colony size at maturation, which varied ninefold among taxa, corresponding to a minimum puberty age of 1 - 3 yr. This is the first comparative study to simultaneously measure male and female function in a range of clonal animals...|$|R
40|$|The testes of Drosophila melanogaster {{provide an}} {{important}} {{model for the}} study of stem cell maintenance and differentiation, meiosis, and soma-germline interactions. Testes are typically isolated from adult males 0 - 3 days after eclosion from the pupal case. The testes of wild-type flies are easily distinguished from other tissues because they are yellow, but the testes of white mutant flies, a common genetic background for laboratory experiments are similar in both shape and color to the fly gut. Performing dissection on a glass microscope slide with a black background makes identifying the testes considerably easier. Testes are removed from the flies using dissecting needles. Compared to protocols that use forceps for testes dissection, our method is far quicker, allowing a well-practiced individual to dissect testes from 200 - 300 wild-type flies per hour, yielding 400 - 600 testes. Testes from white flies or from mutants that reduce testes size are harder to dissect and typically yield 200 - 400 <b>testes</b> <b>per</b> hour. Protocol 1. Make a glass microscope slide with a black background: Cut 20 # white paper to {{the same size as the}} microscope slide. Color one side of the slide-size paper black using a permanent marker (e. g., Sharpie). Apply white glue (Elmer's) to the black side and adhere the paper to the slide. The slide can be reused.

40|$|In mammals, the {{duration}} of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium (DCSE) largely differs between species, but is remarkably stable within a species, usually showing variations of 1 %– 3 %. It is difficult to change the DCSE, e. g., by hormones or chemicals. Initial experiments, employing quantitative RT-PCR, aimed at investigating the diurnal profiles of the clock genes Arntl (previously called Bmal 1) and <b>Per</b> 1 in <b>testes</b> and kidneys of Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). While the testicular levels of Arntl were almost constant, clear diurnal variations were identified for Per 1. In order to clarify whether day length (T-cycle) is a factor for DSCE, adult male hamsters (n 20 per group) were exposed to normal (T 24 h), prolonged (T 25 h), or shortened (T 23 h) T-cycles, with cycles thus being longer or shorter by 4. 2 % compared to the normal condition. Exposure lasted for 43 days, during which the activity of the animals was recorded to confirm entrainment. DCSE was estimated by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine in dividing cells and the immunohistochemical localization of labeled cells in stages I–XII of the seminiferous epithelium. Despite the low variability of the results and the close agreement with previously published data, no effects of prolonged or shortened T-cycles on DCSE could be identified (24 h: 7. 98 6 0. 05 days; 23 h: 7. 94 6 0. 04 days; 25 h: 7. 91 6 0. 03 days; P. 0. 05). The results strongly indicate that the high temporal precision of spermato-genesis is independent of the central circadian clock. circadian rhythm, sperm maturation, spermatogenesis, testi...|$|R
40|$|Global warming has {{important}} implications for the dynamics and ecological impacts of emerging diseases. We investigated temperature effects on scuticociliate, Orchitophrya cf. stellarum, infections in ripe testes of two Pacific northeast sea stars (Asterina miniata Brandt and Pisaster ochraceus Brandt) using laboratory and field approaches. We predicted that a small increase in temperature would result in higher ciliate growth rates and heightened infection intensities. To test this we (1) cultured free-living O. stellarum at 10 and 15 °C and quantified ciliate abundance after 3 days, and (2) housed sea stars of both species at 10 and 15 °C for durations varying from 4 to 21 days and then measured the infection intensity. Ciliate densities in cultures were two orders of magnitude higher in the warmer treatment. Infection intensity was also temperature sensitive: greater proportions of testes were infected and infection stage was more advanced at 15 versus 10 °C, leading to a reduction in spermatozoa and regression of the germinal layer within three weeks. In seven field populations surveyed, we found a tight linear correlation between infection prevalence (percent infected sea stars) and infection intensity (proportion of infected <b>testes</b> <b>per</b> individual and mean infection score). However, 45 % of P. ochraceus testes exhibited heavy infections versus 8 % of A. miniata testes, which may relate to the different thermal habitat of each species: P. ochraceus occurs higher on the shore and likely reaches higher body temperatures at low tide. While the sex ratio of A. miniata is unbiased, P. ochraceus populations are consistently female-biased and show no relationship to infection prevalence (ranged from 30 to 90 %). O. cf. stellarum infections of testes of both sea stars are prevalent in field populations, are highly temperature sensitive, and lead to rapid loss of reproductive potential...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that germ cells or germ cell-conditioned media are capable of {{regulating}} α 2 -macroglobulin (α 2 -MG, a non-specific protease inhibitor) expression by Sertoli cells and hepatocytes cultured in vitro. These results illustrate a possible physiological link between testes and liver regarding α 2 -MG production. Using a series of surgical procedures including castration, hemicastration, and hepatectomy coupled with Northern blot and immunoblot analyses, we report herein that the surge in α 2 -MG expression in the liver in response to inflammation is indeed regulated, at least in part, by the testis via testosterone. It was found that hepatectomy induced at least a tenfold increase in the steady-state mRNA and protein production of α 2 -MG in the liver. However, castration induced a mild but not statistically significant induction of α 2 -MG in the liver in contrast to sham operation or hemicastration alone, when hemicastration alone could induce liver α 2 -MG production by almost fourfold. Perhaps most important of all, hepatectomy accompanied by castration significantly reduced the liver α 2 -MG response to the surgery-induced inflammation compared with hepatectomy alone, illustrating that the removal of the testicles can induce a loss of signal communications between the testis and the liver, rendering a significant loss of the α 2 -MG response to experimentally induced inflammation in the liver. Interestingly, this lack of response of the liver to surgery-induced inflammation regarding α 2 -MG production following castration could be restored, at least in part, by using testosterone implants placed subdermally 6 days prior to orchiectomy. Collectively, these results illustrate that a physiological link does indeed exist between the testis and the liver, and that <b>testes</b> <b>per</b> se can influence the liver α 2 -MG expression in response to inflammation in vivo possibly via testosterone or testosterone-induced biological factor(s). © 2005 Society for Endocrinology. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
