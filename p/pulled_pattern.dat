40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} strake characteristics by analyzing two-dimensional motion during the front crawl stroke of physically disabled swimmers with above and below the elbow amputations, and to draw up guidelines for coaching methods for physically disabled swimmers. The subjects who volunteered for this study were two swimmers with an above elbow amputation. and two swimmers with a below elbow amputation. Front crawl strokes were filmed from a lateral angle at the center of the pool, using an underwater digital video camera. In the results of the motion analysis, the stroke technique was presented for each stroke of a subject to clarify the comparison between the non-amputation side and the amputation side. The stroke on the non-amputation side showed remarkable curvilinear <b>pulling</b> <b>patterns.</b> Moreover, the swimmers kept a better stroke balance by leangthening the gliding distance during the downsweep phase from entry to catch of the stroke on the amputation side. Therefore, it was concluded that stroke characteristics of physically disabled swimmers with amputations could be investigated by analyzing the stroke motion, and this motion analysis could be utilized as an effective method for improving their stroke techniques and performance...|$|R

As a result, issues associated with the resource perspective, i. e., the people and machines actually doing the work, have been largely neglected. Although the process perspective is of most significance, appropriate consideration of the resource perspective is essential for successful implementation of workflow technology. Previous work has identified recurring, generic constructs in the control-flow and data perspectives, and presented them {{in the form of}} control-flow and data patterns. The next logical step is to describe workflow resource patterns that capture the various ways in which resources are represented and utilised in workflows. These patterns include a number of distinct groupings such as push patterns (“the system pushes work to a worker”) and <b>pull</b> <b>patterns</b> (“the worker <b>pulls</b> work from the system”) to describe the many ways in which work can be distributed. By delineating these patterns in a form that is independent of specific workflow technologies and modelling languages, we are able to provide a comprehensive treatment of the resource perspective and we subsequently use these patterns as the basis for a detailed comparison of a number of commercially available workflow management systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Small-diameter {{structural}} fibers {{are being}} considered as reinforcements for high temperature ceramic matrix composite materials, and thus they require characterization. At the NASA Lewis Research Center, a nondestructive optical technique {{was used to}} determine surface strain on a structural fiber, in real time, as it was pulled in a tensile test machine. With this technique, interference or speckle patterns from the laser illuminated fiber test specimen are recorded. As the fiber is <b>pulled,</b> its speckle <b>pattern</b> shifts in proportion to the strain, translation, and rotation components of the sample deformation. Shifting speckle patterns are detected in real time by two linear charge-coupled discharge (CCD) camera arrays, and the images are processed by a hardware correlator. Surface strain is selectively detected on fibers with diameters on the order of 100 mm and can be resolved to 19 microstrain. This system was designed to be robust and compact and generally does not require surface preparation of the structural fibers. For strain detection, two laser beams are positioned incident on the structural fiber being tested, as shown in the photograph, where the test specimen is mounted in a tensile test machine via two coupons. As the fiber is <b>pulled,</b> the speckle <b>pattern</b> produced from each laser beam is detected by one of two CCD arrays located inside the tube {{on the right side of}} the photograph...|$|R

In fact, it challenges the clunky, western-world, Cartesian construct that would differentiate between somatic experience and conceptual practice.|$|R
30|$|In this work, we {{introduce}} position-resolved surface characterization and nanofabrication {{using an}} optical microscope (OM) {{combined with a}} nanopipette-based quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope (nanopipette/QTF-AFM) system. This system is used to accurately determine substrate position and nanoscale phenomena under ambient conditions. Solutions consisting of 5 nm Au nanoparticles, nanowires, and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are deposited onto the substrate through the nano/microaperture of a <b>pulled</b> pipette. Nano/microscale <b>patterning</b> is performed using a nanopipette/QTF-AFM, while position is resolved by monitoring the substrate with a custom OM. With this tool, one can perform surface characterization (force spectroscopy/microscopy) using the quartz tuning fork (QTF) sensor. Nanofabrication is achieved by accurately positioning target materials on the surface, and on-demand delivery and patterning of various solutions for molecular architecture.|$|R

Informal squats form in Western cities experiencing blight and abandonment, with a plethora of vacant buildings reclaimed by a population unaccounted for by the “for-profit” housing market. The civic action taken in East Village and Lower East Side resulted in 11 buildings previously owned by the city to be converted into low-income cooperatives through an urban homesteading program. By examining the squatter movement {{as it relates to}} gentrification, this thesis aims to <b>pull</b> key demographic <b>patterns</b> to indicate how the neighborhood changed during its transition from disinvestment to reinvestment, as well as investigate the feasibility of urban homesteading as an alternative solution to housing crisis...|$|R
50|$|Patterns may {{be drafted}} on paper or in a {{computer}} program designed for patternmaking. Most of the time, in modern American samplerooms, the patternmaker <b>pulls</b> an existing <b>pattern</b> (or block) and makes a modified copy of it to match the new style, either on paper or on computer. If it's a completely new style, the patternmaker will usually drape a rough draft in muslin fabric on a dress form, then show it to the designer to discuss any changes before transferring the markings to paper to create the pattern for cutting. Patterns may also be drafted from measurements, but this method has fallen out of use, as it's less accurate and takes longer than the other methods. Patternmakers are also asked to copy existing garments without damaging them. This is a common practice in American samplerooms.|$|R

Accordingly, {{this study was designed}} to investigate the biomechanics of start techniques used by elite athletes and assess the influence of different start environments. Seven elite ski cross athletes performed starts indoors on a custom-built ramp; six of these also performed starts on an outdoor slope. Horizontal and vertical forces were measured by force transducers located in the handles of the start gate and a 12 -camera motion capture system allowed monitoring of the sagittal knee, hip, shoulder, and elbow kinematics. The starting movement involved Pre, Pull, and Push phases. Significant differences between body sides were observed for peak vertical and resultant forces, resultant impulse, and peak angular velocity of the shoulder joint. Significantly lower peak vertical forces (44 N), higher resultant impulse (0. 114 Ns/kg), and knee joint range of motion (12 °) were observed indoors. Although movement in the ski cross start is generally symmetrical, asymmetric patterns of force were observed among the athletes. Two different movement strategies, i. e. pronounced hip extension or more accentuated elbow flexion, were utilised in the <b>Pull</b> phase. The <b>patterns</b> of force and movement during the indoor and outdoor starts were similar. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{substantial}} amount of work undertaken on internationalization to-date, most has placed little emphasis on the temporal processes and dynamics of internationalization in shaping firm internationalization histories. This is reflected in several problem areas in theories and research regarding internationalization including accelerated internationalization, full and partial de-internationalization and use of multiple modes of entry {{at a point in}} time. This study addressed an important question: what factors and processes affect the way a firms pattern of internationalization changes over time? Although mainstream theories of internationalization and recent advances that link internationalization and entrepreneurship assume the importance of opportunity, there is a paucity of research that that places opportunity as the core process in internationalization. By embracing time as a key dimension, this study reconceptualized internationalization as an entrepreneurial process: as the process of opportunity discovery, evaluation and exploitation in international markets. The research was undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 included a literature review covering the internationalization and entrepreneurship research streams. The discovery-evaluation-exploitation framework from entrepreneurship was used to identify relevant factors and explore eight case studies. By drawing on results from the exploratory research, an initial conceptual model and a set of propositions were developed. In Phase 2, fifteen case studies were theoretically sampled from a pool of small and medium enterprises from the knowledge and non-knowledge based industries in Australia. The data collection and analysis followed a process, event-driven approach to case study research involving the mapping of key sequences of events as well as within and cross case analysis. The results clarified the nature and pattern of opportunity discovery, evaluation and exploitation, and a number of factors that influence this process: the role of prior knowledge, network ties, serendipity, absorptive capacity, bricolage, the nature of uncertainty, feedback mechanisms and effectual versus causal reasoning. The findings also suggest the evolutionary process of firm development and internationalization and show that born globals may be a classification error. The results indicate that full and partial de-internationalization as well as the use of multiple modes of entry are influenced by the interconnectedness of opportunities across the founding, domestic and international context over time; the role of Knightian uncertainty which can push or <b>pull</b> the <b>patterns</b> in many directions and how firms rely on effectual reasoning. The results provide {{a better understanding of the}} basic mechanisms of internationalization. The academic contributions of this thesis include the extension of Jones and Coviello&# 65533;&# 65533;&# 65533;&# 65533;s (2005) model and previous models by developing a dynamic, process model of internationalization that is capable of addressing the temporal and dynamic gaps in internationalization; the integration and reconciliation of extant theories of internationalization by understanding the role of mode of reasoning; and the establishment of opportunity-firm nexus as a suitable unit of analysis in internationalization and international entrepreneurship research. Finally, the managerial contributions include guidance for firms and entrepreneurs in terms of dealing with uncertainty and complexity in international markets using the appropriate mode of reasoning (i. e. effectual, non-predictive approach vs. causal, predictive approach) in the right context and circumstances...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction is {{applied in the}} study of solid state proton transfer processes in hydrogen bonded molecular complexes. Proton transfer processes are of interest where they are responsible for a number of physical and chemical properties within solid state functional materials; their study gives insight into the occurrence of such properties and where they may be targeted and tuned in future materials. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique has been trialled with respect to the potential it offers for high throughput capability for studying proton transfer processes as a function of an external stimulus or across a number of molecular systems. Chapter 1 contains {{a review of the literature}} of the hydrogen bond, including its role in crystal engineering and proton transfer effects. In Chapter 2, the theory behind the analytical techniques used {{in the study of}} hydrogen bonded molecular complexes, in which crystallographic methods are fundamental, are described. In Chapter 3 the research project aims and objectives are presented; these objectives are targeted at the use of single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction in the study and rationalisation of solid state proton transfer processes. In Chapter 4, the experimental methods implemented in this research project to achieve these research goals are reported. Chapter 5 is the first of the result chapters and applies the synchrotron single crystal X-ray diffraction technique in the study of variable temperature proton disorder in centrosymmetric hydrogen bonded carboxylic acid dimers. Chapter 6 focuses on the design of proton transfer systems implementing a number of crystal engineering strategies in the design of short strong hydrogen bonds (SSHBs) for potential proton migration studies. Chapter 7 applies a combination of diffraction methods (synchrotron and laboratory X-ray diffraction) and refinement strategies in the study of temperature dependent proton migration across SSHBs, allowing the potential of these methods in the study of proton migration to be assessed. Chapter 8 is the final application of the synchrotron technique in studies of proton transfer behaviour investigating static proton transfer behaviour in molecular complexes of the proton sponge 1, 8 -bis(dimethylamino) naphthalene with organic acids. The urea-acid inclusion materials presented in Chapter 9 additionally allow the investigation of the hydrogen bond as a crystal engineering tool in the design of hydrogen bonded solvent-inclusion networks. In the last chapter, Chapter 10, conclusions from the findings in Chapters 5 to 9 are <b>pulled</b> together and <b>patterns</b> explored. Drawing on these overall findings, some suggestions for future work are also made...|$|R
