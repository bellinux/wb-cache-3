5000|$|An Independent Inquiry into Foot and Mouth Disease in Scotland {{initiated}} by the Royal Society of Edinburgh was chaired by Professor Ian Cunningham. This embraced not only the scientific aspects of the outbreak, but also economic, social and psychological effects of the event. The costs to Scottish agriculture of the FMD outbreak were estimated to be £231m {{and the loss of}} gross revenue to tourism to be between £200-250m for Scotland as a whole. There should be a regional laboratory in Scotland, and priority be given to the development of testing procedures. The delay in imposing a ban of all movements until the third day after confirmation, the use of less than transparent modelling techniques and the failure to call on more than a fraction of the considerable relevant scientific expertise available in Scotland were criticised. The case for emergency <b>protective</b> <b>vaccination,</b> without subsequent slaughter, was supported by the evidence and it was recommended that contingency plans should include emergency barrier, or ring. vaccination as an adjunct to slaughter in clinical cases. Reservations about the consumption of meat and milk from vaccinated animals were unjustified. The importance of biosecurity at all times and throughout the agricultural industry was emphasised and SEERAD (The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department) should take the lead in establishing standards to be applied in normal times and at the start of an outbreak. A Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland) should be appointed and a [...] "Territorial Veterinary Army" [...] formed from professionals to be called upon should need arise. Burial of carcasses, where conditions permit, is the preferred option for disposal of slaughtered animals. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) should have a clear role in contingency planning and management of any future emergency. There was a need for operational guidelines for slaughtermen. In formulating movement restriction, the dispersed nature of many holdings should be taken into account. There should be a clear and consistent strategy for compensation for slaughtered animals. The closing down of the country initially for no more than three weeks and then reopening in non-affected areas was recommended. Great importance was placed on contingency planning, on the need for regular exercises and on the setting up of an independent standing committee to monitor the maintenance of effective planning. In all, some twenty seven recommendations were made to the Scottish Executive.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Secondary {{prophylaxis}} of {{cervical cancer}} consisting in cytology screening tests, despite its effectiveness, does not {{achieve the desired}} results. For several years, primary prophylaxis has been available {{in the form of}} <b>protective</b> <b>vaccinations.</b> At present, two vaccine preparations are available on the market, and studies conducted on these preparations confirm their almost 100 % effectiveness in the prevention of types of HPV present in the vaccine. Objective: Analysis of the programmes of <b>protective</b> <b>vaccinations</b> against HPV carried out during the period 2008 – 2013 in the Lublin Region. Material/Methods: The material used in the study was data obtained from the relevant organs of the territorial self-government concerning programmes of vaccinations against HPV, demographic data pertaining to girls aged 10 – 18 living in the Lublin Region, as well as data published by the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIZP–PZH). The method applied in the study was analysis of records. Results: During the period 2008 – 2013, in the Lublin Region a total of 5, 496 girls were vaccinated within the health programmes. The mean immunization coverage in Lublin is 50 %, and in Radzyń Podlaski 59 %. The percentage contribution of vaccinations guaranteed free by the local authorities, with relation to the total number of vaccinations performed in the Lublin Region, was from 60 to 77 %. The units of territorial self-government allocated the amount of PLN 5, 125, 359 for the performance of projects associated with execution of free vaccinations. Discussion: Among the total number of girls vaccinated against HPV, a considerable percentage were those vaccinated within the prophylactic programmes carried out by the units of territorial self-government. The programmes of free <b>protective</b> <b>vaccinations</b> against HPV began in 4 cities in the Lublin Region, and are continued only in two (Lublin and Radzyń Podlaski). Long-term observation of girls subjected to vaccinations from the aspect of maintenance of the immune response after vaccination should become an important element of performance of health programmes concerning vaccinations against HPV. Conclusions: Among the total number of girls vaccinated against HPV, those vaccinated within prophylactic programmes carried out by territorial self-government units made up a considerable percentage. Programmes of free preventive vaccinations against HPV began in 4 cities in the Lublin Region, but are continued in only 2.

40|$|Chronic immune {{activation}} {{is one of}} {{the hallmarks}} of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It is present also, with very similar characteristics, in very large human populations infested with helminthic infections. We have tried to review the studies addressing the changes in the immune profiles and responses of hosts infected with either one of these two chronic infections. Not surprisingly, several of the immune derangements and impairments seen in HIV infection, and {{considered by many to be}} the “specific” effects of HIV, can be found in helminth-infected but HIV-noninfected individuals and can thus be accounted for by the chronic immune activation itself. A less appreciated element in chronic immune activation is the immune suppression and anergy which it may generate. Both HIV and helminth infections represent this aspect in a very wide and illustrative way. Different degrees of anergy and immune hyporesponsiveness are present in these infections and probably have far-reaching effects on the ability of the host to cope with these and other infections. Furthermore, they may have important practical implications, especially with regard to <b>protective</b> <b>vaccinations</b> against AIDS, for populations chronically infected with helminths and therefore widely anergic.

40|$|Oyster {{farming is}} one of the most {{important}} aquaculture industries in the world. However, its productivity is increasingly limited by viral disease and we do not yet have management practices, such as <b>protective</b> <b>vaccination,</b> that can control these disease outbreaks. Hence, in the current study we investigated the expression of known anti-viral genes in oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in response to primary and secondary encounter with a virus associated molecular pattern (dsRNA), and tested whether a common form of epigenetic gene regulation (DNA methylation) was associated with the expression of these anti-viral genes. Injection of dsRNA into the adductor muscle resulted in the rapid and transient expression of virus recognition receptors (TLR & MDA 5), whereas several anti-viral signalling (IRF & SOC- 1) and effector (PKR & viperin) genes were still up-regulated at one week post primary challenge (p 0. 05). These results collectively suggest that C. gigas does not have an enhanced anti-viral gene response (immune-priming) to secondary dsRNA challenge and that the sustained up-regulation of anti-viral signalling and effector genes following primary challenge is unlikely to be associated with upstream DNA methylation levels. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{spread of}} H 5 N 1 avian {{influenza}} continues to pose an economic burden {{and a public}} health risk worldwide. Despite this, estimates of the transmissibility of infection exist in {{only a handful of}} settings and vary considerably. Using final size methods and flock-level infection data from a field trial of mass vaccination, we obtained the first estimates of the transmissibility of infection between and within flocks in Indonesia. We also found that outbreaks in areas designated as vaccination zones were less transmissible than in non-vaccination zones. However, this reduction is only comparable with a limited degree of <b>protective</b> <b>vaccination</b> coverage. Quantifying the overall effect of vaccination in these zones remains challenging. However, this result would appear to imply that, although the interventions applied in vaccination zones were not sufficient to completely prevent transmission in all areas, when outbreaks occur, they are less transmissible than those in areas where vaccination was not applied. This could be either a direct or an indirect effect of vaccination. Given the dynamism of small-scale poultry production in Indonesia, more regular vaccination may be required to ensure that infection is fully controlled in vaccination zones...|$|E
40|$|Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) causes mammary {{carcinoma}} or lymphoma in mice. An increasing body {{of evidence}} in recent years supports its involvement also in human sporadic breast cancer. It is thus of importance to develop new strategies to impair the development, growth and metastasis of MMTV-associated cancers. The signal peptide of the envelope precursor protein of this virus: MMTV-p 14 (p 14) is an excellent target for such strategies, due to unique characteristics distinct from its regular endoplasmic reticulum targeting function. These include cell surface expression in: Murine cancer cells that harbor the virus, human breast cancer (MCF- 7) cells that ectopically express p 14, as well as cultured human cells derived from an invasive ductal breast carcinoma positive for MMTV sequences. These findings support its use in signal peptide-based immune targeting. Indeed, priming and boosting mice with p 14 elicits a specific anti-signal peptide immune response sufficient for <b>protective</b> <b>vaccination</b> against MMTV-associated tumors. Furthermore, passive immunization {{using a combination of}} anti-p 14 monoclonal antibodies or the transfer of T-cells from immunized mice (Adoptive Cell Transfer) is also therapeutically effective. With reports demonstrating involvement of MMTV in human breast cancer, we propose the immune-mediated targeting of p 14 as a strategy for prevention, treatment and diagnosis of MMTV-associated cancers...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether in children receiving immunosuppressive therapy due to inflammatory systemic connective tissue diseases the protective concentration of the anti-HBs antibodies produced after vaccination against type B virus hepatitis in infancy is maintained. Material and methods : The concentration of anti-HBs antibodies was assessed in the sera of 50 children with inflammatory connective tissue diseases – 37 girls (74 %) and 13 boys (26 %), aged 1. 5 – 17. 5 years – during the immunosuppressive treatment, which lasted at least 6 months. The control group consisted of 50 healthy children – 28 girls (56 %) and 22 boys (44 %) aged 2 – 17 years. All children were vaccinated in infancy with Engerix B vaccine according to the 0 – 1 – 6 months schedule. The antibody concentration of ≥ 10 mIU/ml in patients is regarded as protective.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cooperation of CD 4 + T {{helper cells}} with {{specific}} B cells {{is crucial for}} <b>protective</b> <b>vaccination</b> against pathogens by inducing long-lived neutralizing antibody responses. During infection with persistence-prone viruses, prolonged virus replication correlates with low neutralizing antibody responses. We recently described that a viral mutant of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which lacks a T helper epitope, counterintuitively induced an enhanced protective antibody response. Likewise, partial depletion of the CD 4 + T cell compartment by using anti-CD 4 antibodies enhanced protective antibodies. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we have developed a protocol to selectively reduce the CD 4 + T cell response against viral CD 4 + T cell epitopes. We demonstrate that in vivo treatment with LCMV-derived MHC-II peptides induced non-responsiveness of specific CD 4 + T cells without affecting CD 4 + T cell reactivity towards other antigens. This was associated with accelerated virus-specific neutralizing IgG-antibody responses. In contrast to a complete absence of CD 4 + T cell help, tolerisation did not impair CD 8 + T cell responses. CONCLUSIONS: This result reveals a novel "negative vaccination" strategy where specific CD 4 + T cell unresponsiveness {{may be used to}} enhance the delayed protective antibody responses in chronic virus infections...|$|E
40|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) is {{a life-threatening}} disease caused by human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). A <b>protective</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{has been under}} development for several decades. The main targets for the vaccines are surface glycoproteins (gp 120) on the viral envelope of HIV- 1. Gp 120 is characterized by functionally important variable (V) loops {{that are hard to}} study experimentally. Here, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are harnessed to improve the current understanding of the gp 120 loop dynamics. According to previous MD studies the major variable loop V 3 shows significant flexibility in monomeric gp 120. This is also observed in this study. Additionally, the flexibility of the V 1 /V 2 domain in monomeric gp 120 is demonstrated for the first time. However, gp 120 in the trimer context tells a different story. According to the simulations, the major variable loops have lost their flexibility, mobility, and concerted motion among the loops in the trimer. The reduced motion seems to be due to inter-gp 120 interactions, where the V 2 and V 3 loops play key roles in stabilizing the trimer apex. The results provide significant insight into gp 120 variable loop dynamics on an atomic level in the native trimeric state and facilitate understanding the mechanism of the viral entry and its inhibition...|$|E

This paper describes a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) application to illustrate its potential support to policy makers in choosing the control strategy that best meets all of the conflicting interests. The presented application focused on the evaluation of alternative strategies to control Classical Swine Fever (CSF) epidemics within the European Union (EU) according to the preferences of the European Chief Veterinary Officers (CVO). The performed analysis was centred on the three high-level objectives of epidemiology, economics and social ethics. The appraised control alternatives consisted of the EU compulsory control strategy, a pre-emptive slaughter strategy, a <b>protective</b> <b>vaccination</b> strategy and a suppressive vaccination strategy. Using averaged preference weights of the elicited CVOs, the preference ranking of the control alternatives was determined for six EU regions.

Data collection tools comprised a questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results Vaccination rate for 2009 pandemic influenza A(H 1 N 1) among HCW was low (12. 7 %). Most of the respondents believed the vaccine was not safe and <b>protective.</b> <b>Vaccination</b> refusal was mostly related to the vaccine's side effects, disbelief to vaccine's protectiveness, negative news about the vaccine and the perceived negative attitude of the Prime Minister to the vaccine.

40|$|Detailed {{characterization}} of the protective T-cell response in salmonellosis is a pressing unmet need {{in light of the}} global burden of human Salmonella infections and the likely contribution of CD 4 T cells to immunity against this intracellular infection. In previous studies screening patient sera against antigen arrays, SseB was noteworthy as a serodominant target of adaptive immunity, inducing significantly raised antibody responses in HIV-seronegative compared with seropositive patients. SseB is a secreted protein, part of the Espa superfamily, localized to the bacterial surface and forming part of the translocon of the type III secretion system (T 3 SS) encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 2. We demonstrate here that SseB is also a target of CD 4 T-cell immunity, generating a substantial response after experimental infection in human volunteers, with around 0. 1 % of the peripheral repertoire responding to it. HLA-DR/peptide binding studies indicate that this protein encompasses a number of peptides with ability to bind to several different HLA-DR alleles. Of these, peptide 11 (p 11) was shown in priming of both HLA-DR 1 and HLA-DR 4 transgenic mice to contain an immunodominant CD 4 epitope. Analysis of responses in human donors showed immunity focused on p 11 and another epitope in peptide 2. The high frequency of SseB-reactive CD 4 T cells and the broad applicability to diverse HLA genotypes coupled with previous observations of serodominance and <b>protective</b> <b>vaccination</b> in mouse challenge experiments, make SseB a plausible candidate for next-generation Salmonella vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Elderly {{humans are}} prone to severe {{infection}} with human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). The aging of today’s human popu-lation warrants the development of <b>protective</b> <b>vaccination</b> strategies aimed specifically at the elderly. This may require special approaches due to deteriorating immune function. To design and test vaccination strategies tailored to the elderly population, {{we need to understand}} the host response to HRSV vaccination and infection at old age. Moreover, the preclinical need for testing of candidate vaccines requires translational models resembling susceptibility to the (unadapted) human pathogen. Here, we ex-plored the effects of aging on immunity and protection induced by a model HRSV vaccine candidate in a translational aging model in cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) and examined possibilities to optimize vaccination concepts for the elderly. We immu-nized young and aged cotton rats with a live-attenuated recombinant HRSV vaccine candidate and analyzed the induced im-mune response to and protection against challenge with HRSV. In old cotton rats, HRSV infection persisted longer, and vaccina-tion induced less protection against infection. Aged animals developed lower levels of vaccine-induced IgG, virus-neutralizing serum antibodies, and IgA in lungs. Moreover, booster responses to HRSV challenge were impaired in animals vaccinated at an older age. However, increased dose and reduced attenuation of vaccine improved protection even in old animals. This study shows that cotton rats provide a model for studying the effects of aging on the immune response to the human respiratory pathogen HRSV and possibilities to optimize vaccine concepts for the elderly...|$|E
40|$|There {{is still}} no {{licensed}} vaccine against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) which causes severe bronchiolitis in yound children. The nucleoprotein N, {{a major component of}} the RSV nucleocapsid, is remarkably conserved among RSV subtypes and is recognized as a target of protective T cell responses. We reported a method to produce recombinant N assembling in homogenous rings composed of 10 - 11 N subunits. Intranasal vaccination of adult BALB/c mice with N-rings and detoxified E. coli enterotoxin LT(R 192 G) as adjuvant (provided by J. Clements, USA), proved protective against an RSV challenge, without causing significant lung inflammatory reactions. In the present study, we evaluated the vaccine potential of N-rings in 5 to 7 day-old BALB/c pups: a single intranasal administration of N-rings with LT(R 192 G) provided a significant reduction of the viral load after an RSV challenge at five weeks of age. However, neonatal vaccination also generated an enhanced lung infiltration by eosinophils following the RSV challenge. Analysis of antibody subclasses and cytokines produced after an RSV challenge or a boost administration of the vaccine suggested that neonatal vaccination induced a long lasting Th 2 biased local immune memory. This early Th 2 bias could be prevented by adding CpG-ODN to the vaccine formulation, but then the protection against virus replication was also reduced. In conclusion, <b>protective</b> <b>vaccination</b> against RSV can be achieve in neonates but requires an appropriate combinations of adjuvant...|$|E
40|$|Marek’s disease (MD) is a {{lymphoproliferative}} disease of domestic chickens caused by Marek’s disease virus (MDV), an oncogenic and highly contagious α-herpesvirus. MD has been controlled by vaccination but sporadic outbreaks of MD still occur {{in some parts}} of the world. Efforts to improve vaccine efficacy have continued in both research communities and vaccine industries. We reported the host genetic variation affecting Marek’s disease vaccine-induced immunity in chickens earlier. In this study, we evaluated chicken lines, vaccines, and line by vaccine interaction on the <b>protective</b> efficacy of <b>vaccination</b> against MD. Specific pathogen free chickens from the relatively resistant line 6 3 and the highly susceptible line 7 2 were primarily used to evaluate the protection by three kinds of vaccines (rMd 5 ΔMeq, CVI 988 /Rispens, and HVT) upon challenge with a very virulent plus strain of MDV, vv+ 648 A. Our data confirmed that both the chicken line and the vaccine significantly affected the <b>protective</b> efficacy of <b>vaccination</b> and showed that a chicken line by vaccine interaction, in most of the trials, also altered vaccine protective efficacy. More interestingly, although the protective index of all vaccine strains was higher in resistant than in susceptible line of chickens, the difference for HVT protection was striking and warrants further study. The findings may have important implications for vaccine development as well as for selective use of particular vaccines in specific lines of chickens to achieve maximum protection at minimized costs...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} how public opinion surveys {{can be designed}} to collect information pertinent to computational behavior modeling, and we present {{the results of a}} public opinion and behavior survey conducted during the 2009 - 2010 H 1 N 1 influenza pandemic. The results are used to parameterize the Health Belief Model of individual health-protective decision making. Survey subjects were asked questions about their perceptions of the then-circulating influenza and attitudes towards two personal <b>protective</b> behaviors: <b>vaccination</b> and avoidance of crowds. We empirically address two important issues in applying the Health Belief Model of behavior to computational infectious disease simulation: (1) the factors dynamically influencing the states of the Health Belief Model variables and (2) the appropriateness of the Health Belief Model in describing self-protective behavior in the context of pandemic influenza.
