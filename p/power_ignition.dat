40|$|International audienceThe ammonia {{absorption}} {{properties of}} polyaniline elaborated by the pulsed-plasma technique are studied. These properties {{depend on the}} structure of the polymer which is associated not only to plasma parameters such as peak <b>power,</b> <b>ignition</b> and extinction durations, pulse frequency and duty cycle, but also to the type of doping agent. Two methods of analysis are used: the UV/vis spectrometry and the quartz crystal microbalance. The results show that input power is the most influent plasma parameter on the sensitivity of the polyaniline film. Moreover, the oxidative doping is more efficient than the acidic one to create more polarons and then to obtain a more sensitive layer. The gravimetric study shows that the interaction between ammonia molecules and iodine-doped polyaniline corresponds to a multilayer reversible chemisorption...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory {{conducted}} a study of laser safety in potentially flammable environments. Researchers measured threshold igniting powers {{as a function of}} beam diameter for butane and propane-air mixtures by laser-heating targets placed on optical fiber tips using a 1064 nm laser. The minimum igniting powers for propane-air and butane-air were about 250 and 300 mW, respectively. Threshold igniting powers for propane-air were approximately proportional to beam diameter for beam diameters from 0. 1 to 2. 0 mm. Results suggest that relatively powerful beams may be used in these atmospheres without causing ignition, provided the beam diameter is controlled. Threshold ignition delay times using 91125 and 62. 51 125 pm fibers were approximately proportional to the inverse square of the laser <b>power.</b> <b>Ignition</b> delays were about 45 ms or longer for laser powers up to 800 mW.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (NIOSH, PRL) conducted a study of laser safety in potentially flammable environments. Researchers conducted experiments to estimate the {{mean and standard deviation}} of laser powers needed to ignite 6 % methane-air atmospheres using single mode optical fiber tips covered by two types of iron oxide (Fe 304 and (FeMn) 203) mixed with a ceramic adhesive. The iron oxides, heated by a 1064 nm continuous wave laser, ignited the methane-air mixtures,at similar powers. The minimum igniting power and maximum non-igniting power (10 tests) were 407 and 350 mW, respectively, using a 62. 5 pm fiber. Laser beams guided by 125 and 80 pm diameter cladding single mode fibers produced similar methane-air igniting powers.

40|$|The {{influence}} of ignition manner on micropyretic synthesis of low exothermic reaction with Ni+Al is numerically investigated in this study. The different <b>ignition</b> <b>powers</b> and <b>ignition</b> regions are chosen {{to illustrate the}} influences {{on the length of}} pre-heating zone and propagation velocity of the specimens. The numerical results indicate that a lower <b>ignition</b> <b>power</b> or igniting in the center region accelerates the heat loss.

In the extreme case, the combustion front may not complete the propagation for the reaction with a lower pre-exponential factor. In addition, it is also shown that a higher <b>ignition</b> <b>power</b> consumes the additional ignition energy to ignite the specimens.

The work was based on the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) and aerial photos unconventional. The total area studied was 895. 86 ha. Of this total, 584. 07 ha is occupied by agriculture and pasture. This last class, were 548. 40 ha of pasture, composing 61. 21 % of the total area.

40|$|This work aims to {{investigate}} and characterize the photo-ignition phenomenon of MWCNT/ferrocene mixtures by using a continuous wave (CW) xenon (Xe) light source, {{in order to find}} the <b>power</b> <b>ignition</b> threshold by employing a different type of light source as was used in previous research (i. e., pulsed Xe lamp). The experimental photo-ignition tests were carried out by varying the weight ratio of the used mixtures, luminous power, and wavelength range of the incident Xe light by using selective optical filters. For a better explanation of the photo-induced ignition process, the absorption spectra of MWCNT/ferrocene mixtures and ferrocene only were obtained. The experimental results show that the luminous power (related to the entire spectrum of the Xe lamp) needed to trigger the ignition of MWCNT/ferrocene mixtures decreases with increasing metal nanoparticles content according to previously published results when using a different type of light source (i. e., pulsed vs CW Xe light source). Furthermore, less light power is required to trigger photo-ignition when moving towards the ultraviolet (UV) region. This is in agreement with the measured absorption spectra, which present higher absorption values in the UV–vis region for both MWCNT/ferrocene mixtures and ferrocene only diluted in toluene. Finally, a chemo-physical interpretation of the ignition phenomenon is proposed whereby ferrocene photo-excitation, due to photon absorption, produces ferrocene itself in its excited form and is thus capable of promoting electron transfer to MWCNTs. In this way, the resulting radical species, FeCp 2 +∙ and MWCNT −, easily react with oxygen giving rise to the ignition of MWCNT/ferrocene samples...|$|E
40|$|Collisionless {{electron}} beam-plasma instabilities {{are expected}} {{to play an important}} role in fast ignition. Such beams are produced by the short high <b>power</b> <b>ignition</b> laser interacting with long scale length plasmas. Here we present results from a one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson code used to investigate different electron beam temperatures and background plasma conditions. The simulations demonstrate that the beam-plasma instabilities drive large amplitude electrostatic waves that undergo the parametric decay instability driving backwards propagating electrostatic waves and much lower frequency ion acoustic waves. Saturation of the beam-plasma instability creates a plateau in the electron distribution function consistent with quasi-linear theory. We observe the creation of high energy tails in the electron and ion distribution functions, formed by the trapping of particles in the waves formed during the collapse of the beam. The high energy tails of the ion distribution are found to account for up to one-half of the energy gained by the ion population from the beam collapse. Furthermore, at the highest electron beam temperatures we observe the formation of long-lived coherent phase-space structures. These phase-space structures are a direct consequence of the cascade nature of the parametric instability driving up lower wavenumber modes that have higher phase velocities that can in turn accelerate electrons to energies in excess of the initial beam energy. A quasi-linear treatment also shows similar effects but the simulations are clearly beyond a simple quasi-linear treatment and demonstrate the transfer of energy from an incident beam to the ion population via collisionless effects. The implications of these mechanisms for the fast ignition scheme will be discussed. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to find ways to}} improve combustion and reduce emissions from supercharged natural gas engines. In-cylinder flow measurements were made with laser doppler velocimetry, LDV, heat release was calculated from cylinder pressures and emissions were measured at various locations. The original combustion chamber was a low turbulence-generating geometry, resulting in an overall slow combustion. Four new combustion chambers were designed, to generate high turbulence and hence a fast combustion. The piston-geometry with the highest turbulence was more tolerant for highly diluted mixtures in terms of engine stability, which is favorable for lean burn operation or high amounts of EGR at stoichiometric operation. The flow-measuring tests were made on a single-cylinder engine. Base-engine performance measurements were conducted on a multi-cylinder version of the engine. The results show that pulse-width fuel-injection close to the cylinders (at the throttle) resulted in variations in air/fuel ratio between the cylinders. Cycle-to-cycle variations were high in cylinders with leaner mixtures, and NOX emissions were high from cylinders with richer mixtures. Late ignition timing, high boost pressure and lean mixture led to the need for a small spark gap in order to avoid misfires with the original ignition system. A larger gap results in higher spark energy, but the ignition system must be powerful enough not to cause misfires. The original ignition settings were retarded to suppress NOX formation. The HC and CO emissions were also lower than at maximum brake torque ignition (MBT) due to higher temperatures during expansion and exhaust, leading to more post-oxidation. Load and efficiency were reduced with the retarded ignition timing. A new engine control system was installed with high <b>power</b> <b>ignition</b> modules, enabling a larger spark gap. Idle quality was improved and maximum load was increased with this new system. Cylinder-individual control of fuel injection and ion-current measurements in all six cylinders made it possible to adapt port fuel-injection and cylinder balancing. Both cycle-to-cycle and cylinder-to-cylinder variations were reduced with cylinder balancing at lean operation. The ion-current integral and variations in the integral were used to perform the cylinder balancing. Lean burn operation was compared to stoichiometric operation diluted with EGR. The raw emissions of NOX and HC were higher at lean burn operation than for the EGR case. NOX emissions after a three-way catalyst were up to 700 times higher at lean operation (29. 5 g/kWh vs. 0. 042 g/kWh), and HC emissions approximately 20 times higher (2. 7 g/kWh vs. 0. 13 g/kWh). The early flame period (ignition to 5 % burned) was much longer for the EGR case, since EGR has a stronger influence on laminar flame speed than excess air. The main combustion duration (10 % to 90 % burned) was similar for both cases. The ion-current signal was very weak for the lean burn cases, but a strong signal was found for the EGR case...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the UK, the {{flammability}} {{of domestic}} upholstered furniture is regulated by a cigarette composite test and flame ignition tests for components.
