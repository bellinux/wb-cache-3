5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple <b>pleiotropic</b> reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E

25|$|CD44 (PGP1) is an {{adhesion}} molecule that has <b>pleiotropic</b> roles in cell signaling, migration and homing. It has multiple isoforms, including CD44H, which exhibits high affinity for hyaluronate and CD44V which has metastatic properties.|$|E
25|$|Honokiol is a <b>pleiotropic</b> compound, {{meaning it}} {{is able to}} act on the body through a number of pathways. This {{diversity}} of interaction makes it a viable therapy for a number of conditions in the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal system. It has been shown to have antitumorigenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects as well.|$|E
25|$|Some traits do {{not appear}} to be adaptive, that is, they have a neutral or {{deleterious}} effect on fitness in the current environment. Because genes have <b>pleiotropic</b> effects, not all traits may be functional: they may be what Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin called spandrels, features brought about by neighbouring adaptations, like the triangular areas under neighbouring arches in architecture which began as functionless features.|$|E
25|$|In medical research, DMSO {{is often}} used as a drug vehicle in in vivo and in vitro experiments. However, when a {{researcher}} is unaware of its <b>pleiotropic</b> effects, or when the control groups are not carefully planned, a bias can occur; an effect of DMSO can be falsely attributed to the drug. For example, even a very low dose of DMSO has a powerful protective effect against paracetamol (acetaminophen)-induced liver injury in mice.|$|E
25|$|GCs {{are part}} of the {{feedback}} mechanism in the immune system which reduces certain aspects of immune function, such as reduction of inflammation. They are therefore used in medicine to treat diseases caused by an overactive immune system, such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and sepsis. GCs have many diverse (<b>pleiotropic)</b> effects, including potentially harmful side effects, and as a result are rarely sold over the counter. They also interfere with some of the abnormal mechanisms in cancer cells, so they are used in high doses to treat cancer. This includes inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation, as in the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias, and the mitigation of side effects of anticancer drugs.|$|E
25|$|Most genes {{have more}} than one effect on the {{phenotype}} of an organism (pleiotropism). Some of these effects may be visible, and others cryptic, so it is often important to look beyond the most obvious effects of a gene to identify other effects. Cases occur where a gene affects an unimportant visible character, yet a change in fitness is recorded. In such cases the gene's other (cryptic or 'physiological') effects may be responsible for the change in fitness. Pleiotropism is posing continual challenges for many clinical dysmorphologists in their attempt to explain birth defects which affect one or more organ system, with only a single underlying causative agent. For many <b>pleiotropic</b> disorders, the connection between the gene defect and the various manifestations is neither obvious, nor well understood.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{literature}} review writes that studies in several nations {{have found a}} relationship between myopia and higher IQ and between myopia and school achievement. Several, but not all, studies have found hyperopia {{to be associated with}} lower IQ and school achievements. A common explanation for myopia is near-work. Regarding the relationship to IQ, several explanations have been proposed. One is that the myopic child is better adapted at reading, and reads and studies more, which increases intelligence. The reverse explanation is that the intelligent and studious child reads more which causes myopia. Another is that the myopic child have an advantage at IQ testing which is near work because of less eye strain. Still another explanation is that <b>pleiotropic</b> gene(s) affect the size of both brain and eyes simultaneously. A study of Chinese schoolchildren found that after controlling for age, gender, school, parental myopia, fatherâ€™s education, and books read per week, myopia was still associated with high nonverbal IQ. Nonverbal IQ was a more important explanation than books read per week.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} targets of all Raf enzymes are MKK1(MEK1) and MKK2(MEK2). Although {{the structure of}} the enzyme-substrate complex c-Raf:MKK1 is unknown, it can be precisely modelled after the KSR2:MKK1 complex. Here no actual catalysis takes place, but it is thought to be highly similar to the way Raf binds to its substrates. The main interaction interface is provided by the C-terminal lobes of both kinase domains; the large, disordered, proline-rich loop unique to MKK1 and MKK2 also {{plays an important role in}} its positioning to Raf (and KSR). These MKKs become phosphorylated at at least two sites on their activation loops upon binding to Raf: this will activate them too. The targets of the kinase cascade are ERK1 and ERK2, that are selectively activated by MKK1 or MKK2. ERKs have numerous substrates in cells; they are also capable of translocating into the nucleus to activate nuclear transcription factors. Activated ERKs are <b>pleiotropic</b> effectors of cell physiology and play an important role in the control of gene expression involved in the cell division cycle, cell migration, inhibition of apoptosis, and cell differentiation.|$|E
25|$|Adalia bipunctata, the two-spotted ladybird, {{is highly}} polymorphic. Its basic form is red with two black spots, {{but it has}} many other forms, the most {{important}} being melanic, with black elytra and red spots. The curious fact about this morphism is that, although the melanic forms are more common in industrial areas, its maintenance {{has nothing to do}} with cryptic camouflage and predation. The Coccinellidae as a whole are highly noxious, and experiments with birds and other predators have found this species quite exceptionally distasteful. Therefore, their colour is warning (aposematic) colouration, and all the morphs are quite conspicuous against green vegetation. The field studies identify differing proportions of morphs at different times of year and in different places, which indicates a high level of selection. However, the basis of that selection is still not known for sure, though many theories have been proposed. Since all the morphs are aposematically coloured, it seems unlikely that the difference between the colour of morphs is directly under selection. Perhaps <b>pleiotropic</b> effects of the genes acting on colour also affect the beetle's physiology, and hence its relative fitness. A similar polymorphic system is found in many other species in this family: Harmonia axyridis is a good example.|$|E
500|$|The protein {{products}} of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of pleiotropy, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. The loci of these <b>pleiotropic</b> toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular cis-regulatory elements. For example, while a non-pleiotropic rhodopsin gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element {{just a few hundred}} base pairs long, the <b>pleiotropic</b> eyeless cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs. The regulatory networks involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls [...] "scores to hundreds" [...] of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each. All this complexity enables genes involved {{in the development of the}} embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.|$|E
500|$|In humans, a skin {{condition}} called piebaldism {{is caused by}} more than a dozen distinct mutations in the KIT gene. Piebaldism in humans is characterized by a white forelock, and pigmentless patches of skin on the forehead, brow, face, ventral trunk and extremities. Outside of pigmentation, piebaldism is an otherwise benign condition. In pigs, the [...] "patch," [...] "belted," [...] and commercial [...] "white" [...] colors are caused by mutations on the KIT gene. The best-known model for KIT gene function is the mouse, in which over 90 alleles have been described. The various alleles produce everything from white toes and blazes to black-eyed white mice, panda-white to sashed and belted. Many of these alleles are lethal in the homozygous state, lethal when combined, or sublethal due to anemia. Male mice with KIT mutations are often sterile. To date, no such <b>pleiotropic</b> effects have been described in horses with KIT mutations.|$|E

2500|$|The GR is {{expressed}} in almost every cell {{in the body and}} regulates genes controlling the development, metabolism, and immune response. [...] Because the receptor gene {{is expressed}} in several forms, it has many different (<b>pleiotropic)</b> effects {{in different parts of the}} body.|$|E
2500|$|Lethal white {{syndrome}} {{has been}} described by researchers as both dominantly and recessively inherited. Lethal white syndrome is described as recessive because heterozygotes (written Oo or N/O) are not affected by intestinal aganglionosis. However, if the frame pattern trait is included, inheritance of the trait follows an incomplete dominant pattern. The concept of [...] "recessive" [...] and [...] "dominant" [...] antedate molecular biology and technically apply only to traits, not to genes themselves. In <b>pleiotropic</b> conditions, such as lethal white syndrome, the application of [...] "recessive" [...] or [...] "dominant" [...] can be ambiguous.|$|E
2500|$|Mutations in {{transcription}} {{factors are}} tightly connected to blood cancers, as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For example, Ikaros {{is known to}} be regulator of numerous biological events. Mice with no Ikaros lack B cells, Natural killer and T cells. [...] Ikaros has six zinc fingers domains, four are conserved DNA-binding domain and two are for dimerization. Very important finding is, that different zinc fingers are involved in binding to different place in DNA and this is the reason for <b>pleiotropic</b> effect of Ikaros and different involvement in cancer, but mainly are mutations associated with BCR-Abl patients and it is bad prognostic marker.|$|E
2500|$|Genetic {{conditions}} which affect {{more than one}} physical traitâ€”in the case of lethal white syndrome, both pigment cells and enteric nerve cellsâ€”are termed <b>pleiotropic.</b> The unusual instance of pleiotropy in LWS foals suggested early on that the syndrome was related to an important section of embryonic tissue called the neural crest. As the name suggests, the stem cells of the neural crest are precursors to nerve cells. [...] Another cell type that descends from neural crest cells are melanocytes, pigment-producing cells found in hair follicles and skin. The migration of nerve- and melanocyte-precursors {{from the top of}} the embryo to their eventual destinations is carefully controlled by regulatory genes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{autocrine}} or paracrine secretion of IL-2 {{can bind to}} {{that same}} Th cell or neighboring Th's via the IL-2R thus driving proliferation and clonal expansion. The Th cells receiving both signals of activation and proliferation will then become Th0 cells (T helper 0) cell that secrete IL-2, IL-4 and interferon gamma (IFN-Î³). The Th0 cells will then differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells depending on cytokine environment. IFN-Î³ drives Th1 cell production while IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit Th1 cell production. Conversely, IL-4 drives Th2 cell production and IFN-Î³ inhibits Th2 cells. [...] It {{should be noted that}} these cytokines are <b>pleiotropic</b> and carry out many other functions of the immune response.|$|E
2500|$|Statistical {{research}} has shown that the various phenotypes are more, or less, likely to suffer a variety of diseases. For example, an individual's susceptibility to cholera (and other diarrheal infections) is correlated with their blood type: those with type O blood are the most susceptible, while those with type AB are the most resistant. Between these two extremes are the A and B blood types, with type A being more resistant than type B. This suggests that the <b>pleiotropic</b> effects of the genes set up opposing selective forces, thus maintaining a balance. Geographical distribution of blood groups (the differences in gene frequency between populations) is broadly consistent with the classification of [...] "races" [...] developed by early anthropologists on the basis of visible features.|$|E
2500|$|The DNA damage {{theory of}} aging is a {{prominent}} explanation for aging {{at the molecular}} level. [...] This theory postulates that DNA damage is ubiquitous in the biological world and is {{the primary cause of}} aging. [...] Consistent with this theory, genetic elements that regulate repair of DNA damage in somatic cells were proposed to have <b>pleiotropic</b> effects that are beneficial during early development but allow deleterious consequences later in life. As an example, studies of mammalian brain and muscle have shown that DNA repair capability is relatively high during early development when cells are dividing mitotically, but declines substantially as cells enter the post-mitotic state. [...] The reduction in DNA repair capability presumably reflects an evolutionary adaptation for diverting resources from cell duplication and repair to more essential neuronal and muscular functions. [...] The effect of reducing expression of DNA repair capability is to allow increased accumulation of DNA damage. [...] This then impairs gene transcription and causes the progressive loss of cellular and tissue functions that define aging.|$|E
2500|$|Phosphorylated LAT {{recruits}} SLP-76 to the membrane, {{where it}} can then bring in PLC-Î³, VAV1, Itk and potentially PI3K. [...] PLC-Î³ cleaves PI(4,5)P2 on the inner leaflet of the membrane to create the active intermediaries diacylglycerol (DAG), inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3); PI3K also acts on PIP2, phosphorylating it to produce phosphatidlyinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). [...] DAG binds and activates some PKCs. [...] Most important in T cells is PKCÎ¸, critical for activating the transcription factors NF-ÎºB and AP-1. [...] IP3 is released from the membrane by PLC-Î³ and diffuses rapidly to activate calcium channel receptors on the ER, which induces the release of calcium into the cytosol. [...] Low calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum causes STIM1 clustering on the ER membrane and leads to activation of cell membrane CRAC channels that allows additional calcium to flow into the cytosol from the extracellular space. [...] This aggregated cytosolic calcium binds calmodulin, which can then activate calcineurin. [...] Calcineurin, in turn, activates NFAT, which then translocates to the nucleus. [...] NFAT is a transcription factor that activates the transcription of a <b>pleiotropic</b> set of genes, most notable, IL-2, a cytokine that promotes long-term proliferation of activated T cells.|$|E
2500|$|Several LSm {{proteins}} {{have been}} reported in the third domain of life, the Bacteria. [...] Hfq protein forms homohexamer rings, and was originally discovered as necessary for infection by the bacteriophage QÎ², although this is clearly not the native function of this protein in bacteria. [...] It is not universally present in all bacteria, but has been found in Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, Thermotogae, Aquificae and one species of Archaea. [...] (This last instance is probably a case of horizontal gene transfer.) [...] Hfq is <b>pleiotropic</b> with a variety of interactions, generally associated with translation regulation. [...] These include blocking ribosome binding to mRNA, marking mRNA for degradation by binding to their poly-A tails, and association with bacterial small regulatory RNAs (such as DsrA RNA) that control translation by binding to certain mRNAs. A second bacterial LSm protein is YlxS (sometimes also called YhbC), which was first identified in the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. [...] This is a two-domain protein with a N-terminal LSm domain. [...] Its function is unknown, but amino acid sequence homologs are found in virtually every bacterial genome to date, and it may be an essential protein. The middle domain of the small conductance mechanosensitive channel MscS in Escherichia coli forms a homoheptameric ring. This LSm domain has no apparent RNA-binding function, but the homoheptameric torus is part of the central channel of this membrane protein.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pleiotropic</b> genes {{act as an}} arbitrating {{force in}} speciation. William R. Rice and Ellen E. Hostert (1993) {{conclude}} that the observed prezygotic isolation in their studies {{is a product of}} pleiotropy's balancing role in indirect selection. By imitating the traits of all-infertile hybridized species, they noticed that the fertilization of eggs was prevented in all eight of their separate studies, a likely effect of <b>pleiotropic</b> genes on speciation. Likewise, <b>pleiotropic</b> gene's stabilizing selection allows for the allele frequency to be altered.|$|E

50|$|Resources are {{generally}} limited. Therefore, investment in one trait (e.g. virulence or immunity) limits investment in other life-history traits (e.g. reproductive rate). Moreoever, genes often have <b>pleiotropic</b> effects. Thus, {{a change in}} a <b>pleiotropic</b> immunity or virulence gene may automatically affect other traits. There is thus a trade-off between benefits and costs of the adaptive changes that then may prevent the host population to become fully resistant or the parasite population to express very high pathogenicity.|$|E

Further, there is direct inhibition through repression of the shared target genes nerfin-1 and escargot during olfactory development. In this way microRNA regulation of <b>pleiotropic</b> neural genes is likely {{to play a role in}} divergence of sensory systems, with nervous system divergence occurring with failed miR-regulation of genetic pathways.|$|E
