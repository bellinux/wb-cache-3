40|$|Aim: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the passage of fetal erythrocytes into the maternal circulation after invasive obstetric procedures, using the Kleihauer-Betke test, flow cytometry and -fetoprotein concentration in maternal blood. Material and Methods: This was a prospective descriptive study on patients who underwent: amniocentesis, cordocentesis, chorionic villus sample, amniotic infusion, bladder drainage and ventricular-amniotic shunt to investigate the karyotype; treatment for hydrocephalus, oligohydramnios, obstructive uropathy and polyhydramnios; and investigation of lung maturity. Maternal blood samples were collected before and 60 min after the invasive obstetric procedure in order to evaluate the passage of fetal erythrocytes using the Kleihauer-Betke test, flow cytometry and -fetoprotein concentration. Results: in total, 43 invasive obstetric procedures were performed. the procedures performed were: 27 cases of amniocentesis (62. 7 %), seven cases of cordocentesis (16. 2 %), four chorionic villus samples (9. 4 %), two amniotic infusions (4. 7 %), two ventricular-amniotic shunts and one bladder drainage (2. 3 %). After one case of cordocentesis with two <b>puncture</b> attempts via <b>the</b> <b>placenta,</b> a significant increase in fetal erythrocytes was detected using the three methods. After another cordocentesis with one <b>puncture</b> via <b>the</b> <b>placenta,</b> a significant increase in fetal erythrocytes was detected using flow cytometry and -fetoprotein concentration, but not through the Kleihauer-Betke test. the other 41 samples did not show any significant increase in fetal erythrocytes in the maternal blood. Conclusion: Invasive obstetric procedures performed during prenatal care are safe when performed by experienced professionals with the proper technique, with minimal chance of passage of fetal erythrocytes into the maternal compartment.

The theoretical part deals with description, development and function of <b>the</b> <b>placenta.</b> Emphasis is put on laboratory processing and examination of <b>the</b> <b>placenta.</b> Placental pathology, including inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>placenta,</b> defects in maturation and circulatory disorders of <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> are described. <b>The</b> comparison of fetal disorders caused by selected malfunctions of <b>the</b> <b>placenta,</b> i. e. placental inflammation (due to infection by bacteria and viruses) and developmental disorders of <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> with fetal hypoxia.

40|$|AbstractIn all mammals {{including}} humans, development {{takes place}} within the protective environment of the maternal womb. Throughout gestation, nutrients and waste products are continuously exchanged between mother and fetus through <b>the</b> <b>placenta.</b> Despite <b>the</b> clear importance of <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> to successful pregnancy {{and the health of}} both mother and offspring, relatively little is understood about the biology of <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> and its role in pregnancy-related diseases. Given that pre- and peri-natal diseases involving <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> affect millions of women and their newborns worldwide, there is an urgent need to understand placenta biology and development. Here, we suggest that <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> is an organ under unique selective pressures that have driven its rapid diversification throughout mammalian evolution. The high divergence of <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> complicates <b>the</b> use of non-human animal models and necessitates an evolutionary perspective when studying its biology and role in disease. We suggest that diversifying evolution of <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> is primarily driven by intraspecies evolutionary conflict between mother and fetus, and that many pregnancy diseases are a consequence of this evolutionary force. Understanding how maternal–fetal conflict shapes both basic placental and reproductive biology – in all species – will provide key insights into diseases of pregnancy...|$|R

50|$|Placental {{insufficiency}} or utero-placental insufficiency is {{the failure}} of <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> to deliver sufficient nutrients to the fetus during pregnancy, and is often a result of insufficient blood flow to <b>the</b> <b>placenta.</b> <b>The</b> term is also sometimes used to designate late decelerations of fetal heart rate as measured by electronic monitoring, {{even if there is}} no other evidence of reduced blood flow to <b>the</b> <b>placenta,</b> normal uterine blood flow rate being 600mL/min.|$|R
40|$|Several major {{vascular}} tissues, {{such as the}} aorta-gonad-mesonephros región (AGM), yolk sac, and {{fetal liver}} have been confirmed to possess hematopoietic function. Recently, <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> has been demonstrated as another hematopoietic organ. However, it is not conclusive whether <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> possesses hematopoietic ability. Therefore, we undertook a series of experiments to study the hematopoietic functions of placenta. Fetal blood circulation in <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> is difficult to be eliminated and its interference {{in the study of}} placental hematopoiesis is inevitable. With the application of placental flushing, fetal blood contained in <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> was eliminated. We then made the further study of placental hematopoiesis after the El 2. 5 placenta was flushed. Our studies showed that placental cells expressing Sca- 1, CD 117 and CD 34 were mainly restricted to the embryonic vessels of E 12. 5 <b>placenta.</b> <b>The</b> results of fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACs) analysis and colony forming cells (CFC) assay demonstrated that both placenta and placental blood contained hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HS/PCs), including CFU-GMs, CFU-GEMMs, BFU-Es, and HPP-CFCs. The frequency of HS/PCs in <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> was 2 - 3 times that of placental blood.

40|$|Background: In <b>the</b> human <b>placenta,</b> {{maternal}} and fetal bloods exchange substances {{through the surface}} of the villous trees: the fetal blood circulates in the villous trees, around which the maternal blood circulates. The blood flows directly influence fetal growth. Stem villi, the main supports of the villous tree, have contractile cells along the axes, whose contractions are expected to influence the blood circulations in <b>the</b> <b>placenta.</b> <b>The</b> displacement is neither measurable nor predictable while non-invasive measurements such as umbilical Doppler waveforms are helpful to predict the histological changes of the villous trees and vascularization in <b>the</b> <b>placenta.</b> Objective: <b>The</b> displacement caused by the contraction of the villous tree is necessary to predict the blood flows in <b>the</b> <b>placenta.</b> Hence, a computational villous tree model, which actively contracts, was developed in this study. Method: The villous tree model was based on the previous reports: shear moduli of the human placenta; branching patterns in the stem villi. The displacement pattern in <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> was estimated by the computational model when the shear elastic moduli were changed. Results: The results show that the displacement caused by the contraction was influenced by the shear elastic moduli, but kept useful for the blood flows in <b>the</b> <b>placenta.</b> <b>The</b> characteristics agreed with the robustness of the blood flows in <b>the</b> <b>placenta.</b> Conclusion: <b>The</b> villous tree model, which actively contracts, was developed in this study.

40|$|<b>The</b> human <b>placenta</b> is {{essential}} for the supply of the fetus. To monitor the fetal development, imaging data is acquired using ultrasound (US).

Nevertheless, there is currently no established procedure for assessing the condition of <b>the</b> <b>placenta</b> and consequently <b>the</b> fetal health.
