40|$|We {{estimate}} three international price elasticities using exporters data: the {{elasticity of}} firm exports to export <b>price,</b> <b>tariff</b> and real exchange rate shocks. In standard trade and international macroeconomics models these three elasticities should be equal. We {{find that this}} {{is far from being}} the case. We use French firm level electricity costs to instrument for export prices and provide a first estimate of the elasticity of firm-level exports to export prices. The elasticity of exports is highest, around 5, for export prices followed by tariffs, around 2, and is lowest for the real exchange rate, around 0. 6. The large discrepancy between these elasticities makes us conclude that the international elasticity puzzle is actually worse than previously thought. Moreover, we show that because exporters absorb part of tariffs and exchange rate movements, estimates of export elasticities that do not take into account export prices are biased...|$|E

40|$|In 2007, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) {{formed the}} Customer Response Task Force (CRTF) to {{identify}} barriers to deploying demand response (DR) resources in wholesale markets and develop policies {{to overcome these}} barriers. One of the initiatives of this Task Force was to develop more detailed information on existing retail DR programs and dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>tariffs,</b> program rules, and utility operating practices. This report describes {{the results of a}} comprehensive survey conducted by LBNL in support of the Customer Response Task Force and discusses policy implications for integrating legacy retail DR programs and dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>tariffs</b> into wholesale markets in the SPP region. LBNL conducted a detailed survey of existing DR programs and dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>tariffs</b> administered by SPP's member utilities. Survey respondents were asked to provide information on advance notice requirements to customers, operational triggers used to call events (e. g. system emergencies, market conditions, local emergencies), use of these DR resources to meet planning reserves requirements, DR resource availability (e. g. seasonal, annual), participant incentive structures, and monitoring and verification (M&V) protocols. Nearly all of the 30 load-serving entities in SPP responded to the survey. Of this group, fourteen SPP member utilities administer 36 DR programs, five dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>tariffs,</b> and six voluntary customer response initiatives. These existing DR programs and dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>tariffs</b> have a peak demand reduction potential of 1, 552 MW. Other major findings of this study are: o About 81 percent of available DR is from interruptible rate tariffs offered to large commercial and industrial customers, while direct load control (DLC) programs account for ~;; 14 percent. o Arkansas accounts for ~;; 50 percent of the DR resources in the SPP footprint; these DR resources are primarily managed by cooperatives. o Publicly-owned cooperatives accounted for 54 percent of the existing DR resources among SPP members. For these entities, investment in DR is often driven by the need to reduce summer peak demand that is used to set demand charges for each distribution cooperative. o About 65 - 70 percent of the interruptible/curtailable tariffs and DLC programs are routinely triggered based on market conditions, not just for system emergencies. Approximately, 53 percent of the DR resources are available with less than two hours advance notice and 447 MW can be dispatched with less than thirty minutes notice. o Most legacy DR programs offered a reservation payment ($/kW) for participation; incentive payment levels ranged from $ 0. 40 to $ 8. 30 /kW-month for interruptible rate tariffs and $ 0. 30 to $ 4. 60 /kW-month for DLC programs.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Electricity {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{requirements}} for people and they are widely used for domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes. Every meter is a device that measures the amount of electrical energy consumed by a residence, business or an electrically powered device. This paper presents the impact of prepaid energy metering system on electricity consumption in Ogbomoso South Local Government Area of Oyo state. The results of the paper revealed that about 95 % of the pre-paid meter users in the local government area are conscious of electricity management, about 74 % of the post-paid meter users were just wasting the energy. The introduction of the pre-paid metering system has increased the revenue collection and hence, reduced the revenue generation of the local government area because of the reliability nature of the metering system.

30|$|The on-demand {{delivery}} {{model for}} cloud computing resources {{offers a variety}} of benefits for business consumers: no up-front capital expenditure on (often under-utilised) compute infrastructure needed to cover peak business demand; flexibility and scale-out opportunities from the ability to start and stop VM instances at will; and reduced operational costs from outsourcing maintenance and support [6]. However, the on-demand model is not necessarily ideal for cloud providers, as they attempt to adhere to strict Service Level Agreements in the face of fluctuating demand. If providers could accurately forecast future resource demand, then they would have the opportunity to reduce costs by optimising electricity purchases, engineering staff, and hardware utilisation, etc. [7]. At present, most providers offer a choice between an on-demand tariff (“on-demand” instances, billed per hour of usage with no upfront purchase cost [8]) and a contract tariff (“reserved” instances (RIs), leased for a fixed time period and offering significant hourly usage discounts [9]). Some providers, e.g., AWS, offer an alternative spot <b>price</b> <b>tariff</b> that varies in real-time based on current supply and demand [10]. However, of these methods, only long-term RI contracts (12 -months or 36 -months) have the potential to aid the provider in capacity planning.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} solar energy based Electric Vehicle Transportation System in Singapore, {{the state of the}} art Photovoltaic Systems have been reviewed in this report with a focus on solar cell technologies. Various solar cell technologies were evaluated based on characteristics such as efficiency, reliability and cost to identify a best working one under Singapore's hot and humid climate. Commercial CdTe modules were found to have the best efficiency to cost ratio, making them the best module choice in land-scarce and tropical Singapore. Based on the market price and characteristics of CdTe modules from manufacturer First Solar Ltd, two PV systems based on an apartment model and a private house model were evaluated. The cost of electricity from a relatively large scale grid-tied PV system is found to be at around US$ 0. 173 /kWh which is not market competitive with the utility electricity price of US$ 0. 109 /kWh in Singapore. But with enough capital funding and government incentives such as rebate or feed-in <b>price</b> <b>tariff,</b> PV electricity generation could become economically feasible. The small private house system is found not economical as a means of household electricity generation even with current status of government rebate. When carbon trading is considered, the current trading price has to be increased by around 7 times of the current value or 3 times of the predicted price at 2016 to offset the difference with the utility electricity price. by Li Sun.

40|$|Integrating {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{electricity generation}} into the German energy system {{is proving to}} be a growing challenge due to its fluctuating nature. The combination of more rigid regulation for feeding PV power into the grid and steadily rising electricity prices means that energy storage devices are becoming more attractive to private households as a way of upping their energy self-sufficiency. At the same time, storage systems make the household’s power purchasing strategy more complex. For these reasons, control concepts are required for PV and storage systems which ensure system-friendly operation as well as considering the household’s primary objectives. This paper presents a three-part model, which enables forecast-based load management of a battery storage system in combination with a PV system. In the first modelling step, forecasts of hourly electricity demand and solar generation are created using artificial neural networks. In a second step, the model optimizes the energy flows considering a real-time <b>price</b> <b>tariff</b> based on EPEX Spot in addition to its main task of using the forecasts to maximize on-site self-consumption. In the third step, a control algorithm adjusts the actual energy flows if forecast deviations occur. The study shows that the model enables system-friendly operation of the battery storage as well as intensified usage. As an added value, the forecasting approach presented is closer to reality than the otherwise frequently used optimization algorithms that assume perfect foresight of electricity load and generation. It therefore provides a real-world basis for planning, but also shows that the inevitable forecasting errors are reflected in higher electricity bills. Considering the inaccuracy of forecasting, we conclude that if a system-friendly integration of solar power storages is to be promoted in the future, households should be provided with better forecast data or offered other incentives to compensate for their lost profit...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{temporal}} {{changes in}} wholesale electricity prices, retail prices are typically constant throughout the day. To address this economic inefficiency, Detroit Edison, {{a subsidiary of}} DTE Energy (DTE), can introduce residential dynamic pricing rates to incent customers to shift load away from peak periods, at which time wholesale electricity prices are high. This paper estimates the financial and environmental impacts of implementing dynamic electricity pricing rates for residential customers within the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). Based on these estimates, we recommend that DTE pilot specific residential dynamic pricing rates, all {{of which may be}} suitable for wide-scale deployment. We researched existing pricing programs that have been piloted throughout the country to determine which options present the most potential to reduce or shift peak load. In addition, we obtained cost estimates for enabling technology to be used in conjunction with these tariffs. We then constructed a dispatch model which simulates the MISO electricity market by using electricity supply and demand forecasts for 2010 - 2030. Applying residential peak load reduction and shifting estimates from previous pilots to the dispatch model, we calculate avoided capacity savings, avoided energy savings, and emissions impacts for various dynamic pricing programs. Specifically, we analyzed a Time of Use (TOU) tariff and TOU/Critical Peak <b>Price</b> <b>tariff</b> with and without enabling technology (smart thermostat and in-home display), as well as a TOU/Peak-time Rebate tariff. We investigate these tariffs using peak and critical-peak period window lengths ranging from four to eight hours. There were three central results. First, deployment of demand response programs to a subset of residential customers with a four-hour peak window results in financial outcomes ranging from a net loss of $ 350 million to a net gain of $ 400 million. Second, enabling technology increases peak load reduction, but technology costs may exceed the savings of the increased load reduction. Third, the length of the peak window is an important driver of economic benefits; increasing the window length may enhance net economic benefits...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze whether, and how, {{uncertainty}} influences the layout {{and costs of}} a CO 2 transportation network. The case without uncertainty is modelled with a perfect foresight (PF) model and with uncertainty with the real option approach (ROA). In this study, uncertainties in the CO 2 <b>price,</b> <b>tariff</b> received per tonne of CO 2 transported, the willingness, probability and moment that sources join the CO 2 transportation network are incorporated in the analysis. The results show that uncertainty leads to higher required CO 2 prices before investments in carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) are made. With a volatility of 47 % in the CO 2 price, the required CO 2 price almost triples {{in comparison with the}} net present value approach. Hence, under uncertainty less sources are retrofitted with CCS and less CO 2 is captured and stored over time. For instance, for the analyzed case study 31 Mt and 137 Mt CO 2 is projected to be captured in the base scenario of ROA and PF model, respectively, in the period 2015 - 2050. If the volatility of the CO 2 price is reduced with 50 %, 96 Mt is projected to be captured in the ROA, which is still about one third less than in the PF model. Furthermore, the results show that uncertainty leads to less development of trunklines. All this leads to an increase in the transport and storage costs. For instance, for our case study, the average CO 2 transport and storage costs in 2050 increase from 2. 8 €/t to 13 €/t in the base scenario of the ROA compared to the PF model. If the volatility is reduced with 50 %, the transport and storage costs decrease to 7. 5 €/t in the ROA, which is still 2. 5 times as much as in the PF model. Our findings indicate that the implementation of CCS can best be stimulated by reducing the volatility of the CO 2 price, reducing capture costs and facilitating cooperation between nearby sources...|$|E
40|$|Tariffs {{and other}} policy distortions {{typically}} lower real national income relative {{to what it}} {{otherwise would have been}} for any given rate of factor accumulation. Even while lowering real income, however, policy distortions may raise an economy''s real measured growth rate and so, somewhat deceivingly, give the impression that national welfare has benefited from things like tariff protection. This would be an incorrect conclusion. This paper discusses the issue of how protection can affect the rate of growth for a small, open economy. As shown by Johnson (1970), in the presence of exogenously given factor accumulation, tariffs either raise or lower an economy''s growth rate (measured by the change in the value of output at world prices), relative to the no-distortion growth rate. We also discuss the relevance of this result for tariff uniformity, "tariff jumping" foreign direct investment, and the empirical literature on trade and growth.

Our analysis shows that when {{the sum of the}} marginal costs and the monitoring costs is below a threshold value, flat fee pricing is the optimal scheme regardless of how large or how small the monitoring costs are (as long as they are positive) when customers are homogeneous or have heterogeneous marginal willingness to pay. Positive marginal costs also do not change this result; but when monitoring costs are zero, the two-part tariff becomes one of the optimal pricing schemes...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{has adopted}} Directive 2004 / 8 /EC on the {{promotion}} of cogeneration, which the EU Member States, as well as candidates including Croatia, were obliged to accept. Among other terms and conditions, the Directive requires certain support mechanisms, such as feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>prices</b> and premiums added to market electricity prices. In this paper, the cost effectiveness of selling electricity at the feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>prices</b> in the selected EU Member States is compared to selling it on the European electricity market, with or without premiums. The results of this comparison will indicate whether correction of the Croatian feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>price</b> to a higher value would be justified. The cost effectiveness ratio of a cogeneration unit upgraded with mean reverting and jump diffusion processes is used for comparison. At {{the end of this}} paper, a method is suggested for the correction of feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>prices,</b> with examples of corrected prices for the years 2008 and 2009. Such corrections have been proven to be justified and are compared to the feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>prices</b> in most of the selected EU Member States. Feed-in tariff Electricity Cogeneration...|$|R
