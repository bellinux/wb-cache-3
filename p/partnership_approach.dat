The comparative data analysis from in-depth interviews and document analysis of project-associated materials and municipal policies provides insight into the different <b>partnership</b> <b>approaches.</b> Results suggest that while strategically designed and focused inter-governmental partnerships can build local government capacity to respond to food security, there are systemic, regulatory, and resource barriers in play.
