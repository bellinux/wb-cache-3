50|$|The Leaders renewed their {{commitment}} to achieve South Asian Economic Union (SAEU) in a phased and planned manner through a Free Trade Area, a Customs Union, a Common Market, and a Common Economic and Monetary Union.The Leaders acknowledged that SAARC Member States, particularly the Least Developed and Landlocked Member States, face structural constraints and challenges that result in their weak productive capacity affecting their competitiveness in external trade due to, among others, high trade and transit cost. They committed to enhance support to the Least Developed and Landlocked Member States in their development efforts, {{with a view to}} ensuring equitable benefits of free trade arrangements. In this context, they agreed to effectively implement the existing <b>preferential</b> <b>facilities</b> under SAFTA and SATIS.|$|E
5000|$|A {{significant}} policy shift {{took place}} in October 1990, when a memorandum from the FHWA administrator stated that [...] "FHWA strongly supports the objective of HOV <b>preferential</b> <b>facilities</b> and encourages the proper application of HOV technology." [...] Regional administrators were directed to promote HOV lanes and related facilities. Also in the early 1990s, two laws reinforced the U.S. commitment to HOV lane construction. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included HOV lanes {{as one of the}} transportation control measures that could be included in state implementation plans to attain federal air quality standards. The 1990 amendments also deny the administrator of the EPA the authority to block FHWA from funding 24-hour HOV lanes as part of the sanctions for a state's failure to comply with the Clean Air Act, if the secretary of transportation wishes to approve the FHWA funds.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, the {{government}} provided US$77 million in loans with <b>preferential</b> rates to <b>facilities</b> service providers (FSP). In 2000, another US$77 million was provided in loans for suburban areas, small cities and towns, and regional industrial areas. Another US$926 million was provided until 2005 {{in order to}} supply the rural areas with broadband.|$|R
40|$|Ninety-five {{first year}} medical {{students}} agreed {{that there was}} differential medical treatment of minority vs majority persons. Implicated reasons for this phenomenon were lack of personal treatment of members of minorities, distrust of medical workers by minority members, and majority perceptions that minority persons are not good patients. Integrated treatment and training <b>facilities,</b> <b>preferential</b> academic treatment, special training for majority students, and philosophy of medical care are {{discussed in terms of}} improving medical care for all...|$|R
40|$|The most {{significant}} {{problems of the}} agricultural enterprises are the asset deficiency, the capital shortage, the low profitability and the financing problems of current production and development. The subsidies, the favourable credit terms, the European Union sources are instrumental in improvement of financial condition, realization of investments and current assets financing of the farmers. In the last years the farmers could have resort to several national and from 2004 May the European Union subsidies and <b>preferential</b> credit <b>facilities,</b> for example the Agriculture and Rural Development Operational Programme, National Rural Development Plan, medium-term current assets credits, investments credits and the Europe Plan Agricultural Credit Programme. The {{purpose of this paper}} to analyse the trend of capital structure, liquidity, profitability and amount of subsidies claimed by agricultural enterprises in Békés county. In the course of analysis used the data base of Agricultural Economics Research Institute between 2001 and 2004...|$|R
40|$|Based {{upon the}} Triple-Helix model of {{university}}-industry interaction, this study investigates the technology-based university spin-out {{companies and the}} assistance being provided by other stakeholders. The research reveals that the spin-out strategy of {{the university and the}} practical assistance by the university are the significant factors of the spin-out companies financial performance. Using one Nottingham University spin-out company as a model case, detailed qualitative analysis of each stakeholder, technology transfer office, science park and company, was conducted. The analysis firstly revealed that an awareness of the entrepreneurial activities in academia needed to be enhanced. Secondly, the technology transfer office supports up to the stage of the spin-out formation; not up to the stage of the company development. This indicated that the university supported to form the company, but no further assistance was provided. The Nottingham spin-out model was compared with the Manchester model. In terms of the finance, the Manchester spin-out companies seemed to be outperforming the Nottingham spin-outs. Manchester model had the smooth sequence of the research discovery to the company development within the university premises. The major reason that caused the difference was identified as the existence of the interim funding and the suitable premises within the university. Although it may not be realistic to construct new incubation facilities in Nottingham, this study recommended to utilise the Lachesis Fund for the interim funding and to offer the <b>preferential</b> rent or <b>facility</b> usage of the university towards its spin-out companies. The implementation of the two schemes could enhance the chance of spin-out survival relatively readily...|$|R
