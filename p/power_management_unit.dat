40|$|Part 13 : ElectronicsInternational audienceThe Internet of Thing (IoT) {{has given}} rise to the {{integration}} of smart systems in the industrial, healthcare, and social environments. These smart systems are often implemented by system-on-chip (SoC) solutions that require <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>units,</b> sensors, signal processors, and wireless interfaces. Hence, an independent voltage reference circuit is crucial for obtaining accurate measurements from the sensors and for the proper operation of the SoC. Making, bandgap circuits indispensable in these types of applications. Typically, bandgap circuits are implemented using bipolar transistors to generate two voltages with opposite temperature coefficients (Complementary To Absolute Temperature – CTAT; Proportional do Absolute Temperature - PTAT) which are added resulting in a temperature independent voltage reference. The disadvantage of using bipolar devices is that the power supply voltage must be larger than the ON base-emitter voltage, resulting in voltages larger than 0. 7  V. The low power demands of IoT and of technology scaling, have forced lower values for the power supply voltage and thus new bandgap circuits using only CMOS transistors have gathered increased interest. In these, the MOS transistors operate in the weak inversion region where its current has an exponential relation with its gate-to-source voltage, as in the bipolar devices. Making it possible to generate both the PTAT and the CTAT voltages and thus produce a temperature independent voltage reference. This paper describes a design methodology of an all CMOS bandgap voltage reference circuit, in which one of the transistors works in the moderate region and the other in the weak inversion, to achieve the lowest possible voltage variation with temperature. The circuit produces a voltage reference of 0. 45  V from a minimum power supply voltage of 0. 6  V, with a total variation of 1. 54  mV, over a temperature range of − 40 to 100 °C, resulting in a temperature coefficient of 24  ppm/°C, and a power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of − 40  dB...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – A novel non-linear equivalent circuit that accounts for electrochemical reactions and charge generation inside catalyst layers, electronic and protonic conduction, methanol crossover through the membrane, mass transport of reactants inside diffusion layers is presented. The discharge dynamic of the fuel cell, depending on the initial methanol concentration and on the load profile, is modelled by using the mass conservation equation. The equivalent circuit is interfaced to a stochastic optimization procedure in order to maximize the battery duration while minimizing fuel crossover. Findings – In the proposed circuit scheme, unlike semi-empirical models, lumped circuit parameters are derived directly from mass transport and electric equations in order to fully describe the dynamic performance of the fuel cell. Physical and geometrical parameters are optimized in order to improve the system runtime. It is shown that a combined use of fuel cells and lithium batteries can improve the runtime of portable electronic devices compared to traditional supply systems based on lithium batteries only. Research limitations/implications – The one-dimensional model of the micro fuel cell does not take into account possible transverse mass and electric charge flows in the fuel cell layers; most of the geometric and physics model parameters cannot be estimated from direct in situ or ex situ measurements. Practical implications – Direct methanol fuel cells are nowadays a promising technology for replacing or complementing lithium batteries due to their high energy density.

This change, driven by the increasing demand of all sort of mobile devices and smart sensors, requires not only logic power and memory but also multi-standard wireless communication capabilities, sensing functionalities, and more important, longer battery life, thus low power operation. Systems-on-chip (SoC) are meant to integrate in a single chip not only the logic of one or several processors, but also graphical and <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>units,</b> <b>power</b> amplifiers, passive components, transceivers, and memory components. SoC with fully integrated multi-band multi-standard transceivers and RF front-ends are needed. HR-Si is currently used for the fabrication of RF circuits and HR-SOI substrates are now a mature and cost-effective technology for future SoCs. Unfortunately, their lossless RF capabilities are limited by the presence of a parasitic surface conduction. In addition, HR-Si and HR-SOI presents non-linear behaviour under large signal operation and the substrate electrical properties are frequency and voltage dependent. 	In this thesis, a CMOS compatible Si-based substrate for the integration of RF systems, named trap-rich HR-SOI, are investigated. The small-signal and large-signal performance of a series of Si, HR-Si, HR-SOI, trap-rich HR-Si, and (for the first time) commercial trap-rich HR-SOI wafers are characterized. The presence of trap-rich layer helps recovering the high-resistivity nominal and linear characteristics of HR-Si substrates. Moreover, compared to Si substrates, it also reduces the substrate crosstalk between adjacent devices. It is shown that the effective resistivity is a powerful figure-of-merit able to quantify the high-resistivity characteristics and nonlinear properties of HR-SOI and trap-rich HR-SOI substrates. Experimental measurements and physically-based simulations demonstrate that trap-rich HR-SOI substrates with effective resistivities higher than 3 kΩ-cm have excellent lossless and linear properties. Therefore, trap-rich HR-SOI wafers can be used for the integration of RF front-end in SoCs, with comparable performances to other more classical, and expensive, substrate solutions as SOS, SOQ or SOG.
