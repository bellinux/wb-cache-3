Michaels worked on Perfect's injured back until Perfect took control of the match. After a series of attacks on Michaels, Perfect used the Perfect Plex. Diesel <b>pulled</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the ring and threw him into the steel ring steps, however, allowing Michaels to win by countout.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{investigate}} the crash. Scully suggests a man {{stopped the car}} but Doggett points out {{that it would have}} required a dense block of steel to stop the car. Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario’s body left in a garbage can nearby; his face has gaping holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario’s head and <b>pulled</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe Ray could be involved in Curtis’s death.|$|E

500|$|Brownlee's {{defenders}} {{called into}} doubt MacLean's motivation for {{involvement in the}} case: according to rumour, MacLean {{had been involved in}} a drunk driving incident several years previous in which he had driven his car into a ditch. [...] When another motorist had <b>pulled</b> <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> MacLean had attempted unsuccessfully to drive away with the chains still attached to his vehicle, for which he was charged. [...] He had reputedly asked Brownlee, then the Attorney General, to have the charges dropped. [...] Upon Brownlee's refusal, he had allegedly vowed to [...] "get" [...] him. [...] Finally, Brownlee made a point of noting that, as a medical student, Caldwell would have been well-positioned to coach MacMillan on her claims about the pills she was taking to avoid pregnancy. [...] According to Brownlee, the events alleged were a complete fabrication, the result of scheming by an opportunistic young medical student and his impressionable girlfriend, encouraged by a vindictive lawyer and unscrupulous political opponents.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} {{was shot}} {{over a period}} of two days. Principal photography on the first day commenced inside a well, which was built by Gregory Melton in approximately four weeks. It measured over forty feet in height, and the base of the well was located in a swimming pool. Nicotero stated that [...] " [...] could open the door, put the zombie actor in there, then close the door. The camera would shoot down." [...] Atop of the well was a lip that measured a height of six feet. Despite putting slime and K-Y Jelly on a board inside of the well, Nicotero and his production team found the particular sequence to be difficult to shoot. [...] "On 'action', we <b>pulled</b> <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> and he slid up and over the lip," [...] Nicotero stated. [...] "It was challenging to get all those pieces to come together on a television schedule." [...] By the time Hilliard was pulled out of the well, producers used a second suit equipped with prosthetic legs and prosthetic body. Various blood bags were inserted in the torso of the suit; each were filled with viscous liquids in a variety of colors. Entrails were lastly added inside the suit, as Nicotero asserted that his team wanted [...] "a gigantic explosion of gore." ...|$|E

Many other teams began experimenting with the technology, but Lotus had a head start and Mario Andretti won the Championship in the [...] "Black Beauty", {{becoming}} the first driver to win both the American IndyCar championship and the Formula One title. Brabham outbid Lotus in generating downforce with BT46B [...] "fan car", {{a revival of the}} [...] "sucker car" [...] concept used by Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J in the Can-Am series in the early 1970s. The car exploited a loophole in the regulations, but the team, led by Bernie Ecclestone who had recently become president of the Formula One Constructors Association, withdrew the car before it had a chance to be banned after winning its only race with Niki Lauda at the wheel at the Swedish Grand Prix. Late in the season Ronnie Peterson crashed into the barriers in the first lap at Monza and his Lotus burst into flames. James Hunt heroically <b>pulled</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the car and the medical prognosis was initially good but the Swede died the next day because of an embolism.

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1851 and {{at the age of}} 19, Luther Gotwald entered Wittenberg College, a Lutheran college in Springfield, Ohio in the Preparatory Department. He only had {{fourteen}} dollars when he arrived and he had to work to pay his way. He remained at Wittenberg until his sophomore year. There is a book written by his Lutheran cleric great-grandson, Rev. Luther A. Gotwald, Jr., called The Gotwald Trial Revisited (the [...] "Gotwald heresy trial book" [...] for short). The book states that Gotwald took up with college sweetheart Mary Elizabeth King, who was fifteen years old at the time. Gotwald met King through her brothers. She had three brothers, David King, Jr., Robert Quigley King and Samuel Noble King, who were his classmates at Wittenberg. The Gotwald heresy book notes that the King family was sufficiently wealthy to send all three of them to college at the same time. [...] Not only that, the King family lived close enough to the Wittenberg campus {{that they were able to}} walk to class. [...] However, Luther became so infatuated with her that his family feared it would adversely affect his studies. [...] So, they <b>pulled</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of Wittenberg and sent him to Pennsylvania where he continued his studies in Lutheran theology. In 1855 he entered Pennsylvania College at Gettysburg, from which he graduated with honors in 1857. Next he entered the Theological Seminary of Gettysburg and after taking a two-year course graduated from that institution in 1859. The Lutheran Synod of West Pennsylvania ordained Luther Alexander Gotwald at Waynesboro, Pennsylvania. A year later the same synod licensed him to preach.|$|E
