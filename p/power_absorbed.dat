500|$|It is {{now known}} by direct {{observation}} {{that much of the}} light curve (the graph of luminosity as a function of time) after the occurrence of a Type II Supernova, such as SN 1987A, is explained by those predicted radioactive decays. Although the luminous emission consists of optical photons, it is the radioactive <b>power</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the ejected gases that keeps the remnant hot enough to radiate light. The radioactive decay of 56Ni through its daughters 56Co to 56Fe produces gamma-ray photons, primarily of 847keV and 1238keV, that are absorbed and dominate the heating and thus the luminosity of the ejecta at intermediate times (several weeks) to late times (several months). Energy for the peak of the light curve of SN1987A was provided by the decay of 56Ni to 56Co (half life 6 days) while energy for the later light curve in particular fit very closely with the 77.3 day half-life of 56Co decaying to 56Fe. Later measurements by space gamma-ray telescopes of the small fraction of the 56Co [...] and 57Co gamma rays that escaped the SN 1987A remnant without absorption confirmed earlier predictions that those two radioactive nuclei were the power sources.|$|E
60|$|Girouard {{was sent}} to England to buy the plant and rolling stock. Fifteen new engines and two hundred trucks were ordered. The {{necessary}} new workshops were commenced at Halfa. Experienced mechanics were procured to direct them. Fifteen hundred additional men were enlisted in the Railway Battalion and trained. Then the water question was dealt with. The reconnoitring surveys had reported that though the line was certainly 'good and easy' for 110 miles--and, according to Arab accounts, for the remaining 120 miles--no drop of water was to be found, and only two likely spots for wells were noted. Camel transport was, of course, out of the question. Each engine must first of all haul enough water to carry it to Railhead and back, besides a reserve against accidents. It was evident that the quantity of water required by any locomotive would continually increase as the work progressed and the distance grew greater, until finally the material trains would have one-third of their carrying <b>power</b> <b>absorbed</b> in transporting the water for their own consumption. The amount of water necessary is largely dependent on the grades of the line. The 'flat desert' {{proved to be a}} steady slope up to a height of 1,600 feet above Halfa, and the calculations were further complicated. The difficulty had, however, to be faced, and a hundred 1,500-gallon tanks were procured. These were mounted on trucks and connected by hose; and the most striking characteristic of the trains of the Soudan military railway was the long succession of enormous boxes on wheels, on which the motive power of the engine and the lives of the passengers depended.|$|E

40|$|The {{expanding}} application {{spectrum of}} plasmonic nanoantennas demand versatile design approaches to tailor the antenna properties for specific requirements. The design efforts primarily concentrate on shifting the operation wavelength or enhancing the local fields by manipulating {{the size and}} shape of the nanoantenna. Here, we propose a design path to control the absorption and scattering characteristics of a dipole nanoantenna by introducing a hollow region inside the nanostructure. The resulting contour geometry can significantly suppress the scattering of the dipole nanoantenna and enhance its absorption simultaneously. Both the dipole and the contour dipole nanoantenna couple to equivalent amount of the incident radiation. The dipole nanoantenna scatters 84 % of the coupled <b>power</b> (<b>absorbs</b> the remaining 16 %) whereas the contour dipole structure scatters only 28 % of the coupled <b>power</b> (<b>absorbs</b> the remaining 72 %). This constitutes the transformation from scatter to absorber nanoantenna. The scattering of a contour nanoantenna can be further suppressed by incorporating a lossless dielectric in the hollow region without altering its absorption. We also demonstrate the applicability of scattering suppression and absorption enhancement features of the contour design in other nanoantenna geometries such as the self-assembly compatible nanoantenna structures of nanodisk and nanoring chains. The benefits of the contour design can be readily utilized in diverse applications; including bioplasmonics, medical diagnosis/therapy, cloaked sensing, photovoltaics and thermoplasmonics.
