While the prevailing equilibrium partitioning (EqP) theory predicts a 54 % decrease in PCB uptake by the_chironomids in the <b>pre-extracted</b> sediment, with a maintained biota-to-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF), a decrease in PCB uptake by 91 % was observed. For all investigated PCBs the BSAFs were on average 81 % lower in the cultures with <b>pre-extracted</b> sediment than in the untreated systems. The data allowed for a calculation of the bioavailable fraction, which was estimated to 60 %.

40|$|If {{the release}} {{mechanisms}} during selective chemical extraction of {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POP) mimic release mechanisms in natural systems during biological uptake, then a selective non-exhaustive extraction could give a quantitative measure of the bioavailable POP fraction. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is suggested as a possible technique to estimate the amount of bioavailable polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at contaminated sites and hence serve as a new tool in risk assessment. The uptake of PCBs by earthworm (Eisenia foetida) was investigated. PCB contaminated soil was <b>pre-extracted</b> with selective non-exhaustive SFE (50 degrees C, 350 bar, 1 h), which removed on average 70 % of the individual PCBs. Earthworms were placed in this <b>pre-extracted</b> soil, {{as well as in}} untreated soil. After 10 days, the PCB uptake by earthworms in the two systems was compared. The bioaccumulation factor(BAF) was 83 % lower in the <b>pre-extracted</b> system than in the untreated system, demonstrating that SFE extracts primarily bioavailable contaminants. From the data, the bioavailable fraction could also be calculated to be 75 %, which is very close to the 70 % removed by SFE under the applied conditions. This suggests that the chemical methodology is capable of measuring the bioavailable fraction very accurately in this system. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Before the kraft pulping, a pre-extraction of hemicelluloses from mixed hardwood chips was performed with two different alkali concentrations (3 % and 12 % as Na 2 O) at 150 °C for 90 minutes. The kraft pulping of the <b>pre-extracted</b> chips was then conducted in two ways: with either the H-factor alone controlled or with both the H-factor and the alkali charge controlled. When the chips were <b>pre-extracted</b> with the 3 % alkali charge and with the kraft pulping controlled to an H-factor of 500, the yield and properties of the pulp were higher than those of the reference kraft pulp. The 12 % alkali pre-extraction and kraft pulping resulted in a low yield of screened pulp. However, when the alkali charge and the H-factor were adjusted together, the pulp yield remained constant and the pulp properties improved in comparison to the reference pulp for both the 3 and 12 % cases...|$|E

Using extensive experiments on four different corpora, we show that incorporating bigram collocations in the document representation creates more parsimonious models and improves topic coherence. We point out some problems in interpreting test likelihood and test perplexity to compare model fit, and suggest an alternate measure that penalises model complexity. We show how the Akaike information criterion is a more appropriate measure, which suggests that using a modest number (up to 1000) of top-ranked bigrams is the optimal topic modelling configuration. Using these 1000 bigrams also results in improved topic quality over unigram tokenisation. Further increases in topic quality {{can be achieved by}} using up to 10, 000 bigrams, but this is at the cost of a more complex model. We also show that multiword (bigram and longer) named entities give consistent results, indicating that they should be represented as single tokens.

RMs for NO 2 were prepared by exposure to gas mixtures in a chamber while the RMs for SO 2 were prepared by liquid spiking. Certification of RMs for NO 2 was found feasible with a certified uncertainty of 5. 8 % and a proposed shelf life of 5 years. The uncertainty was calculated with contribution from the homogeneity of preparation, stability and transport of the CRMs and from an external verification of the certified value. To reach 5. 8 % of uncertainty, the contribution {{of the differences between the}} results of analysis by ion chromatography and colorimetry must be eliminated. It is proposed to solve this by <b>pre-extracting</b> the samplers with water before analysis. The results of this study indicate that the samplers are stable for at least two years before and after exposure when stored in refrigerator. On the opposite, the certification of RMs for SO 2 was found not feasible due to instability problems. This instability was attributed to reaction of sulfate on the walls of the samplers.
