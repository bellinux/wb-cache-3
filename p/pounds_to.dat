5|$|Although St. Gatien {{was entered}} in the Cambridgeshire Handicap at the next Newmarket meeting, {{he would have been}} {{required}} to carry 139 pounds, and his connections decided not to run, instead targeting the ten furlong Free Handicap at the same meeting on October 22. He started odds-on favourite and successfully conceded three <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> Duke of Richmond, winning comfortably by three quarters of a length. On his final start of the year he won at Newmarket for the third time when taking the Jockey Club Cup.|$|E
5|$|In Series 3, Adam and Rachel seek intracytoplasmic sperm {{injection}} (ICSI) {{when they}} have trouble conceiving a child naturally. The characters take out bank loans of thousands of <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> pay for the treatment, which is unsuccessful each time. The producers devised this storyline because IVF was a major contemporary issue and wrote the treatment as a failure because it was representative of the odds of conception in real life.|$|E

5|$|The gongs weigh roughly {{from two}} <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> three pounds each, and have {{dimensions}} of 6 to 10inches for their diameters and 3 to 5inches for their height. Traditionally {{they were made}} from bronze but due to the disruption and loss of trade routes between the islands of Borneo and Mindanao during World War II, resulting in loss of access to necessary metal ores, and the subsequent post-war use of scrap metal, brass gongs with shorter decaying tones are now commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Garfield as Sebastião Rodrigues (based on Giuseppe Chiara, {{who later}} in the film {{goes by the name}} Okada San'emon). In interviews, Garfield has spoken of his {{extensive}} year-long preparation for the role with James Martin, a practicing Jesuit priest working in New York. Garfield detailed that the preparation with Martin included extensive research and immersion in the Jesuit lifestyle and frame of mind which was felt to be essential to the accuracy of the film by the producers. Garfield, who is of slight to medium frame, reported losing 40 <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> play the role following the rules of abstention which were outlined to him by Martin.|$|E
5|$|As {{a four-year-old}} in 1882, Tristan showed much {{improved}} form and {{established himself as}} one of the leading racehorses in Europe by winning ten times in fourteen starts. He began the year by winning a Queen's Plate at Newmarket in April and followed up by winning His Majesty's Plate at Chester in May. At Epsom Downs Racecourse he ran twice at the Derby meeting. In the Epsom Stakes, a handicap race over one and a half miles, Tristan carried top weight of 124 pounds and won by a length and a half from Retreat He then added the Epsom Gold Cup, the race which was the forerunner of the Coronation Cup, in which he successfully conceded twenty-seven <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> a filly named Isabel.|$|E

5|$|Coutances took {{no further}} part in English {{government}} {{after returning from}} Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of Andely manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the castle of Gaillard on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 Angevin <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> secure contested rights from the new king. After John lost control of Normandy in 1204, the archbishop did not resist the new government of King Philip II of France. Coutances died in November 1207 and was buried in his cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Clottey fight, {{negotiations}} began {{to pursue a}} contest against Manny Pacquiao (49-3-2, 38 KOs). Even before Pacquiao defeated Ricky Hatton, Bob Arum, who represents both Cotto and Pacquiao, stated that {{he was interested in}} this matchup. Subsequently, Pacquiao expressed interest in fighting Cotto. The fight was sanctioned as a world title fight in the welterweight division, where the weight limit is 147 pounds, however Cotto's camp agreed to fight at a catchweight of 145 <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> accommodate Pacquiao's smaller physique. Cotto's camp also conceded the larger share of the purse to Pacquiao, who received a 65% share of pay-per-view buys, compared to Cotto's 35% share.|$|E
5|$|In 821, {{the year}} of Coenwulf's death, a council was held in London at which Coenwulf {{threatened}} to exile Wulfred if the archbishop did not surrender an estate of 300 hides and make a payment of 120 <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> the king. Wulfred is recorded to have agreed to these terms, but the conflict continued well past Coenwulf's death, with an apparently final agreement between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter Cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827. However, Wulfred officiated at the consecration of Coenwulf's brother and heir, Ceolwulf, on 17 September 822, so {{it is evident that}} some accommodation had been reached by that time. Wulfred had probably resumed his archiepiscopal duties earlier that year.|$|E

5|$|Joel Stoffer and Neil Flynn have minor {{roles as}} FBI agents {{interrogating}} Indiana {{in a scene}} following the opening sequence. Alan Dale plays General Ross, who protests his innocence. Andrew Divoff and Pasha D. Lychnikoff play Soviet soldiers. Spielberg cast Russian-speaking actors as Soviet soldiers so their accents would be authentic. Dimitri Diatchenko plays Spalko's right-hand man who battles Indiana at Marshall College. Diatchenko bulked up to 250 <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> look menacing, and his role was originally minor with ten days of filming. When shooting the fight, Ford accidentally hit his chin, and Spielberg liked Diatchenko's humorous looking reaction, so he expanded his role to three months of filming. Ernie Reyes, Jr. plays a cemetery guard.|$|E
5|$|Larkin {{had asked}} {{on his deathbed}} that his diaries be destroyed.

His will {{was found to be}} contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors, who decided the material should not be destroyed. When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in turn, left one million <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> St Paul's Cathedral, Hexham Abbey, and Durham Cathedral.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{changes to}} out of hours care {{provided}} by General Practitioners {{have led to}} wide variation in the types and costs of out of hours care across the country. Aim To examine the costs of different models of service delivery for GP out of hours organisations. Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional survey of eight GP out of hours organisations and samples of their patients. A deputising service, rotas, and various types of GP co-operative across Scotland were surveyed. Information on the quantities of resources used by each organisation was combined with unit costs, Costs incurred by patients mid other NHS costs subsequent to the out of hours contact were also calculated Results: Annual costs incurred by the GP out of hours organisation per 1, 000 population ranged from <b>pound</b> 2, 916 <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> 12, 120. There was no relationship between costs and type and size of organisation. There was a three-fold variation in total costs per our of hours contact (<b>pound</b> 15 <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> 51). Costs per phone contact were lowest (<b>pound</b> 6 <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> 11), followed by cost per centre contact (<b>pound</b> 10 <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> 16) and cost per home contact (<b>pound</b> 21 <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> 60), Total costs per episode ranged from <b>pound</b> 78 <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> 136 for centre contacts, from <b>pound</b> 130 <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> 303 for home contacts, and from <b>pound</b> 70 <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> 553 for telephone contacts. Home contacts had the highest average cost per episode (pound 212), followed by telephone contacts (pound 117) and centre contacts (pound 85), Conclusions: There are wide variations in the costs of operating GP out of hours services. It {{is likely that the}} context in which organisations were set up and local geography influence variations in costs, as well as the level of GP cover. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Shrewsbury {{has been}} an {{important}} centre for road traffic. In 1815, Thomas Telford designed a new coaching route from London to Holyhead in order to improve communications with Ireland. He routed the new road via Shrewsbury, which opened in 1830. The road is now the A5. The road connects the town northwest to Oswestry, and east towards Telford, where it joins the M54. The A5 once ran through the town centre, until a bypass was built in the 1930s. Subsequently, in 1992, a 17-mile (27km) dual carriageway was completed at a cost of 79 million <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> the south of the town, and was made to form part of the A5 route. This dual carriageway was built further out of the town to act as a substantial link to Telford, as well as a bypass for the town.|$|E
5|$|The Forge {{junction}} at Telford Town Centre {{was awarded}} relatively late, {{to the company}} Norwest Holst. The junction precipitated the construction of Telford Shopping Centre, and the central commercial area, as the exchange was upgraded to allow traffic from the motorway to join and exit in both directions. The Forge to Cluddley section, from junction 5 to junction 7, opened to traffic in December 1975. The Hilton Park to Forge section, from the M6 to junction 5, opened in November 1983. The motorway cost 65 million <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> build, which when adjusted for inflation would come to approximately 150 million 2006 GBP.|$|E
5|$|Through French {{pressure}} on Libya and {{the mediation of}} Nigerien President Hamani Diori, the two countries resumed diplomatic relations on 17 April 1972.

In exchange, Gaddafi pledged 40 million <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> the Chadian President and the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship in December 1972. Gaddafi withdrew official support to the FROLINAT and forced its leader Abba Siddick to move his headquarters from Tripoli to Algiers. Good relations were confirmed in the following years, with Gaddafi visiting the Chadian capital N'Djamena in March 1974; in the same month a joint bank was created to provide Chad with investment funds.|$|E

5|$|When Richard died on 6 April 1199, the {{archbishop}} invested Richard's youngest brother John as duke of Normandy on 25 April 1199. At the ceremony, John pledged {{to protect the}} Norman church, and soon afterwards confirmed the grant of Dieppe and the other manors to the archdiocese. John contested the right of {{the archbishop}} to some jurisdictional rights however, as well as forest rights, forcing Coutances to pay 2,100 Angevin <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> secure most of the contested rights. In May 1200, Coutances was involved in the peace treaty of Le Goulet between King John and King Philip of France, but took no active part in the Angevin defence of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|While bishop, Hervey {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a history}} of the refounding of the abbey of Ely, which later became incorporated into the Liber Eliensis. This was a Latin reworking of an Old English book of grants compiled by Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester. He was energetic in recovering the feudal rights of the bishopric against knights who had intruded themselves on the lands, but were not rendering knight service to the bishop. As bishop, he attended a legatine council, or council held by a papal legate, in 1127, and a royal council in 1129, but otherwise his administrative actions remain obscure. The causeway between the island of Ely and Exning, which made it easier for pilgrims to visit the shrine of Saint Ethelreda, was built under Hervey's orders. Insight into his activities as bishop is given in the Pipe Roll of 1130, the first surviving Pipe Roll. In that record, Hervey is recorded as owing King Henry 45 <b>pounds</b> <b>to</b> provide an office for a nephew, 100 pounds on an old settlement with the king, another 100 pounds for the settlement of a case dealing with Ramsey Abbey, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey and the bishop, 240 pounds for the right to be rid of a surplus of knights, and finally 1000 pounds for the king to allow the bishop's knights to serve castleguard at Ely instead of Norwich.|$|E
