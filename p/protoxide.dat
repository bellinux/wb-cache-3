6000|$|... 695. When {{this new}} sulphuret was {{dissolved}} in muriatic acid, although a little antimony separated, yet {{it appeared to}} me that a true protochloride, consisting of single proportionals, was formed, and from that by alkalies, &c., a true <b>protoxide,</b> consisting also of single proportionals, was obtainable. But I could not stop to ascertain this matter strictly by analysis.|$|E
6000|$|... 801. The {{ordinary}} <b>protoxide</b> of antimony, {{which consists}} of one proportional of metal and {{one and a half}} of oxygen, was subjected to the action of the electric current in a green-glass tube (789.), surrounded by a jacket of platina foil, and heated in a charcoal fire. The decomposition began and proceeded very well at first, apparently indicating, according to the general law (679. 697.), that this substance was one containing such elements and in such proportions as made it amenable {{to the power of the}} electric current. This effect I have already given reasons for supposing may be due to the presence of a true <b>protoxide,</b> consisting of single proportionals (696. 693.). The action soon diminished, and finally ceased, because of the formation of a higher oxide of the metal at the positive electrode. This compound, which was probably the peroxide, being infusible and insoluble in the <b>protoxide,</b> formed a crystalline crust around the positive electrode; and thus insulating it, prevented the transmission of the electricity. Whether, if it had been fusible and still immiscible, it would have decomposed, is doubtful, because of its departure from the required composition (697.). It was a very natural secondary product at the positive electrode (779.). On opening the tube it was found that a little antimony had been separated at the negative electrode; but the quantity was too small to allow of any quantitative result being obtained[A].|$|E
6000|$|... 1341. I {{have now}} very {{little doubt that}} periodide of mercury (414. 448. 691.) {{is a case of}} the same kind, and also {{corrosive}} sublimate (692.). I am also inclined to think, since making the above experiments, that the anomalous action of the <b>protoxide</b> of antimony, formerly observed and described (693. 801.), may be referred in part to the same cause.|$|E
6000|$|... 399. Other substances, {{which could}} not be melted on glass, were fused by the lamp and {{blowpipe}} on platina connected with one pole of the battery, and then a wire, connected with the other, dipped into them. In this way chloride of sodium, sulphate of soda, <b>protoxide</b> of lead, mixed carbonates of potash and soda, &c. &c., exhibited exactly the same phenomena as those already described: whilst liquid, they conducted and were decomposed; whilst solid, though very hot, they insulated the battery current even when four troughs were used.|$|E
6000|$|... 694. The {{ordinary}} sulphuret of antimony its {{considered as}} being the compound with the smallest quantity of sulphur, and analogous in its proportions to the ordinary <b>protoxide.</b> But I find that if it be fused with metallic antimony, a new sulphuret is formed, containing much more of the metal than the former, and separating distinctly, when fused, both from the pure metal on the one hand, and the ordinary gray sulphuret on the other. In some rough experiments, the metal thus {{taken up by the}} ordinary sulphuret of antimony was equal to half the proportion of that previously in the sulphuret, in which case the new sulphuret would consist of single proportionals.|$|E
6000|$|... 621. All {{those cases}} of bodies which being {{insoluble}} in water and not combining with it are hygrometric, and condense its vapour around or upon their surface, are stronger instances of the same power, and approach a little nearer to the cases under investigation. If pulverized clay, <b>protoxide</b> or peroxide of iron, oxide of manganese, charcoal, or even metals, as spongy platina or precipitated silver, be put into an atmosphere containing vapour of water, they soon become moist by virtue of an attraction which is able to condense the vapour upon, although not to combine it with, the substances; and if, as is well known, these bodies so damped be put into a dry atmosphere, as, for instance, one confined over sulphuric acid, or if they be heated, then they yield up this water again almost entirely, it not being in direct or permanent combination[A].|$|E
6000|$|... 1334. Cavendish {{was perhaps}} the first to show {{distinctly}} that discharge was not always by one channel[A], but, if several are present, by many at once. We may make these different channels of different bodies, and by proportioning their thicknesses and lengths, may include such substances as air, lac, spermaceti, water, <b>protoxide</b> of iron, iron and silver, and by one discharge make each convey its proportion of the electric force. Perhaps the air ought to be excepted, as its discharge by conduction is questionable at present (1336.); but the others may all be limited in their mode of discharge to pure conduction. Yet several of them suffer previous induction, precisely like the induction through the air, it being a necessary preliminary to their discharging action. How can we therefore separate {{any one of these}} bodies from the others, as to the principles and mode of insulating and conducting, except by mere degree? All seem to me to be dielectrics acting alike, and under the same common laws.|$|E
6000|$|... 763. This {{constancy}} {{does not}} {{decide whether the}} muriatic acid is electrolyzed or not, although it proves that if so, it must be in definite proportions to the quantity of electricity used. Other considerations may, however, be allowed to decide the point. The analogy between chlorine and oxygen, in their relations to hydrogen, is so strong, as to lead almost to the certainty, that, when combined with that element, they would perform similar parts {{in the process of}} electro-decomposition. They both unite with it in single proportional or equivalent quantities; and the number of proportionals appearing to have an intimate and important relation to the decomposability of a body (697.), those in muriatic acid, as well as in water, are the most favourable, or those perhaps even necessary, to decomposition. In other binary compounds of chlorine also, where nothing equivocal depending on the simultaneous presence of it and oxygen is involved, the chlorine is directly eliminated at the anode by the electric current. Such is the case with the chloride of lead (395.), which may be justly compared with <b>protoxide</b> of lead (402.), and stands in the same relation to it as muriatic acid to water. The chlorides of potassium, sodium, barium, &c., are in the same relation to the protoxides of the same metals and present the same results {{under the influence of the}} electric current (402.).|$|E
60|$|From Combarbala to Coquimbo, I traversed {{the country}} in a zigzag direction, {{crossing}} and recrossing the porphyritic conglomerate and finding in the granitic districts an unusual number of mountain-masses composed of various intrusive, porphyritic rocks, many of them andesitic. One common variety was greenish-black, with large crystals of blackish albite. At Panuncillo a short N.N.W. and S.S.E. ridge, with a nucleus formed of greenstone and of a slate-coloured porphyry including crystals of glassy feldspar, deserves notice, from the very singular nature of the almost vertical strata composing it. These consist chiefly of a finer and coarser granular mixture, not very compact, of white carbonate of lime, of <b>protoxide</b> of iron and of yellowish garnets (ascertained by Professor Miller), each grain being an almost perfect crystal. Some of the varieties consist exclusively of granules of the calcareous spar; and some contain grains of copper ore, and, I believe, of quartz. These strata alternate with a bluish, compact, fusible, feldspathic rock. Much of the above granular mixture has, also, a pseudo-brecciated structure, in which fragments are obscurely arranged in planes parallel to those of the stratification, and are conspicuous on the weathered surfaces. The fragments are angular or rounded, small or large, and consist of bluish or reddish compact feldspathic matter, in which a few acicular crystals of feldspar can sometimes be seen. The fragments often blend at their edges into the surrounding granular mass, and seem due to a kind of concretionary action.|$|E
60|$|The Unknown.--The order I {{have adopted}} {{is not very}} remote from this. But I was perhaps wrong in {{treating}} first of the agency of gravitation, which owes almost all its powers to the operation of other causes. In consequence of your hint, I shall alter my plan a little, and consider first the chemical agency of water, then that of air, and lastly that of electricity. In every species of chemical change, temperature is concerned. But unless the results of volcanoes and earthquakes be directly referred to this power, it has no chemical effect {{in relation to the}} changes ascribed to time simply considered as heat, but its operations, which are the most important belonging to the terrestrial cycle of changes, are blended with, or bring into activity, those of other agents. One of the most distinct and destructive agencies of water depends upon its solvent powers, which are usually greatest when its temperature is highest. Water is capable of dissolving, in larger or smaller proportions, most compound bodies, and the calcareous and alkaline elements of stones are particularly liable to this kind of operation. When water holds in solution carbonic acid, which is always the case when it is precipitated from the atmosphere, its power of dissolving carbonate of lime is very much increased, and in the neighbourhood of great cities, where the atmosphere contains a large proportion of this principle, the solvent powers of rain upon the marble exposed to it must be greatest. Whoever examines the marble statues in the British Museum, which have been removed from the exterior of the Parthenon, will be convinced that they have suffered from this agency; and an effect distinct in the pure atmosphere and temperate climate of Athens, must be upon a higher scale in the vicinity of other great European cities, where the consumption of fuel produces carbonic acid in large quantities. Metallic substances, such as iron, copper, bronze, brass, tin, and lead, whether they exist in stones, or are used for support or connection in buildings, are liable to be corroded by water holding in solution the principles of the atmosphere; and the rust and corrosion, which are made, poetically, qualities of time, depend upon the oxidating powers of water, which by supplying oxygen in a dissolved or condensed state enables the metals to form new combinations. All the vegetable substances, exposed to water and air, are liable to decay, and even the vapour in the air, attracted by wood, gradually reacts upon its fibres and assists decomposition, or enables its elements to take new arrangements. Hence it is that none of the roofs of ancient buildings more than a thousand years old remain, unless it be such as are constructed of stone, as those of the Pantheon of Rome and the tomb of Theodoric at Ravenna, the cupola of which is composed of a single block of marble. The pictures of the Greek masters, which were painted on the wood of the abies, or pine of the Mediterranean, likewise, as we are informed by Pliny, owed their destruction not to a change in the colours, not to the alteration of the calcareous ground on which they were painted, but to the decay of the tablets of wood on which the intonaco or stucco was laid. Amongst the substances employed in building, wood, iron, tin, and lead, are most liable to decay from the operation of water, then marble, when exposed to its influence in the fluid form; brass, copper, granite, sienite, and porphyry are more durable. But in stones, much depends upon the peculiar nature of their constituent parts; when the feldspar of the granite rocks contains little alkali or calcareous earth, it is a very permanent stone; but, when in granite, porphyry, or sienite, either the feldspar contains much alkaline matter, or the mica, schorl, or hornblende much <b>protoxide</b> of iron, the action of water containing oxygen and carbonic acid on the ferruginous elements tends to produce the disintegration of the stone. The red granite, black sienite, and red porphyry of Egypt, which are seen at Rome in obelisks, columns, and sarcophagi, are amongst the most durable compound stones; but the grey granites of Corsica and Elba are extremely liable to undergo alteration: the feldspar contains much alkaline matter; and the mica and schorl, much <b>protoxide</b> of iron. A remarkable instance of the decay of granite may be seen in the Hanging Tower of Pisa; whilst the marble pillars in the basement remain scarcely altered, the granite ones have lost a considerable portion of their surface, which falls off continually in scales, and exhibits everywhere stains from the formation of peroxide of iron. The kaolin, or clay, used in most countries for the manufacture of fine porcelain or china, is generally produced from the feldspar of decomposing granite, in which the cause of decay is the dissolution and separation of the alkaline ingredients.|$|E
60|$|But {{to return}} to the 'Diary' of Sir Humphrey Davy. This {{pamphlet}} was not designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer, as any person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style. At page 13, for example, near the middle, we read, in reference to his researches about the <b>protoxide</b> of azote: 'In less than half a minute the respiration being continued, diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.' That the respiration was not 'diminished,' is not only clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the plural, 'were.' The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: 'In less than half a minute, the respiration [being continued, these feelings] diminished gradually, and were succeeded by [a sensation] analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.' A hundred similar instances go to show that the MS. so inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book, meant only for the writer's own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion. The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on scientific topics. Not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly afraid of appearing empirical; so that, however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter now in question, he would never have spoken out, until he had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration. I verily believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched, could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this 'Diary' (full of crude speculations) would have been unattended to; as, it seems, they were. I say 'his wishes,' for that he meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed 'to be burnt,' I think there can be no manner of doubt. Whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet remains to be seen. That the passages quoted above, with the other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet {{remains to be seen whether}} this momentous discovery itself (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service or disservice to mankind at large. That Von Kempelen and his immediate friends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to doubt for a moment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to 'realize,' in time, by large purchases of houses and land, with other property of intrinsic value.|$|E

J. H. Teall, Director of the British Geological Survey in the early 1900s, Baddeleyite was discovered thanks {{to the discovery of}} Geikielite. Baddeley happened to send specimens of several pebbles to the Museum of Practical Geology in London, where Mr. Pringle examined them and attempted to classify them. According to Teall, the specimens were submitted to him by Pringle after he failed to assign them and compare them to other species, such as spinel, ilmenite, and so on. After analyzing the specimens, Teall concluded that the mineral was mainly composed of titanic acid and magnesia, with {{a very small percentage of}} <b>protoxide</b> of iron. Geikielite has the composition of MgTiO3. Concluding the various analyses, Teall and Pringle decided to name the new mineral Geikielite, taking the name after the Director General of the Geological Survey, Sir Archibald Geikie. Baddeley then decided to send more specimens to Teall in order to determine a proper specimen to be put in display at the Museum of Practical Geology. While trying to find the best specimen for display, as Teall relates, he noticed that one of the specimens was different from the rest. This new mineral as described was black in color, with a submetallic lustre and a hardness of 6.5. After analyzing the mineral, it was determined that its composition was not MgTiO3, as geikielite's, but it was ZrO2. Teall proposed that the new mineral should be named baddeleyite, after Joseph Baddeley to honor the man who brought two new minerals to notice.|$|E

The reactor, specially setup at the laboratory for this purpose, is used here for the deposition of a-SiCxOy:H thin films on the inner surface of tubular substrates at low temperature and involves the reaction between an organosilicon monomer vapor diluted in a mixture of oxygen or nitrogen <b>protoxide</b> and argon. The glow discharge is transported up to the surface and monomer fragmentation occurs close to it. The substrate tube can translate along its main axis in order to obtain a homogeneous layer along several centimeters. The morphology and chemical composition of the layers have been investigated as a function of the plasma discharge (gas flow rates, gas mixture composition, and plasma power) by scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy, whereas mass spectrometry helped to choose the conditions to form an organic/inorganic membrane. First results show that the deposition rate is very high (several micrometers per minute) and leads to a dense homogeneous organic-like material. Nevertheless, this one presents a good thermal stability up to 500 degreesC under an inert atmosphere. Currently, conditions to obtain much slower deposition rates and inorganic layer are optimized to obtain silica-like membranes for hydrogen separation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cryosurgery is safely {{employed}} {{for the treatment}} of skin precancerous and malignant lesions {{of the head and neck}} in selected patients. The case of a 101 -year-old female patient with advanced malignant melanoma of the facial skin, undergoing cryosurgery, is reported in order to assess the feasibility and tolerability of the technique, as well as the biological implications of cryosurgical treatment in this specific neoplasm. CASE REPORT: A 101 -year-old woman, with a large (pT 4 b N 0 M 0) cutaneous melanoma of the facial skin on the right cheek, was treated at the Division of Surgical Oncology of the National Cancer Research Institute, Italy, from June to August 2003. The treatment was accomplished by means of serial cryosurgical applications which were performed within three months; the bulk of the lesion was cryotreated with a liquid nitrogen cryoprobe, while the residual disease was treated with a nitrous <b>protoxide</b> cryoprobe, by means of the insertion technique. The treatment was well tolerated, with a good aesthetic result, and the patient is recurrence- and distant-disease-free two years after the initial cryosurgical application. CONCLUSION: Cryosurgery is feasible in the treatment of head and neck melanoma, mostly for mucosal melanomas and cutaneous lesions in anatomically critical sites, as well as in high-risk surgical patients. Here, a good aesthetic result was obtained in a very elderly patient with a large cutaneous melanoma of the facial skin, avoiding skin flap transposition for tissue repair and postoperative complications (e. g., serious bleeding or postoperative pain), with a satisfactory functional and oncological outcome at two years...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, it is {{acknowledged}} that climatic changes represent {{a serious threat}} for the environment and, so, this problem has been approached at numerous conferences, conventions and summits. The climate is strongly influenced by {{the changes in the}} atmospheric concentrations of certain gases that hold the solar radiations on the Earth’s surface (the greenhouse effect). The water vapors and the carbon dioxide (CO 2) present in the atmosphere have always generated a natural greenhouse effect, without which the Earth surface would be 33 o C lower than it is today. Other greenhouse gases are: methane (CH 4), nitrogen <b>protoxide</b> (N 2 O), and the halogenated compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). During the last hundred years, man’s activity has led to the increase of the atmospheric concentration of the greenhouse gases and of other pollutants, its consequence being the increase of the average global temperature. Although it has not been calculated exactly how much of this warming {{can be attributed to the}} greenhouse gases, there is evidence that human activity contributes to global warming. The main causes leading to the accentuation of the greenhouse effect are the burning of the fossil fuels, deforestations, cement production, waste disposal, refrigeration etc. The climatic changes triggered by the greenhouse gases will have consequences that have already made themselves visible, causing: the increase of the sea level and the possible flooding of the low areas; the melting of the icecap; the modification of the precipitations regime, with consequences like the increase of the floods and droughts frequency; changes in the occurrence of climatic extremes, especially in the occurrence of the high, extreme temperatures. All these will have a direct impact on ecosystems, health, some key economic sectors such as agriculture and on water resources...|$|E

Introduction: The use of anaesthetics (anesthetic) {{has been}} known for hundreds of years. The art of catalepsis, a sort of mesmerism, {{was one of the first}} methods of allaying pain that was put into practice. Herodotus, a Greek historian B. 0. 484 - 420, Pliny, a Roman naturalist 23 - 79, and Dioskorides, a Greek medical writer who flourished in the second century, mention in some of their manuscripts drugs that were used for the purpose of deadening pain. Mandragora was used by Italian physicians for this purpose. There is a Chinese physician who is credited with having used Cannabis, hemp, for the purpose of obviating the pains of surgical operations, by inhalation. It has been claimed that physicians of the Middle Ages were very skillful in the producing of insensibility by artificial means, and that many of the astonishing exhibitions of unconsciousness to pain were the effect of drugs and vapors. Sir Humphrey Davy, 1778 - 1829, one of the leading English chemists, appears to have been the first to comprehend the practicability of using anaesthesia (anesthesia) for surgical purposes. He discovered that nitro-genic <b>protoxide</b> would, with a reasonable degree of safety, remove the sense of pain and set the mind free from its bodily duties. Michael Faraday, a pupil of Davy's, secured similar results from inhaling sulphuric ether, but it was not until the latter part of the century that this was put to any practical use. It was then that Crawford W. Long of Georgia, Horace Wells of Hartford, and William T. G. Morton of Boston ventured to make some practical demonstrations with it. The latter two, who were dentists, used it in their practice, Wells using nitrous oxide, and Morton, sulphuric ether. Morton's success was so complete that he induced a surgeon to use it in the hospital. After many trials and legal conflicts the credit for the discovery was conceded to Morton. At first his discovery was not accepted very generally in the United States, but received a very speedy appreciation abroad. In the preceding lines I have tried to give a brief history of the use of anaesthetics (anesthetics) leading up to the discovery of the use of ether by Morton...|$|E
