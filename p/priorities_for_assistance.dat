40|$|Based on {{the best}} {{available}} remote sensing data from before 1990, the total area of formally eligible lands in Indonesia for the aff orestation and reforestation (A/R) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) activities under the Kyoto protocol is about 46 M ha. <b>Priorities</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> {{in the development of}} A/R CDM project activities may use criteria based on (i) the Human Development Index (HDI), which is focused on districts with below-average HDI; (ii) population density, which is in the range where the land/labour ratio is conducive to profi table tree-based farming systems; and (iii) Fire Risk Index (FRI). Overall the lists for Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, Molluca, and Papua that meet these criteria involve 302 Districts, 195 M ha of total area in the districts with 48 M ha of ‘eligible Kyoto lands’ and 158 M people and a mean HDI of 64. 7. Th e mean of district-level population density is 293 persons/km 2 and the mean FRI is 0. 086. When a ‘default’ setting of the criteria (minimum 15 % of eligible lands in the district, population density between 10 and 100 persons/km 2, HDI below 65), we obtain a priority list of 60 districts (20 % of the total). Th is priority lists involves 46 M ha in the districts (24 % of the total) with 19 M ha of ‘Kyoto lands’ (40 % of the total) and 19. 5 M people (12 % of the total) and a mean HDI of 62. 9 (refl ecting the ‘pro-poor’ prioritisation), mean of district-level population density of 53 persons/km 2 (the larger districts tend to have lower densities) and mean FRI of 0. 135 (60 % higher than for the set as a whole) ...|$|E
40|$|Context: Australian Aboriginal {{communities}} in urban, rural and remote areas {{are continuing to}} suffer high rates of perinatal mortality and morbidity that will impact on the future health of the community. It {{has been well documented}} that Aboriginal women have extreme distrust of mainstream pregnancy-related health care and suggested that late entry into antenatal care is as high as 50 % in the Aboriginal population. Although medical and midwifery staff have long discussed strategies to improve uptake of antenatal health care for Aboriginal women, researchers in many areas have found the recruitment of Aboriginal people into scientific studies almost impossible. This article seeks to share the strategies that have been developed {{over a period of time}} by the authors that have proved useful for recruitment and retention into research. It is anticipated that these strategies would also apply for health practitioners in maintaining their patients for clinical care management. Issue: Although each research location (regional, rural and remote) has had to spend time determining what approach is best for meeting the research outcomes, many of these suggestions become applicable to clinicians seeking to develop better connections with Aboriginal patients in their clinics. With the management of ongoing chronic health conditions for Aboriginal people a priority in ‘Closing the Gap’, a number of these suggestions could easily be implemented by clinicians. Remembering that each community has specific needs that must be addressed, <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> for that community will be easily identifiable after community consultation (eg transport, or ability to access medical testing). Opportunities for the use of new social media (eg Facebook) as communication tools for researchers and clinicians will have increasing applicability as further software updates are created. Lessons learnt: With open and trusting dialogues between researchers, clinicians and Aboriginal communities, we can go a long way towards understanding the needs of individual communities and working in partnerships to close the gap...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedFrom 1980 to 1992, the United States spent over 6 {{billion dollars to}} combat insurgency and bolster democracy in El Salvador, a nation of only 5. 3 million people. In fact, El Salvador {{was the site of}} the United States' most prolonged - and until the Persian Gulf War - the most costly military endeavor since Vietnam. While United States assistance did help the Salvadoran government combat the insurgents, this aid by most accounts acted to undermine rather than bolster the democratic stability of the country. The thesis examines the democratic experience of El Salvador, as a representative case study of a nation experiencing insurgency, to determine what changes are required in the formation of US foreign policy to help bolster democratic stability in countries challenged by insurgency. The thesis makes four key assertions: First, it is in the United States' self-interest to aid in the consolidation of democracy in El Salvador. Second, El Salvador is a nascent democracy, even after the Peace Accords of 1992 were signed, lacking democratic experience or stability, thus requiring US assistance. Third, despite oligarchic resistance, the United States has the ability to successfully influence democratic reform. Fourth, the best way to define United States' <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> democratic <b>assistance</b> to El Salvador must be through a comprehensive, empirically-based assessment of causal factors. Utilizing the El Salvador case study and pre-existing theories, the thesis then presents and tests a new empirically-based model <b>for</b> define US <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> providing democratic <b>assistance</b> to El Salvador or any other country under consideration.

40|$|Because many animal {{diseases}} have strong transboundary attributes, their control can be reasonably characterized {{as an international}} public good. The potential for reservoirs of transboundary diseases to persist in developing countries that lack the capacity or incentives to control them implies a need for international financial transfers to fund control. However, the costs of control can be large compared with development assistance budgets, and the benefits small compared with the global benefits of control and the local benefits of other priority investments.

40|$|As budgets {{in forest}} {{management}} agencies become more restrictive, cost-effective programs become more important. This paper describes a quantitative tool <b>for</b> setting <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> the forestry <b>assistance</b> program {{administered by the}} Montana Division of Forestry. Logistic regression was used to better identify the type of forest owners to which assistance should be directed. (In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a probability that a certain event or activity will occur.) Data supporting model development were obtained from a questionnaire survey of forest landowners in the western portion of Montana. Four models were developed that pertain to past use of technical assistance, intention to harvest timber, and timber benefits as motivation for forest ownership. The most consistently useful independent variables were geographic region and past timber harvest activity. The author discusses procedures for interpreting results and for rating land ownerships <b>for</b> <b>assistance.</b> One model is discussed in detail, but the discussion is applicable to the other three models.

In this study, the case of Ethiopia was used (i) to assess the proportion of 291 nutrition surveys conducted between 2003 and 2008 that used the recommended sampling method to estimate the prevalence of wasting, (ii) to assess how and what data on indicators of aggravating factors were collected, (iii) to examine whether data on such factors can be used to establish <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> emergency <b>assistance</b> based on Ethiopian Government guidelines and (iv) to discuss the general value of such data. All but one survey used the recommended methods to estimate the prevalence of wasting. Data were collected on more than 40 indicators of aggravating factors related to health, caring practices, food security and coping strategies, but no consistent methods or indicators were used, resulting in inconsistent data. This illustrates the need to develop and agree upon a set of core indicators of aggravating factors and then thresholds to describe the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia and elsewhere and to indicate <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> interventions...|$|R
40|$|Various {{commentators}} often contrapose emerging development {{donors to}} the traditional ones {{on a number of}} factors including aid effectiveness. While such distinction can be productive <b>for</b> analyzing development <b>assistance</b> at a global level, it might bring less value when considering development aid milieu at a local level. In this article the author considersthe case of Kyrgyzstan and its main aid donors based on select criteria set out by the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation. It draws on an analysis of databases, official documents, open sources including media and the country’s National Sustainable Development Strategy for 2013 – 2017. It concludes that traditional and emerging donors do not represent homogeneous groups; for Kyrgyzstan, differences within the group can be as significant as differences among the groups. Moreover, the analysis does not support the notion that assistance from traditional donors has greater effectiveness. On some parameters including alignment emerging donors’ assistance can be more effective. Nonetheless, serious gaps between the two groups remain in terms of transparency, mutual accountability and harmonization. The author also explores the stronger bargaining positions of aid recipient in their interactions with donors due to the increased diversity of sources of assistance, focusing on this trend in Kyrgyzstan. Given Kyrgyzstan’s position as a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> Russia’s <b>assistance</b> and Russia’s rapidly increasing levels of support, the author also addresses the case of Russian-Kyrgyz Development Fundin detail...|$|R
40|$|As {{problems}} in society {{are reflected in}} our schools, it becomes necessary for school personnel to prioritize student needs. It is especially essential for school counselors to set priorities as they plan guidance and counseling programs for the future. The purpose for conducting {{this study was to}} compare the perceptions of students, teachers, and parents of Lincoln High School students regarding the types of assistance students need from school counselors. ^ Students, teachers, and parents were asked to complete a needs assessment survey to determine what student needs were thought to be of most importance among the three groups. The needs assessment survey was divided into 9 categories including: (1) Planning and developing careers; (2) Making decisions about college; (3) Preparation for finding jobs; (4) Finding jobs; (5) Job selection and training; (6) Planning and managing high school; (7) Issues which affect me; (8) Understanding and getting along with others; (9) Understanding and accepting myself. ^ The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks was used to assess differences among the responses of teachers, parents, and students for each category of the needs assessment survey. Pairwise comparisons, using the Mann-Whitney U test were used to follow-up significant ANOVAS. ^ Students, teachers, and parents agreed that career planning and obtaining financial aid were <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> counselor <b>assistance.</b> Teachers and parents selected more items in the realm of affective issues than did students. Students selected items primarily dealing with career and educational planning. Findings can be used by school counselors and administrators to plan school guidance and counseling programs {{to meet the needs of}} students. ...|$|R
