40|$|Small Darrieus wind {{turbines}} are standing out {{as one of}} the most promising technologies in view of a widespread availability of delocalized energy production from wind. In view of a performance optimization ofDarrieus rotors, the application of a pitch angle to blades has been often suggested. In the present work, the pitch modeling in an advanced BEM code has been exploited to investigate different pitch control strategies. In particular, the prospects of a pitch preset based on both the maximum power and the maximum energy extraction have been evaluated and compared to those connected to a <b>progressive</b> <b>pitch</b> variation with the turbine revolution speed. The pitch effects have been discussed both in terms of aggregated power output and of variation of the airfoil functioning conditions throughout a revolution. The analysis confirmed that the application of a proper pitch angle could definitely provide an increase of the turbine performance, especially at medium-high solidities...|$|E
40|$|To ensure {{adequate}} {{access to}} sanitation in developing economies, off-grid single household sanitation {{has been proposed}} which obviates the need for significant infrastructure capital investment. Whilst treatment at this scale is most efficient when coupled to source separation (i. e. urine from faeces), existing source separation solutions have proved difficult to implement in this context. In this study, screw extrusion is therefore investigated to provide ‘post-flush’ source separation. Both screw characteristics and operational boundary conditions were evaluated. Preferential screw characteristics included tapering of the shaft and <b>progressive</b> <b>pitch</b> reduction, linked to a small extrusion aperture, the combination of which enhanced solids extrusion efficiency and promoted higher solids concentration in the extruded fraction. Whilst maximum extrusion efficiency was observed at high rotational speeds (over 400 rpm), this also promoted free water transport. Operating below 300 rpm instead introduced selectivity for transport of faecal sludge over urine, enabling phase separation. Constraining the volumetric ratio of urine to faeces also enhanced the extrusion rate of faecal sludge by increasing feed viscosity sufficient to overcome backpressure imposed by unmasticated food particles that would otherwise restrict separation. Importantly, this study demonstrates the feasibility of screw extrusion for ‘post flush’ separation of urine and faeces which constitutes a significant advancement towards realising sanitation at a single household scale...|$|E
5000|$|In early 1948, Pressman led a {{group of}} like-minded colleagues in a pitch to CIO {{executives}} to abandon Truman and the Democratic Party for Henry A. Wallace and his <b>Progressive</b> Party. The <b>pitch</b> failed. Repercussions came quickly. [...] In late 1947, housecleaning of the CIO from communists had already begun when Len De Caux was let go by Murray.|$|R
40|$|Objective. It is {{generally}} accepted that crackles {{are due to}} sudden opening of airways and that larger airways produce crackles of lower pitch than smaller airways do. As larger airways are likely to open earlier in inspiration than smaller airways and the reverse {{is likely to be}} true in expiration, we studied crackle pitch as a function of crackle timing in inspiration and expiration. Our goal was to see if the measurement of crackle pitch was consistent with this theory. Methods. Patients with a significant number of crackles were examined using a multichannel lung sound analyzer. These patients included 34 with pneumonia, 38 with heart failure, and 28 with interstitial fibrosis. Results. Crackle pitch progressively increased during inspirations in 79 % of all patients. In these patients crackle pitch increased by approximately 40 [*]Hz from the early to midinspiration and by another 40 [*]Hz from mid to late-inspiration. In 10 % of patients, crackle pitch did not change and in 11 % of patients crackle pitch decreased. During expiration crackle pitch progressively decreased in 72 % of patients and did not change in 28 % of patients. Conclusion. In the majority of patients, we observed <b>progressive</b> crackle <b>pitch</b> increase during inspiration and decrease during expiration. Increased crackle pitch at larger lung volumes is likely a result of recruitment of smaller diameter airways. An alternate explanation is that crackle pitch may be influenced by airway tension that increases at greater lung volume. In any case improved understanding of the mechanism of production of these common lung sounds may help improve our understanding of pathophysiology of these disorders...|$|R

40|$|This Folio of Compositions is {{the result}} of an intense musical search. A search that I do not believe to be {{finished}} yet and which probably never will be, as being a composer is a lifelong journey of exploration. There has been a clear development in my personal voice during the last 5 years, a development that is documented in the music of these 11 pieces. The folio includes solo pieces, several chamber works and an orchestral score. Through the composition of these works I have consolidated a style where polyphonic texture, which involves a strong use of polyrhythms and isorhythm, and <b>progressive</b> transformations in <b>pitch</b> and harmony, play an important role. This commentary is divided into two sections. The first part contains some information about all the compositions, outlining facts such as the date of composition, first performance and main features of the piece. In the second part I present details and examples of compositional techniques, focusing on three specific music elements: harmony and pitches, melody and rhythm. By composing this corpus of pieces I had the aim of looking further into the essence of music, into the process of communication and the beauty of art. ...|$|R
