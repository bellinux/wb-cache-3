Two major types of projects have been undertaken, aimed at identifying (i) policy-relevant questions most imperative to conservation and (ii) horizon scanning topics, defined as emerging issues {{that are expected to}} have substantial implications for biodiversity conservation and policy in the future. Here, we provide the first overview of the outcomes of biodiversity and conservation-oriented projects recently completed around the world using this framework. We also include the results of the first questions and horizon scanning project completed for a Mediterranean country. Overall, the outcomes of the different projects undertaken (at the global scale, in the UK, US, Canada, Switzerland and in Israel) were strongly correlated in terms of the proportion of questions and/or horizon scanning topics selected when comparing different topic areas. However, some major differences were found across regions.

This report {{is the result of a}} consensus process using selected experts in health and exercise. The purpose of the consensus conference was to identify research priorities for physical activity and health among people with disabilities. Priorities were established by 30 participants, who were selected by the principal investigators to achieve balance in the areas of engineering, epidemiology, medicine, nutrition, exercise physiology, and psychology. Experts summarized relevant data from their research and from comprehensive review of the scientific literature on the topic areas chosen for the conference. Public commentary was provided by participants in the 1996 Paralympic Congress. Panel members discussed openly all material presented to them in executive session. Commentary from open discussion periods were recorded and transcribed.

40|$|<b>Priority</b> <b>question</b> {{exercises}} are becoming an increasingly common tool to frame future agendas in conservation and ecological science. They are {{an effective way}} to identify research foci that advance the field and that also have high policy and conservation relevance. To date, there has been no coherent synthesis of key questions and priority research areas for palaeoecology, which combines biological, geochemical and molecular techniques in order to reconstruct past ecological and environmental systems on time-scales from decades to millions of years. We adapted a well-established methodology to identify 50 priority research questions in palaeoecology. Using a set of criteria designed to identify realistic and achievable research goals, we selected questions from a pool submitted by the international palaeoecology research community and relevant policy practitioners. The integration of online participation, both before and during the workshop, increased international engagement in question selection. The questions selected are structured around six themes: human-environment interactions in the Anthropocene; biodiversity, conservation and novel ecosystems; biodiversity over long time-scales; ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycling; comparing, combining and synthesizing information from multiple records; and new developments in palaeoecology. Future opportunities in palaeoecology are related to improved incorporation of uncertainty into reconstructions, an enhanced understanding of ecological and evolutionary dynamics and processes and the continued application of long-term data for better-informed landscape management.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the XXI sentry, the sustainable use of water is not only a <b>priority</b> <b>question</b> for water scarce regions and for agriculture in particular but for all sectors and regions in Europe. Imbalances between availability and demand, degradation of surface and ground water quality, inter sartorial competition, inter-regional and internal conflicts, all bring water issues to foreground. The effects of climate change in Europe are already significant and measurable. Scenarios generally predict a change in drought for almost all regions of Europe. According the EU Commission staff Working Document “Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union”, most EU Member States have reported drought events which have taken place since 1976. From 2000 to 2006, an average of 15 % of the EU total area and an average of 17 % of the EU total population were affected by droughts. They represent a total area of 460 000 km (about 10 % of the total EU area) and host a total population of 82 million (about 16. 5 % of the total EU population). As regards drought events, they have often been resolved by a crisis management approach dictated by a lack of timely preparedness for extreme events. Water scarcity situations encountered at river basin level have already had noticeable impacts on water supply, economy, society and environment and can last beyond the end of the drought event.

40|$|The {{national}} <b>priority</b> <b>question</b> {{of education}} quality is {{considered in the}} article {{at the level of}} an in-depth – existential – function of the educational system, where the former arises. In that case, education appears not only as a social organism, but a fundamental form of understanding existence and self-realization of a person as a self-organized space and biosocial system in terms of an integral educational result. The mechanisms and effects of formal development logic become clear from such research perspective namely, that changes into philosophy of education {{in the shape of a}} single-dimensional methodological imperative and provides for an inconsistency of educational practice, achievement of some pedagogical aims at the expense and to the disadvantage of others. The limited nature of pedagogical thinking is not simply fixed in the paradoxes of human development as an individual and organism, but is considered as the main obstacle in the way of evolution of the Human-Nature-Society global system. The phenomenological comprehension of education problems supposes coming into the space of a spiritual idea, funding the process of searching for quality at different levels of human life and activities from within, which characterizes the topicality of the given article.   The aim of the scientific research is to analyze factors limiting the process of modern human development, and to ground the necessity of the fundamental updating of the education model in the noospheric scientific paradigm. Theoretical methods of research are used in the paper: analysis of scientific literature, system analysis, analogy, systematization, and generalization. The research results are represented in the categories of education philosophy and focus the reader’s attention mainly on its critical-reflexive function. Elimination of the subject of education is considered as a logical result of phenomenological reduction of thinking that loses a higher level of the Universal, divides the single living space into the “autonomous” spheres of life and at the same time hides the natural code of stability (health) of a person. The article contains the description of splitting of consciousness process, of a deep inversion of personality in the system of biological and social determination of development, analysis of the human’s two-headed problem (psychological-physiological and psychospiritual) and the limit of pedagogical thinking operating in modern practice of the students’ personality socialization. System insufficiency and functional danger of the traditional binary model of development is formed in the absence of clear ideas in pedagogics of the ontological structure of the subject and a complete concept of the individual, accumulation of the negative quality of individual and public lifestyles.  Therefore, it is possible to suppose that formation of an individual, a person – the object of the space, social and natural  system must become the aim and result of the modern educational mainstream. In such a case, Müller-Haeckel’s biogenetic law regulating traditional education must lose its methodological force. The proposed methodology of managing quality of education implies higher subjectness of development of the educational process participants, restoration of their personality unity based on noospheric pedagogical philosophy and requires expanding the regulatory principle of modeling educational practice up to the anthropocosmic one.    </p...|$|E

40|$|Work in progress. Comments welcome. Traditionally, {{political}} {{philosophers and}} theorists (from Plato and Aristotle to Montesquieu) not only systematically distinguished {{a greater number}} of political regimes than we are accustomed to distinguish today (identifying several varieties of democracy and non-democracy, according to several normative criteria) but also used these distinctions for specifically evaluative purposes: distinctions among political regimes corresponded to {{the degree to which a}} political regime facilitated important values (e. g., the common good, the good life, freedom, etc.). Questions of evaluation often took <b>priority</b> over <b>questions</b> of justification. Contemporary political theory, by contrast, with some exceptions, has mostly operated within the restricted distinction between (liberal) democratic and non-democratic regimes, and has failed to attend to the morally significant differences among “imperfect ” or “less justified ” political regimes. Questions of justification have mostly taken <b>priority</b> over <b>questions</b> of evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Hummingbird is {{a highly}} focused {{scientific}} mission, proposed to NASA s Discovery Program, designed to address the highest <b>priority</b> <b>questions</b> in cometary science-that of the chemical composition of the cometary nucleus. After rendezvous with the comet, Hummingbird would first methodically image and map the comet, then collect and analyze dust, ice and gases from the cometary atmosphere to enrich characterization of the comet and support landing site selection. Then, like its namesake, Hummingbird would carefully descend to a pre-selected surface site obtaining a high-resolution image, gather a surface material sample, acquire surface temperature and then immediately return to orbit for detailed chemical and elemental analyses followed by a high resolution post-sampling image of the site. Hummingbird s analytical laboratory contains instrumentation for a comprehensive molecular and elemental analysis of the cometary nucleus {{as well as an}} innovative surface sample acquisition device...|$|R
