How to easily and reasonably determine the value of principal stress {{in the direction of}} plane strain is the key point. Based on the Elastic-plastic stress-strain relationship for soil and test data under the plane strain condition, it is assumed that the relationship between principal stresses in <b>plain</b> <b>strain</b> direction and the principal stresses in the other directions is bilinear. The parameters of bilinear function are determined by one-dimensional consolidation and failure state. The principal stress in <b>plain</b> <b>strain</b> direction is expressed as a function of stress states and material properties.

In addition, q-lp mutant larvae are inactive, consume little and grow slowly, with a high death rate and other developmental abnormalities. Pigmentation of the silkworm epidermis consists of melanin, ommochrome and pteridine. Silkworm development is regulated by ecdysone and juvenile hormone. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq on the epidermis of the q-lp mutant in the 4 th instar during molting, with 932 VR serving as the control. The results showed 515 differentially expressed genes, of which 234 were upregulated and 281 downregulated in q-lp. BLASTGO analysis indicated that the downregulated genes mainly encode protein-binding proteins, membrane components, oxidation/reduction enzymes, and proteolytic enzymes, whereas the upregulated genes largely encode cuticle structural constituents, membrane components, transport related proteins, and protein-binding proteins. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to verify {{the accuracy of the}} RNA-Seq data, focusing on key genes for biosynthesis of the three pigments and chitin as well as genes encoding cuticular proteins and several related nuclear receptors, which are thought to play key roles in the q-lp mutant.

40|$|The {{safety of}} {{construction}} in the long-term performance is the main goal of structural designers. An example is seen in reinforced concrete (RC) bridge deck slabs that {{have been subjected to}} a large number of load repetitions. Therefore, many numerical and experimental studies have been conducted to predict the fatigue life of these slabs. Most of these studies focused on the modeling of fatigue behaviors of RC slabs reinforced with deformed bars. Until 1965, plain bars were used for reinforcing RC bridge slabs in a part of Japan. The fatigue damage of those slabs is more significantly observed than that of slabs reinforced with deformed bars. Moreover, old slabs were economically designed by small thickness without considering the fatigue resistance. Until 1965, plain bars were used for reinforcing RC bridge slabs in a part of Japan. The fatigue damage of those slabs is more significantly observed than that of slabs reinforced with deformed bars. Therefore, it is important to predict the fatigue behaviors of these slabs to decide a suitable repairing method. For the main goal of this research, a numerical method based on the bridging stress degradation concept is presented in this study to simulate the fatigue behaviors of RC slabs reinforced with plain bars under a moving load. Moreover, this study provides a numerical investigation to understand the fatigue failure and the improvement mechanism of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthening. Finite element method (FEM) is used to solve a slab model of smeared crack elements. The cracked elements are modified according to the bridging stress degradation concept. This concept can be defined as the reduction of transferred stress across a crack plane under repetitive loading due to crack opening and closing process. Reinforcing bars are modeled as a smeared reinforcement according to its ratio in all directions. For plain reinforcing bars, the bond-slip effect between a reinforcing bar and its surrounding concrete is taken into consideration by adding equivalent bond <b>strain</b> to <b>plain</b> bar <b>strain.</b> To verify the numerical method, this study will be divided to three parts as follows. In the first part, plain concrete beam is analyzed under static and fixed pulsating load. Moreover, RC beams are analyzed using this numerical method under fixed pulsating and moving load. The numerical method succeeded in describing the propagation of cracked elements for fixed pulsating and moving load. The numerical results are compared with the experimental results to examine the applicability of this method for plain and reinforced concrete beams. In the second part, three RC slabs reinforced with plain bars are conducted using the proposed numerical method. Moreover, one RC slab reinforced with deformed bars is analyzed to compare with that reinforced with plain bars. The numerical model is verified using previous experimental data. This model is also able to capture the cracking pattern, change in displacement and rebar strain. The numerical results provide a good agreement with the experimental ones. In this part, a successful explanation of fatigue failure mechanism is existed. The effect of plain reinforcing bars on the fatigue behaviors is described. In the last, three full scale RC slabs reinforced with plain bars under moving load are analyzed using a proposed numerical method to simulate their fatigue behaviors. two of them were strengthened with externally bonded FRP sheets in longitudinal and transverse directions on slab bottom surface. The interfacial bond behavior between FRP sheet and concrete surface with its degradation due to fatigue loading are integrated to obtain appropriate numerical results. The propagation of cracked elements, center displacement evolution, cracking pattern and FRP strain are presented in this study. According to the results, FRP sheets play an important role to restrict the major crack opening. This leads to a slow degradation, longer fatigue life and smaller deformations for the strengthened RC slab. These numerical results are compared with the experimental results, and this comparison provides a good agreement...|$|R
