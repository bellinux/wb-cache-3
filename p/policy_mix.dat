Previous conceptual work on <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> has highlighted evaluative criteria such as "consistency" (the ability of multiple policy tools to reinforce rather than undermine each other in the pursuit of individual policy goals), "coherence" (or the ability of multiple policy goals to co-exist with each other in a logical fashion), and "congruence" (or the ability of multiple goals and instruments to work together in a uni-directional or mutually supportive fashion) as important design principles and measures of optimality in <b>policy</b> <b>mixes.</b> And previous empirical work on the evolution of existing <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> has highlighted how these three criteria are often lacking in mixes which have evolved over time as well as those which have otherwise been consciously designed.

40|$|In {{resource}} economics, decoupling {{from environmental}} impacts {{is assumed to}} be beneficial. However, the success of efforts to increase resource productivity should be placed {{within the context of the}} earth’s resources and ecosystems as theoretically finite and contingent on a number of threshold values.

Through ex-post evaluation of a number of real world <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> from European Union member states, this paper further develops definitions of the concept of decoupling.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ambition}} of energy policy {{has long been}} to reduce carbon emissions, secure energy supply and provide affordable energy services. In recent years {{an increasing number of}} policy instruments have been introduced to promote energy efficiency in different sectors across the EU. While previous research has largely analysed the effectiveness of individual policy instruments and their impact on the diffusion of particular energy efficient technologies or practices, our analysis takes a broader view and examines the <b>mix</b> of existing <b>policies</b> aimed at stimulating reductions in energy use. The empirical focus of the paper is on policy goals and instruments aimed at stimulating energy efficiency in buildings in Finland and the United Kingdom (UK). We trace the development of the <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> during 2000 – 2014 and analyse their emerging overall characteristics. The analysis is based on a mapping of policy goals and instruments, documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders.

These factors highlighted the Government of Ecuador's unsustainable economic <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> of large fiscal deficits and expansionary money policy and resulted in a 7.3% contraction of GDP, annual year-on-year inflation of 52.2%, and a 65% devaluation of the national currency in 1999.|$|E

40|$|Treating waste as a {{resource}} and {{the design of a}} circular economy have been identified as key approaches for resource efficiency. Despite ambitious targets, policies and instruments that would enable a transition from a conventional waste management to an integrated and comprehensive resource management are still missing. Moreover, this will require innovative <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> which do not only address different end-of-pipe approaches but integrate various resource efficiency aspects from product design to patterns of production and consumption. Based on the results of a project funded by the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development named "POLFREE - Policy Options for {{a resource}} efficient economy", this paper addresses several aspects of the conceptualization of <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> with regard to waste as a specific resource efficiency challenge. The guiding research interest of this paper is the combination of policies necessary to create a full circular economy. In a first step, the present waste policy frameworks, institutions and existing incentives at national level are examined in order to disclose regulatory and policy gaps. Based on this, {{the second part of the}} paper describes and analyses specific waste-related resource efficiency instruments with regard to their potential impacts under the constraints of various barriers.

Thus traditional analyses were made with respect to the two policy instruments to obtain the optimum <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> of the two to achieve macroeconomic goals, lest the two policy tools be aimed at mutually inconsistent targets. But more recently, owing to the transfer of control with respect to monetary policy formulation to central banks, formation of monetary unions (like European Monetary Union formed via the Stability and Growth Pact), and attempts being made to form fiscal unions, there has been a significant structural change in the way in which fiscal and monetary policies interact.|$|E
50|$|In a {{world of}} ever {{increasing}} water demand and decline in water availability and/or reliability, where water-related hazards are on rise, where climate change threatens to undo decades of development efforts, {{the only way to}} sustainability is a right mix of mutually strengthening policy instruments. In this <b>policy</b> <b>mix,</b> Economic Policy Instruments (EPIs) are best suited to foster an efficient allocation and use of water, reduce harmful exposure and impacts on the communities and environment, and protect natural capital.EPIs are regulations that encourage behaviour through market signals rather than through explicit directives”. They are a means of correcting market signals in order to convey the costs of externalities to economic actors (individuals as well as firms) which have generated them. Regarding water policies, economic instruments comprise regulations like those creating virtual market conditions (tradable permits), charges for public services, payments for ecosystem services, and transfer payments such as incentives based on taxation, levies, fees and royalties and subsidies. They represent an alternative to more traditional command and control instruments. Whereas already introduced into climate policies, air quality and energy policies, their application to water policies represents some specific challenges.|$|E
40|$|One key {{approach}} for studying emerging technologies {{in the field}} of sustainability transitions is that of technological innovation systems (TIS). While most TIS studies aim at deriving policy recommendations - typically by identifying system barriers - the actual role of these proposed policies in the TIS is rarely looked at. In addition, often single policy instruments instead of more encompassing policy mixes are considered. We address these shortcomings by applying a more comprehensive <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> concept within the TIS approach. In doing so we analyze interdependencies between the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> and the TIS by shedding light {{on the role of the}} <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> for TIS functioning and performance as well as how TIS developments influence the evolution of the <b>policy</b> <b>mix.</b> We explore these interdependencies for the case of offshore wind in Germany, using data from event history analysis and expert interviews. We find highly dynamic interdependencies with reoccurring patterns of systemic problems and adjustments of the <b>policy</b> <b>mix,</b> which are fuelled by high <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> credibility and supportive actors. Our study constitutes a first step incorporating the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> concept into the TIS approach, thereby enabling a better understanding of real dynamics occurring in TIS...|$|E

40|$|Against the {{background}} of climate change, a decarbonization of the energy system constitutes a major objective in many countries. Renewable energy technologies (RET) {{play a key role}} for this – yet some of these technologies are still rather immature thus requiring further innovation to become more competitive. While innovation is often hindered by a number of failures and barriers, policy intervention may help removing these. Due to the multitude of failures, multiple policy instruments – so-called policy mixes – are required. Such policy mixes are in fact complex formations, exceeding policy instruments added up to instrument mixes. Yet the literature on policy mixes for innovation often neglects major <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> components such as strategic elements or overarching characteristics, e. g. consistency and credibility. Therefore the first objective of this thesis is to develop an overarching concept of the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> for innovation in RET and for sustainability transitions more broadly that goes beyond policy instruments and that can serve as analytical framework for empirical analyses. An important prerequisite for successfully fostering innovation in emerging RET is {{a better understanding of the}} innovation impact of such a complex <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> on these technologies. The second objective of the thesis addresses this issue – it is to explore the effects of such a comprehensive <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> on innovation in RET. Such impacts are studied both at the level of firms as key innovators and at the innovation system level, providing for a systemic and more encompassing innovation perspective. The analysis is carried out for the case of offshore wind in Germany due to the importance of offshore wind for achieving renewable energy targets and to the rich <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> in place for this technology in Germany. While the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> concept is developed based on a review of the literatures on innovation studies, environmental economics and policy analysis, the innovation impact of the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> is analyzed with a predominantly qualitative approach, including interviews, history event analysis and document analysis. The first finding of the thesis is the comprehensive <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> concept consisting of a policy strategy and instrument mix, policy processes and <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> characteristics. Second, regarding the impact of the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> on innovation in offshore wind in Germany it is found that several <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> components (besides other factors) – particularly the policy strategy, the instrument mix and <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> consistency – play a decisive role for corporate innovation activities. Furthermore, the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> does not only influence the development of the technological innovation system (TIS) of offshore wind in Germany but is also altered based on TIS developments. Finally policy processes have been found to be an influential determinant of TIS functioning. These findings point to a crucial role of the comprehensive <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> for innovation. Policy makers aiming to foster offshore wind and RET in general should therefore consciously design the whole <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> (not only particular policy instruments) considering, for instance, interactions between instruments, characteristics of instrument mixes and also the process of making and implementing policies...|$|E

40|$|A {{far-reaching}} transformation to green, CO 2 –free solutions {{is needed}} to achieve the ambitious climate policy target of limiting the global temperature rise to not more than 2 °C. With this in mind, the GRETCHEN project explored the impacts of the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> on innovation in renewable power generation technologies in Germany at three levels: the micro level, focusing on the perspective of individual companies, the meso level, examining industry structures and the innovation system, and the macro level, modelling macroeconomic effects and CO 2 emissions. The impact of the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> was analysed at these three levels for the following aspects: political targets to expand power generation from renewable energy sources, technology push, demand pull and systemic instruments {{as well as their}} interaction within the instrument mix, and the consistency and credibility of the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> and the coherence of political processes. The <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> needed for a green transformation of the energy system can be considered holistically and valuated with regard to its innovation impact based on the <b>policy</b> <b>mix</b> concept developed in the GRETCHEN project.

40|$|Since the 1950 s {{the global}} {{consumption}} {{of natural resources}} has skyrocketed, both in magnitude and {{in the range of}} resources used. Closely coupled with emissions of greenhouse gases, land consumption, pollution of environmental media, and degradation of ecosystems, as well as with economic development, increasing resource use is a key issue to be addressed {{in order to keep the}} planet Earth in a safe and just operating space. This requires thinking about absolute reductions in resource use and associated environmental impacts, and, when put in the context of current re-focusing on economic growth at the European level, absolute decoupling, i. e., maintaining economic development while absolutely reducing resource use and associated environmental impacts. Changing behavioural, institutional and organisational structures that lock-in unsustainable resource use is, thus, a formidable challenge as existing world views, social practices, infrastructures, as well as power structures, make initiating change difficult. Hence, <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> are needed that will target different drivers in a systematic way. When designing <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> for decoupling, the effect of individual instruments on other drivers and on other instruments in a mix should be considered and potential negative effects be mitigated. This requires smart and time-dynamic policy packaging. This Special Issue investigates the following research questions: What is decoupling and how does it relate to resource efficiency and environmental policy? How can we develop and realize <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> for decoupling economic development from resource use and associated environmental impacts? And how can we do this in a systemic way, so that all relevant dimensions and linkages—including across economic and social issues, such as production, consumption, transport, growth and wellbeing­—are taken into account? In addressing these questions, the overarching goals of this Special Issue are to: address the challenges related to more sustainable resource-use; contribute to the development of successful policy tools and practices for sustainable development and resource efficiency (particularly through the exploration of socio-economic, scientific, and integrated aspects of sustainable development); and inform policy debates and policy-making. The Special Issue draws on findings from the EU and other countries to offer lessons of international relevance for <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> for more sustainable resource-use, with findings of interest to policy makers in central and local government and NGOs, decision makers in business, academics, researchers, and scientists...|$|R
40|$|This report {{builds on}} the {{findings}} of the qualitative ex-ante assessment s of the <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> developed under the DYNAMIX project 1. In doing so, it identifies some of the challenges associated with the forward-looking evaluation of <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> generally, and with the specific <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> identified by the DYNAMIX project. It also notes key areas of consonance and divergence between the qualitative ex ante assessments under consideration, and the quantitative ex-ante assessments carried out in parallel, and identifies possible implications for policy. The report first explains the methodology adopted for each aspect of the qualitative ex-ante assessment; it then discusses some of the challenges which were common to all or several of the assessments, or which arise from the process of bringing separate assessments together to form a single overview. Understanding these challenges, and thus the nature of the messages that emerge from the evaluations (both in terms of the valuable light they provide, {{and in terms of the}}ir limitations) is important to their effective use in policymaking. Moreover, some of the challenges of the evaluations themselves reflect the challenges faced by policymakers in developing responses at the scale required to deliver a significant shift towards improved resource efficiency in the European economy. This report then addresses the comparison with the quantitative assessment carried out in parallel under the DYNAMIX project, looking at both the economic modelling and the physical and environmental modelling, and respectively comparing them with the economic and the environmental qualitative assessments. This report does not aim to recapitulate the detailed findings of the individual qualitative assessments, which are summarised in Annex 1. Rather, it attempts to identify some key messages which emerge from the process of bringing together separate qualitative assessments which address different facets of the impacts of <b>policy</b> <b>mixes,</b> using different methodological approaches; a process which was informed by the comparison with the results emerging from the quantitative assessment. These messages appear to be of broad relevance to the development of <b>policy</b> <b>mixes</b> for resource efficiency. In particular, we identify: • The importance of understanding public acceptability issues, and the potential for policy sequencing to be used to help achieve the required changes in paradigms over time; • The challenges involved in developing appropriate, and effective, tax instruments, which requires attention to the risk of overlaps between tax instruments, and is confronted with a broad challenge of public acceptability; • The need to address the impact of extra - EU material flows in the form of imports and exports, both in terms of the potential impacts (often exaggerated in the public discourse) on EU economic interests, and in terms of the impact of EU policies on environmental and other outcomes in other economies; • The importance of addressing social impacts at an early stage in policy design, in order to ensure that accompanying measures reinforce and facilitate the shift to resource efficiency among low - income households in particular. • The need for coherence and consistency in the development of <b>policy</b> <b>mixes,</b> based on forward - looking roadmapping, effective sequencing, and an awareness of the challenges posed by uncertainty (both uncertainty in relation to the impact of individual policies, and uncertainty as to the broader context in which policies will be implemented) ...|$|R
