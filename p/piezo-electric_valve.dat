40|$|The gas {{introduction}} module (GIM) is {{the basic}} system used in Joint European Torus (JET) to provide the vacuum vessel {{with the amount of}} gas necessary for a successful plasma discharge. The plasma density feedback (PDF) system controls the GIM <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>valve</b> allowing the desired amount of gas to flow in the vacuum vessel. The unavailability of a flow measurement is the main reason for the development of an accurate flow model, able to predict and calculate the number of particles flowing within an acceptable error margin. This paper describes a GIM model that uses the control signal of the <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>valve</b> to compute the pressure evolution inside the GIM reservoir and, using the pressure estimation, obtains the particles flow considering also the dynamic heat exchange effect between the gas and the structure of the GIM...|$|E
40|$|After {{successful}} demonstration measurements {{with the}} Scintillation Profile Monitor (SPM) at COSY, a dedicated vacuum chamber with two vacuum windows and supporting vacuum ports {{was installed in}} the COSY synchrotron. The chamber is blackened inside to suppress light reflection. Since residual gas pressure is too low to support reliable profile measurements based on beam induced scintillation, a <b>piezo-electric</b> dosing <b>valve</b> was installed allowing fast injections of defined amount of nitrogen. A 32 -channel photomultiplier is used to detect light. Beam profile measurements and first experience are reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a piezoelectric-hydraulic pump with {{innovative}} active valves is presented in this study. The pump structure consists of a piezoelectric stack actuator and two piezoelectric unimorph disc valves acting as inlet and delivery valves. The pump actuation mechanism is composed of a pumping chamber and a diaphragm attached to the piezoelectric stack actuator. Static and dynamic piezoelectric finite element analyses {{have been used to}} maximize the delivered fluid volume per stroke and to predict the dynamic behavior, respectively. A structural optimization technique has been employed to optimize the pumpâ€™s efficiency for specific geometrical dimensions. A transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been utilized to predict flow rates. Dynamic experiments have also been conducted and results are in good agreement with those obtained from simulations. Key Words: piezoelectric-hydraulic pump, diaphragm, piezoelectric stack actuator, <b>piezo-electric</b> unimorph disc <b>valves,</b> finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), design optimizatio...|$|R
40|$|In the {{high-tech}} industry {{the call for}} higher precision and higher accuracy will never vanish. One of the aspects that influences precision and accuracy is transportation. To transport an object contact is needed. Stigmatically thinking, contact means having a mechanical connection between the transporter and the object to transport. However, if mechanical contact with {{the object is to}} be avoided, other means of transportation can be used. By avoiding mechanical contact certain benefits arise. For example contamination or surface damage (due to friction at the contact points) can be reduced by avoiding mechanical contact. The use of a device that can transport objects without contact is the basis for the thesis. The considered device uses an air bearing to carry and to position the object. This device is called the Contactless Wafer Handler (CWH). This contactless wafer handler is connected to an air supply system that generates the forces needed for carrying and actuation. To be able to support the object the air should be spread evenly across the object's surface. Also, the actuation function of the bearing requires the air flow to be controllable. This distribution of air is done by the supply manifold. A part of the CWH that consists of a labyrinth of channels, with inlets at the perimeter of the manifold and multiple outlets {{across the surface of the}} manifold. In this thesis the influence of the geometry of this supply manifold on the performance of the CWH is examined. The term performance is defined as the CWH's ability to accurately position the carried object. This performance is limited by numerous factors, one of which is the dynamics of the air in the manifold. The dynamic behavior is investigated in order to design manifolds that show optimal dynamic properties. The term optimal will be defined in this thesis. In order to obtain the optimal supply manifold the air dynamics are investigated. Using a setup consisting of a pneumatic valve and multiple air pressure sensors, models that can predict air dynamics are verified. Furthermore potentially interesting pseudo manifold geometries are analyzed. The pneumatic valve's actuation principle is <b>piezo-electric</b> and the <b>valve</b> is of the nozzle-flapper type. The pressure sensors measure strain in a membrane that deflects due to a pressure difference. The pneumatic valve and the pressure sensors used are of the same make as the ones used in the CWH. In this thesis it is shown that interesting geometries do exist and that their dynamics can be predicted with modeling. It is found that certain geometries can influence dynamics and that these influenced dynamics can benefit the performance of the CWH. MSDPMEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The Siemens Advanced Quantra Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FTICR) mass {{spectrometer}} was evaluated {{as an alternative}} instrument to large double focusing {{mass spectrometer}}s for gas analysis. High resolution mass spectrometers capable of resolving the common mass isomers of the hydrogen isotopes are used to provide data for accurate loading of reservoirs and to monitor separation of tritium, deuterium, and helium. Conventional double focusing magnetic sector instruments have a resolution that is limited to about 5000. The Siemens FTICR instrument achieves resolution beyond 400, 000 and could possibly resolve the tritium ion from the helium- 3 ion, which differ {{by the weight of}} an electron, 0. 00549 amu. Working with Y- 12 and LANL, SRNL requested Siemens to modify their commercial Quantra system for low mass analysis. To achieve the required performance, Siemens had to increase the available waveform operating frequency from 5 MHz to 40 MHz and completely redesign the control electronics and software. However, they were able to use the previous ion trap, magnet, passive pump, and <b>piezo-electric</b> pulsed inlet <b>valve</b> design. NNSA invested $ 1 M in this project and acquired four systems, two for Y- 12 and one each for SRNL and LANL. Siemens claimed a $ 10 M investment in the Quantra systems. The new Siemens Advanced Quantra demonstrated phenomenal resolution in the low mass range. Resolution greater than 400, 000 was achieved for mass 2. The new spectrometer had a useful working mass range to 500 Daltons. However, experiments found that a continuous single scan from low mass to high was not possible. Two useful working ranges were established covering masses 1 to 6 and masses 12 to 500 for our studies. A compromise performance condition enabled masses 1 to 45 to be surveyed. The instrument was found to have a dynamic range of about three orders of magnitude and quantitative analysis is expected to be limited to around 5 percent without using complex fitting algorithms. Analysis of low concentration ions, at the ppm level, required a separate analysis using ion ejection techniques. Chemical ionization due to the formation of the MH{sup +} ion or MD{sup +} increased the complexity of the spectra compared to magnetic sector mass spectra and formation of the protonated or deuterated complex was a dynamic function of the trap ion concentration. This made quantitative measurement more of a challenge. However, the resolution of the instrument was far superior to any other mass spectrometry technique that has been applied to the analysis of the hydrogen isotopes. The piezo-electric picoliter injection device offers a new way of submitting small quantities of atmospheric pressure sample gas for analysis. The new software had many improvements over the previous version but significant flaws in the beta codes remain that make the prototype units less than ideal. The instrument is a promising new technology that experience will likely improve. Unfortunately, Siemens has concluded that the technology will not be a commercial success and has decided to stop producing this product...|$|R
