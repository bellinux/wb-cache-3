5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} the normal state for all adult residents of the colony. Most men first married in their mid-twenties and women around age 20. Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and economic <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within {{six months to a}} year. Most adults who reached marriageable age lived into their sixties, so effectively two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.|$|E

The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993. Notwithstanding the overall reduction in military spending, Cheney directed {{the development of a}} Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post-Cold War era.|$|E
5|$|When Il trittico premiered at New York's Metropolitan Opera in December 1918, Gianni Schicchi {{became an}} {{immediate}} hit, {{whereas the other}} two operas were received with less enthusiasm. This pattern was broadly repeated at the Rome and London premieres and led to commercial <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> abandon the less successful elements. Although on artistic grounds Puccini opposed performing the three operas except as the original triptych, by 1920 he had given his reluctant consent to separate performances. Gianni Schicchi has subsequently become the most-performed part of Il trittico and has been widely recorded.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Peer {{pressure}} {{is regarded as}} an important determinant of substance use, sexual behavior and juvenile delinquency. However, few peer pressure scales are validated, especially in French or German. Little {{is known about the}} factor structure of such scales or the kind of scale needed: some scales takes into account both peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do and peer <b>pressure</b> not <b>to</b> do, while others consider only peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do. The aim {{of the present study was}} to adapt French and German versions of the Peer Pressure Inventory, which is one of the most widely used scales in this field. We considered its factor structure and concurrent validity. METHODS: Five thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven young Swiss men filled in a questionnaire on peer pressure, substance use, and other variables (conformity, involvement) in a cohort study. RESULTS: We identified a four-factor structure, with the three factors of the initial Peer Pressure Inventory (involvement, conformity, misconduct) and adding a new one (relationship with girls). A non-valued scale (from no peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do only) showed stronger psychometric qualities than a valued scale (from peer <b>pressure</b> not <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do). Concurrent validity was also good. Each behavior or attitude was significantly associated with peer pressure. CONCLUSION: Peer <b>pressure</b> seems <b>to</b> be a multidimensional concept. In this study, peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do showed the strongest influence on participants. Indeed, peer <b>pressure</b> not <b>to</b> do did not add anything useful. Only peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do affected young Swiss men's behaviors and attitudes and was reliable...|$|R
5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} {{years of the}} war, many Abenakis had tired of the {{conflict}} despite French <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> continue raids against New England targets. The peace of Utrecht, however, had ignored Indian interests, and some Abenaki expressed willingness to negotiate a peace with the New Englanders. Governor Dudley organized a major peace conference at Portsmouth, New Hampshire (of which he was also governor). In negotiations there and at Casco Bay, the Abenakis objected to British assertions that the French had ceded to Britain the territory of eastern Maine and New Brunswick, but they agreed to a confirmation of boundaries at the Kennebec River {{and the establishment of}} government-run trading posts in their territory. The Treaty of Portsmouth was ratified on July 13, 1713 by eight representatives of some of the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy; however, it included language asserting British sovereignty over their territory. Over the next year, other Abenaki tribal leaders also signed the treaty, but no Mi'kmaq ever signed it or any other treaty until 1726.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Fefa was {{forecast}} {{to intensify}} slightly after reaching hurricane status to reach peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). However, it quickly intensified after a large, ragged eye developed early on August 1. On August 2, the eye organized further, and Fefa strengthened {{to attain a}} peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h) while located about 940miles (1,510km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Based on higher Dvorak numbers, the hurricane could have peaked with winds stronger than 120mph (195km/h). Fefa encountered cooler waters shortly after peaking in intensity, and subsequently began to weaken. The hurricane gradually weakened as it turned more to the west, a change in motion due to building high <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> its north, and on August 3 the winds of Fefa dropped to 85mph (135km/h) due to cooler water and dry air.|$|E

5|$|The Broadcasting Act 1990 led to {{the brief}} decline of UK pirate radio by {{encouraging}} diversity in radio and opening up the development of commercial radio. Many pirate radio stations such as the London-based dance music station Kiss FM applied for licenses to the new Radio Authority and went legitimate. However, the number of unlicensed broadcasts has since increased, partly because many non-licensed broadcasters believed that the 1990 Act had actually undermined community-based stations and small scale radio entrepreneurs. Of the pirate radio stations that gained a license in the 1990s, such as Kiss FM, FTP in Bristol, WNK Radio in Haringey and KFM Radio in Stockport, only a few, such as Sunrise Radio in London, remained {{in the hands of}} the original owners.

5|$|With a {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} to its north, the depression tracked westward. Favorable conditions persisted {{for several days}} prior {{to the arrival of}} the depression, and as such the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Anita. The storm tracked slowly over warm water temperatures, and throughout its duration it was embedded within warm, moist tropical air; Anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on August 30; this is the latest date for the first hurricane since 1967. Initially it threatened to strike Texas, though building high <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> the north of the hurricane turned Anita to the west-southwest. The hurricane developed a well-defined eye, and Hurricane Anita began to rapidly intensify late on September 1 after attaining major hurricane status. During a two-day period up to its peak intensity, Anita deepened at a rate of 2 mbar per hour, and on September 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) while located just offshore northeastern Mexico, making Anita a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} {{system on the}} tail end of a stationary cold front organized into a subtropical depression on August 8 near the South Carolina coast, and drifted southward. Convection became more organized, and the storm was classified Tropical Depression Three on August 10 over the Bahamas. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status on August 11, based on reports from Hurricane Hunters. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs in its path. A trough of {{low pressure}} near Bermuda initially inhibited strengthening. However, after high <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane on August 22. Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance of an eye feature on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast into the cold waters of the north Atlantic Ocean, and on August 23 it became extratropical about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating on August 28 over Spain.|$|E

5|$|In late September, a {{large area}} of {{disturbed}} weather associated with two tropical waves formed {{just east of the}} Lesser Antilles. The disturbance drifted very slowly west-northwestward, inhibited by strong wind shear that eventually caused the westernmost wave to dissipate. Albeit weak, an elongated remnant trough, or area of low pressure, persisted for several days, stalling over the extreme eastern Caribbean Sea as a nearby upper-level cyclonic vortex retrograded to its north. By October5, the trough had drifted northward into a more favorable atmospheric environment over the Virgin Islands, which allowed the lowest <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> extend to the surface. The low became well defined, interacting with the adjacent upper vortex to produce a wide convective banda concentrated region in which strong showers and thunderstorms can formover the northeastern Caribbean. Over the next day, the system continued to acquire a prominent subtropical structure: it developed a markedly larger wind radius than typically seen in pure tropical cyclones. Satellite observations also revealed that although the lower wind circulation was distinct, it had become intertwined with the cyclonic vortex aloft to its southwest, confirming the hybrid nature of the system. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a subtropical depression at 06:00UTC on October6, when it was 265mi (425km) north-northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
