The album received favourable reviews from most music critics; Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue's [...] "finest work since 1997's underrated Impossible Princess" [...] and Tim Sendra from Allmusic commended Minogue's choice of collaborators and producers, commenting that the album is the [...] "work of someone who knows exactly what her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection". Aphrodite debuted at number-one in the United Kingdom, exactly twenty two years after her first number one hit in the United Kingdom. The album's lead single, [...] "All the Lovers," [...] was a success and became her thirty-third top ten single in the United Kingdom, though subsequent singles from the album, [...] "Get Outta My Way", [...] "Better than Today", and [...] "Put Your Hands Up", failed {{to reach the top}} ten of the UK Singles Chart.

Aphrodite marked the first time Minogue enlisted an executive producer; discussing the process, she said [...] "It was just the best experience, and funnily enough I think it's the most cohesive album I've had since the beginning of my career, back in the PWL days, where by its very nature made it cohesive. There's a lot to be said for working with different producers and trying different stuff which has worked really well for me in the past but I definitely wanted someone to tie this together as Stuart has done so beautifully [...] so that it existed as a real body of work". Minogue and Price subjected songs on Aphrodite to a [...] "Parton Test", as they [...] "knew a song would work if it made sense when sung in the style of Dolly Parton". Shears also contributed to the album, while two of Pallot's collaborations with Minogue were kept.

40|$|During {{the past}} ten years, the {{government}} of Côte d’Ivoire has pursued various reforms to cut its role in domestic and export marketing of cocoa, to create a competitive environment for the private sector, and to raise <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> Despite some success, those reforms did not contributed much in raising <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> The maintenance of fixed <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> and marketing costs and margins encouraged rent-seeking activities and led to efficiency losses. In August 1999 the government liberalized the export marketing system by eliminating public management. The reform package included: the end to mandatory export authorization, the abolition of public forward sales, {{and the elimination of}} fixed minimum <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> and marketing margins. The paper finds that the benefits from liberalizing the export marketing system, in terms of lower marketing costs/margins and higher <b>producer</b> <b>prices,</b> outweigh costs from eliminating the public forward sales program and fixed <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> Additional results from a general equilibrium model indicate that reducing marketing costs would have had a small negative effect on aggregate welfare, but would have improved income distribution toward poorer rural areas. While Côte d’Ivoire has market power in the world cocoa market justifying a higher optimal export tax than the current one, raising export taxes may eventually reduce its market share and worsen income distribution particularly {{at the expense of the}} rural poor.

Large firms change prices {{two to three times}} more frequently than do small firms, and by smaller amounts, particularly for price decreases. Longer price durations are associated with larger price changes, though there is considerable heterogeneity in this relationship. Long-term contracts are associated with somewhat greater price rigidity for goods and services, though the differences are not dramatic.

Market reforms {{over the past}} 10 years have somewhat succeeded in making domestic and foreign marketing more transparent and competitive. But they have not done much to raise <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> in real terms or {{as a share of}} the FOB (free on board) <b>price.</b> Maintaining fixed <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> and marketing costs and margins has encouraged rent-seeking and led to efficiency losses.

The new reform is expected to improve producers'incomes.
