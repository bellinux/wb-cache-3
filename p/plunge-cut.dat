40|$|This is {{a report}} on {{grinding}} action of high speed steels in constant feeding load, that is, free infeed <b>plunge-cut</b> grinding. A grinding wheel is WA 46 G 6 V and the used high speed steels are SKH 4 (18 - 4 - 1 - 10) and HV 5. The latter {{is said to be}} improved in the resistance of tool wear behaviour by adding high vanadium and high carbon. The relations between grinding ratio, grinding force and grinding time are obtained. The wheel wear in grinding is observed by a micro-scope also. The conclusions are as follows. 1. Though a small difference in grinding force between SKH 4 and HV 5 is observed, SKH 4 differs remarkably from HV 5 in grinding ratio. The grinding ratio of SKH 4 is far better than HV 5 in both this value and in a tendency of G-t curves. 2. The poor grinding raio of HV 5 will make it difficult to apply it to multiple teeth cutter in the grinding accuracy. SKH 4 is more preferable than HV 5. 3. The wear, fracture and breakdown of a grinding wheel grains progress rapidly in case of high load. 4. The free infeed <b>plunge-cut</b> grinding process is seemed to be severer in view of the poor grinding ratio than the conventional grinding method of high speed steels...|$|E
40|$|The {{machining}} of cemented carbides after sintering is done {{mainly by}} grinding operation. They are {{very hard and}} brittle in comparison with high speed steels. Therefore grinding cracks occur easiliy in grinding operation of sintered carbides. Grindability of sintered carbides (JIS. P 10,P 30,K 10,K 30) is examined in free infeed <b>plunge-cut</b> grinding with silicon carbide grinding wheel. The results obtained are as follows. 1. Metal removed is more affected by grinding cracks and pitts than hardness of sintered carbides. This {{is different from the}} grinding of high speed steels in preoious reports. 2. More wheel wear appears in the grinding of hard sintered carbides. 3. Grinding ratio of P grades is larger than K grades...|$|E
50|$|Because the {{material}} to be cut is non-fibrous, there is much less chance of kickback. Therefore, the most-used method of cutting is <b>plunge-cutting,</b> by pushing {{the tip of the}} blade into {{the material}}. With this method square cuts as small as the blade width can be achieved. Pushback can occur if a block shifts when nearly cut through and pinches the blade, but overall the machine is less dangerous than a wood-cutting chainsaw.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} novel method for {{fabricating}} {{carbon fiber composite}} sandwich panels with lattice core construction by means of electrical discharge machining (EDM). First, flat-top corrugated carbon fiber composite cores were fabricated by a hot press molding method. Then, two composite face sheets were bonded to each corrugated core to create precursor sandwich panels. These panels were transformed into sand-wich panels with near-pyramidal truss cores by EDM <b>plunge-cutting</b> the corrugated core between the face sheets with a shaped cuprite electrode. The flat top corrugation permits adhesive to be applied consistently, and the selected dimen-sions leave a substantial bond area after cutting, resulting in a strong core-to-sheet bond. The crushing behavior of this novel construction was investigated in flatwise compression, {{and the results were}} compared to analytical expressions for strength and stiffness...|$|R
40|$|Ductile cutting {{are most}} widely used in {{fabricating}} high-quality optical glass components to achieve crack-free surfaces. For ultra-precision machining of brittle glass materials, critical undeformed chip thickness (CUCT) commonly plays {{a pivotal role in}} determining the transition point from ductile cutting to brittle cutting. In this research, cutting characteristics in nanometric cutting of BK 7 and fused silica glasses, including machined surface morphology, surface roughness, cutting force and specific cutting energy, were investigated with nanometric <b>plunge-cutting</b> experiments. The same cutting speed of 300 mm/min was used in the experiments with single-crystal diamond tool. CUCT was determined according to the mentioned cutting characteristics. The results revealed that 320 nm was found as the CUCT in BK 7 cutting and 50 nm was determined as the size effect of undeformed chip thickness. A high-quality machined surface could be obtained with the undeformed chip thickness between 50 and 320 nm at ductile cutting stage. Moreover, no CUCT was identified in fused silica cutting with the current cutting conditions, and brittle-fracture mechanism was confirmed as the predominant chip-separation mode throughout the nanometric cutting operation...|$|R
