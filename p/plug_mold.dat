40|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>molds</b> {{used for}} PFGE can be {{expensive}} to purchase and often physically and experimentally inflexible. The use of plastic primer container covers as <b>plug</b> <b>molds</b> for Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) is reported in this study. These plastic covers are cheap, effective and easy-to-use for processing samples for electrophoresis. Besides, the broad surface and flat area in the mold promotes faster cooling and the agar sets quickly at room temperature. Plugs are also easily removed with a spatula. These containers can be easily cleaned for re-use or disposed of as waste. Twenty samples can be prepared in one container. The PFGE results obtained by using these plastic primer-container covers as <b>plug</b> <b>molds</b> {{are similar to the}} PFGE results obtained by using commercial <b>plug</b> <b>molds...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Federal Circuit {{described}} <b>plug</b> <b>molding</b> {{technology in}} these terms, in its {{decision in the}} Interpart case, discussed below:The California <b>plug</b> <b>molding</b> statute...proscribes use of the product itself for a pattern or [...] "plug" [...] in a direct molding process. In that process, the product is entirely coated with a mold-forming substance that sets and which is then removed from the product and used as the mold for making numerous replicas of the product. This process is substantially less expensive than developing a mold from scratch, something the original product manufacturer has to do.|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} in 1976, a new <b>plug</b> and <b>mold</b> was built, {{and the first}} boat went into the water on January 15, 1977. Production {{gradually}} increased to seven CSY-44's per month by May, 1977.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>molding</b> {{statutes}} {{have been}} challenged as {{interfering with the}} federal patent system and therefore preempted by federal law. In 1985 in Interpart Corp. v. Italia, the Federal Circuit upheld the California anti-plug molding law against a preemption challenge, when it was invoked to stop copying of an automobile rear view mirror. The court said that the law [...] "prevents unscrupulous competitors from obtaining a product and using it as the 'plug' for making a mold." [...] The Federal Circuit insisted {{that there is no}} [...] "right to copy." [...] It therefore concluded:The California law does not [...] "clash" [...] with the federal patent law; the two laws have different objectives. ...We see nothing in the federal patent statutes that conflicts with California's desire to prevent a particular type of competition which it considers unfair.|$|R

50|$|Special modular plugs {{have been}} {{manufactured}} (for example, the Siemon UP-2468) which have extra slots beyond their standard contacts, {{to accommodate the}} wider jack's outermost contacts without damage. These special plug connectors can be visually identified by carefully looking for the extra slots <b>molded</b> into the <b>plug.</b> The <b>molded</b> plastic bodies of the special plugs may also be colored with a light blueish tinge, to aid in quick recognition.|$|R

50|$|The starter bar, {{also called}} a dummy bar, has a free end portion which is {{flexible}} for storage and a substantially rigid portion {{at the end}} which <b>plugs</b> the <b>mold.</b> The starter bar is constructed in discrete blocks secured {{to one side of}} a planar spine provided in segments and arranged end to end. Adjustable spacers in the form of tapered blocks are disposed between the blocks of the bar to allow the starter bar to be self-supporting in a curved configuration corresponding to the casting path. A more flexible spine in the end portion of the starter bar allows the starter bar to be curved to a tighter radius than that of the casting path while the blocks fan out in an unsupported configuration. A storage ramp is provided to support the flexible end in the stored position. Before a cast is started, the starter bars are fed through the caster (in reverse direction of casting) using hydraulic actuators. Once fed {{all the way to the}} bottom of the mold, the process of packing the mold can continue to ensure a smooth start up.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{screening}} method for molds producing the intracellular mycotoxins brevianamide A, citreoviridin, cyclopiazonic acid, luteoskyrin, penitrem A, roquefortine C, sterigmatocystin, verruculogen, viomellein, and xanthomegnin was developed. After removing an agar <b>plug</b> from the <b>mold</b> culture, the mycelium on the plug is wetted with {{a drop of}} methanol-chloroform (1 : 2). By this treatment the intracellular mycotoxins are extracted within seconds and transferred directly to a thin-layer chromatography plate by immediately placing {{the plug on the}} plate while the mycelium is still wet. After removal of the plug, known thin-layer chromatographic procedures are carried out. The substrate (Czapek yeast autolysate agar) and growth conditions (25 degrees C for 7 days) used by Penicillium taxonomists proved suitable for the production of the mycotoxins investigated when 60 known toxigenic isolates and 865 cultures isolated from foods and feedstuffs were tested with this {{screening method}}...|$|R
50|$|An {{integral}} part of the thermoforming process is the tooling which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge thermoforming as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires <b>molds,</b> <b>plug</b> assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge thermoforming also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated thermoforming machine is limited {{to the quality of the}} tooling. Some large thermoforming manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.|$|R
50|$|With both methods, {{the sand}} mixture is packed around a pattern, forming a mold cavity. If necessary, a {{temporary}} plug {{is placed in}} the sand and touching the pattern in order to later form a channel into which the casting fluid can be poured. Air-set molds are often formed {{with the help of a}} casting flask having a top and bottom part, termed the cope and drag. The sand mixture is tamped down as it is added around the pattern, and the final mold assembly is sometimes vibrated to compact the sand and fill any unwanted voids in the mold. Then the pattern is removed along with the channel <b>plug,</b> leaving the <b>mold</b> cavity. The casting liquid (typically molten metal) is then poured into the mold cavity. After the metal has solidified and cooled, the casting is separated from the sand mold. There is typically no mold release agent, and the mold is generally destroyed in the removal process.|$|R
40|$|This report {{details the}} work {{completed}} under the TX- 100 blade manufacturing {{portion of the}} Carbon-Hybrid Blade Developments: Standard and Twist-Coupled Prototype project. The TX- 100 blade is a 9 meter prototype blade designed with bend-twist coupling to augment the mitigation of peak loads during normal turbine operation. This structural coupling was achieved by locating off axis carbon fiber in the outboard portion of the blade skins. The report will present the tooling selection, blade production, blade instrumentation, blade shipping and adapter plate design and fabrication. The baseline blade used for this project was the ERS- 100 (Revision D) wind turbine blade. The molds used {{for the production of}} the TX- 100 were originally built for the production of the CX- 100 blade. The same high pressure and low pressure skin molds were used to manufacture the TX- 100 skins. In order to compensate for the difference in skin thickness between the CX- 100 and the TX- 100, however, a new TX- 100 shear web <b>plug</b> and <b>mold</b> were required. Both the blade assembly fixture and the root stud insertion fixture used for the CX- 100 blades could be utilized for the TX- 100 blades. A production run of seven TX- 100 prototype blades was undertaken at TPI Composites during the month of October, 2004. Of those seven blades, four were instrumented with strain gauges before final assembly. After production at the TPI Composites facility in Rhode Island, the blades were shipped to various test sites: two blades to the National Wind Technology Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, two blades to Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico and three blades to the United States Department of Agriculture turbine field test facility in Bushland, Texas. An adapter plate was designed to allow the TX- 100 blades to be installed on existing Micon 65 / 13 M turbines at the USDA site. The conclusion of this program is the kick-off of the TX- 100 blade testing at the three testing facilities...|$|R
