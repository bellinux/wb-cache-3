It was pulled down on 17 June 1925, when electric lighting was introduced. During the 1970s, the junction was redeveloped to accommodate the new Crompton Way bypass. A large roundabout was built, and a scaled-down replica of the original Big Lamp was erected in its centre. The new Big Lamp is electrically powered and stands about [...] high.|$|E

With the inevitable fire risk of naked flame, the Great Bolton Trustees {{and a number of}} mill owners bought horse-drawn fire engines; Hick became a Trustee of Great Bolton during the early 1820s, he was an Anglican and prominent member of Bolton's Pitt Club, formed 1809 as a [...] "political organisation composed of the admirers of William Pitt", that helped Hick move amongst the middle class social elite of the time.|$|R

50|$|According to Bartlett, {{a portion}} of the economy of the Bartlett <b>Street</b> <b>Lamps</b> was derived from the iron frames used in their construction. Other {{efficient}} qualities included a greater thickness of glass and less need for repair. Unless an object collided with a Bartlett <b>Street</b> <b>Lamp</b> with sufficient force, it would likely glance off of it. Likewise, drops of rain did not affect them after they were lighted. The Times disputed those contentions, saying the lamps were frequently cracked or broken. Lamplighters preferred them because they were easy to light and clean. Bartlett <b>Street</b> <b>Lamps</b> diffused light nicely, according to an advertisement.|$|R

The research improved the grid power factor, reduced the network pressure drop and reduces the energy consumption of <b>street</b> <b>lamp.</b> It upload the master station through GPRS network real-timely, And accept command such as mode conversion, parameter setting, time checking and capacitor switching. It implements the voltage optimization function, remote monitoring and control functions {{on the basis of}} ensuring road illumination and uniformity, Which realized street light energy-saving and reduced the loss of lines and transformers at the same time. And it protect lighting lamps effectively. Examples show that the study further improved the management level of Jinan <b>street</b> <b>lamp,</b> it realized the double harvest of electricity environment optimization and electrical energy saving, Which made a great contribution to energy-saving society construction...|$|R

The village flourished after the fire, eventually reaching a population peak of around 600 following World War II. On September 7, 1903 the first phone service reached Ransom, and AT&T opened a telegraph office in 1905. Between 1905-1910 the village constructed a sidewalk system.
