As Roy enters the mothership, one of the aliens <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments with the humans. Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that {{correspond}} to the five-note alien tonal phrase. The alien replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which ascends into space, as Barry bids Roy goodbye.|$|E

An organism trained on this schedule typically <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while after a reinforcement and then responds at a high rate. If the response requirement is low {{there may be no}} pause; if the response requirement is high the organism may quit responding altogether.|$|E

In The Cafe Concert, shown at right, a sophisticated gentleman sits at a bar while a waitress stands resolutely in the background, sipping her drink. In The Waitress, a serving woman <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment behind a seated customer smoking a pipe, while a ballet dancer, with arms extended as she is about to turn, is on stage in the background.|$|E

25|$|As the {{questioning}} continues, Ingrid admits to Emma {{that she wants}} her {{to be part of}} her family, but then uses mind tactics on Emma to convince her that her family do not love her, they fear her. Emma denies this, but as she <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second, Ingrid casts a spell on a glass of water, and when she returns Ingrid increases the pressure on Emma, resulting in the glass of water to boil as Emma's powers are unleashed due to her fear, causing the wall in the station to blast open and Ingrid to escape. Emma then walks out and as David, Mary Margaret, Hook, Elsa, Gold, and Belle show up to stop her, Emma wants everyone to stay away but when Hook touches her, Emma causes the streetlight to fall on David. Emma runs away after a horrified Mary Margret looks at her with disgust and gets into her car driving away even as Mary Margret calls after her that it's okay. Everyone present suspects that The Snow Queen/Ingrid has succeeded in turning Emma against them. After Elsa and Hook are unable to find Emma, Mary Margret blames herself, stating that no one wants their family to see them as a monster. Elsa reassures a fearful Hook that Emma will be fine, but that she needs time alone {{to come to terms with}} her powers, the way she did. Meanwhile, a terrified Emma sits in her parked bug in the woods overlooking the town.|$|E
500|$|When the {{helicopter}} arrives, {{it contains a}} wounded soldier, which occupies Hawkeye and Trapper; they say their short goodbyes before going {{to care for the}} soldier. Beginning to board {{the helicopter}}, Henry spots an emotional Radar saluting him and <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. He runs back to him to return the salute, hug him, and leave him with the words: [...] "You behave yourself, or I'm gonna come back and kick your butt." [...] Blake then boards the helicopter and leaves the 4077th.|$|E
500|$|Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) kicks Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) off the Party Planning Committee. In response, Pam {{reaches out}} to Karen, and the two plan a rival party. The rival Christmas parties begin, and the office staff members are forced to choose sides. Pam and Karen's party is a hit, while Angela's is a dreary affair. Michael and Andy each return with a {{waitress}} as their [...] "new girlfriend" [...] (though neither {{is the one who}} waited on them at the restaurant). Angela accepts Pam's offer to merge the parties. Oscar enters the office with his partner Gil just as Angela is singing The Little Drummer Boy, <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, says, [...] "Too soon" [...] and leaves.|$|E

500|$|Upon encountering a Chi site, the {{activity}} of the RecBCD enzyme changes drastically. DNA unwinding <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seconds and then resumes at roughly half the initial speed. [...] This is likely because the slower RecB helicase unwinds the DNA after Chi, rather than the faster RecD helicase, which unwinds the DNA before Chi. [...] Recognition of the Chi site also changes the RecBCD enzyme so that it cuts the DNA strand with Chi and begins loading multiple RecA proteins onto the single-stranded DNA with the newly generated 3' end. [...] The resulting RecA-coated nucleoprotein filament then searches out similar sequences of DNA on a homologous chromosome. The search process induces stretching of the DNA duplex, which enhances homology recognition (a mechanism termed conformational proofreading [...] ). [...] Upon finding such a sequence, the single-stranded nucleoprotein filament moves into the homologous recipient DNA duplex in a process called strand invasion. [...] The invading 3' overhang causes one of the strands of the recipient DNA duplex to be displaced, to form a D-loop. [...] If the D-loop is cut, another swapping of strands forms a cross-shaped structure called a Holliday junction. [...] Resolution of the Holliday junction by some combination of RuvABC or RecG can produce two recombinant DNA molecules with reciprocal genetic types, if the two interacting DNA molecules differ genetically. [...] Alternatively, the invading 3’ end near Chi can prime DNA synthesis and form a replication fork. [...] This type of resolution produces only one type of recombinant (non-reciprocal).|$|E

2500|$|A more mixed review from Karina Longworth of The Village Voice said: [...] "We get {{a fairly}} typical Hollywood {{flattening}} of history, with powerful villains and disenfranchised heroes." [...] Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail, giving the film {{two out of}} four stars, said: [...] "Typically, this sort of film is an earnest tear-jerker with moments of levity. Instead, {{what we have here}} is a raucous rib-tickler with occasional <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little dramatic relief." [...] Referring to the film as a [...] "big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum", The New York Times noted that [...] "save for Ms. Davis's, however, the performances are almost all overly broad, sometimes excruciatingly so, characterized by loud laughs, bugging eyes and pumping limbs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lutherans {{differ from}} other Protestants as they {{practice}} [...] "confession and absolution" [...] (in two forms). They, like Roman Catholics and many Anglicans, see [...] and [...] as biblical evidence for confession. The first form of confession and absolution is {{done at the}} Divine Service with the assembled congregation (similar to the Anglican tradition). Here, the entire congregation <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment of silent confession, recites the confiteor, and receives God's forgiveness through the pastor as he says the following (or similar): [...] "Upon this your confession and in the stead and by the command of my Lord Jesus Christ, I forgive you all your sins {{in the name of}} the Father and of [...] the Son and of the Holy Spirit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} Billy Preston's song, [...] "That's the Way God Planned It", Preston gets up {{from his}} stool and dances across the stage and back again – much to Harrison's delight. (Like most of the concert visuals and audio, this footage is taken from the evening {{performance}} on 1 August.) Starr sings his hit song [...] "It Don't Come Easy" [...] and appears flustered as he forgets some of the words. Harrison then returns to the spotlight for two of his own numbers, the second being [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", {{at the end of}} which Clapton clearly struggles on lead guitar next to Harrison's more measured soloing. Before this, Harrison <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes to introduce the many musicians around him, and to his own amazement misses out one of the key performers so far – [...] "We've forgotten Billy Preston!" [...] he declares eventually.|$|E

Then you get so worn out and exhausted, that you can scarce move an oar through the water, until you are wakened up by a smart as if a red hot iron had been laid across your shoulders. It is terrible work then. The whip cracks every minute across some one's back; you are blinded by exhaustion and rage, and you feel that you would give the world if you could but burst your chain, rush on your taskmasters, and strike, if only one blow, before you are killed." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{a wealthy}} nation like the English discovers the {{perfectly}} patent {{fact that it}} is making a ludicrous mess of the government of a poorer nation like the Irish, it <b>pauses</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment in consternation, and then begins to talk about Celts and Teutons. As far as I can understand the theory, the Irish are Celts and the English are Teutons. Of course, the Irish are not Celts any more than the English are Teutons. I have not followed the ethnological discussion with much energy, but the last scientific conclusion which I read inclined on the whole to the summary that the English were mainly Celtic and the Irish mainly Teutonic. But no man alive, with even the glimmering of a real scientific sense, would ever dream of applying the terms [...] "Celtic" [...] or [...] "Teutonic" [...] to either of them in any positive or useful sense.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} (towards eight, if I might guess) Day {{has got the}} upper hand; the Daun Austrians stand visible on their Ring of Heights all round, behind Hochkirch and our late Battery, on to westward and northward, as far as Steindorfel and Waditz;--extremely busy rearranging {{themselves}} into something of line; there being much confusion, much simmering about in clumps and gaps, after such a tussle. In front of us, to eastward, the appointed Austrian parties are proceeding to attack: but in daylight, and with our eyes open, it {{is a thing of}} difficulty, and does not prosper as Hochkirch did. Duke D'Ahremberg, on their extreme right, had in charge to burst in upon our left, so soon as he saw Hochkirch done: D'Ahremberg does try; as do others in their places, near Daun; but with comparatively little success. D'Ahremberg, meeting something of check or hindrance where he tried, <b>pauses,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good while, till he see how others prosper. Their grand chance is their superiority of number; and the fact that Friedrich can try nothing upon THEM, but must stand painfully on the defensive till Retzow come. To Friedrich, Retzow seems hugely slow about it. But the truth is, Baden-Durlach, with his 20,000 of Reserve, has, as per order, made attack on Retzow, 20,000 against 12: one of the feeblest attacks conceivable; but sufficient to detain Retzow till he get it repulsed. Retzow is diligent as Time, and will be here.|$|E
