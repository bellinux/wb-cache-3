2500|$|The SD50F was a Canadian cowl unit version {{equipped}} with a [...] "Draper taper" [...] (inset section aft of cab for limited rear visibility). 60 were built for the Canadian National Railway as road numbers 5400-5459.

2500|$|The {{engine is}} a uniflow design with four poppet-type exhaust valves in the {{cylinder}} head. For maintenance, a <b>power</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{consisting of a}} cylinder head, cylinder liner, piston, piston carrier, and piston rod, can be individually and relatively easily and quickly replaced. The block is made from flat, formed and rolled structural steel members and steel forgings welded into a single structure (a [...] "weldment"). Blocks may, therefore, be easily repaired, if required, using conventional shop tools. Each bank of cylinders has an overhead camshaft which operates the exhaust valves and the unit injectors.|$|E
2500|$|As 645 <b>power</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{are more}} readily {{available}} than 567 <b>power</b> <b>assemblies,</b> this upgrade may also be employed in so-called [...] "life extension" [...] programs, {{in which case the}} <b>power</b> <b>assemblies</b> would be upgraded, and the engine may be de-turbo-ed, without corresponding changes to the engine's Woodward governor, hence without a corresponding power increase.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{situations}} {{can require}} <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> replacement. Most {{are due to}} failure within the <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> itself such as a dropped valve, broken piston or internal coolant leak. Less common are replacements to repair catastrophic failures such as broken connecting rods or a [...] "hydro-locked" [...] <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> that has been broken or knocked out of the cylinder block when the cylinder filled with coolant during engine operation and {{the inability of the}} piston to compress the liquid caused catastrophic failure. Complete <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> replacements, where all of the assemblies in an engine are replaced, are least common and are normally done as part of a comprehensive engine overhaul.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{components}} {{are large and}} heavy and specialized tools are required, the replacement process is straightforward and simple. The engine coolant is drained, the rocker arm assembly and fuel system components are removed, the connecting rod is disconnected from the crankshaft, the <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> hold-downs (commonly called [...] "crabs") are removed, the cooling system plumbing is disconnected, the lifting fixture is installed and the <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> is lifted out of the cylinder block. The process is reversed to install the replacement <b>power</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As far as {{repair time}} goes, <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> {{replacement}} is typically performed {{by at least}} two mechanics so the labor involved is at least twice the repair time required. If the engine comes in for inspection or repair [...] "hot", the unit may need to cool for several hours before repairs can begin. If parts are not readily available, the delays will increase. Typically, for a <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> replacement in an engine cool enough to work on and with the proper tools and necessary parts readily at hand, two mechanics can replace a <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> properly and safely in a 4-hour period. Rarely are major repairs involving expensive engines and components and significant safety hazards rushed to create [...] "efficiency" [...] {{at the expense of}} safety and reliability.|$|E

5000|$|In an EMD diesel engine, since two <b>power</b> <b>assemblies</b> share {{a common}} {{connecting-rod}} journal, and since the <b>power</b> <b>assemblies</b> are directly opposite each other rather than staggered as in a typical V-type engine, two different <b>power</b> <b>assemblies</b> are required in a single engine. The {{difference between the two}} assemblies is in the connecting rods. One connecting rod [...] "big end" [...] has to fit inside that of its companion rod and the two types are referred to as [...] "blade rods" [...] and [...] "fork rods". The [...] "fork rod" [...] is logically the [...] "master" [...] as only it has a [...] "rod cap", in this specific case referred to as a [...] "basket", whereas the [...] "blade rod" [...] is logically the [...] "slave" [...] as its [...] "big toe" [...] is designed to fit completely within, and is guided by, and is retained by the [...] "fork", and both are retained by the single [...] "basket".|$|R
5000|$|The engine airbox covers (the upper covers {{observed}} {{on the side}} of an EMD engine - they cover the [...] "airbox" [...] that allows air to flow through the cylinder block to the <b>power</b> <b>assemblies)</b> are removed to allow visual inspection of the inside of the cylinder liners and the piston crowns, skirts and rings. The crankcase access covers (the lower covers {{observed on}} the side of an EMD engine) are also removed to inspect for coolant leakage, damaged components and excessive wear. A proper inspection requires filling and pressurizing the cooling system to check for leakage from the <b>power</b> <b>assemblies.</b>|$|R

50|$|The block {{designation}} {{was changed}} to J to reflect the changes to the new engine, which included <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> and block redesigns, {{as well as the}} addition of a two-stage turbocharging system consisting of three turbochargers. Other new features are an EGR system to reduce exhaust emissions and double-walled fuel injection to increase safety.|$|E
50|$|The 645 series engines entered {{production}} in 1965. As the 567 series had reached its limits in horsepower increases, a larger displacement was needed; this {{was accomplished by}} increasing the bore from 8+1/2 in on the 567 series to 9+1/16 in on the 645 series, while maintaining the same stroke and deck height. While the crankcase was modified from the 567 series, 567C and later engines (or 567 engines which have been modified to 567C specifications, {{sometimes referred to as}} 567AC or 567BC engines) can accept 645 series service parts, such as <b>power</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Conversely, the 567E engine employs a 645E series block with 567 series <b>power</b> <b>assemblies.</b>|$|R
25|$|Because {{of their}} age, 567 engines are {{generally}} exempt from emissions rules. EMD manufactures a special series of 645 <b>power</b> <b>assemblies</b> which are particularly useful in updating these exempt 567 engines and also certain exempt 645 engines.|$|R
50|$|De-turbo-ed GP20s, which employ 645 <b>power</b> <b>assemblies,</b> with Roots blowers {{replacing}} the EMD turbocharger without de-rating the horsepower of the locomotive, are somewhat common. As {{the reliability of}} the EMD turbocharger significantly improved over time, these de-turbo-ed examples became less common.|$|R
5000|$|For maintenance, a <b>power</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{consisting}} of a cylinder head, cylinder liner, piston, piston carrier and piston rod can be individually replaced relatively easily and quickly. The engine block is made from flat, formed and rolled structural steel members and steel forgings welded into a single structure (a [...] "weldment"), so it can easily be repaired using conventional shop tools.|$|E

50|$|In {{a normal}} {{in-service}} <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> replacement situation, the replacement will follow an {{inspection of the}} engine specifically performed to find internal engine failures. With the engine crankcase access and cylinder block airbox covers removed, a visual inspection of the engine's rotating and reciprocating assemblies can be performed. The use of a fiber optic endoscope (flexible borescope) may facilitate this inspection and evaluation, {{but this is not}} a requirement, nor is it a part of EMD's maintenance program.|$|E

[...] Although this power increase is not recommended, horsepower-for-horsepower updates (e.g., [...] 567D to [...] "645D"—645 <b>power</b> <b>assemblies</b> in a 567 block) are quite successful and common.|$|R

50|$|A {{mud motor}} (or {{drilling}} motor) is a progressive cavity {{positive displacement pump}} (PCPD) placed in the drill string to provide additional power to the bit while drilling. The PCPD pump uses drilling fluid (commonly referred to as drilling mud, or just mud) to create eccentric motion in the power section of the motor which is transferred as concentric power to the drill bit (well). The mud motor uses different rotor and stator configurations to provide optimum performance for the desired drilling operation, typically {{increasing the number of}} lobes and length of <b>power</b> <b>assembly</b> for greater horsepower. In certain applications, compressed air, or other gas, can be used for mud motor input power. Normal rotation of the bit while using a mud motor can be from 60 rpm, to over 100 rpm.|$|E
