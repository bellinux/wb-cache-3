5|$|Cameroon has a {{high level}} of {{religious}} freedom and diversity. The predominant faith is Christianity, <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> about two-thirds of the population, while Islam is a significant minority faith, adhered to by about one-fifth. In addition, traditional faiths are <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> many. Muslims are most concentrated in the north, while Christians are concentrated primarily in the southern and western regions, but practitioners of both faiths can be found throughout the country. Large cities have significant populations of both groups. Muslims in Cameroon are divided into Sunnis (including Wahhabis), Shias, Sufis, and non-denominational Muslims.|$|E

5|$|Tongue {{piercing}} was <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> the Aztec, Olmec and Mayan {{cultures as}} a ritual symbol. Wall paintings highlight a ritual of the Mayans during which nobility would pierce their tongues with thorns.

5|$|Appreciation of art {{among the}} gentry class flourished during the Song dynasty, {{especially}} {{in regard to}} paintings, which is an art <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> many.

5|$|Taqiya ("dissimulation") was <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> some Bábís. It was {{justified}} {{by some as}} a response to the often violent oppression the community faced.

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{migration}} and evolution {{of the practice of}} circumcision is followed mainly through the cultures and peoples in two separate regions. In the lands south and east of the Mediterranean, starting with Sudan and Ethiopia, the procedure was <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> the ancient Egyptians and the Semites, and then by the Jews and Muslims, with whom the practice travelled to and was adopted by the Bantu Africans. In Oceania, circumcision is <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> the Australian Aborigines and Polynesians. There is also evidence that circumcision was practiced among the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in the Americas, but little detail is available about its history.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E
5|$|At {{least some}} wild {{bottlenose}} dolphins use tools.

This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).|$|E

5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E

40|$|This article {{opens up}} space to {{challenge}} state-centrism {{about human rights}} practice. To do so, it presents and critically assesses four methods {{that can be used}} to determine who and/or what counts as a part of any international practice: the agreement method, which locates a <b>practice</b> <b>by</b> referring to speech acts that define it; the contextual method, which locates a <b>practice</b> <b>by</b> referring to the actions, meanings, and intentions of practitioners; the value method, which locates a <b>practice</b> <b>by</b> identifying a value or principle that the practice reflects or instantiates; and the purpose method, which locates a <b>practice</b> <b>by</b> constructing an account of the sociopolitical reason(s) for a practice’s existence. The purpose method, based on an interpretation of Rawls’ constructivism, is developed, in a way that focuses on practitioners’ judgement-based reasons to assign responsibility for human rights to any state or non-state actor...|$|R

The notes are not an official form of recognized currency or legal tender since their sole intended purpose is to be offered as burnt offerings to the deceased as a superstitious solution to resolve their ancestors financial problems.

5|$|In {{the absence}} of the {{harassment}} of coyotes <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> rural people, urban coyotes are losing their fear of humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally or unintentionally feeding coyotes. In such situations, some coyotes have begun to act aggressively toward humans, chasing joggers and bicyclists, confronting people walking their dogs, and stalking small children. Non-rabid coyotes in these areas sometimes target small children, mostly under the age of 10, though some adults have been bitten.|$|E
5|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{traditional}} sports {{not solely}} the preserve of the samurai class, being popular among peasants and sake brewers. Both professions valued the manual labor of young people, and similar practices called kyokumochi also existed, which involved lifting sacks of rice or barrels of sake. The sporting aspect of stone-lifting developed in Edo around the seventeenth century, likely evolving from the sack-lifting contests of the stevedores and labourers. Historically, the lifting of strength-stones was exclusively <b>practiced</b> <b>by</b> men.|$|E
