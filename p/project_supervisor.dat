5|$|Before Mega Man, Capcom {{primarily}} made arcade games, {{and their}} console releases were mostly ports of these titles. In the mid-1980s, Capcom {{made plans to}} develop Mega Man specifically for the Japanese home console market. They decided to bring in fresh, young talent for the small team, including artist Keiji Inafune, a recent college graduate who started on the Street Fighter team. Inafune recalled that the Mega Man development team worked extremely hard to complete the final product, with a <b>project</b> <b>supervisor</b> and lead designer who sought perfection in every possible aspect of the game.|$|E

500|$|Resident Evil 3 {{uses the}} same game engine as its predecessors. The environments consist of 2D pre-rendered {{backgrounds}} while moving objects such as enemies and some interactive elements consist of 3D polygon graphics. The developers chose this technique because having full 3D graphics would {{not allow them to}} create graphically rich and detailed environments. According to <b>project</b> <b>supervisor</b> Yoshiki Okamoto, [...] "the number of polygons allocated for the enemies would not be sufficient. We did not want to have blocky, pixelated zombies." [...] Interaction with the environment was improved so that the player could shoot objects like explosive barrels to damage enemies. Developers also added more variety of zombies, who can take the form of policemen, doctors, and ordinary citizens, among others.|$|E
500|$|The first Mega Man game—released in 1987—was not {{successful}} {{enough to justify}} the immediate development of a sequel. According to Roy Ozaki, director Akira Kitamura had {{wanted to make a}} sequel to Mega Man, but producer Tokuro Fujiwara was against it. Kitamura then went to Capcom Vice-President to get permission to make the game. [...] Capcom allowed the development team to create a sequel on the condition that they work concurrently on other projects as well. The staff spent their own time on the project to improve upon the original by adding more levels and weapons, as well as improving the graphics. The <b>project</b> <b>supervisor</b> of the first Mega Man invited Inafune to the sequel's development crew; Inafune was working on a separate game at the time. In the previous title, Inafune worked as an artist and character designer but became more involved in the production process of the sequel. [...] "Working on [...] marked my second year at this, and I even got to mentor a 'new kid', which opened up a whole new world of stress for me," [...] Inafune recounted. The development time for the game was only three to four months.|$|E

40|$|For decades, Army Engineers have {{utilized}} the {{systems of the}} Critical Path Method (CPM) and multi-level Gantt chart planning system for its construction projects. While these methods are well accepted, they are not without their flaws. Research and literature in project management has given weight to several viable alternative options to planning projects. One such option, Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM), was developed to address the flaws of CPM by offering a holistic approach to project management based on strict resource control {{and the use of}} time buffers. This method attempts to eliminate multitasking and procrastination that can plague efficiency and offer managers more flexibly on tasks that otherwise had no leeway. CCPM may give project managers more flexibility and control {{while at the same time}} shortening the overall length of a project, saving time and money. The purpose of this thesis was to address the time saving and resource management benefits of utilizing CCPM over CPM and analyze the viability of those benefits being applied to U. S. Army Corps of Engineers construction project planning. Through the use of surveys of Army Engineer <b>project</b> <b>supervisors,</b> several key factors that cause delays because of CPM were identified and rated. The validity of CCPM based solutions to the same issues were also assessed by Army <b>project</b> <b>supervisors</b> in the survey. Analysis of the survey results indicated that CCPM may offer solutions to major issues that Army <b>project</b> <b>supervisors</b> face...|$|R

500|$|The team {{decided to}} {{incorporate}} anime elements for the game's animation. Inafune explained, [...] " [...] hand transforms into {{a gun and}} {{you can actually see}} it come out of his arm. We {{wanted to make sure that}} the animation and the motion was realistic and actually made sense. So with Mega Man, we had this perfect blending of game character with animation ideas." [...] The gameplay for Mega Man was inspired by the game rock-paper-scissors. The <b>project</b> <b>supervisor</b> wanted a simple system that offered [...] "deep gameplay". Each weapon deals a large amount of damage to one specific Robot Master, others have little to no effect against them, and there is no single weapon that dominates all the others. Mega Man was originally able to crouch, but the team decided against it since it made players' ability to determine the height of onscreen projectiles more difficult. Naoya Tomita (credited as [...] "Tom Pon") began work on the Mega Mans scenic backgrounds immediately after his Capcom training. Tomita proved himself amongst his peers by overcoming the challenges of the console's limited power through maximizing the use of background elements.|$|E

2500|$|After Thusis {{was reached}} from Chur, the {{construction}} of the Albula Railway began on 15 October 1898. [...] Unlike the Bernina Railway, which was opened a good ten years later, and operated in fully electrified form right from the start, the Albula Railway was still a steam railway at its conception. [...] Moreover, (and again unlike the Bernina Railway), it was intended to be universally available, particularly for the transport of goods. [...] As the steam locomotives of the time were still not particularly powerful, and in order to permit the highest possible speeds, the maximum gradients were restricted to 3.5%, and the minimum curve radius was also generously defined. [...] Thus, the Albula Railway, in the interests of maximising its effectiveness, did not test the technical bounds of an adhesion railway. However, such an architectural style required a variety of engineering structures. [...] So, for example, the viaducts were exclusively solidly constructed. Especially problematical was the ascent of the valley between Bergün/Bravuogn and Preda, where, in a distance of 5km as the crow flies, a difference in altitude of over 400m needed to be overcome. To stay within the maximum gradient parameters, the <b>project</b> <b>supervisor,</b> , devised an intricate alignment, which lengthened the line's formation by 12km. [...] Two , three , and a number of bridges overcame the engineering problem, by winding the track around like the thread of a screw. [...] On this part of the line, {{the construction of}} the 660m long [...] in particular led to problems, because the 4°C cold mountain water hampered the activities of the workers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract— In a {{university}} system, {{the final year}} project is a synthesis of all the knowledge the students have acquired throughout the different years of their stay in the university. This knowledge must be used to solve a specific problem. Finding and selecting the appropriate <b>project</b> topic and <b>supervisor</b> to supervise the students, presently is in most cases very subjective. This paper presents a web based decision support system that automates efficiently the management of final year projects. The main contribution of the research is to recommend <b>project</b> <b>supervisors</b> and <b>project</b> topic based Naïve Bayes prediction. The decision support framework is web based, developed using JSP (Java-Server Pages), which integrates machine-learning algorithms to allocate final year <b>projects</b> and <b>supervisor.</b> The developed system {{has been able to}} provide a platform that maximizes the potentials of students and faculties particularly to solve industry and community related problems.

40|$|Abstract — Evaluation {{of network}} {{analysis}} application to project management was studied in southwest Nigeria. This {{was with a}} view to determining the level of application of project management tools and techniques especially network analysis in achieving project success. The study covered 129 large value construction projects in tertiary institutions in southwest Nigeria. The research instrument used was questionnaire. It elicited information on the issues such as project management tools and techniques applied, project duration and benefits of applying network analysis. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics. The results showed that 23. 3 % of the <b>project</b> <b>supervisors</b> applied network analysis while 100 % applied work breakdown structure and monthly progress technical reports. Thus, the application of network analysis in project management in southwest Nigeria is very low.
