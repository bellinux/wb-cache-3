With the benefits of the plays and shows, the hospital could bear part of its expenses.For these benefits to be greater, the theater would have the exclusive right to host theatrical performances in the city.On the 27 of October of 1787 the theater underwent a fire that completely destroyed it. Rebuilt thanks to the donations of nobles like the Marquess of Ciutadilla and the Count of El Asalto, the new theater, more sumptuous, was inaugurated on November 4, 1788.After 3 more fires and the opening of the Liceu opera house in 1847 the Teatro <b>Principal</b> <b>fell</b> into decadence.

40|$|This study investigates principals’ {{individual}} and aggregate perceptions of and expectations {{for students who}} use African American Vernacular English. Using the African American English Teacher Attitude Scale (AAETAS), the study seeks to describe the relationship between principals’ demographic characteristics and their perceptions of African American Vernacular English. The study uses raw scores from the AAETAS instrument created by Hoover, McNair-Knox, Lewis and Politzer (1997) and codes the principals’ perceptions of AAVE in a histogram. Principals’ demographic information was gathered on the following categories: race, gender, home language, county location, childhood hometown community, age, years in education, years as a teacher, years in administration, student socio-economic class, school’s dominate culture, and total school enrollment. The results show an overall attitude of mild acceptance of AAVE in about 80 % of the respondents. Five principals reported to having a negative attitude toward AAVE. Demographic factors such as gender, race, school location, enrollment, socio-economic status, age of principal, hometown setting and dialect were shown to influence principals’ perceptions and expectations of African American Vernacular English. Principals may want to view the AAVE as different as opposed to derogatory, deviant, or deficient (Jonsberg 2001). This study found {{that a majority of}} the high school principals in Cook County, IL, who completed the principal’s profile and the African American English Teacher Attitude Scale were in the ”Difference” category. “Difference” means that listeners view AAVE as different and not necessarily negative. Seventeen respondents out of 22 (77. 3 %) were in this category. “Deficit” represents a strongly negative attitude towards AAVE. Five out of 22 principals were in this category (22. 7 %). “Excellence” is a strong positive attitude towards AAVE. No <b>principals</b> <b>fell</b> into this category. Because this is a qualitative study, the principals’ responses have been explained through narrative. The findings in this study showed that most principals are neutral to mildly positive about AAVE and have neutral to mildly positive expectations for students who use AAVE. Five of the 22 school principals in this study indicated that the dialect could be harmful to one’s academic career, and they perceived AAVE as a dialect they would mildly prefer students not use...|$|R

60|$|Fortunately Pepin des Essarts and John de Charny, two loyal knights {{who were}} in Paris, {{obtained}} information of the plan {{a few minutes before}} the time appointed for its execution. Arming themselves instantly, and collecting a few followers, they rushed to the houses of the chief conspirators, but found them empty, Marcel and his companions having already gone to the gates. Passing by the hotel-de-ville, the knights entered, snatched down the royal banner which was kept there, and unfurling it mounted their horses and rode through the streets, calling all men to arms. They reached the Port St. Antoine just at the moment when Marcel was in the act of opening it in order to give admission to the Navarrese. When he heard the shouts he tried with his friends to make his way into the bastille, but his retreat was intercepted, and a severe and bloody struggle took place between the two parties.

Most of the inhabitants were killed during the assault, and the city, which became a center for Hellenistic learning and philosophy, was resettled by nearby Bedouins. The area changed hands regularly between two Greek successor-kingdoms, the Seleucids of Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt, until it was besieged and taken by the Hasmoneans in 96 BCE.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To assess {{trends in}} admissions of {{patients}} with heart failure (HF) to all hospitals in Australia between 1996 - 1997 and 2003 - 2004. Methods and results: We carried out a retrospective analysis of the official population-based National Hospital Morbidity Data in Australia. Although the absolute number of separations with a principal diagnosis of HF remained stable, the age- and sex-standardized separation rate for HF recorded as principal diagnosis decreased from 2. 0 per 1000 population in 1996 - 1997 to 1. 6 per 1000 population in 2003 - 2004. The corresponding values for HF recorded in any diagnostic position were 7. 7 and 4. 7 per 1000 population. Men had higher in-hospital mortality than women (8. 9 % versus 8. 1 %,p < 0. 001) and also a larger decrease in this measure over the study period (21. 9 % versus 14. 4 %). While the geometric mean length of stay for HF as <b>principal</b> diagnosis <b>fell</b> from 5. 4 days in 1996 - 1997 to 4. 9 days in 2003 - 2004, the proportion of bed-days related to such diagnoses relative to total bed days attributed to circulatory diseases increased from 12. 8 % to 13. 7 % (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: There were no increase in number of admissions involving HF and standardized rates of hospital separations with HF fell in Australia between 1996 and 2004. The explanation for the observed declines in in-hospital case fatality and the separation rates should be sought in whole-of-community studies. (c) 2006 European Society of Cardiology.

40|$|Daily {{mechanical}} loading strongly influences the architecture {{and composition of}} bone tissue. Throughout the day, the amplitudes, rates, frequencies, and the dispersion over time of these loads vary. Nevertheless, most experimental and descriptive studies on the aforementioned relationship consider only cyclic loading and, in addition, focus on weight-bearing bones. A more complete assessment of the daily loading of bone {{might lead to a}} better understanding of the natural everyday stimulus for bone maintenance or adaptive responses. In the present study, we measured the daily habitual strain history of the non-weight-bearing mandible bone in the rabbit. Long-term continuous strain recordings were made using an implantable telemetry device able to read out bone-bonded strain gauges. The lateral surface of the rabbit mandibular corpus was chosen as the bone surface of interest. During the recordings, which lasted up to 33 h, the rabbits (N = 7) were able to move unrestrictedly in their cages, performing their habitual behaviours. Analysis of the recordings revealed that the measured bone surface was subjected to 2. 9 (± 1. 4) × 103 strain events per hour of which 1. 8 (± 1. 0) × 103 had amplitudes ≤ 10 microstrains (μvar epsilon). Larger strain amplitudes occurred less often and <b>principal</b> strains <b>fell</b> within the range of − 517 (± 118) μvar epsilon to 298 (± 81) μvar epsilon. Strain rates never exceeded 10, 000 μvar epsilon/s and only 8. 9 % (± 7. 2 %) of the habitual strain rates were higher than 1000 μvar epsilon/s. Strain frequency spectra displayed clear peaks at 4 - 5 and 9 Hz. The wirelessly recorded daily strain history of the rabbit mandible featured peak strain amplitudes resembling those of other mammalian mandibles, but much smaller than those found in many long-bone strain measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{paradigm}} case {{of political}} communication in late 20 th Century democracies is the mediated public sphere suggested by Jurgen Habermas. However, a less obvious discursive space opens when decisions made {{at higher levels}} of government are forced upon an unwilling community. The resulting controversy creates an ad hoc public sphere, i. e., public meetings at which a single divisive issue is argued. This study investigated an exemplar case of public discourse at the community level in Boyd County, Nebraska, where a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility was proposed in 1989. The purpose was to describe communication and to determine explanatory utility of extant communication theories {{in the context of}} an ad hoc public sphere. ^ Textual analysis of utterances by ordinary citizens in extended personal interviews and transcripts of public meetings found that <b>principal</b> arguments <b>fell</b> into three broad categories: demonization of supporters and officials, victimization and valorization of opponents, and dichotomization of views regarding science and technology. Images of nuclear holocaust suggested in many historical, psychological and sociological studies constituted only a small part of the discourse. ^ Discursive characteristics identified in the analysis are best explained by Symbolic Convergence Theory. Argument fragments found in public meetings are analogous to Bormann 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 cryptic allusions to symbolic common ground. 2 ̆ 2 Hidden political motives and conspiracy can be explained as interpreting events in terms of human action. Strong group self-images are produced as opponent and proponent rhetorical communities seek to distinguish insiders from outsiders. Dichotomization of views on science and technology can be understood as mirror image rhetorical visions. ^ Complexity and richness of discourse found in this exemplar case of an ad hoc public sphere suggest that further study by political communication scholars is needed. Bormann 2 ̆ 7 s Fantasy Theme Analysis is proposed as the most appropriate analytical method for future research. ...|$|R

The researcher sought to determine if a relationship between specific leadership practices performed by the principal and overall student achievement on the three gateway tests, English, Math, and Biology, exists. High school <b>principals</b> whose school <b>fell</b> within one standard deviation of the mean school size and one standard deviation of the mean in socio-economic status were surveyed. Data for this quantitative study were collected using the Instructional Leadership Practices Survey, developed by the researcher using the current literature regarding instructional leadership practices.

Data collected from the State of Tennessee report cards for each school involved in the study were also used in order to attempt to draw a correlation between leadership practices and student achievement. The findings indicated that there was not a relationship between the specific principal leadership practices and student achievement on the Tennessee Gateway Tests. The findings also indicated that the average high school principal in the State of Tennessee spends less than 10 hours per week monitoring instruction...|$|R
