50|$|As part of {{new rules}} {{announced}} by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) on 16 June 2006 which encouraged closed cockpit Le Mans Prototypes, Peugeot unveiled the 908 with a closed cockpit, the first Le Mans Prototype (LMP) since the Bentley Speed 8 to race with such a design. Peugeot's choice of a closed cockpit is possibly intended to allow the 908 to run a larger air restrictor due to rules mandating the use of air conditioning on closed cockpit designs.Peugeot also felt that weight, centre of gravity, and operational drawbacks were able to be overcome by better chassis rigidity and aerodynamics with using a closed cockpit design. The cockpit uses a unique 2 part door system with {{the upper part of}} the door (the window) swinging forward and out with a hinged <b>plate</b> (<b>part</b> of the sidepod) forming the lower part of the door that can be either swung out or removed completely, this was reportedly done to allow the car to conform to current regulations regarding door size. The body is a carbon fibre monocoque instead of a conventional open structure to offer better rigidity and lower weight. Front and rear suspension are linked, steering is electrically powered, magnesium wheels come from BBS. The car measures 4.65 m ×2 m and weighs 925 kg minimum. Peugeot announced they would build the 908 chassis themselves, instead of relying on another manufacturer to build it for them.|$|E

30|$|The {{solution}} of Eq. (10) {{relies on the}} boundary conditions for the four edges of the plate. The longitudinal length of a usual cantilever deck is generally {{much greater than the}} lateral length of the plate, i.e., L_b≫ L_a. As a result, the boundary conditions for the two lateral edges of the plate are not essential for the mechanism behavior of the <b>plate</b> <b>part</b> far from these two edges, and these two edges are both assumed to be simply supported hereby. It is noticed that one of the longitudinal edges of the cantilever deck is elastically constrained by the web and top plate of the box girder and the other longitudinal edge is free.|$|E
