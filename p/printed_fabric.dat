25|$|Darker lozenge {{patterns}} {{were used for}} upper wing surfaces, while lighter ones {{were used for the}} undersides of the aircraft. Even darker shades were used for night operations by aircraft such as Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI and Gotha G.V heavy bombers. These aircraft were often hand-painted in similar but unrepeating patterns on their fuselages. The heaviest Riesenflugzeug were painted in lozenge patterns—they were never covered in <b>printed</b> <b>fabric.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} stages of the Great War, the Germans were looking for a way to {{effectively}} camouflage the aircraft of the Luftstreitkräfte to inhibit enemy observation of the aircraft while it was airborne and when on the ground. Large, irregular blotches with two or three colors were used on the upper surfaces of the wing which led to the development of the Buntfarbenanstrich, the lozenge camouflage made up of repeating patterns of irregularly shaped four-, five- or six-sided polygons. Because painting such a pattern was very time consuming, and the paint added considerably to the weight of the aircraft, the patterns were printed on fabric, and the fabric was then used to cover the aircraft. This <b>printed</b> <b>fabric</b> was used in various forms and colors from late 1916 until the end of the war.|$|E

40|$|Chitosan, a {{naturally}} available biopolymer {{which is now}} increasingly used as a functional finish on textile substrates to impart antimicrobial characteristics and increase dye uptake of fabrics, was blended with different ratios of gelatinized starch. The chitosan was extracted and characterized by IR, 1 H-NMR, and X-ray powder diffraction. These blends were tested as thickeners in textile screen printing using Curcuma tinctoria as natural dye. The rheological properties and the viscosity of the printing paste were measured. The effect of chitosan on the printing properties of different fabrics (natural, blends, and synthetic fabrics) was studied by measuring the color strength value (K/S) and related color parameters of the <b>printed</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The antimicrobial properties of <b>printed</b> <b>fabrics</b> were assessed. The results proved that the <b>printed</b> <b>fabrics</b> using these new thickeners showed increase in the color strength value (K/S) giving darker color which means that chitosan increased the dye uptake on fabrics. Fastness properties of the <b>printed</b> <b>fabrics</b> to washing, rubbing, perspiration, and light have also been improved. The treated fabrics {{were found to be}} antimicrobial...|$|R

When Ashley looked for small patches carrying Victorian designs to help her make patchworks, she found no such thing existed. Here was an opportunity, and she started to print Victorian style headscarves in 1953.|$|E
50|$|Broderie perse can be {{done with}} any <b>printed</b> <b>fabric</b> on any ground, but it {{originally}} was worked with Chintz type fabrics. Chintz typically has clearly defined, separated motifs, which were cut out and invisibly applied onto the ground fabric. The typical intention was to create a scene from the motifs, but the decoration could also be random. The resulting fabric was often made into bedspreads, either unlined for summer or quilted for winter. They were typically saved for special occasions, such as guest beds.|$|E
50|$|Originally only {{printed on}} shelter halves, the pattern was not {{intended}} to be worn by soldiers though the shelter halves could be used as rain-ponchoes. From 1937, the <b>printed</b> <b>fabric</b> was also used for smocks for the Italian paratroopers. At some point before the outbreak of the Second World War, the pattern was changed, possibly to accommodate printing with smaller rolls. It was scaled down and compressed slightly lengthwise, but otherwise kept the shapes and colours of the first production. The pattern varied with time, the colours becoming brighter while the print became less crisp.|$|E
