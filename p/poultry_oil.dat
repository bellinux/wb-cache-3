40|$|Abstract. Acceptance of oral baits by dogs was {{evaluated}} in Guatemala. Eight bait matrix/attractant combinations were produced using commercial materials {{available in the}} United States. Two baits were produced using local materials in Guatemala. All baits included a plastic sachet that contained a placebo vaccine (water). Bait trials were conducted Februaryâˆ’April, 2002, at five sites using 261 dogs. Bait acceptance ranged from 50. 0 % to 87. 1 %, and the combined proportion of sachets either swallowed or punctured ranged from 23. 1 % to 83. 9 %. The four bait types with the highest acceptance by dogs were the wax-coated sachet coated with <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> and poultry meal (87. 1 %), the dog meal polymer coated with <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> and poultry meal (82. 8 %), the fish meal polymer coated with <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> and poultry meal (77. 4 %), and the chicken head bait (77. 8 %).

40|$|Different size pellet {{dies and}} {{two levels of}} dietary energy density were used in prestarter broiler diets {{formulated}} to meet typical commercial standards. In the first experiment, birds reared in battery brooders were offered diets containing either 0. 5 or 2. 5 % <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> from 0 to 14 days. Each group of diets was assigned different feed forms such as mash continuously through the study or mash, pellet diameters of 1. 59, 2. 38 and 3. 17 mm dies or crumbled diets from 0 - 7 days followed by crumbled diets to 14 days and pelleted diets to 35 days. In the second experiment, birds reared in floor litter were assigned the same treatments as the previous study except the 2 levels of <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> were supplied from 0 - 42 days of age. During the first seven days birds fed the 1. 59 and 2. 38 mm diameter die or crumble diets had higher body weight than did birds fed the other feed forms; however, this positive effect was dissipated as the birds grew older. The feed intake kept almost the same tendency as the body weight. The feed conversion at 7 days was improved as pellet size was reduced. It is {{thought that this was}} {{due in large part to}} better nutritive value since, birds fed crumbled and pelleted diets have almost the same feed intake but different feed conversion. Birds given the mash feed during the whole period had lower body intake and feed intake than those birds fed other feed forms. The body weights and feed conversions at 35 and 42 days were improved as the level of <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> increased. Improvement in feed conversion by birds fed diets with 2. 38 and 3. 17 mm diameter die or crumble diets at 7 days and mash or 3. 17 mm diameter die diets at 42 days was observed as the dietary energy level increased.

Overall, the results of the three experiments suggest little if any improvement in metabolizable energy of SBM as a result of the addition of an exogenous alpha-galactosidase enzyme, as indicated by evaluation of body weight gain, feed utilization, calorie conversion, or mortality. No improvements in the above parameters were noted when Avizyme 1502 was added to the diet, alone or in combination with the alpha-galactosidase enzyme.

40|$|Fatty acid profile {{analysis}} {{is a tool}} for dietary investigation that may complement traditional stomach contents analysis. While {{recent studies have shown}} that the liver of sharks fed different diets have differing fatty acid profiles, the degree to which diet is reflected in shark blood serum and muscle tissue is still poorly understood. An 18 -week controlled feeding experiment was undertaken using captive Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni). Sharks were fed exclusive diets of artificial pellets treated with fish or <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> and sampled every 6 weeks. The fatty acid profiles from liver, blood serum, and muscle were affected differently, with the period from which significant differences were observed varying by tissue and diet type. The total fatty acid profiles of fish oil and <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> fed sharks were significantly different from week 12 onwards in the liver and blood serum, but significant differences were only observed by week 18 in the muscle tissue of sharks fed different diets. The drivers of dissimilarity which aligned with dietary input were 14 : 0, 18 : 2 n- 6, 20 : 5 n- 3, 18 : 1 n- 9 and 22 : 6 n- 3 in the liver and blood serum. Dietary fatty acids accumulated more consistently in the liver than in the blood plasma or muscle, likely due to its role as the central organ for fat processing and storage. Blood serum and muscle fatty acid profiles were influenced by diet, but fluctuated over-time. The low level of correlation between diet and muscle FA profiles is likely a result of low levels of fat (< 1 %) in the muscle and the domination of structural, cell-membrane phospholipids in shark muscle tissues. Our findings describe inter-tissue differences in the incorporation of fatty acids from the diet to consumer, which should be taken into account when interpreting dietary patterns from fatty acid profiles.

40|$|Introduction: Depletion {{of fossil}} fuels and {{environmental}} degradation are two major problems faced by the world. Today fossil fuels take up to 80 % of the primary energy consumed in the world, of which 58 % is consumed by the transport sector alone (Mard et al., 2012). The combustion products cause global warming, which is caused of emissions like carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX). Thus {{it is essential that}} low emission alternative fuels to be developed for useing in diesel engines. Many researchers have concluded that biodiesel holds promise as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. Biodiesel is oxygenated, biodegradable, non-toxic, and environmentally friendly (Qi et al., 2010). Materials and Methods: In this study transesterification method was used to produce biodiesel, because of its simplicity in biodiesel production process and holding the highest conversion efficiency. Transesterification of <b>poultry</b> fat <b>oil</b> and the properties of the fuels: Fatty acid methyl ester of <b>poultry</b> fat <b>oil</b> was prepared by transesterification of oil with methanol in the presence of KOH as catalyst. The fuel properties of <b>poultry</b> fat <b>oil</b> methyl ester and diesel fuel were determined. These properties are presented in Table 1. Tests of engine performance and emissions: After securing the qualitative characteristics of produced biodiesel, different biodiesel fuels of 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % blended with diesel fuel were prepared. A schematic diagram of the engine setup is shown in Fig. 1. The MF- 399 tractor engine was used in the tests. The basic specifications of the engine are shown in Table 3. The engine was loaded with an electromagnetic dynamometer. The Î£ 5 model dynamometer manufactured by NJ-FROMENT was used to measure the power and the torque of the tractor engine. The speed range and capacity of this device are shown in Table 2. A FTO Flow Meter, manufactured by American FLOWTECH Company, was used to measure the fuel consumption (Fig. 3). Its measuring range is 37 - 1537 ml min- 1. Results and Discussion: The engine performance was evaluated in terms of engine power, engine torque and specific fuel consumption at different engine speeds. The variation of engine torques with B 5, B 10, B 15, B 20 and diesel fuel are presented in Fig. 4. The engine torque for biodiesel blends was more than that by diesel fuel only. The mean engine torques for B 5, B 10, B 15 and B 20 were 2. 5 %, 2. 8 %, 3 %, and 3. 5 % higher than that by only diesel, respectively. This is due to the better combustion of biodiesel compared to diesel fuel. The variation of engine powers with B 5, B 10, B 15, B 20 and diesel fuel are presented in Fig. 5. The engine powers for biodiesel blends were more than that by diesel fuel. The mean engine powers for B 5, B 10, B 15 and B 20 were higher than that by diesel by 2. 5 %, 3 %, 3. 5 %, and 4 %, respectively. This is because of good combustion of biodiesel resulted from higher oxygen content. The mean specific fuel consumptions for B 5, B 10, B 15 and B 20 were higher than diesel fuel about 4. 1 %, 7 %, 8. 8 %, and 2 %, respectively (Fig. 8). The density of biodiesel was higher than that of diesel fuel, which means the same fuel consumption on volume basis results in higher specific fuel consumption in case of biodiesel. Conclusions: The values of viscosity, density and flash point of <b>poultry</b> fat <b>oil</b> biodiesel were found to be closely matched with ASTM D- 6751 standard specifications. Viscosity and density of biodiesel were found more than those for diesel. The calorific value of biodiesel was found to be lower than that of diesel. <b>Poultry</b> fat <b>oil</b> biodiesel cannot be used as a neat diesel fuel in cold weather conditions due to its relatively low cloud point. Preheating and lowering freezing point is required to eliminate this problem. The engine performance with <b>poultry</b> fat <b>oil</b> biodiesel and its blends are comparable with those of pure diesel fuel. Results indicated that B 20 blend had the best performance and the lowest specific fuel consumption...|$|R

In experiment I, broiler performance, carcass traits, serum cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride levels, and pancreatic lipase activity in 42 -day-old broilers were evaluated. In experiment II, dry matter (DM), ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP) and crude fiber (CF) coefficients of digestibility were analyzed.

No significant difference in incidence of the syndrome was detected in broilers fed a corn-soy diet, or one with 13 % animal protein concentrates and 7. 5 % bakery product, or with a diet containing 10 % distillers dried grains with solubles. Substituting animal tallow for <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> significantly (P<. 05) increased the inci-dence of the syndrome. Feeding diets with a more narrow calorie to protein ratio significantly reduced incidence in one experiment, and feeding an unpelleted diet from 3 to 7 weeks of age also significantly reduced the incidence below that of birds fed the same diet in pelleted form. Incidence of OBS was significantly less for birds housed in a separate building with lower temperature condi-tions than those maintained {{in a house with}} a higher environmental temperature.

As {{a result of their}} decreased EPA and DHA content, the peroxidation index of the muscle lipids was also decreased. This was associated with increased simulated retail storage shelf life as indicated by decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in muscle samples from fish fed the palm or poultry oil-based diets. Concomitantly, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, but not glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity or reduced glutathione concentration, was significantly reduced in the liver of barramundi fed the palm or poultry oil-based diets as compared with the fish fed the fish oil-based diet. Furthermore, GPx and GST activity were very low in muscle, much lower than in gastrointestinal tract, liver or swim bladder.

Na fase inicial, as aves receberam raÃ§Ãµes formuladas com Ã³leo de soja; Ã³leo de algodÃ£o; Ã³leo de vÃ­sceras ou sebo bovino e, na fase de crescimento, cada uma dessas dietas foi desmembrada em duas, de modo que um grupo de aves continuou a receber a mesma fonte de Ã³leo utilizada na fase anterior, enquanto o outro grupo passou a receber Ã³leo de soja na dieta. Nessa fase, foi utilizado um delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com sete dietas, cada uma com quatro repetiÃ§Ãµes. Houve influÃªncia das dietas no perfil de Ã¡cidos graxos da coxa. No experimento 2, durante a fase inicial (1 a 21 dias), as aves receberam a mesma raÃ§Ã£o, contendo 3 % de Ã³leo de soja e, na fase de crescimento (22 a 42 dias), em um delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com cinco dietas, cada uma com uma com uma fonte lipÃ­dica (Ã³leo de soja, Ã³leo de canola, Ã³leo de girassol, Ã³leo de vÃ­sceras ou sebo bovino) seis repetiÃ§Ãµes e 30 aves/unidade experimental, fontes lipÃ­dicas. NÃ£o foi verificado efeito das dietas sobre o pH e a forÃ§a de cisalhamento. As dietas influenciaram, no entanto, o perfil de Ã¡cidos graxos da coxa, pois, de acordo com os resultados, o enriquecimento das raÃ§Ãµes com fontes de Ã³leo promoveu modificaÃ§Ãµes na composiÃ§Ã£o lipÃ­dica na carne da coxa dos frangos, de modo que o melhor perfil de Ã¡cidos graxos foi observado na carne dos animais alimentados com a raÃ§Ã£o contendo Ã³leo de soja. Two {{experiments were}} carried out to evaluate the quality and profile of fatty acids in the thigh and drumstick of broiler chickens, from one to 42 days of age. In the experiment 1, a complete randomized design, with four diets, eight replicates and 49 birds per experimental unit was used. In the starter phase, birds received diets formulated with soybean <b>oil,</b> cottonseed <b>oil,</b> <b>poultry</b> offal <b>oil,</b> or beef tallow, and during the growing phase, {{each one of these}} diets was dismembered in two diets, so one group of birds kept receiving the same oil source used in the previous phase while the other group started to receive soybean oil in the diet. In this phase, it was used a complete random design with seven diets, each one with four replicates. There was an effect of the diets on the profile of the fatty acids in the thigh. In the experiment 2, during the starter phase (from 1 to 21 days of age), the birds received the same diets with 3 % of soybean oil, and in the growing phase (from 22 to 42 days of age), they received five diets each one with a lipidic source (soybean, canola <b>oil,</b> sunflower <b>oil,</b> <b>poultry</b> offal <b>oil</b> and beef tallow) evaluated in a complete random design with six replicates and 30 birds per experimental unity. It was not observed effect of the diets on pH and shear force. However, diets influence the profile of fatty acids in the thigh because accordingly to the results, the increment of the rations with oil sources promote changes on lipid composition of the broiler thigh meat, so the best profile of fatty acids is observed in the meat of animals fed ration containing soybean oil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Fatty acid (FA) {{profile of}} fish tissue mirrors dietary FA profile {{and changes in}} a {{time-dependent}} manner following a change in dietary FA composition. To deter-mine whether FA profile change varies among lipid classes, we evaluated the FA composition of fillet cholesteryl esters (CE), phospholipids (PL), and triacylglycerols (TAG) of sunshine bass (SB, Morone chrysops 9 M. saxatilis) raised on feeds containing fish oil or 50 : 50 blend of fish oil and coconut, grapeseed, linseed, or <b>poultry</b> <b>oil,</b> with or without implementation of a finishing period (100 % FO feed) prior to harvest. Each lipid class {{was associated with a}} gen-eralized FA signature, irrespective of nutritional history: fillet PL was comprised largely of saturated FA (SFA), long-chain polyunsaturated FA (LC-PUFA), and total n- 3 FA; fillet TAG was higher in MC-PUFA and total n- 6 FA; and fillet CE was highest in monounsaturated FA (MUFA). Neutral lipids reflected dietary composition in a near-direct fashion; conversely, PL showed evidence of selectivity for MC- and LC-PUFA. Shorter-chain SFA were not strongly reflected within any lipid fraction, even when dietary availability was high, suggesting catabolism of these FA. FA metabolism in SB is apparently characterized by a division between saturated and unsaturated FA, whereby LC-PUFA are preferentially incorporated into tissues and SFA are preferentially oxidized for energy production. We demonstrated provision of SFA in grow-out feeds for SB, instead MC-PUFA which compete for tissue deposition, meets energy demands and allows for maximum inclusion of LC-PUFA within fillet lipids...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Maximum Profit Feed Formulation (MPFF) is {{proposed}} {{as a new}} approach to formulation of broiler diets which predicts the best profit for given ingredient and broiler prices, nutrient requirements and performance. Absolute and relative equations for body weight and feed intake as a function of Dietary Nutrient Density (DND) were developed and included into the objective function of Maximum Profit Programming 3. 0. Maximum performance and profitability were compared in terms of DND. Factors such as livability, temperature, processing cost, ingredient and broiler prices, starting and ending broiler prices as well as comparisons of two dynamic models, Body Weight (BW) or cut-up parts (CW), were evaluated to determine changes in DND and to compare the profitability between MPFF and Least-cost Feed Formulation (LCFF). Starter, grower and finisher DND were calculated from the mean of DND obtained by the MPFF. The maximum performances for cut-up parts and body weight were 3. 250 and 3. 300 ME kcal/g of DND respectively using simulations of the calculated equations, whereas the maximum profits for them were at 3. 169 and 3. 177 ME kcal/g respectively using the MPFF. Livability slightly decreased the DND, while temperature and processing cost did not affect the DND. However, the ingredient and broiler prices did affect the DND. As broiler meat or corn price increased, the DND was also increased but as the price of soybean meal or <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> increased, the DND tended to decrease. For the above variables, use of the MPFF resulte...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to investigate the influence of fish oil (FO), two terrestrial animal fats (lard (PL) and <b>poultry</b> <b>oil</b> (CF)) and three vegetable oils (palm kernel (PKO), sheabutter (SBO) and sunflower (SFO)) as the dietary lipid sources on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fatty acid (FA) composition and histology of Hetero-branchus longifilis. Six isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets containing 6 % of added fat from the lipid sources were formulated and used. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of 20 fish. The lipid source influenced (P < 0. 05) weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, hepatosomatic index and nutrient digestibility. Liver morphology of H. longifilis fed CF showed intense steatosis with hepatocytes containing numerous lipid vacuoles. However, fish fed PKO and SFO showed regular-shaped hepatocytes with few lipid vacuoles in the cytoplasm. Fillet FA profile of fish fed PKO, SBO, PL and CF diets had significantly higher (P < 0. 05) concentrations of SFA and MUFA, but lower PUFA com-pared to fish fed FO and SFO diets. Fillet of fish fed the FO diet had higher (P < 0. 05) concentrations of EPA and DHA compared with fish fed the other diets. The {{results of this study}} shows that alternative lipids sources could be used in H. longifilis diets however, inclusion of PKO or SBO in the diet of H. longifilis produced fillets with low concentrations of long chain n- 3 PUFA...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a recent {{increase}} in research interest directed at the inclusion of tallow in fish feed formulations are suggesting tallow is viable as a potential substitute for other alternative lipid sources such as <b>poultry</b> by-product <b>oil.</b> Although strong growth performance data has been shown, reservations still exist regarding reduced digestibility and the potential impacts this could have on performance over the duration of a grow-out period in low temperature conditions. Also little information is yet available on the potential effect of dietary tallow inclusion on final product quality. A large scale farm based study testing the inclusion of tallow at 40 % inclusion, partially replacing <b>poultry</b> by-product <b>oil,</b> in commercial diets of Atlantic salmon over a winter grow-out period in southern Tasmania, Australia was conducted. Tallow inclusion had no impact on growth performance or nutrient digestibility. Tallow resulted in a slight improvement in fillet quality exhibiting {{a significant reduction in}} n - 6 PUFA and the n 6 :n 3 ratio, and an increased n - 3 LC-PUFA tissue deposition. Consumers were unable to display any preference in liking between 3 salmon products (cold smoked, hot smoked, and cooked) as a result of tallow inclusion. This study demonstrates the viability of partial inclusion of tallow in Atlantic salmon diets over a winter grow-out period. Statement of relevance: Improved knowledge of alternative dietary energy sources (oils and fats) to be used in aquafeed, (replacing the increasingly expensive, and diminishingly available, fish oil) is a key area of research towards improved environmental sustainability and economic viability of the aquaculture sector. Following a promising laboratory based, research scale, in vivo trial aimed at assessing the viability of tallow in salmon feed, a larger and longer duration farm-based trial was implemented to validate initial findings. Consumer test of final products (fresh-cooked, hot smoked and cold smoked fillets) showed no modification of sensorial attributes. Tallow is hereto shown to be a highly viable alternative oil for the salmon aquafeed industry...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{content of}} the diets is the major factor that affect feed intake in <b>poultry.</b> Fats and <b>oils</b> are the most {{concentrated}} sources of energy, but also those from which the availability and, therefore, the metabolizable energy content show the greatest variation (Blanch et al., 1996). This variation is influenced by several factors as saturated and unsaturated fatty acids ratio (VilÃ  et al., 1996 a, Castrovilli et al., 1994) and percentage of free fatty acids (VilÃ  et al., 1996 b). Another source of variation is the animalâ€™s age:Wiseman and Salvador (1989) reported an improvement in the utilisation of dietary fats by broilers to adult birds [...] ...|$|R
