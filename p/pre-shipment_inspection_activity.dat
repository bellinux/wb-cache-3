To detect and combat fraud, we argue that revenue-collection authorities should,notably {{in the absence of}} reliable third-party information, exploit non-usual sources ofinformation. Specifically, our micro-level study of customs evasion provides evidence thatusing any internal or external available source of information facilitates customsenforcement. Estimates highlight that exploiting historical data and/or relying on aninformation provider - a <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> company - significantly reduces evasion inCameroon.

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} some factors that reduce evasion of customs duties in developing countries. Following the recent literature on customs evasion, we proxy customs fraud by discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics. Estimates first {{show that the}} more frequently a product is imported, the more customs fraud reduces. We argue that this result {{is indicative of the}} fact that customs officers use what they have learned from similar import declarations - use customs' internal information - to better assess the compliance of declarations. Then, we show that relying on an information provider - a <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> company in our case - seems to increase tax enforcement. Results indicate that <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspections</b> significantly reduce observed discrepancies in trade statistics. In line with previous studies, we find that the semi-elasticity of evasion increases with the tax rate. Finally, estimates confirm that enforcement is product-varying. Results are robust to various robustness checks...|$|R
50|$|While {{engaging}} a <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> agency {{may appear}} justified {{in a country}} with an inexperienced or inadequate customs establishment, the measure {{has not been able to}} plug the loophole and protect revenue.

Privatization of customs has been viewed as a fatal remedy.|$|R
50|$|Commodity {{inspection}} {{is other}} term {{that is used}} between buyers and sellers. The scope of work for commodity inspection depends to the buyers. Some buyers hire the inspection agencies only for <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspections</b> i.e. visual quality, quantity, packing, marking and loading inspections and some others request for higher level inspections and ask inspection agencies to attend in the vendor shops and inspect commodities during manufacturing processes.

50|$|The <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> can be {{agreed upon}} between a buyer, a supplier, and a bank, {{and it can}} be used to {{initiate}} payment for a letter of credit. A PSI can be performed at different stages before shipment, such as checking the total amount of goods and packing, controlling the quality or consistency of goods, checking of all documentation, as for example test reports, packaging list, or verification of compliance with standards of the destination country like ASME, CE mark and import duties.|$|R
50|$|Customs {{is part of}} one of {{the three}} basic {{functions}} of a government, namely: administration; maintenance of law, order, and justice; and collection of revenue. However, in a bid to mitigate corruption, many countries have partly privatised their customs. This has occurred by way of contracting <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> agencies, which examine the cargo and verify the declared value before importation occurs. The country's customs is obliged to accept the agency's report for the purpose of assessing duties and taxes at the port of entry.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> (PSI) {{agencies}} are companies that carry out physical {{inspection of the}} cargo and certify {{the value of the}} consignment after verification of the declared price against the ruling international price. Then the Customs authorities calculate the leviable of amount of duties and taxes on the basis of that certified value. This essentially has shifted the critical task of tax assessment to the PSI companies from the Customs inspectors and appraisers who were supposed to ascertain the assessable value of a consignment in accordance with the GATT valuation code.|$|R

50|$|An {{acceptable}} {{quality level}} {{is a test}} and/or inspection standard that prescribes {{the range of the}} number of defective components that is considered acceptable when random sampling those components during an inspection. The defects found during an electronic or electrical test, or during a physical (mechanical) inspection, are sometimes classified into three levels: critical, major and minor. Critical defects are those that render the product unsafe or hazardous for the end user or that contravene mandatory regulations. Major defects can result in the product's failure, reducing its marketability, usability or saleability. Lastly, minor defects do not affect the product's marketability or usability, but represent workmanship defects that make the product fall short of defined quality standards. Different companies maintain different interpretations of each defect type. In order to avoid argument, buyers and sellers agree on an AQL standard, chosen according to the level of risk each party assumes, which they use as a reference during <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection.</b>|$|R
40|$|If {{the only}} {{solution}} tried for customs corruption and evasion in a developing country is to outsource certain customs functions to a <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> (PSI) company, PSI will prove more of a fiscal burden than a panacea. PSI works best in countries where the customs service already performs fairly well-by reducing the costs of catching evaders. Typically a developing country's customs service brings in {{a large share of}} its revenues and accounts for an even larger share of its corruption. One prescription popular among development agencies for reducing corruption and customs evasion by importers has been to outsource certain customs functions to <b>pre-shipment</b> <b>inspection</b> (PSI) companies. More than 35 countries employ PSI as a second-best solution to corruption in customs collection. But whether PSI companies are an effective alternative to comprehensive civil service reform has been widely questioned. The success of PSI contracts depends on the institutional environment-the formal and informal rules of enforcement that affect different agents'incentives-but the reasons for PSI's success or failure in different institutional settings have not been well understood. Johnson presents a simple model highlighting the principal-agent problems in a typical PSI contract. Based on his conclusions, he suggests that PSI should be thought of less as a second-best alternative to customs reform (in countries where the customs service performs poorly) than as a cost-effective complement to reforms in"intermediate"cases (countries where the customs service already performs fairly well). PSI could help in these intermediate cases by reducing the costs of catching evaders. This {{would make it easier for}} the ministry of finance to maintain separate reforms to eliminate corruption between customs and importers. In countries where the customs service is powerful-ishighly independent and controls the country's borders-and where the government does not have the institutional ability to put through the complementary reforms essential for using PSI successfully, introducing a PSI contract will add to the burdens of public finance rather than provide the hoped-for panacea.

40|$|Customs {{reform in}} the 21 st century for {{developing}} countries will principally be the redefinition {{of public and private}} sector roles. As customs moves from physical control to documentary compliance, the private sector can and will play a larger role in customs administration. The widespread use of <b>Pre-Shipment</b> <b>Inspection</b> (PSI) and Mexico’s innovative privatized second inspection illustrate these trends. This paper examines Mexico’s recently introduced Second Inspection which is privatized and provides a check on the government’s physical inspection. The Second Inspection is uniquely poised to improve both physical control and documentary audit in Mexico’s customs by defining Rough Justice in customs. Rough Justice is a recognition of the limitations of time and space in customs operations and is an approach that promotes systematic but selective review of contents and documents. Unlike PSI services, Mexico’s Second Inspection builds the capacity of a government’s customs administration. In addition to reviewing the operation of the Second Inspection, the paper concludes with several observations about administrative reform of customs. The two most important conclusions are that administrative reform should promote accountability first and efficiency second, and that appropriate administrative redundancy promotes accountability. Mexico’s Second Inspection has promoted accountability by providing a layer of administrative redundancy...|$|R
