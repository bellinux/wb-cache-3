5|$|In 2003 NOAA divers {{and volunteers}} {{returned}} to the Monitor {{with the goal of}} obtaining overall video of the site to create a permanent record of the current conditions on the wreck after the turret recovery. Jeff Johnston of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary (MNMS) also wanted a definitive image of the vessel's <b>pilothouse.</b> During the dives, Monitors iron <b>pilothouse</b> was located near the bow of the vessel and documented for the first time by videographer Rick Allen, of Nautilus Productions, in its inverted position.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with three rudders, and the armored <b>pilothouse</b> was mounted {{on top of}} the gun turret. The officers' staterooms were built on deck out of light pine, and a {{hurricane}} deck was positioned between the turret and the deckhouse, between the two funnels. The hull was subdivided by three transverse and three longitudinal watertight bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the duel between the two ironclads, Monitor had been struck twenty-two times, {{including}} nine hits to the turret and two hits to the <b>pilothouse.</b> She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. Virginia had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor from the fire of Monitor and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. In the opinion of Virginias commander Jones and her other officers, Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E
50|$|Naval {{architect}} and engineer John Ericsson designed the Passaic-class warships, drawing upon {{lessons learned from}} the first USS Monitor, which he also designed. The Passaic monitors were larger than the original Monitor and had their <b>pilothouses</b> atop the turret, rather than near the bow. This allowed a wider field of view and easier communications between captain, pilot and crew. The shape of the hull was an improvement with a less pronounced overhang than the Monitor. The Passaic class featured an 18 ft funnel and improved ventilation.|$|R
5000|$|New York City {{developed}} its {{own style}} of tugboat. The vessels had tall, narrow houses, with high <b>pilothouses</b> {{to aid in}} seeing {{over the tops of}} railroad boxcars on carfloat barges towed alongside [...] "on the hip". Machinery was unique among marine steam engines in that many compound steam engines were non-condensing and exhausted to the air. The New York Central tug 16 had a single-cylinder non-condensing engine. Old films of the harbor exhibit puffs of steam as the tugs make their journey. This feature was unique in tug marine architecture. Hulls were usually iron or steel and boilers were fired with Appalachian anthracite coal.|$|R
50|$|Designed by John Lenthall. The {{hull of the}} {{monitors}} were of a conventional form, but were constructed of wood, not iron. The ships displaced 3400 LT and were 258 ft in length with a 53 ft beam and 13 ft draft. Freeboard was 31 inches, which left part of the hull exposed, this was covered several inches of armor plate backed by oak. The turrets, with 11 in of a armor, were similar to the turrents on the , only slightly larger. There were <b>pilothouses</b> fitted {{on the top of}} each turret. A light hurricane deck was constructed between the turrets, along with a tall funnel and a tall ventilation shaft. There were some variations within the class which leads some sourcesto identify them as four one-ship classes. One difference was that Tonawandas turrets were closer together than the other three ships in the class.|$|R
5|$|The Elmer S. Dailey was {{originally}} {{known as the}} Claire B. Follette when it was built by William H. Follette in 1915 at Tonawanda, New York. In 1928, the ship was rebuilt by Brown Drydock on Staten Island and acquired the name Elmer S. Dailey. Brown Drydock installed two Fairbanks-Morse in-line six-cylinder diesel engines and added the <b>pilothouse</b> and stack. At an unspecified later date, one engine was removed and a direct-drive engine, rated at 180 or 210 horsepower, operated on compressed air. In its final configuration, the vessel was manned by a three-man crew.|$|E
5|$|While {{she was out}} of {{commission}} at Mare Island, Bennington was refitted. A <b>pilothouse</b> that had been added on top of her bridge and a spotlight platform on her bow – both added in 1893–94 – were removed. Benningtons mainmast was also removed, leaving her as a two-mast rig. In addition, two tall ventilation cowls were added immediately behind the bridge. After 18months of inactivity, Bennington was recommissioned on 2 March 1903 under the command of Commander Chauncey Thomas.|$|E
5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the <b>pilothouse</b> let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E
6000|$|I {{too many}} and many a time cross'd {{the river of}} old, [...] Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them {{high in the air}} [...] {{floating}} with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies, [...] Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left [...] the rest in strong shadow, [...] Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south, [...] Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water, [...] Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams, [...] Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my [...] head in the sunlit water, [...] Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward, [...] Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet, [...] Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving, [...] Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me, [...] Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor, [...] The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars, [...] The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender [...] serpentine pennants, [...] The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their <b>pilothouses,</b> [...] The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels, [...] The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset, [...] The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the [...] frolic-some crests and glistening, [...] The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the [...] granite storehouses by the docks, [...] On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on [...] each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter, [...] On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning [...] high and glaringly into the night, [...] Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow [...] light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.|$|R
25|$|In 1882, {{the wooden}} <b>pilothouse</b> {{in the bow}} of all four Pennsylvania class ships was {{replaced}} with an iron one for safety reasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat had}} {{accommodation}} for 14 people. Eight crewmates slept below decks in double berth cabins, while the cook had {{a private room}} by the galley on the main deck. Four private rooms for officers were on the engineer’s deck and the captain’s office and private bedroom was behind the <b>pilothouse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Twenty {{hours after}} Myrons sinking, Captain Jordon of the steamer W.C. Franz was upbound {{out of the}} Soo Locks and {{on the lookout for}} {{survivors}} when he sighted a body moving on wreckage near Ile Parisienne. Captain Jordon launched a lifeboat and rescued a half-dead Captain Neal from the roof of Myrons <b>pilothouse.</b> Captain Neal's clothing was frozen to his body and his hands were so swollen that 2 finger rings were not visible but he survived.|$|E
25|$|After {{this initial}} brush with destruction, Pennsylvania {{continued}} to provide regular service between Liverpool and Philadelphia for another thirteen years. In 1875, {{a decision was}} made to increase the first class complement of all Pennsylvania class vessels from 75 to 100. In 1878, Pennsylvania was involved in a collision with the schooner H. B. Hume in which the latter was sunk. Judgement in the case was rendered against Pennsylvania in 1882. In that same year, the wooden <b>pilothouse</b> in the bow of all four Pennsylvania class ships was replaced with an iron one for safety reasons.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the crew}} members of the Thai vessel had a minor flesh wound, which was treated by the Munro {{boarding}} team. The Coast Guardsmen also discovered four automatic weapons in the <b>pilothouse,</b> expended ammunition shells {{on the deck of}} the vessel, as well as ammunition on the detained suspects. The three suspects were transferred to Munro. The Munro was assigned to CTF 150, which is the Coalition maritime task force conducting Maritime Security Operations (MSO) in the vicinity of the Horn of Africa, Gulf of Aden, Red Sea, North Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman.|$|E
25|$|City Ice Boat No.3 had {{a length}} of 201 feet 6 inches, a beam of 33 feet 5 inches and a draft of 13 feet 6 inches. She had a gross {{register}} tonnage of 637.2 tons (326.42 tons net) and a displacement of 1,537 tons. Photos taken during the vessel's naval service indicate {{that she was a}} double-ender, with a smaller <b>pilothouse</b> astern. Her powerplanta steam engine of the horizontal direct-acting typewas rated at a nominal horsepower of 500. It is not known what icebreaking features were incorporated into her design, but she is known to have been capable of making unusually sharp turns. She was the largest of the city's three icebreakers, the only one with an electric generating plant and electric lighting, and throughout her career was considered the best of the three.|$|E
25|$|Wooding-up was {{immediately}} ceased and the Hazelton {{pulled into the}} stream as the Mount Royal approached and they raced bow to bow. Slowly the Mount Royal gained on the Hazelton. Captain Bonser was having none of it and he rammed the Mount Royal several times. Johnson lost control and the current carried her back downstream, bow first. Bonser wagged the Hazelton’s stern at the Mount Royal, tooted the whistle and continued triumphantly upstream. Furious, Johnson left the <b>pilothouse</b> unattended to retrieve a rifle and shot at the departing Hazelton. Afterwards, Johnson laid charges on Bonser claiming he deliberately rammed the Mount Royal. Bonser claimed in his defense {{that it was an}} accident. The Federal Department of Marine investigated and decided that both captains were at fault, Bonser for ramming the Mount Royal, and Johnson for leaving the helm. The men were reprimanded and the case was closed.|$|E
25|$|In July 1994, MacInnis {{organized}} and led six publicly funded dives to the SS Edmund Fitzgerald over a three-day period. Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution provided the Edwin A. Link as the support vessel, and their manned submersible, the Celia. The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) paid $10,000 {{for three of}} its members to each join a dive and take still pictures. MacInnis concluded that the notes and video obtained during the dives did not provide an explanation of why the Fitzgerald sank. MacInnis helped organize another series of dives in July 1995 to salvage the bell from the Fitzgerald. Canadian engineer Phil Nuytten's atmospheric diving suit, the Newtsuit, was used to retrieve the bell from the ship, {{replace it with a}} replica, and put a beer can in the Fitzgeralds <b>pilothouse.</b> At MacInnis' suggestion, the replica bell was inscribed with the names of the Fitzgeralds crew.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1904, both boats {{wanted to be the}} first one of the season to arrive in Hazelton. Captain Bonser started out in Hazelton first, and while he was wooding-up 105 miles upstream, he saw Mount Royal with Captain Johnson at the helm coming up from behind. Wooding-up was {{immediately}} ceased and Hazelton pulled into the stream as Mount Royal approached and they raced bow to bow. Slowly Mount Royal gained on Hazelton. Captain Bonser was having none of it and he rammed Mount Royal several times. Johnson lost control and the current carried her back downstream, bow first. Bonser wagged Hazelton’s stern at Mount Royal, tooted the whistle and continued triumphantly upstream. Furious, Johnson left the <b>pilothouse</b> unattended to retrieve a rifle and shot at the departing Hazelton. Afterwards, Johnson laid charges on Bonser claiming he deliberately rammed Mount Royal. Bonser claimed in his defense that it was an accident.|$|E
25|$|Patrol vessel No.123 {{arrived at}} the scene near 9:30a.m. as the first ship to reach the site after the incident. During the time between the {{dispatch}} and the operations, members failed to raise Sewol, and chose to call for other ships on the radio. Consequently, members on the vessel had not directly communicated with Sewol, and {{were not aware of}} the content of the communication between Sewol and the Jindo VTS on arrival. At the time of arrival, Sewol had listed about 50 to 60 degrees to port. When the vessel arrived, members made announcements for five minutes, calling people to abandon ship and jump into the water. The vessel began rescue operations at 9:38a.m., with the dispatching of a rubber boat. Passengers who had reached the deck or jumped into the water were rescued, including the captain, but rescue members could not get inside the ship due to the list. However, people trapped inside the <b>pilothouse</b> were rescued by breaking through the windows.|$|E
25|$|Near 2:00 A.M. on April 27, 1865, when Sultana {{was just}} seven {{miles north of}} Memphis, her boilers {{suddenly}} exploded. First one boiler exploded, followed a split second later by two more. The cause of the explosion was too much pressure and low water in the boilers. There was reason to believe allowable working steam pressure was exceeded {{in an attempt to}} overcome the spring river current. The enormous explosion of steam came from the top, rear of the boilers and went upward at a 45-degree angle, tearing through the crowded decks above, and completely demolishing the <b>pilothouse.</b> Without a pilot to steer the boat, Sultana became a drifting, floating hulk. The terrific explosion flung some of the passengers on deck into the water and destroyed a large section of the boat. The twin smokestacks toppled over, one backwards into the blasted hole, and one forward onto the crowded forward section of the upper deck. The forward part of the upper decks collapsed into the exposed furnace boxes, shoving kindling into the open fire boxes which soon caught fire and turned the remaining superstructure into an inferno. Survivors of the explosion panicked and raced {{for the safety of the}} water but in their weakened condition soon ran out of strength and began to cling to each other. Whole groups went down together.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the engagement, Worden {{directed}} Williams {{to steer}} Monitor around the stern of Confederate ironclad, where Lieutenant Wood fired his 7-inch Brooke gun at the vessel's <b>pilothouse,</b> striking the forward side directly beneath the sight hold, cracking the structural [...] "iron log" [...] along the base of the narrow opening just as Worden was peering out. Worden was heard to have cried out, My eyes—I am blind! Others in the <b>pilothouse</b> had also been hit with fragments and were also bleeding. Temporarily blinded by shell fragments and gunpowder residue from the explosion and believing the <b>pilothouse</b> to be severely damaged, Worden ordered Williams to sheer off into shallow water, where Virginia with her deep draft could not follow. There Monitor drifted idly for about twenty minutes. At the time the <b>pilothouse</b> was struck Worden's injury was only known to those in the <b>pilothouse</b> and immediately nearby. With Worden severely wounded, command passed to the Executive Officer, Samuel Greene. Taken by surprise and confused he hesitated briefly and was undecided as to what action to take next, but after assessing the damage soon ordered Monitor to return to the battle area.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the Marietta-class ships resembled the river monitor [...] in many ways. The gun turret was at the bow {{and they had a}} deckhouse aft. There were also twin smokestacks similar to the Mississippi River steamboat designs. The original plans also called for a forward, pyramidal <b>pilothouse,</b> similar to the one on , however it is believed that the <b>pilothouse</b> was moved {{to the top of the}} turret before construction was completed. The Marietta-class ships were [...] long overall.

500|$|By ore {{freighter}} standards, {{the interior}} of Fitzgerald was luxurious. Her J.L. Hudson Company-designed furnishings included deep pile carpeting, tiled bathrooms, drapes over the portholes, and leather swivel chairs in the guest lounge. There were two guest state rooms for passengers. Air conditioning extended to the crew quarters, which featured more amenities than usual. A large galley and fully stocked pantry supplied meals for two dining rooms. The Fitzgerald <b>pilothouse</b> was outfitted with [...] "state-of-the-art nautical equipment and a beautiful map room." ...|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{original}} design of the Riverlore is the distinctive river boat theme of the house. [...] There is a glassed-in <b>pilothouse</b> with a sliding hatch {{that serves as the}} entrance to the roof. [...] The roof was designed to be flat and resemble the deck of a steamboat, so that Halliday could view the river and reminisce about his early days working as a steamboat captain while standing on his roof.

500|$|Because of her size, appearance, {{string of}} records, and [...] "DJ captain," [...] Fitzgerald became a {{favorite}} of boat watchers throughout her career. Although Captain Peter Pulcer was in command of Fitzgerald on trips when cargo records were set, [...] "he is best remembered... for piping music day or night over the ship's intercom system" [...] while passing through the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers. While navigating the Soo Locks he would often {{come out of the}} <b>pilothouse</b> and use a bullhorn to entertain tourists with a commentary on details about Fitzgerald.|$|E
500|$|The ships' main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} two smoothbore [...] Dahlgren guns mounted in a single turret that had an arc of fire of 300°.

500|$|Clouette {{describes}} the Elmer S. Dailey {{as having an}} [...] "almost rectangular hull in section and plan, with bluntly rounded bow and stern...the bulwarks, perforated by scuppers, rise up to the stem which is slightly raked back. There are prominent strakes in the bow and topside {{along the sides of}} the vessel.
