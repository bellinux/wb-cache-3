5000|$|An MGRS grid {{reference}} {{is a point}} reference system. When the term 'grid square' is used, it can refer to a square with a side length of 10 km, 1 km, 100 m, 10 m or 1 m, depending on the precision of the coordinates provided. (In some cases, squares adjacent to a Grid Zone Junction (GZJ) are clipped, so polygon is a better descriptor of these areas.) The number of digits in the numerical location must be even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10, depending on the desired precision. When changing <b>precision</b> <b>levels,</b> {{it is important to}} truncate rather than round the easting and northing values to ensure the more precise polygon will remain within the boundaries of the less precise polygon. Related to this is the primacy of the southwest corner of the polygon being the labeling point for an entire polygon. In instances where the polygon is not a square and has been clipped by a grid zone junction, the polygon keeps the label of the southwest corner as {{if it had not been}} clipped.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the cluster}} {{sampling}} approach many parameters have influence on lowering the survey costs {{and one of}} the most important is the intracluster homogeneity. Objectives: The goal of the paper is to find the most optimal value of intracluster homogeneity in case when two or more questions or variables have a key role in the research. Methods/Approach: Five key variables have been selected from a business survey conducted in Croatia and results for the two-stage cluster sampling design approach were simulated. The calculated intracluster homogeneity values were compared among all the five observed questions and survey costs and <b>precision</b> <b>levels</b> were inspected. Results: In the new cluster sampling design, for the fixed precision level, the lowest survey costs would be achieved by using the intracluster homogeneity value which is the closest to the average intracluster homogeneity value among all the key questions. Similar results were obtained when survey costs were held fixed. Conclusions: If there is more than one key question in the survey, then the best solution would be to use an average intracluster homogeneity value. However, one should notice that in that case minimum survey costs would not be reached, but the <b>precision</b> <b>levels</b> would increase at all key questions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} two {{problems}} related to imprecision in colour image segmentation processes: to decide whether a set of pixels verify the property "to be homogeneously coloured", and to represent the set of possible segmentations of an image at different <b>precision</b> <b>levels.</b> In order to solve the first problem we introduce a measure of distance between colours in the CIE L*a*b* space, {{that allows us to}} measure the degree of homogeneity of two pixels p and q {{on the basis of the}} maximum distance between the colours of consecutive pairs of pixels in any path linking p and q. Since homogeneity is a matter of degree, we define a (fuzzy) segmentation of an image as a set of fuzzy regions, each of them being a fuzzy subset of pixels, that we obtain by using a region growing technique. The membership degree of each pixel to each region is calculated on the basis of our homogeneity measure. The second problem is solved by introducing a fuzzy similarity relation between the fuzzy regions in this initial segmentation. The different α-cuts of the similarity relation define the set of <b>precision</b> <b>levels,</b> from which a nested hierarchy of fuzzy segmentations is finally obtained...|$|E
