25|$|<b>Prime-boost</b> {{strategies}} {{have been successful}} in inducing protection against malarial challenge in a number of studies. Primed mice with plasmid DNA encoding Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite surface protein (PyCSP), then boosted with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same protein had significantly higher levels of antibody, CTL activity and IFN-γ, and hence higher levels of protection, than mice immunized and boosted with plasmid DNA alone. This can be further enhanced by priming with a mixture of plasmids encoding PyCSP and murine GM-CSF, before boosting with recombinant vaccinia virus. An effective <b>prime-boost</b> strategy for the simian malarial model P. knowlesi has also been demonstrated. Rhesus monkeys were primed with a multicomponent, multistage DNA vaccine encoding two liver-stage antigens – the circumsporozoite surface protein (PkCSP) and sporozoite surface protein 2 (PkSSP2) – and two blood stage antigens – the apical merozoite surface protein 1 (PkAMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (PkMSP1p42). They were then boosted with a recombinant canarypox virus encoding all four antigens (ALVAC-4). Immunized monkeys developed antibodies against sporozoites and infected erythrocytes, and IFN-γ-secreting T-cell responses against peptides from PkCSP. Partial protection against sporozoite challenge was achieved, and mean parasitemia was significantly reduced, compared to control monkeys. These models, while not ideal for extrapolation to P. falciparum in humans, will be important in pre-clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|The {{virus is}} known to {{instigate}} robust humoral immunity in animal models and in the human population, where up to 80% of individuals {{are thought to be}} seropositive for AAV2. Antibodies are known to be neutralising, and for gene therapy applications these do impact on vector transduction efficiency via some routes of administration. As well as persistent AAV specific antibody levels, it appears from both <b>prime-boost</b> studies in animals and from clinical trials that the B-cell memory is also strong. In seropositive humans, circulating IgG antibodies for AAV2 appear to be primarily composed of the IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses, with little or no IgG3 or IgG4 present.|$|E

40|$|Protein-subunit {{vaccines}} as boosting strategies against tuberculosis (TB) infection {{are currently}} in the pipeline of TB vaccine research. Their main limitation is represented by their poor immunogenicity, which makes it necessary to couple protein-subunits with adjuvant molecules. In this study, we employed replication-deficient invasive Escherichia coli strains to deliver Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins to the cytoplasm of non-phagocytic eukaryotic cells using various priming and <b>prime-boosting</b> vaccination protocols. Our results demonstrate that intranasal administration of invasive E. coli expressing the M. tuberculosis protective antigen MPT 64 to mice primed with a recombinant BCG strain over-expressing MPT 64 on its surface, decrease bacterial burden in mice spleens. Our data suggest that replication-deficient invasive E. coli may represent a suitable platform for BCG/rBCG priming followed by homologous-boosting immunization strategies...|$|R
40|$|Currently, various {{therapeutic}} {{strategies are}} being explored {{as a potential}} means to immunize against metastatic malignant cells or even primary tumours. Using recombinant viral vectors systems or protein-based immunization approaches, we are developing immunotherapeutic strategies against cervical cancer or premalignant cervical disease, as induced by high-risk type human papillomaviruses (HPVs). We previously demonstrated that immunization of mice with recombinant replication-defective Semliki Forest virus (rSFV) encoding a fusion protein of HPV 16 E 6 and -E 7 (SFV-eE 6, 7) induces strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity and eradication of established HPV-transformed tumours. In this study, we compared the antitumour efficacy of SFV-eE 6, 7 {{with that of a}} recombinant adenovirus (rAd) type 5 vector, expressing the same antigen construct (AdeE 6, 7). <b>Prime-boosting</b> with SFV-eE 6, 7 resulted in higher precursor CTL frequencies and CTL activity compared to <b>prime-boosting</b> with Ad-eE 6, 7 and also in murine tumour treatment experiments SFV-eE 6, 7 was more effective than Ad-eE 6, 7. To elicit a therapeutic effect with Ad-eE 6, 7, 100 / 1000 -fold higher doses were needed compared to SFV-eE 6, 7. In vivo T-cell depletion experiments demonstrated that these differences could not be explained by the induction of a different type of effector cells, since CD 8 (+) T cells were the main effector cells involved in the protection against tumour growth in both rSFV- and rAd-immunized mice. Also comparable amounts of in vivo transgene expression were found upon immunization with rSFV and rAd encoding the reportor gene luciferase. However, antivector responses induced by a single injection with rAd resulted in a more than 3 -log decrease in luciferase expression after a second injection of rAd. With rSFV, transgene expression was inhibited by only one to two orders of magnitude in preinjected mice. As an antigen-specific booster immunization strongly increases the level of the CTL response and is essential for efficient induction of immunological memory, it is likely that (part of) the difference in efficacy between rSFV and rAd type 5 can be ascribed to a diminished efficacy of the booster immunization in the case of rAd due to anti-vector antibody responses...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Although {{results from}} phase III {{clinical}} trials substantially {{support the use}} of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against cancer, what has yet to be defined is how many and how frequent boosts are needed to sustain a long-lasting and protecting memory T-cell response against tumor antigens. Common experience is that such preclinical tests require the sacrifice of a relatively large number of animals, and are particularly time- and money-consuming. Results: As a first step to overcome these hurdles, we have developed an ordinary differential equation model that includes all relevant entities (such as activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and memory T cells), and investigated the induction of immunological memory in the context of wild-type mice injected with a dendritic cell-based vaccine. We have simulated the biological behavior both in the presence {{and in the absence of}} memory T cells. Comparing results of ex vivo and in silico experiments, we show that the model is able to envisage the expansion and persistence of antigen-specific memory T cells. The model might be applicable to more complex vaccination schedules and substantially in any biological condition of <b>prime-boosting.</b> Availability and implementation: The model is fully described in the article.

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes {{the upper}} {{respiratory}} tract of healthy individuals,from {{where it can be}} transmitted to the community. Occasionally, bacteria invade sterile niches, causing diseases. The pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) is a virulence factor that is important during colonization and the systemic phases of the diseases. Here, we have evaluated the effect of nasal or sublingual immunization of mice with Lactobacillus casei expressing PspC, as well as <b>prime-boosting</b> protocols using recombinant PspC, on nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization. None of the protocols tested was able to elicit significant levels of anti-PspC antibodies before challenge. However, a significant decrease in pneumococcal recovery from the nasopharynx was observed in animals immunized through the nasal route with L. casei-PspC. Immune responses evaluated after colonization challenge in this group of mice were characterized by an increase in mucosal anti-PspC immunoglobulin A (IgA) 5 days later, a time point in which the pneumococcal loads were already low. A negative correlation between the concentrations of anti-PspC IgA and pneumococcal recovery from the nasopharynx was observed, with animals with the lowest colonization levels having higher IgA concentrations. These results show that nasal immunization with L. casei-PspC primes the immune system of mice, prompting faster immune responses that result in a decrease in pneumococcal colonization...|$|R

We assessed this vaccine strategy among 138 Gambian and Burkinabe children in four cohorts: 2 - to 6 -year olds in The Gambia, 5 - to 17 -month-olds in Burkina Faso, and 5 - to 12 -month-olds and 10 -week-olds in The Gambia. We assessed induction of cellular immunity, taking into account the distinctive hematological status of young infants, and characterized the antibody response to vaccination. T cell responses peaked 7 days after boosting with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), with highest responses in infants aged 10 weeks at priming. Incorporating lymphocyte count into the calculation of T cell responses facilitated a more physiologically relevant comparison of cellular immunity across different age groups. Both CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells secreted cytokines. Induced antibodies were up to 20 -fold higher in all groups compared with Gambian and United Kingdom (UK) adults, with comparable or higher avidity.

Each antigen was subcloned into the pTECH 1 vector system, which allows them to be expressed as fusion proteins with highly immunogenic fragment C of tetanus toxin {{under the control of the}} anaerobically inducible nirB promoter. The recombinant vector was introduced into Salmonella Typhimurium vaccine strain SL 3261, and the stable soluble expression of the chimeric protein was evaluated and confirmed by Western blotting with polyclonal C. parvum antisera. Mice were inoculated orally with a single dose of SL 3261 /pTECH-Cp 23 or Cp 40, respectively, and plasmid stability was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the Cp 23 or Cp 40 antigen were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 35 days after immunization. Also, serum IgA and mucosal (feces) IgA antibodies were detected in 30 % of the mice immunized with Cp 23. In addition, <b>prime-boosting</b> with Cp 23 and Cp 40 DNA vaccine vectors followed by Salmonella immunization significantly increased antibody responses to both antigens. Our data show that a single oral inoculation with recombinant S.

40|$|In {{the light}} of the recent {{emergence}} of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the epidemic of tuberculosis (TB) in populations coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus, and the failure of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) to protect against disease, new vaccines against TB are urgently needed. Two promising new vaccine candidates are the recombinant DeltaureC hly(+) BCG (recBCG), which has been developed to replace the current BCG vaccine strain, and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing M. tuberculosis antigen 85 A (MVA 85 A), which is a leading candidate vaccine designed to boost the protective efficacy of BCG. In the present study, we examined the effect of MVA 85 A boosting on the protection afforded at 12 weeks postchallenge by BCG and recBCG by using bacterial CFU as an efficacy readout. recBCG-immunized mice were significantly better protected against aerosol challenge with M. tuberculosis than mice immunized with the parental strain of BCG. Intradermal boosting with MVA 85 A did not reduce the bacterial burden any further. In order to identify a marker {{for the development of a}} protective immune response against M. tuberculosis challenge, we analyzed splenocytes after priming or <b>prime-boosting</b> by using intracytoplasmic cytokine staining and assays for cytokine secretion. Boosting with MVA 85 A, but not priming with BCG or recBCG, greatly increased the antigen 85 A-specific T-cell response, suggesting that the mechanism of protection may differ from that against BCG or recBCG. We show that the numbers of systemic multifunctional cytokine-producing cells did not correlate with protection against aerosol challenge in BALB/c mice.

40|$|Buruli ulcer (BU) vaccine design faces similar {{challenges}} to those observed during development of prophylactic tuberculosis treatments. Multiple BU vaccine candidates, based upon Mycobacterium bovis BCG, altered Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) cells, recombinant MU DNA, or MU protein <b>prime-boosts,</b> have shown promise by conferring transient protection to mice against the pathology of MU challenge. Recently, {{we have shown}} that a recombinant BCG vaccine expressing MU-Ag 85 A (BCG MU-Ag 85 A) displayed {{the highest level of}} protection to date, by significantly extending the survival time of MU challenged mice compared to BCG vaccination alone. Here we describe the generation, immunogenicity testing, and evaluation of protection conferred by a recombinant BCG strain which overexpresses a fusion of two alternative MU antigens, Ag 85 B and the MU ortholog of tuberculosis TB 10. 4, EsxH. Vaccination with BCG MU-Ag 85 B-EsxH induces proliferation of Ag 85 specific CD 4 + T cells in greater numbers than BCG or BCG MU-Ag 85 A and produces IFNγ+ splenocytes responsive to whole MU and recombinant antigens. In addition, anti-Ag 85 A and Ag 85 B IgG humoral responses are significantly enhanced after administration of the fusion vaccine compared to BCG or BCG MU-Ag 85 A. Finally, mice challenged with MU following a single subcutaneous vaccination with BCG MU-Ag 85 B-EsxH display significantly less bacterial burden at 6 and 12 weeks post-infection, reduced histopathological tissue damage, and significantly longer survival times compared to vaccination with either BCG or BCG MU-Ag 85 A. These results further support the potential of BCG as a foundation for BU vaccine design, whereby discovery and recombinant expression of novel immunogenic antigens could lead to greater anti-MU efficacy using this highly safe and ubiquitous vaccine...|$|R

The continuous drift of Indonesian HPAI/H 5 N 1 viruses and {{emergence of a new}} clade in 2012 that became dominant in 2016, demands the assessment of commercial vaccine formulations against Indonesian field viruses. Seven databases were explored to identify relevant literature reporting performance of commercial vaccines against Indonesian HPAI/H 5 N 1 viruses. After methodological assessment, data were collated and analyzed to report immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy (VE) to prevent respiratory and cloacal viral shedding 2 -day post challenge, and death {{at the end of the}} follow-up period. Meta-analyses were performed to assess VE consistency of alternative formulations and to explore sources of heterogeneity in VE. In total, 65 studies and 46 vaccine formulations from 13 articles were grouped per OIE's VE protocols (group 1) and variations of it (groups 2, 3, 4). We found that concurrence of vaccine-seed and challenge-viruses in a clade designation might be a better proxy of VE than current estimates based on vaccine-homologous HI antibody titers, particularly against current fourth order clade viruses (groups 1 & 2). <b>Prime-boosting</b> was efficacious across different chicken breeds (group 3), and early vaccination may increase the risk of death (group 4). One Indonesian vaccine was tested against the new dominant clade, conferring consistent protection in chickens but not in ducks. Meta-analyses revealed high inconsistency (I 2 ≥ 75 %) and inefficacy of LPAI formulations against current field viruses, while potential sources of inconsistent VE were formulation of seed-homologous vaccines and the species vaccinated. We conclude that the VE of commercial vaccines in Indonesia changes as Indonesian HPAI/H 5 N 1 evolve into new clades, which should warrant continuous matching between vaccine-seeds and emerging HPAI/H 5 N 1. Furthermore, given the characteristics of the new Indonesian dominant HPAI/H 5 N 1 clade, further studies to confirm VE across species are warranted. embarg...|$|R

Trichinellosis is a widespread zoonosis primarily caused by Trichinella spiralis. Mucosal immunity is crucial for preventing Trichinella spiralis infection. In our previous study, a DNA vaccine with the Trichinella antigen Ts 87 delivered by an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium elicited partial protection against Trichinella spiralis infection inmice. In the current study, to elicit a more robust immune response and develop a potent vaccination strategy against trichinellosis, a heterologous <b>prime-boost</b> vaccination regimen for Ts 87 was used in mice and the protective efficacy was evaluated compared to the homologous DNA <b>prime-boost</b> or protein <b>prime-boost</b> immunization alone. The results revealed that the DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccination with Ts 87 induced higher levels of both humoral and cellular immune responses. The challenge results showed thatmice with theDNA-prime/protein-boost vaccination displayed higher muscle larval reduction than those immunized with DNA <b>prime-boost</b> or protein <b>prime-boost.</b> The results demonstrated that mice vaccinated with Ts 87 in a DNA-prime/protein-boost strategy effectively elicited a local IgA response and mixed Th 1 /Th 2 immune response that might be responsible for improved protection against Trichinella spiralis infection. 1...|$|E
40|$|Induction of high {{frequencies}} of specific T cells by vaccination requires <b>prime-boost</b> regimens. To reach optimal immune responses, {{it is necessary}} to use different vectors for priming and boosting as e. g. DNA vaccination followed by boosting with a recombinant viral vector. Here, we show that vaccines based on virus-like particles (VLP) displaying peptide epitopes are equally effective to induce CTL responses if used in a homologous or heterologous <b>prime-boost</b> setting. Strikingly, {{high frequencies}} (> 20 % of CD 8 (+) cells) of protective CTL could be induced and maintained by weekly injection of VLP. Thus, the use of VLP may avoid the requirement for complicated heterologous <b>prime-boost</b> regimens, facilitating the development of effective T cell-based vaccines...|$|E
40|$|In nonhuman primates, {{complete}} {{protection against}} an Ebola virus (EBOV) challenge {{has previously been}} achieved after a single injection with several vaccine platforms. However, long-term protection against EBOV after a single immunization has not been demonstrated to this date. Interestingly, <b>prime-boost</b> regimens have demonstrated longer protection against EBOV challenge, compared with single immunizations. Since <b>prime-boost</b> regimens {{have the potential to}} achieve long-term protection, determining optimal vector combinations is crucial. However, testing <b>prime-boost</b> efficiency in long-term protection studies is time consuming and resource demanding. Here, we investigated the optimal <b>prime-boost</b> combination, using DNA, porcine-derived adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV-po 6), and human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad 5) vector, in a short-term protec-tion study in the mouse model of EBOV infection. In addition, we also investigated which immune parameters were indicative of a strong boost. Each vaccine platform was titrated in mice to identify which dose (single im-munization) induced approximately 20 % protection after challenge with a mouse-adapted EBOV. These doses were then used to determine the protection efficacy of various <b>prime-boost</b> combinations, using the same mouse model. In addition, humoral and cellular immune responses against EBOV glycoprotein were analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, a neutralizing antibody assay, and an interferon γ–specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay. When DNA was used as a prime, Ad 5 boost induced the best protection, which correlate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Heterologous <b>prime-boost</b> {{immunization}} protocols {{using different}} gene expression systems {{have proven to}} be successful tools in protecting against various diseases in experimental animal models. The main reason for using this approach is to exploit the ability of expression cassettes to prime or boost the immune system in different ways during vaccination procedures. The purpose of the project was to study the ability of recombinant vaccinia virus (VV) and bacterial plasmid, both carrying the NS 1 gene from tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus under the control of different promoters, to protect mice against lethal challenge using a heterologous <b>prime-boost</b> vaccination protocol. Results The heterologous <b>prime-boost</b> vaccination protocol, using a VV recombinant and bacterial plasmid, both containing the NS 1 TBE virus protein gene under the control of different promoters, achieved a high level of protection in mice against lethal challenge with a highly pathogenic TBE virus strain. No signs of pronounced TBE infection were detected in the surviving animals. Conclusion Heterologous <b>prime-boost</b> vaccination protocols using recombinant VV and bacterial plasmids could be used for the development of flavivirus vaccines. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the clinical effectiveness of a <b>prime-boost</b> human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine regimen. A nonrandomized phase II <b>prime-boost</b> vaccine trial was conducted. Women with biopsy-proven anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia (AGIN) 3 were vaccinated with three doses of a recombinant fusion protein comprising HPV 16, E 6 /E 7 /L 2 (TA-CIN) followed by one dose of a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding HPV 16 and 18 E 6 /E 7 (TA-HPV). Clinical responses were evaluated by serial photographs, symptomatology, and biopsies before and after vaccination. Twenty-nine women were vaccinated; 27 with vulval intraepithelial neoplasia 3 and 2 with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3. Clinical responses were seen in five women (17 %), with one complete and five partial responses. Fifteen women (62 %) had symptomatic improvement. No serious adverse effects were recorded. This is the first trial of a <b>prime-boost</b> vaccination regimen using heterologous HPV vaccines (TA-CIN followed by TA-HPV) in the management of AGIN. Since the <b>prime-boost</b> approach in this cohort offered no significant advantages over single TA-HPV vaccination, there are no further studies planned using this protocol. Future studies are warranted to define responders to immunotherapy...|$|E
