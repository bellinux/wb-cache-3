500|$|A {{saprobic}} species, {{it grows}} generally in subalpine regions, fruiting on rotten wood and damp soil, {{and can also}} sometimes be found on ashes, wet leaves or bracket fungi. In Alaska {{it has been found}} growing on humus in the tundra. A six-year study of the succession of fungal flora appearing on freshly cut stumps of Poplar trees (Populus canadensis) showed that S.scutellata appeared roughly {{in the middle of the}} fungal succession (about 24 years after the tree had been cut), along with the species Ascocoryne sarcoides, Scutellinia cervorum, and Lasiosphaeria spermoides. When growing on wood, it is often obscured by surrounding moss. Though sometimes found alone, they typically fruit in groups, sometimes forming dense clusters on rotting wood or other <b>plant</b> <b>detritus.</b> Due to its small size, it is often overlooked, but mycologist Vera Evenson has observed that [...] "the discovery of the Eyelash Cup is always a great pleasure", due to [...] "the beauty of the eyelashes". Vera McKnight describes it as [...] "a most attractive little fungus", and claims it is easy to notice due to its bright colouration.|$|E

This [...] "barrier web" [...] may function as a kind of early-warning system for incoming prey or against spider-hunting predators, or as a shield against windblown leaves; it may also be remnants of the owner's previous web.

40|$|Nutrient inputs from {{productive}} marine environments {{have been}} shown to directly and indirectly subsidise primary producers and consumers in terrestrial ecosystems (e. g.

But does this theory hold true on islands surrounded by oligotrophic waters, which account for a significant proportion of the marine environment? The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the applicability of the spatial subsidisation hypotheses proposed by Polis and his co-authors to an oligotrophic system in south-western region of Western Australia. These aims were achieved by comparing soil and plant nutrients, and the nitrogen stable isotope signatures of soil, <b>plants,</b> <b>detritus</b> and invertebrates in areas with (islands) and without (mainland sites) inputs from seabirds.

The maximum consumption of higher <b>plants</b> <b>detritus</b> occurred {{at the beginning of}} August. Phytoplankton was consumed more intensively in spring during the rapid growth of diatoms (Stephanodiscus sp.) and from the middle to the end of June when cyanobacteria (Anabaena flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Planktothrix agardhii), dynophytes (Peridinium sp.) euglenas (Euglena proxima) and diatoms (Stephanodiscus sp.) were dominated in Bugach Reservoir. The dominant species of protozoa differed in their nutrition spectra: Holophrya sp. was feeding on diatoms in spring and bacteria in the middle of summer; Tintinidium sp. was consuming diatoms and cyanobacteria; Nassula picta was feeding on cyanobacteria...|$|R
