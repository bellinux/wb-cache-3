25|$|Dalton Transactions publishes {{articles}} on {{all aspects of}} the chemistry of inorganic and organometallic compounds, including bioinorganic, biological inorganic, and solid-state inorganic chemistry; the application of <b>physicochemical</b> techniques to the study of their structures, properties, and reactions, including kinetics and mechanisms; synthesis and characterisation of new inorganic materials; homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis; new or improved experimental techniques and syntheses.|$|E
25|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{is the use}} of a combination of cells, engineering and materials methods, and suitable biochemical and <b>physicochemical</b> factors to improve or replace biological tissues. Tissue engineering involves the use of a scaffold for the formation of new viable tissue for a medical purpose. While it was once categorized as a sub-field of biomaterials, having grown in scope and importance it can be considered as a field in its own.|$|E
25|$|The {{thylakoid}} membranes of the cyanobacteria are not differentiated into granum and stroma regions as {{observed in}} plants. They form stacks of parallel sheets {{close to the}} cytoplasmic membrane with a low packing density. The relatively large distance between the thylakoids provides space for the external light harvesting antennae, the phycobilisomes. This macrostructure, {{as in the case}} of higher plants, shows some flexibility during changes in the <b>physicochemical</b> environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{osmolality}} of {{the contrast}} agent was previously {{believed to be}} an important factor in contrast-induced nephropathy. Today it has become increasingly clear that other <b>physicochemical</b> properties play a greater role, such as viscosity. Attention should be paid to using contrast agents of low viscosity. Moreover, sufficient fluids should be supplied to limit fluid viscosity of urine. Modern iodinated contrast agents are non-ionic, the older ionic types caused more adverse effects, and their use has diminished.|$|E
25|$|MoRFPred and MoRFchibi SYSTEM are SVM based {{predictors}} which utilize multiple features including local sequence <b>physicochemical</b> properties, {{long stretches}} of disordered regions and conservation in their predictions. SLiMPred is neural network–based method for the de novo discovery of SLiMs from the protein sequence. Information about the structural context of the motif (predicted secondary structure, structural motifs, solvent accessibility, and disorder) are used during the predictive process. Importantly, no previous knowledge about the protein (i.e., no evolutionary or experimental information) is required.|$|E
25|$|In MHC class II, phagocytes such as macrophages and {{immature}} dendritic cells take up entities by phagocytosis into phagosomes—though B cells {{exhibit the}} more general endocytosis into endosomes—which fuse with lysosomes whose acidic enzymes cleave the uptaken protein into many different peptides. Via <b>physicochemical</b> dynamics in molecular interaction with the particular MHC class II variants borne by the host, encoded in the host's genome, a particular peptide exhibits immunodominance and loads onto MHC class II molecules. These are trafficked to and externalized on the cell surface.|$|E
25|$|Basophils are chiefly {{responsible}} for allergic and antigen response by releasing the chemical histamine causing the dilation of blood vessels. Because {{they are the}} rarest of the white blood cells (less than 0.5% of the total count) and share <b>physicochemical</b> properties with other blood cells, they are difficult to study. They can be recognized by several coarse, dark violet granules, giving them a blue hue. The nucleus is bi- or tri-lobed, {{but it is hard}} to see because of the number of coarse granules that hide it.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{the details}} of {{electronic}} structure are {{less important than the}} long-time phase space behavior of molecules. This is the case in conformational studies of proteins and protein-ligand binding thermodynamics. Classical approximations to the potential energy surface are used, as they are computationally less intensive than electronic calculations, to enable longer simulations of molecular dynamics. Furthermore, cheminformatics uses even more empirical (and computationally cheaper) methods like machine learning based on <b>physicochemical</b> properties. One typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict the binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target.|$|E
25|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} {{translated}} by {{the genetic code}} vary greatly by the {{physical and chemical properties}} of their side chains. However, these amino acids can be categorised into groups with similar <b>physicochemical</b> properties. Substituting an amino acid with another from the same category is {{more likely to have a}} smaller impact on the structure and function of a protein than replacement with an amino acid from a different category. Consequently, acceptance of point mutations depends heavily on the amino acid being replaced in the mutation, and the replacement amino acid. The PAM matrices are a mathematical tool that account for these varying rates of acceptance when evaluating the similarity of proteins during alignment.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{complexity}} and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations. Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science Lawrence M. Principe and William R. Newman, have interpreted the 'decknamen' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed <b>physicochemical</b> experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts. At {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as George Calian and Anna Marie Roos, who question the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of effort}} has been put into {{controlling}} cell selectivity. For example, {{attempts have been made}} to modify and optimize the <b>physicochemical</b> parameters of the peptides to control the selectivities, including net charge, helicity, hydrophobicity per residue (H), hydrophobic moment (μ) and the angle subtended by the positively charged polar helix face (Φ). Other mechanisms like the introduction of D-amino acids and fluorinated amino acids in the hydrophobic phase are believed to break the secondary structure and thus reduce hydrophobic interaction with mammalian cells. It has also been found that Pro→Nlys substitution in Pro-containing β-turn antimicrobial peptides was a promising strategy for the design of new small bacterial cell-selective antimicrobial peptides with intracellular mechanisms of action. It has been suggested that direct attachment of magainin to the substrate surface decreased nonspecific cell binding and led to improved detection limit for bacterial cells such as Salmonella and E. coli.|$|E

2500|$|Glucans are {{arranged}} in six-sided D-glucose rings connected linearly at varying carbon positions depending on the source, although most commonly β-glucans include a 1-3 glycosidic link in their backbone. Although technically β-glucans are chains of D-glucose polysaccharides linked by β-type glycosidic bonds, by convention not all β-D-glucose polysaccharides are categorized as β-glucans. Cellulose is not typically considered a β-glucan, as it is insoluble and does not exhibit the same <b>physicochemical</b> properties as other cereal or yeast β-glucans.|$|E

[...] Various type of notation have been developed to describe the abundance and change in the abundance of isotopes in these processes, and these are summarized below. [...] In most cases only the relative amounts of an isotope are of interest, the absolute concentration of any one isotope is of little importance.|$|E
2500|$|Although anecdotal {{information}} regarding the contributions of vibration in wine storage states that it contributes to the accelerated ageing of wine with adverse effects, this remains a research area with relatively little data. In a particular study, vibrations of different frequencies {{have been shown to}} have their own distinct effect on the chemistry of the wine. The study concludes, [...] "Vibration could be used to accelerate the ageing of wine, but in most cases, this may lead to negative effects on wine quality. Therefore, to store red wines with limited changes in <b>physicochemical</b> properties, vibrations should be minimized." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though it {{occurred}} less frequently than with balloon angioplasty or other techniques, stents nonetheless remained vulnerable to restenosis, caused almost exclusively by neointimal tissue growth. To address this issue, developers of drug-eluting stents used the devices {{themselves as a}} tool for delivering medication directly to the arterial wall. [...] While initial efforts were unsuccessful, the release (elution) of drugs with certain specific <b>physicochemical</b> properties from the stent was shown in 2001 to achieve high concentrations of the drug locally, directly at the target lesion, with minimal systemic side effects. [...] As currently used in clinical practice, [...] "drug-eluting" [...] stents refers to metal stents that elute a drug designed to limit the growth of neointimal scar tissue, thus reducing the likelihood of stent restenosis.|$|E
2500|$|More {{recently}} computational {{methods have}} been developed that can identify new Short Linear Motifs de novo. Interactome-based tools rely on identifying a set of proteins {{that are likely to}} share a common function, such as binding the same protein or being cleaved by the same peptidase. [...] Two examples of such software are DILIMOT and SLiMFinder. Anchor and α-MoRF-Pred use <b>physicochemical</b> properties to search for motif-like peptides in disordered regions (termed MoRFs, among others). ANCHOR identifies stretches of intrinsically disordered regions that cannot form favorable intrachain interactions to fold without additional stabilising energy contributed by a globular interaction partner. α-MoRF-Pred uses the inherent propensity of many SLiM to undergo a disorder to order transition upon binding to discover α-helical forming stretches within disordered regions.|$|E
2500|$|On a {{molecular}} level, amino acid residues at different locations of a protein may evolve non-independently {{because they have}} a direct <b>physicochemical</b> interaction, or indirectly by their interactions with a common substrate or through long-range interactions in the protein structure. [...] Conversely, the folded structure of a protein could potentially be inferred from the distribution of residue interactions. One of the earliest applications of ancestral reconstruction, to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein through residue contacts, was published by Shindyalov and colleagues. Phylogenies relating 67 different protein families were generated by a distance-based clustering method (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean, UPGMA), and ancestral sequences were reconstructed by parsimony. The authors reported a weak but significant tendency for co-evolving pairs of residues to be co-located in the known three-dimensional structure of the proteins.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "drug design" [...] is to {{some extent}} a misnomer. A more {{accurate}} term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, {{there are many other}} properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose <b>physicochemical</b> properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug. [...] Furthermore, in vitro experiments complemented with computation methods are increasingly used in early drug discovery to select compounds with more favorable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and toxicological profiles.|$|E
