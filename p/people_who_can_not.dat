Things seem very much the same in the business modelling world- there are process modellers and IT Architects. Traditionally the IT Architects called what they did "Enterprise Architecture", but in practice they only considered IT and data. However the demands of the business today require <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> understand, <b>not</b> just the IT landscape, but all the key elements of the business and how they interact. We need a new breed of modellers and architects (true Enterprise Architects) <b>who</b> <b>can</b> put the "E " back into Enterprise Architecture to fully support Enterprise BPM (EBPM). The Worlds of Process and IT Collide Process modellers tend to concentrate on modelling the flow of complex processes; the decision points, the branches and alternative paths. They will usually model the roles or departments that carry out the process and occasionally they will also consider the IT systems that support the processes, but rarely in any detail. On the other hand, IT Architects have tended to focus on IT systems landscape planning. That is on categorizing and transforming IT systems, the underlying technology (e. g. databases, operating systems, protocols, etc) and data. Their interest in data i...|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the first {{paragraph}} of the paper. Human self-knowledge continues to increase monumentally, {{as well as the}} accompanying consequences. One aspect of human life that is being conquered is reproduction. While it doesn 2 ̆ 7 t take a genius to procreate naturally, technologies to make artificial reproduction possible are becoming more popular. Men and women who cannot conceive children naturally are getting help, and this help is leading to many ethical dilemmas and scientific questions and dilemmas. By being swept away with the abilities to make children in a lab, there are forgotten children born into unfortunate situations that need stable families. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> want babies <b>can</b> <b>not</b> have them, and those that are having them do not want them. Put that way, adoption seems to be the best answer for couples who want children but cannot conceive their own. Adoption costs, risks, and the simple desire to bear one 2 ̆ 7 s own flesh and blood are constant road-blocks to adoption. Artificial reproduction, however, does not provide the answers to those road-blocks...|$|R
25|$|Kyaiktiyo Pagoda or Golden Rock {{has become}} a popular pilgrimage and also tourist attraction. At {{the peak of the}} pilgrimage season, during November to March, an {{atmosphere}} of devotion is witnessed at Kyaikhtiyo pagoda. As the golden rock gleams in different shades from dawn to dusk (the sight at dawn and at sunset are unique), pilgrims' chants reverberate in the precincts of the shrine. Lighting of candles, meditation and offerings to the Buddha continues throughout the night. Men cross over a bridge across an abyss to affix golden leaves (square in shape) {{on the face of the}} Golden Rock, in deep veneration. However, women are not allowed to touch the rock so cannot cross the bridge. Pilgrims visit the pagoda, from all regions of Myanmar; a few foreign tourists also visit the pagoda. Even disabled persons who are staunch devotees of Buddha visit the pagoda, walking up the track on crutches. Old <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> climb, are carried on stretchers by porters to the Pagoda to offer prayers to Buddha. The Full Moon day of Tabaung in March, is a special occasion for pilgrims who visit the shrine. On this day, the platform of the pagoda is lighted with ninety thousand candles as reverential offering to the Lord Buddha. The devotees visiting the pagoda also offer fruits, food and incense to the Buddha.|$|E

These aids, mobitex, atlas and cellular telephone/radio help the driver to perform his/her assignments, i. e. transport people. The study showed that the aids are not enough efficient, which means that the driver needs to get help from the traffic control, which can take time. Furthermore the study showed that the taxi driver <b>can</b> <b>not</b> get information when he/she wants to continue his/her work, the mobitex storage capacity is insufficient and the driver must make place for the mobitex.

The statement details eight key priorities for Member States as they negotiate the outcome document for June’s General Assembly meeting. “Harm reduction is neither a matter of rhetoric, nor of politics. It is evidence-based and when implemented to scale, reduces HIV transmission among <b>people</b> <b>who</b> inject drugs,” says Bronwyn Myers, Reference Group Secretariat and Specialist Scientist at the Medical Research Council. The statement issued by the Reference Group asks governments to commit to scaling-up evidence-based interventions to addressing HIV among <b>people</b> <b>who</b> inject drugs. It details a rights-based public health approach to achieving universal access, such as providing anti-retroviral treatment to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are living with HIV, and it calls for countries to revise punitive drug and law enforcement policies that can undermine the AIDS response and human rights. “There is still a misconception that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> use drugs <b>can</b> <b>not</b> adhere to HIV treatment regimens, but research shows that they adhere well, especially if HIV treatment is offered in conjunction with drug treatment,” said Steffanie Strathdee, Associate Dean of Global Health at UC San Diego {{and a member of}} the Reference Group. “Denying drug users life-saving HIV treatments and drug treatment violates their right to health and harms the community, since it is now known that HIV treatment reduces viral load and can prevent HIV transmission,” Dr Strathdee said...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of why tourists travel is a fundamental one in tourism that speaks to both how we define tourism as a phenomenon for study and how we build our understanding of its nature, processes, consequences and future. The debate and discussion covered in these three papers take a critical approach to this question but from three very different perspectives. Moscardo begins by providing a selective review {{of some of the}} key papers that have addressed this question beginning with MacCannell's (1976) The Tourist and finishing with discussions of the links between tourism consumption and identity (Bond and Falk 2012), the new mobilities paradigm (Cresswell 2010) and research into <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> but do <b>not</b> travel (McKercher 2009). Along the way she argues that despite a substantial growth in tourism as a research field in the 40 years since MacCannell's (1976) seminal work, very little progress has actually been made in addressing this fundamental question. Dann adds a number of significant references to the discussion and suggests a wider range of possible answers can and should be considered. He disagrees with taking a psychological needs approach to the {{question of}} why tourists travel, but concurs with the critique of the way tourism researchers have addressed this question. McKercher argues for a simpler answer, tourism is essentially a selfish pursuit and provides a variety of evidence to support this stance. The overall debate provides important reviews of critical papers in this field, highlights the challenges that exist in addressing this question, offers some ideas for meeting these challenges, and reaffirms the importance of returning to fundamental questions in tourism research...|$|R
