5|$|Turunen {{enrolled}} in 2000 at the German music university Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe {{to gain a}} <b>professional</b> <b>qualification</b> as a soloist with further specialization in art song. In addition to the good reputation of the university, Turunen chose to go to Karlsruhe because some people at the Finnish university did not take her seriously as a classical singer due to her commitment in a metal band. While there, she recorded vocals for Nightwish's 2002 album Century Child and for Beto Vázquez Infinity. As with the other albums, Holopainen wrote the pieces and sent Turunen the lyrics and a demo recording of the prerecorded instrumental tracks by mail. Using the demo, Turunen designed her vocal lines and the choral passages.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to analyse the system of recognition of <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications</b> within the EU {{as a tool to}} access and pursue a certain profession. It is an important condition for the realization of one of the fundamental EU freedoms, which is free movement of labour. Regardless of the adoption of the <b>Professional</b> <b>Qualifications</b> Directive in 2005, the area of recognition of <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications</b> has quite a long history in the EU. From a legal point of view this legislation is important because it provides the functionality of the free movement of labour. Mobility of qualified professionals in the European Union is still at a relatively low level. To some extent, these skills shortages could be filled by people with <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications</b> obtained outside the EU, who however currently face major problems in having their qualifications recognized. To take full advantage of the freedom of movement, their qualifications must be easily recognized in other Member States. It is therefore essential that the <b>Professional</b> <b>Qualifications</b> Directive sets out clear and simple rules for the recognition of <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications.</b> Millions of <b>professionals</b> in Europe benefit from these rules nowadays. It is estimated that the system of automatic recognition on the basis of [...] ...|$|R
5|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{rational}} nexus test looks at whether the basis for differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those who are grouped together from those left outside the group. To satisfy the second stage, {{there must be a}} discernible basis of classification. All persons being discriminated against by a law must share a common identifying mark that is not borne by those not discriminated against. Examples of such features include gender, age, race, religion, seniority of <b>professional</b> <b>qualification</b> and area of residence. Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible differentia is Singapore citizenship. Singling out a person or object with characteristics not peculiar to itself, but which may conceivably be found in other persons or objects, does not constitute classification. If there is no consistent means of identifying the persons treated differently, the differentiation is arbitrary and the law is invalid. If there is an intelligible differentia, the differentiation is not arbitrary in this sense and it is necessary to proceed to the third stage.|$|E
