5000|$|Booth’s artistic passion started {{early on}} {{when he was just}} a child. Completely self-taught, he always found comfort in {{painting}} darker and more monstrous subject matter.  Through his own experimentation and personal growth, Booth has developed a technical style of his own. His utilization of a multi-layer approach, {{similar to that of the}} early Flemish painters, allows him to achieve a level of depth and texture that results in a visually stunning, realistic <b>painting.</b> <b>Booth</b> can be best described as a dark surrealist and has exhibited both domestically and internationally.|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: For {{ensuring}} about {{proper performance}} of air-purifying respirators in providing protection against workplace contaminants, {{it is necessary}} to change the respirator cartridges before the end of their service life. The aim of this study was determination of service life of organic vapor cartridges using a simple and practical method in a spray <b>painting</b> <b>booth</b> of a car manufacturing industry.   Methods: NIOSH MultiVapor software was used for estimating service life of respirator cartridges based on workplace conditions and cartridge specifications. Efficiency of determined service life was investigated using an apparatus for field testing of cartridges in the workplace.   Results: The results showed that existing schedule for changing the respirator cartridges is not effective and no longer provide adequate protection for sprayers against organic contaminants while working in a <b>painting</b> <b>booth.</b> It is necessary to change the cartridges before their estimated service life (every 4 hours).   Conclusion: NIOSH MultiVapor has acceptable efficiency for determining respirator cartridges service life and {{could be used as a}} simple and practical method in the workplace. Moreover, Service life estimated by this software was confirmed by cartridge field test apparatus...|$|E

Rate of death due to occupational accidents {{in developing countries}} in some cases is 4 times to developed industrial countries. To control accidents & resultant damages, identification of potential agents causing accidents in  necessary. One of the modern methods for identification these agents is ETBA. This method is  based on energy model. This model present energy as potential agent causing accident & according  to this, propose a set of control strategies that are in different levels of priority due to their  effectiveness   Methods   This research is a case study that {{is a kind of}} qualitative researches and it had done in an  automobile factory's paint shop. First in this study ETBA method used to identify hazards, then  risks were analysed and in the last phase, approaches were proposed for decrease level of   unacceptable risks.   Results   This study determined that in this field, two category of hazards are in first priority for   performing control measures:  First category contains chemical hazards that might lead to catastrophic consequences like fire &  cancer. Highest risk portion o this paint shop is manually spray <b>painting</b> <b>booth</b> and spray painting  stations that is placed in repair lines.   Second category contains hazards that causes accidents repeatedly the highest risk portions are stations where ground conveyor moves car bodies (pain and repair lines).   Conclusion   Because of these two category of hazards are concentrated in paint and repair lines, these lines should be in first priority for control hazards...|$|E

40|$|TVS Motor Company is {{the third}} largest {{manufacturer}} of two-wheelers in India {{and one of the}} top ten manufacturers in the world. The company manufactures 1. 5 million two-wheelers for both its domestic and overseas requirements. The company's manufacturing process involves painting of plastic, metal and aluminium components to enhance their appearance and performance properties. The company currently uses a conventional post painting process for its moulded plastic panels. However the conventional post painting process causes a huge impact on the environment through flue gas emissions from baking ovens, solvent emission from <b>paint</b> <b>booths</b> and ovens, sludge generation from <b>paint</b> <b>booths</b> and wastewater generation from <b>paint</b> <b>booths</b> and pretreatment processes. The volumes of waste and cost for part attached to the painting process for TVS Motor Company are detailed in this paper Paint shop replacement technologies in relation to current in-mould decoration technologies such as pigmented plastics, in-mould film, co-injection moulding and in-mould spray painting (INSPIRE) are considered. Based on current specifications and requirements for painted plastic components, INSPIRE is found to be the most advantageous paint shop replacement technology for current TVS Motor Company Ltd production as it uses a thermoset, matching current specifications.

50|$|<b>Paint</b> spray <b>booths</b> for {{vehicles}} are typically 100-300 {{feet in length}} and usually contain many robotic and manual spray zones. The temperature and humidity are rigorously controlled in these systems. As items are <b>painted</b> in these <b>booths,</b> {{a certain amount of}} paint does not contact the article being painted and forms a fine mist of paint in the air space surrounding the article. This paint must be removed from the air. To accomplish this, the contaminated air is pulled through the <b>paint</b> spray <b>booth</b> by exhaust fans. A curtain of circulating water is maintained across the path of the air {{in such a way that}} the air must pass through the water curtain to reach the exhaust fans. As the air passes through the water curtain, the paint mist is “scrubbed” from the air and carried to a sump basin (sludge pit), usually located below the <b>paint</b> spray <b>booth.</b> In this area, the paint particles are separated from the water so that the water may be recycled and the paint particles disposed of as paint sludge. The paint detackifiers commonly added to these systems are either melamine-formaldehyde based, based upon acrylic acid chemistry, or chitosan.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Hexavalent chromium-based primers and paints, {{which are}} used widely in the {{aerospace}} industry as anti-corrosive coatings, pose a health risk to painters and other workers exposed to the paints and primers. Hexavalent chromium has been established as a carcinogen associated with cancers of the lung and nasal passages. Moreover, hexavalent chromium is associated with irritant and allergic contact dermatitis and gastrointestinal disorders. Previous studies have shown evidence of airborne overexposure to painters when utilizing traditional spray <b>paint</b> <b>booth</b> ventilation. The evaluation of work practices, specifically worker orientation in the spray <b>paint</b> <b>booth</b> and maintaining the proper spraying distance, may assist with further lowering the exposure to hexavalent chromium and complying with occupational exposure limits. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the effects of worker orientation within the spray <b>paint</b> <b>booth</b> and spraying distance (distance from the spray paint nozzle to the part being coated) in reducing paint aerosol exposures as a surrogate for hexavalent chromium exposure. Four orientations with respect to the flow of air into the booth were evaluated: 0 o, 45 o, 90 o, and 180 o. Three spray distances were evaluated: 3, 6, and 12 inches. Paint aerosol concentrations were measured using a Thermo Scientific PDR 1500 real-time aerosol monitor. Results showed an association between orientation and aerosol concentrations with the geometric mean concentration increasing as orientation moved from 0 o (directly upwind) to 180 o (directly downwind) : 0 o (0. 08 µg/m 3 /gram), 45 o (0. 47 µg/m 3 /gram), 90 o (2. 69 µg/m 3 /gram), and 180 o (14. 0 µg/m 3 /gram). Changing the spray distance did not reveal an association with aerosol exposure concentrations. Worker orientations that place the painter upwind of the target parts showed decreased paint aerosol exposures and potentially hexavalent chromium exposures. While additional research is required to establish the association between aerosol paint and hexavalent chromium exposures, this research suggests that optimizing spray painter work practices may aid in reducing hexavalent chromium exposures resulting from hexavalent chromium based paints and primers...|$|R
