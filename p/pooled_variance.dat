30|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on image quality {{assessment}} (IQA) in sensor networks and propose a novel method named gradient magnitude and <b>variance</b> <b>pooling</b> (GMVP). The proposed GMVP follows a two-step framework. In this first step, we utilize gradient magnitude to compute the local quality, which is efficient and responsive to degeneration when the images are transmitted by sensor networks. In the second step, we propose a weighted <b>pooling</b> operation, i.e., <b>variance</b> <b>pooling,</b> which explicitly considers the importance of different local regions. The <b>variance</b> <b>pooling</b> operation assigns different weights to local quality map according to the variance of local regions. The proposed GMVP is verified on two challenging IQA databases (CSIQ and TID 2008 databases), and the results demonstrate that the proposed GMVP achieves better results than the state-of-the-art methods in sensor networks.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel FR-IQA model named {{gradient}} magnitude and <b>variance</b> <b>pooling</b> (GMVP) for testing sensor networks. First, we utilize gradient magnitude, i.e., Sobel filter, {{to compute the}} local quality, which is responsive to artifacts introduced by compression, blur or additive noise, etc. In addition, natural images usually have diverse local structures which reflects the degree of importance of different local regions. Based on the consideration, we propose a novel <b>pooling</b> operation, i.e., <b>variance</b> <b>pooling,</b> which assigns different weights according to the variance of local regions.

First, using the post-fire data from each vegetation type, we generated models of relative abundance with site, species, and burn status as fixed factors. We conducted contrast tests to determine whether relative abundance of a species at the impact plots differed from that at the reference plots. For this, we <b>pooled</b> <b>variances</b> across species and sample plots within each vegetation type. Second, for the impact and reference plots where we had both pre-fire and post-fire data (Rancho Jamul: coastal sage scrub and grassland), we subtracted the pre-fire capture rate from the post-fire capture rate for each species at each plot to produce a “net change after fire” statistic. We then ran a two-way ANOVA with species and burn status (reference vs. impact) as fixed factors. We used the differences of least squares means to test whether the change in rodent abundance at the impact plots differed from the change in abundance at the reference plots.|$|R

Factors such as different laboratories, analysts, instruments, columns, days and batches were examined. The interpretation methods described in the literature were found to cause problems. In these methods the variances of the examined factors are estimated from the calculated mean square values and from the equation for the expected mean squares.

40|$|Introduction We define <b>pooled</b> <b>{{variance}}</b> as {{the mean}} variance {{at some time}} scale,, within a longer term series, which is the combination of contributions {{from a variety of}} sources, some instrumental/statistical in origin, and others relating to astrophysical processes.

At a given time scale, the effects from processes at all shorter time scales is cumulative; e. g., at the longest time scale we could expect to find several contributors, i. e. : oe P (= yrs) = oe instr + oe rot + oe ARevol + oe cycle. A representative <b>pooled</b> <b>variance</b> diagram (PVD) appears in Fig. 1 for the star HD 114710 (fi Comae, G 0 V).

It examines the generational differences between Generation-X (born between 1960 - 1980) and Generation-Y (born between 1980 - 2000) professionals working in the software industry. The study attempts to explore whether there are generational differences in work commitment between the two age cohorts or it’s only a myth. A total of 250 respondents belonging to Software industries were administered a questionnaire. 125 respondents were typically X-Generation and 125 were Y- Generation employees. 50 % of the respondents in both the cases were males and 50 % {{of the respondents were}} females. The study examined generational differences for the five types of work commitment-work involvement, job involvement, work group commitment, organizational commitment and professional commitment. Organizational commitment and professional commitment in turn had three components each- affective commitment, continuance commitment and normative commitment. Thus, a total of nine factors was examined for the study. The data was analyzed using two-tailed t-tests (<b>pooled</b> <b>variances</b> method). The results reveal that the two generations differed significantly only on three of the nine factors examined. Thus, the generations are more homogenous than heterogeneous in their work values and beliefs. This finding has serious implications for research and practice.

Where trial treatment is delivered by a person, nesting of patients within care providers leads to clustering that may interact with, or be limited to, {{one or more of}} the arms. Assuming a common standardising variance is less tenable and options for scaling the mean difference become numerous. Metrics suggested for cluster-randomised trials are within, between and total variances and for unequal variances, the control arm or <b>pooled</b> <b>variances.</b> We consider summary measures and individual-patient-data methods for meta-analysing standardised mean differences from trials with two-level nested clustering, relaxing independence and common variance assumptions, allowing sample sizes to differ across arms. A general metric is proposed with comparable interpretation across designs. The relationship between the method of standardisation and choice of model is explored, allowing for bias in the estimator and imprecision in the standardising metric. A meta-analysis of trials of counselling in primary care motivated this work. Assuming equal clustering effects across trials, the proposed random-effects meta-analysis model gave a pooled standardised mean difference of − 0. 27 (95 % CI − 0. 45 to − 0. 08) using summary measures and − 0. 26 (95 % CI − 0. 45 to − 0. 09) with the individual-patient-data.
