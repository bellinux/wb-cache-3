40|$|The Miura-ori pattern {{possesses}} intriguing mechanical features, namely, the one Degree Of Freedom mobility, auxetic in-plane {{behavior and}} energy absorption capability, for {{applications such as}} core to sandwich structure, shock absorber, airless tire, etc. To realize the folding mechanism of Miura-ori, in this paper a Miura-ori <b>patterned</b> <b>sheet</b> was made from copolymer Elvaloy by compression molding, and then its deformation behavior was investigated experimentally and by using finite element analysis. The intrinsic mechanical properties of Elvaloy were obtained by tensile and four-point-bending tests, respectively, and subsequently used in the finite element (FE) simulation. For utilizing the sheet in all the principal directions, three types of tests were conducted: out-of-plane compression, three-point-bending and in-plane compressions. FE simulations using Abaqus/Explicit were carried out to analyze the deformations of the <b>patterned</b> <b>sheet</b> under the same loading as that in the tests. The simulation results were then compared with the tests, which show good agreements. Based on the simulation results, the deformation patterns of the <b>patterned</b> <b>sheet</b> under different loading conditions were examined, {{as well as the}} energy absorption capacity...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that 100 % light absorption {{can take place}} in a single <b>patterned</b> <b>sheet</b> of doped graphene. General analysis shows that a planar array of small lossy particles exhibits full absorption under critical-coupling conditions provided the cross section of each individual particle is comparable to the area of the lattice unit-cell. Specifically, arrays of doped graphene nanodisks display full absorption when supported on a substrate under total internal reflection, and also when lying on a dielectric layer coating a metal. Our results are relevant for infrared light detectors and sources, which can be made tunable via electrostatic doping of graphene. Comment: 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|The shape {{transformation}} of some biological systems inspires scientists to create sophisticated structures at the nano- and macro-scales. However, {{to be useful}} in engineering, the mechanics of governing such a spontaneous, parallel and large deformation must be well understood. In this study, a kirigami approach is used to fold a bilayer planar sheet featuring a specific pattern into a buckliball under a certain thermal stimulus. Importantly, this prescribed spherical object can retract into a much smaller sphere due to constructive buckling caused by radially inward displacement. By minimizing the potential strain energy, we obtain a critical temperature, below which the <b>patterned</b> <b>sheet</b> exhibits identical principal curvatures everywhere in the self-folding procedure and above which buckling occurs. The applicability of the theoretical analysis to the self-folding of sheets with a diversity of patterns is verified by the finite element method...|$|R

40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are increasingly used in {{sheet metal stamping}} in the automotive industry. In comparison with conventional steels, advanced {{high strength}} steel (AHSS) stampings produce higher contact pressures at the interface between draw die and sheet metal blank, resulting in more severe wear conditions, particularly at the draw die radius. The prediction of tool wear <b>patterns</b> for <b>sheet</b> metal stamping die is a highly challenging task as there are many control parameters involved in the production. This paper presents a numerical simulation methodology to analyse the influences of various control parameters on tool wear <b>patterns</b> of a <b>sheet</b> metal stamping die with different die radius arc profiles.

40|$|International audienceRegulated {{deformations}} of epithelial {{sheets are}} frequently foreshadowed by patterning of their mechanical properties. The connection between patterns of cell properties and the emerging tissue deformations is studied in multiple experimental systems, {{but the general}} principles remain poorly understood. For instance, it is in general unclear what determines {{the direction in which}} the <b>patterned</b> <b>sheet</b> is going to bend and whether the resulting shape transformation will be discontinuous or smooth. Here these questions are explored computationally, using vertex models of epithelial shells assembled from prism-like cells. In response to rings and patches of apical cell contractility, model epithelia smoothly deform into invaginated or evaginated shapes similar to those observed in embryos and tissue organoids. Most of the observed effects can be captured by a simpler model with polygonal cells, modified to include the effects of the apicobasal polarity and natural curvature of epithelia. Our models can be readily extended to include the effects of multiple constraints and used to describe a wide range of morphogenetic processes...|$|R

50|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of MED and OctaMED {{in comparison to}} other music trackers on the Amiga was that MED and OctaMED were chiefly used by musicians to create stand-alone works, rather than by game or demo musicians to make tunes that play {{in the context of}} a computer game or demo. Firstly, this is because the MED and OctaMED music replay routine is simply too slow to be used in a game or demo. Most trackers are optimised for speed of replay code, taking less than 3% of CPU time. MED took roughly 20% of CPU time. Secondly, and this is also one of the reasons why MED draws more CPU power, the MED format allowed a greater degree of complexity in music construction, with arbitrary length of <b>pattern</b> <b>sheets,</b> sections and blocks rather than a simple pattern-list, and a greater number of effects for the sound. This additional complexity was welcomed by music composers, who preferred more sophisticated structure to their compositions and did not see it as a simple list of timed note-presses.|$|R

40|$|Interest in {{utilizing}} {{aluminum alloys}} in automobiles {{has increased in}} recent years {{as a result of the}} desire to lower automobile weight and, consequently, increase fuel economy. While aluminum alloy use in cast parts has increased, outer body panel applications are still being investigated. The industry is interested in improving the formability of these sheet alloys by a combination of alloy design and processing. A different avenue of improving the formability of these alloys may be through <b>patterning</b> of the <b>sheet</b> surface. Surface <b>patterns</b> hold the lubricant during the forming process, with a resulting decrease in the sheet-die surface contact. While it has been speculated that an optimum surface pattern would consist of discrete cavities, detailed investigation into the reduction of forming friction by utilizing discrete patterns is lacking. A series of discrete patterns were investigated to determine the dependence of the forming friction of automotive aluminum alloys on pattern lubricant carrying capacity and on material strength. Automotive aluminum alloys used in outer body panel applications were rolled on experimental rolls that had been prepared with a variety of discrete patterns. All patterns for each alloy were characterized before and after testing both optically and, to determine pattern lubricant capacity, using three dimensional laser profilometry. A draw bead simulation (DBS) friction tester was designed and fabricated to determine the forming friction of the <b>patterned</b> <b>sheets.</b> Tensile testing and frictionless DBS testing were performed to ascertain the material properties of each sheet. The most striking result of this work was the inversely linear dependence of forming friction on the lubricant carrying capacity of the discrete patterns...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work reported in {{this paper is to}} create multi-scale and hierarchical surface structures using a simple imprinting process. The hierarchical structures can be fabricated with only simple patterned molds by proposed multi-step imprinting process, instead of using a high cost hierarchical-patterned mold. In the proposed process, the starting material is a layered sheet material. The layered sheet is pressed by a mold with a finer pattern, and subsequently pressed by a mold with a rougher pattern. A pure polymer sheet is employed as the upper layer, which will be removed during heating processes as a sacrificed layer, while the lower layer is a compound material of polymer and ceramic powder. After heating process, ceramic compact is sintered and formed a full-dense <b>patterned</b> <b>sheet.</b> By the proposed multi-step imprinting process with a layered material, ceramic sheets with micro hierarchical pattern can be fabricated with low cost.
