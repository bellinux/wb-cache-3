40|$|Abstract—Bendability is {{constrained}} by maximum top roller load imparting {{capacity of the}} machine. Maximum load is encountered during the edge pre-bending stage of roller bending. Capacity of 3 -roller <b>plate</b> <b>bending</b> <b>machine</b> is specified by maximum thickness and minimum shell diameter combinations that can be pre-bend for given plate material of maximum width. Commercially available plate width or width of the plate that can be accommodated on machine decides the maximum rolling width. Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) provide the machine capacity chart based on reference material considering perfectly plastic material model. Reported work shows the bendability analysis of heavy duty 3 -roller <b>plate</b> <b>bending</b> <b>machine.</b> The input variables for the industry are plate thickness, shell diameter and material property parameters, as it is fixed by the design. Analytical models of equivalent thickness, equivalent width and maximum width based on power law material model were derived to study the bendability. Equation of maximum width provides bendability for designed configuration i. e. material property, shell diameter and thickness combinations within the machine limitations. Equivalent thicknesses based on perfectly plastic and power law material model were compared for four different materials grades of C-Mn steel in order to predict the bend-ability. Effect of top roller offset on the bendability at maximum top roller load imparting capacity is reported.

Triangular <b>plate</b> <b>bending</b> elements can at present only be formed by using a numeric algorithm. The explicit version of a stiffness matrix is not only far more simple to program in a computer routine but its execution (as will be shown) requires approximately one twelfth {{of the time of}} a numeric version.

In the present investigation only triangular elements with a node on each corner and three degrees of freedom at each node will be considered.

Both frequency independent and frequency dependent damping of viscoelastic materials are considered. An iterative complex eigensolver is used to compute the natural frequencies and model loss factors. Several bench mark problems are solved using these new multi-layer plate elements. As the <b>plate</b> <b>bending</b> elements previously developed on the basis of Kirchhoff's theory are inadequate for thick plate analysis, several quadrilateral Mindlin <b>plate</b> <b>bending</b> elements are developed to study the behaviour of Mindlin <b>plates.</b> The <b>plate</b> <b>bending</b> elements based on Mindlin theory require shear correction factors in their formulations.

Parametric effects of plate aspect ratio, length to thickness ratio, degree of orthotropy, number of layers and lamination scheme on the natural frequencies (free vibration), model loss factors (damping) and dynamic (transient) responses have been shown. The results presented in this investigation could be useful in better understanding the behaviour of sandwich laminates under dynamic conditions and potentially beneficial for designers of sandwich structures...|$|R
