5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which players take {{the role of an}} unnamed man who explores the post-apocalyptic remains of Tokyo. Like its predecessor Megami Tensei II has players navigate dungeon environments in first-person, but between dungeons they also navigate an overworld from an overhead perspective. During their journey, the protagonist's party can visit shops and towns to gain additional story information and to purchase items using in-game currency. As they progress through the story, the protagonist is presented with morality-based dialogue options which influence how <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> him and ultimately determine which ending is received.|$|E

25|$|Fear is {{affected}} by cultural and historical context. For example, in the early 20th century, many Americans feared polio, a disease {{that can lead to}} paralysis. There are consistent cross-cultural differences in how <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> fear. Display rules affect how likely people are to show the facial expression of fear and other emotions.|$|E

25|$|<b>People</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> what {{is present}} – Despite {{knowing that the}} media merely provide a {{symbolic}} version of the world, people still tend to respond to what the media appears to be {{as if it were}} real and immediately present. For the most part, people are more concerned with the interpretation of cues or messages they receive, rather than trying to determine the original intention of the message's creators.|$|E
25|$|Only {{a subset}} of <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> {{androgen}} signaling blocking drugs and certain cells with characteristics resembling stem cells remain unaffected. Therefore, the desire to improve outcome of people with CRPC {{has resulted in the}} claims of increasing doses further or combination therapy with synergistic androgen signaling blocking agents. But even these combination will not affect stem-like cells that do not exhibit androgen signaling. It is possible that for further advances, a combination of androgen signaling blocking agent with stem-like cell directed differentiation therapy drug would prove ideal.|$|E
25|$|A Post-traumatic stress {{spectrum}} or {{trauma and}} loss spectrum. Work {{in this area}} has sought {{to go beyond the}} DSM category and consider in more detail a spectrum of severity of symptoms (rather than just presence or absence for diagnostic purposes), as well as a spectrum in terms {{of the nature of the}} stressor (e.g. the traumatic incident) and a spectrum of how <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> trauma. This identifies a significant amount of symptoms and impairment below threshold for DSM diagnosis but nevertheless important, and potentially also present in other disorders a person might be diagnosed with.|$|E

25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus {{and treatment of}} metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the use of}} {{the yellow}} crystal, players can {{converse}} with Previously Living Sentient Beings or [...] "PLSBs". Conversations provide players with puzzle information, strategies for defeating monsters, and story background. Rather than relying on a branching tree of conversation options, players type keywords into a dialogue box. When a certain keyword (typically found in a previous statement by the dead person in question) is entered, the dead person will give a response. The manual gives a starting point by mentioning that all dead <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> [...] "name" [...] and [...] "death", by giving their name and describing how they died, respectively.|$|E

500|$|... "Tea Leaves" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and {{directed}} by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not {{to go in there and}} muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to,</b> and that I love." [...] Although the third episode of the season, it was actually the first episode produced for season, prior to the two-part season premiere, [...] "A Little Kiss".|$|E
500|$|Later in 2004, McAdams starred {{opposite}} fellow Canadian Ryan Gosling in {{the romantic}} drama The Notebook, based on Nicholas Sparks' {{novel of the}} same name. She played Allie Hamilton, a wealthy southern belle who has a forbidden love affair with Gosling's poor labourer, Noah Calhoun. McAdams spent time in Charleston, South Carolina prior to filming to familiarize herself with the southern accent, and took ballet and etiquette classes. Filming took place from late 2002 to early 2003. Although McAdams and Gosling became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked the film's director Nick Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was being uncooperative. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was won over by the [...] "beauty and clarity" [...] of McAdams's performance. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune declared her [...] "a real discovery" [...] who [...] "infuses young Allie with that radiant, breathlessly winning ingénue grace and charm that breaks hearts". [...] The film grossed over $115million worldwide. McAdams won an MTV Movie Award and four Teen Choice Awards. Entertainment Weekly {{has said that the}} movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss while the Los Angeles Times has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses. The Notebook has appeared on many Most Romantic Movies lists. [...] "I'm so grateful to have a film that <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> in that way", McAdams told Elle in 2011. [...] "It was a big deal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Research {{has shown}} that high-need for {{cognition}} consumers prefer advertising that features open-ended comparative advertising which allows consumers to decide which brand is best. [...] Need for cognition has also offered insights into how <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> alternative web site designs. Martin, Sherrard and Wentzel (2005) demonstrate that high-need for cognition people prefer web sites with high verbal complexity (more in-depth information) and low visual complexity (static images rather than animations).|$|E

2500|$|The {{formation}} of the Royal Commission was announced in by Viscount Althorp in the House of Commons on February 1, 1832; the body initially consisted of 7 commissioners and 16 assistant commissioners. The central board was expanded to 9 commissioners in 1833. [...] The assistant commissioners were to be sent out to the country {{to collect data on}} poverty by visiting parishes and by having <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> questionnaires, while the central board were to digest the information into a report.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{academic}} Fran Markowitz {{there is a}} number of [...] "administrative apparatuses and public pressures that push people who might prefer to identify as flexible, multiply constituted hybrids or {{with one of the}} now unnamed minority groups into one of the three Bosniac-Croat-Serb constituent nations". These include respondents being encouraged by census interviewers to identity as belonging to one of the three constituent peoples. Her analysis of marriage registration data shows, for instance, that 67 per cent of people marrying in 2003 identified as Bosniak or Muslim, which is significantly lower than the 79.6 per cent census figure from 2002 (unlike the census, where <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> an interviewer, applicants to the marriage registry fill in the form themselves).|$|E
2500|$|Stress may be {{increased}} {{when a person is}} living in a family situation, with increased pressures. Social stresses, due to inadequate finances or other such problems in a family may further increase tensions. Violence is not always caused by stress, but may be one way that some <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> stress. Families and couples in poverty {{may be more likely to}} experience domestic violence, due to increased stress and conflicts about finances and other aspects. Some speculate that poverty may hinder a man's ability to live up to his idea of [...] "successful manhood", thus he fears losing honor and respect. Theory suggests that when he is unable to economically support his wife, and maintain control, he may turn to misogyny, substance abuse, and crime as ways to express masculinity.|$|E

2500|$|Like Facebook and Twitter, Pinterest now lets {{marketers}} {{access the}} data collected on its users. Technology providers including Salesforce.com, Hootsuite, Spredfast, Percolate, Piqora, Curalate, and Tailwind are presently the only companies granted access to the data. By granting access to users' data, Pinterest lets marketers investigate how <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> products. If a product has {{a high number of}} repins, this generally tells the producer of the product that it is well liked by many members of the Pinterest community. Now that Pinterest lets marketers access the data, companies can view user comments on the product to learn how people like or dislike it. A 2013 study on Pinterest practices found that [...] "repinning" [...] was the most popular action by users, followed by likes, and lastly, commenting. According to Salesforce.com, Pinterest has become a key part of corporate digital marketing strategies.|$|E
2500|$|Growing up, Kripke {{connected}} to television shows that had signature cars, such as The Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider. This {{prompted him to}} include one in Supernatural. [...] "We say it's a modern American Western— two gunslingers who ride into town, fight the bad guys, kiss the girl and ride out into the sunset again. And we were always talking {{from the very beginning}} that if you're going to have cowboys, they need a trusty horse." [...] He originally intended for the car to be a '65 Mustang, but his neighbor convinced him to change it to a '67 Impala, since [...] "you can put a body in the trunk" [...] and because [...] "you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the lights, they lock their doors." [...] Kripke has commented, [...] "It's a Rottweiler of a car, and I think it adds authenticity for fans of automobiles because of that, because it's not a pretty ride. It's an aggressive, muscular car, and I think that's what <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to,</b> and why it fits so well into the tone of our show." ...|$|E
2500|$|Preventative {{medicines}} include gabapentin (Neurontin), tizanidine (Zanaflex), fluoxetine (Prozac), amitriptyline (Elavil), and topiramate (Topamax). In testing, gabapentin {{was found}} {{to reduce the number}} of headache days a month by 9.1%. Tizanidine {{was found to}} decrease the average frequency of headaches per week, the headache intensity, and the mean headache duration. Through studies, Fluoxetine resulted in better mood ratings and [...] "significant increases in headache-free days". Despite being associated with depression, antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, have been found to effectively treat [...] "near-daily headaches" [...] and numerous chronic pain conditions as well as improving mood and sleep—two possible triggers for chronic headache sufferers. One study found that the headache frequency over a 28-day period lowered for chronic headache patients on topiramate. Another medication to prevent headaches is botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA or BOTOX), which is given by injection instead of being taken orally. In a clinical study of botulinum toxin type A, patients participating in the 9-month treatment period with three treatments experienced headache frequency decreases up to 50%. As with all medications, the preventative medications may have side effects. Since different <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> drugs differently, chronic headache sufferers may have to go through a [...] "trial-and-error" [...] period to find the right medications. The previously mentioned medicines can improve headaches, but physicians recommend multiple forms of treatments.|$|E
