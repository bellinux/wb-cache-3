The active ingredient belongs to the chemical class of sulfonly-amino-carbonyl-triazolinones (SACT) and acts as an inhibitor of the ALS-enzyme. The compound offers cross spectrum activity against grasses and broadleaf weeds and can be applied at the pre-emergence and the post-emergence timing.

The herbicide had a flat dose-response curve throughout the investigations. Wheat and barley showed greater tolerance to post-emergence than to <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>applications.</b> <b>Pre-emergence</b> <b>applications</b> of triasulfuron reduced tiller numbers in barley and wheat but application of the herbicide at the 2 - 3 leaf stage stimulated the outgrowth of tiller buds but this effect was temporary and was {{not the result of}} visible physical damage to the shoot meristem. There was no intra-specific variability between cultivars of wheat and barley. Grain yield and other yield components of spring barley were not affected by post-emergence treatments of triasulfuron. Triasulfuron had high activity through the soil and both the roots and subterranean shoots of developing seedlings absorbed the herbicide from the soil. The bioactivity and mobility of the herbicide down the soil profile was inversely related to the organic matter content of the soil. The amount and frequency of rainfall directly influenced the rate of leaching of the herbicide down the soil profile. Comparisons of the rates of disappearance of triasulfuron in autoclaved and non-autoclaved soils suggested the involvement of a biglogical degragation pathway. Triasulfuron disappeared faster at 30 C than at 10 C and higher moisture levels enhanced the rate of breakdown. Studies on the mode of action of triasulfuron indicated that the herbicide acts by inhibiting cell division in susceptible plants.

40|$|In 2010, {{a hybrid}} seed corn {{production}} field was confirmed to be infested {{with a population}} of Amaranthus tuberculatus that was not controlled by postemergence applications of all tested commercially available HPPDinhibitor herbicides. In glasshouse and field studies, resistance to post-emergence applications of mesotrione, tembotrione and topramezone was confirmed. In addition, this population was identified to be resistant to ALSinhibitors and to triazines. A. tuberculatus is a very competitive weed, which can appear in high population density and can emerge even very late during the season. A. tuberculatus is dioecious and therefore an obligate outcrosser, which is leading to high genetic variability within a population. All these biological features increase the risk of developing resistance to herbicides. Therefore, the field history explains clearly that this resistance developed under specific conditions.

Based on two years {{field experiment}}ation, it was found that <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>application</b> of oxyfluorfen (23. 5 % EC) at 400 g. ha - 1 gave significantly lower total weed density, weed dry weight and higher weed control efficiency at all the intervals. Application of new formulation of oxyfluorfen (23. 5 % EC) at 200 g. ha - 1 as pre-emergence herbicide can keep the weed density and dry weight below the economic threshold level and increase the bulb weight (42. 56 and 43. 87 g) and yield (15940 and 15610 k g. ha - 1) in onion. Unweeded control accounted for lower bulb yield which inturn reflected through higher weed index of 60. 6 and 56. 1 per cent, respectively during both the years, due to heavy competition of weeds for nutrients, space and light. </p...|$|E
40|$|Weed control {{strategies}} for field beans were studied in North-eastern Croatia. This {{study focused on}} how different weed management practices affect weed community composition. The recommended <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicide <b>application</b> was compared to different treatments of post-emergence herbicide (broadcasted or banded over crop rows) and mechanical weed control in order to explore the response of a weed community to different management practice. Weed density data were used to compare total community densities by weed management strategies and to calculate diversity indices (Shannon's H', Shannon's E and Margalef's D-MG). Data were analyzed using ANOVA and multivariate technique. Weed community structure was generally similar in the post-emergence herbicide treatments, which were dominated by a few species that had high relative abundance values, {{while most of the}} species were of lower abundance. Notable fluctuations in weed communities corresponded with variation in weather patterns and management practice...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted at Agricultural College and Research Institute, Madurai during summer seasons of 2003 and 2004 {{to study the}} effect of pre and post sowing weed management practices on weeds and growth of summer irrigated cotton. The {{experiments were}} conducted in split plot design and replicated thrice. Pre sowing weed management practices viz., normal sowing (S 1), stale seedbed by slight hoeing (S 2) and stale seed bed by paraquat application (S 3) were assigned to main plots. Under Post-sowing weed management practices, <b>Pre-emergence</b> <b>applications</b> of fluchloralin 1. 0 kg ha - 1 succeeded with each of MW 30 DAS, glyphosate 1. 5 and 1. 0 kg ha - 1 separately and were assigned to W 1, W 2 and W 3 treatments, respectively. While, MW 20 DAS succeeded with each of glyphosate 1. 5 and 1. 0 kg ha - 1 (40 DAS) and MW on 20 DAS separately and were allotted to W 4, W 5 and W 6 treatments, respectively. These were compared with unweeded control (W 7) under sub plots. The results revealed SSB by paraquat application registered significantly lower N, P 2 O 5 and K 2 O depletion by weeds. The lowest nutrient depletion by weeds was achieved by post sowing weed management practice of manual weeding (20 DAS) fb glyphosate 1. 5 kg ha - 1. Whereas, nutrient depletion was higher in unweeded control. As a result, Weed Control Efficiency (WCE) was higher under pre sowing weed management practice of SSB paraquat application, which was followed by SSB, by slight hoeing practice. Among the Post-sowing weed management, MW (20 DAS) fb glyphosate 1. 5 kg ha - 1 recorded higher WCE. The plant growth analysis such as LAI, CGR, RGR and Plant DMP values were increased appreciably in SSB by paraquat application. In post sowing weed management practices, manual weeding (20 DAS) fb glyphosate 1. 5 kg ha - 1 increased the above growth analysis and parameters...|$|R
40|$|Introduction of {{exogenous}} micro-organisms in the rhizosphere of {{crop plants}} for plant growth enhancement requires a careful study of factors affecting their performance. We studied {{the effect of}} pre-and post-emergence herbicides on nodulation, N-accumulation and yield of soybean inoculated with exotic Rhizobium strains in a Dystric Leptosol. The treatments comprising a control with no herbicide treatment, a pre-emergence herbicide treatment and a combination of preand post-emergence herbicide treatment were {{set out in the}} field using a randomized complete block design. The results show that both post-emergence and a combination of pre- and post-emergence herbicide treatments applied at 3 weeks after planting reduced nodulation, shoot dry weight, N-accumulation in the biomass and seed yield. <b>Pre-emergence</b> herbicide <b>application</b> reduced weed density and sparingly affected nodule dry weight, N-accumulation and seed yield. The results of the work suggest that selection and timing of herbicide application in soybean plots affect weed competition, nodulation, N-accumulation and overall performance of the crop in the field...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the farm of Zonal Adaptive Research Station, Uttar Banga Krishi Viswavidhyalaya, Pundibari, Cooch Behar, West Bengal to evaluate the effect of pendimethalin on the yield, weed density and phytotoxicity in different varieties of rai (Brassica juncea) and yellow sarson (B. campestris var. yellow sarson) under higher soil moisture regime in Terai region of West Bengal. <b>Pre-emergence</b> <b>application</b> of pendimethalin at higher dose i. e. 1. 0 kg/ha recorded higher plant mortality (30. 92 %) due {{to the presence of}} higher concentration of pendimethalin residue (0. 292 µg/g) till the tenth day of crop age and consequently had the reduced yield (12. 59 q/ha) than the dose of 0. 7 kg/ha (13. 33 q/ha) where plant mortality was only 12. 62 % due to comparatively lower level of pendimethalin residue (0. 192 µg/g). Although the application of pendimethalin at the rate of 1. 0 kg/ha was able to control weed more efficiently (18. 96 /m 2) than the dose of 0. 7 kg/ha (30. 41 /m 2) and subsequent lower doses. The herbicide leached down to the root zone resulting in phytotoxicity towards crop.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effects of {{herbicides}} on varied species of weeds. The experiment used of four general methods of treatment with various concentrations of herbicidal materials, namely, <b>pre-emergence</b> (<b>application</b> of the herbicidal material either as a liquid spray or as a dry powder of dust on the soil surface of the infested area), post-emergence foliage sprays (application of a spray or dust to the vegetative parts of the undesired species), treatment of the seed in the field, and treatment of fully-headed plants. All plots were replicated and randomized wherever a sufficiently large area of infestation permitted. Where experimental areas were small, permitting only a single unreplicated treatment, these tests were considered as exploratory and used mainly as indicators for future experiments. Results of the various treatments were recorded in actual per cents of weeds killed where size of plots permitted accurate stand counts to be made. In the case of the larger experimental units, such as square red plots, the use of a weedy grass index was employed. Overall the results indicated that specific conditions and types of treatments worked best at the removal of the differing species of weeds. This experiment was carried out during the Summer and Fall of 1947. Advisor: Noel S. Hanson...|$|E
40|$|The {{herbicide}} GOLTIX® TITAN® is {{the unique}} {{combination of two}} active ingredients, Metamitrone (525 g/L) and Quinmerac (40 g/L). GOLTIX® TITAN® {{is used for the}} control of annual dicotyledonous weeds in sugar and fodder beets. Registration was granted for the post emergence splitting application with 3 x 2, 0 L/ha (3 applications). This corresponds to the amount of 3150 g Metamitrone and 240 g Quinmerac per hectare at maximum application rate. The registration application for <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>application</b> has been submitted. Several field trials were carried out between 2009 and 2013. These trials revealed the optimized efficacy on important weeds in sugar beet production including Fool´s parsley (Aethusa cynapium), Cleavers (Gallium aparine) and Fat-hen (Chenopodium album). Selectivity was examined in all of these trials and showed good results with all relevant mixtures at all application times. The two active ingredients have different modes of action; hence, the product {{plays an important role in}} resistance management. They can be applied flexibly and do not have any known negative influence on the environment. The successful formulation of this highly sophisticated sugar beet herbicide was confirmed by the available trial results.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of cover crops and timing of <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicide <b>applications</b> on soybean yield under no-tillage system. The experiment consisted of four cover crops (Panicum maximum, Urochloa ruziziensis, U. brizantha, and pearl millet) and fallow, in addition to four herbicide timings (30, 20, 10, and 0 days before soybean sowing), under no-tillage system (NTS), and of two control treatments under conventional tillage system (CTS). The experimental design was a completely randomized block, in a split-plot arrangement, with three replicates. Soybean under fallow, P. maximum, U. ruziziensis, U. brizantha, and pearl millet in the NTS and soybean under U. brizantha in the CTS {{did not differ significantly}} regarding yield. Soybean under fallow in the CTS significantly reduced yield when compared to the other treatments. The amount of straw on soil surface did not significantly affect soybean yield. Chemical management of P. maximum and U. brizantha near the soybean sowing date causes significant damage in soybean yield. However, herbicide timing in fallow, U. ruziziensis, and pearl millet does not affect soybean yield...|$|R
40|$|The field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicide <b>application</b> on the growth and yield of cotton.

S 0. 66 Lit ha‾ 1, Stomp 455 C. S 1. 00 Lit ha‾ 1 and control (untreated). Three weed species i. e., broad leaved (locally called Waho, and Naro), grasses (locally called (Sawri, Chabber, Mandhano) and sedges (locally called Kabah) {{were found in the}} cotton field. Weed density reduced by 174 percent over untreated control significantly with the application of Stomp 455 C. S 0. 66 Lit ha‾ 1 as pre-emergence weed control. The greater reduction of weed species resulted taller plants, more fruiting branches, seed cotton weight, and ginning out-turn percentage. Therefore it is concluded that Stomp 455 C.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted during rabi season of 2011 - 12 at Junagadh {{to find out}} most suitable and economically viable method of weed control in rabi fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.). The dominant weed species observed were Cyperus rotundus L., Chenopodium album L., Digera arvensis Forsk and Asphodelus tenuifolius L. Cav. Results revealed that besides weed free treatment, significantly higher plant height, number of branches/plant, number of umbels/plant, number of seeds/umbellate, test weight, seed weight per plant, and seed and stover yields of fennel were recorded with <b>pre-emergence</b> (PRE) <b>application</b> of pendimethalin at 0. 90 kg/ha + post-emergence (POE) application of fenoxaprop-ethyl at 75 g/ha at 45 DAS which was at par with PRE application of pendimethalin at 0. 90 kg/ha + hand weeding (HW) at 45 DAS and HW twice at 15 and 45 DAS. These treatments also recorded lower weed density and dry weight of weeds along with highest net returns (81993 & 81442 `/ha) and B:C ratio owing to lower weed index and higher weed control efficiency.
