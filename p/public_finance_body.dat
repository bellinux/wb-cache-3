Based on this research, the approaches used by the Kazakh financial system to converge with the European Union (EU) and the mechanism of implementing international standards in the national regulatory framework are determined. In practice, the study provides justification for the necessity of arranging the systematization of existing rules and regulations covering financial activity in the Republic, eliminating discrepancies between the national regulatory framework and international standards, and determining clear security guarantees for foreign investors’ financial activity in the Republic. The research results are primarily focused on the development of <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> management theory.

40|$|The essays that {{comprise}} this Handbook cover {{a wide variety}} of topics in the theory of <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> As a field of systematic academic inquiry, <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> arose before economics or political economy. For instance, more than 90 chairs in <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> had been established in Europe before the first chair was established in political economy (Backhaus 2002, p. 615). The first scholars of <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> were the Cameralists, who emerged in central Europe in the 16 th century. For a long time after its Cameralist founding, <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> was conceived as a multi-disciplinary field of study, and most certainly not simply a subset of economic theory. The object that <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> scholarship examined, the public household, was examined in a manner that sought to integrate the economic, political, legal, and administrative elements of <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> In the post-war period, a splintering of approaches has taken place, sufficiently so that it is meaningful to distinguish between the old <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> and the new, recognizing that new is not a synonym for better. The old <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> has not been replaced by the new. Both are practiced currently, and are competing for the affection and attention of scholars. If the old-style <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> is still called <b>public</b> <b>finance,</b> the new style is often called public economics instead. This distinction is found in contemporary texts and journals. Fo...|$|R

40|$|Traditional <b>public</b> <b>financing</b> {{of campaigns}} is in trouble.

November 2012 was the first general election in which presidential candidates from both major parties rejected <b>public</b> <b>financing</b> {{since the inception of}} the program. The U. S.

If existing programs are not revamped soon <b>public</b> <b>financing</b> may be off the public radar for decades, as budget deficits make antiquated <b>public</b> <b>financing</b> programs ripe targets for spending cuts. This Essay proposes a paradigm shift. <b>Public</b> <b>financing</b> should no longer aim to purge private money from politics, but should instead encourage as many citizens as possible to participate in financing politics. Specifically, federal, state, and local lawmakers should adopt a multiple match for political contributions that would dramatically expand participation. Giving six-to-one multiple matching public funds on the first $ 200 of a contribution, for example, would make a $ 200 contribution worth $ 1400 to a candidate. Studies show that multiple matching funds can increase citizen participation sevenfold, and can prompt candidates to collect the bulk of their money from smaller contributors...|$|R
