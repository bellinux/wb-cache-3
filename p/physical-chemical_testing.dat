40|$|This paper {{shows the}} effects of ferrate(VI) {{application}} {{in the treatment of}} industrial wastewater effluent in laboratory conditions. Samples used are a mixture of wastewater effluent from various industrial plants whose composition was determined by analyzing samples before the ferrate(VI) treatment. Determining physical-chemical characteristics of the samples showed very high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the concentrations of individual pollutants are higher than the maximum allowed. In the tested samples, the COD was from 18 (sample 1) to 580 times (sample 2) greater than allowed (allowed 45 - 150 mg/l), while the concentrations of certain metals were several times higher than allowed (Cu allowed 0, 1 mg/l, Zn allowed 0, 2 mg/l). Also, a high concentration of total phosphorus content (allowed 2 mg/l) and fluoride was found (allowed 20 mg/l), 2 - 3 times higher than permissible. The applied Na 2 FeO 4 was synthesized by electrochemical method and applied in situ. <b>Physical-chemical</b> <b>testing</b> of samples, after treatment with different amounts (2, 5, 8, and 10 ml) of Na 2 FeO 4, concentration of 8 g/l showed that ferrate(VI) {{can be used as a}} multifunctional agent in the purification of industrial wastewater, where in the amount of contaminating matter is reduced below the maximum permitted level. It was demonstrated the high efficiency of ferrate(VI) as a strong oxidant in the removal of total P and suspended materials. Also pointed out was the high sorption power of the generated ferric(III) hydroxide, which with its developed surface absorbs 95, 5 % of the F- and removes it from the solution in the form of sludge. Showed a high efficiency of ferrate(VI) in the total removal of P (70 to 99, 5 %), and F- (89 to 95, 5 %), but depending on the presence of the total COD value or the presence of the total organic substances. At high values of the COD major part of ferrate(VI) is consumed in the oxidation of organic material and the formation of Fe(OH) 3, which accelerate the process of decomposition of ferrate(VI), which contributes to lower the efficiency of the removal of P and F-.

Appropriate methods have been developed for all aspects with minor modification of original proposed methodologies. Purse seining has yet to be <b>tested.</b> <b>Physical-chemical</b> limnologic sampling could be reduced or subcontracted with the U. S.

MLC- 1 cells, cell extracts, and culture fluids were shown to reduce the spontaneous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and to completely inhibit their response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Suppression of PHA response was demonstrated against a variety of human and nonhuman primate species, with 90 to 95 % inhibition occurring at dilutions of extract as great as 1 : 5, 120. Inhibition of this type was also demonstrated using extracts of two of five other lymphoblastoid cell lines <b>tested.</b> <b>Physical-chemical</b> characteristics of the active factor(s) revealed a non-sedimentable, non-dialyzable, trypsin-resistant molecule, which was stable at 56 C for 30 min but inactivated at 80 C for 30 min.

40|$|To date, {{environmental}} monitoring is mainly focused on traditional chemical techniques, {{or on the}} assessment of specific biomarkers. However, these analyses are affected by several limitations: mainly, they are expensive, spot-sampling and time-consuming. In order to overcome these drawbacks, new biological monitoring methods, such as biosensors and biological early warning system (BEWS) are under development. These kinds of devices, built around whole cells, enzymes and antibodies, are well-suited to cooperatively and continuously monitor the environmental conditions. The key-factor of this very promising approach is the biological sensing element. Whole cell systems and enzymes are well suited for {{environmental monitoring}}: {{they are able to}} determine the bioavailable and toxic concentration of xenobiotics, especially if the source and nature of the compound cannot be predicted. Microorganisms usually detect a broad spectrum of chemicals, and represent a good opportunity for low cost, long shelf-life, and wide range of conditions in which they can be applied. Besides, enzymes are effective when a particular kind of pollutant would be detected because is possible to fine tune their metabolic behaviour by means of protein engineering. In this work, three biological sensing elements, related to three different index of toxicity were evaluated, in order to develop new biosensors for environmental monitoring: a broad toxicity index associated to the decrease of light emission (EC 50 or half effective concentration) of a bioluminescent bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, a metal toxicity connected to the metal-regulated production of a siderophore (pyoverdine) by the soil and water microorganism Pseudomonas fluorescens, and finally an index of toxicity given by PAHs, was related to the metabolization of these compounds by laccase of Trametes versicolor. One of the first step during the assessment of a new biological sensing element is the study of the effect of <b>physical-chemical</b> parameters. The <b>tested</b> <b>physical-chemical</b> parameters (temperature, pH, inoculum percentage (v/v) and carbon source) influenced both microbial sensible elements (V. fischeri and P. fluorescens), therefore, these sensible elements {{can be used in a}} whole-cell biosensor for in-situ application, even if the response is affected by the environmental variables. Furthermore, the light emission of V. fischeri was highly variable, although a more stable bioluminescence was obtained by means of a glucose fed-batch: this is one step towards the direct application of this system, usually tailored for laboratory assays, to estimate the broad acute toxicity directly in situ in a portable device. Regarding the interaction between P. fluorescens and Fe 3 +, Cu 2 +, and Zn 2 +, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the pyoverdine critical concentration (PCC) obtained values were compared to those indicated in the WHO Guidelines for drinking water quality and in European directive 98 / 83 /EC: MICs of Fe 3 +, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + are always above the threshold specified, whilst PCCs are very near to the recommended thresholds for iron and copper. The PCC was not determined for zinc in the tested range of concentration and conditions. These results highlighted that this sensible element should be further investigated for the development of a biosensor able to monitor metals in the environment. The last and most promising sensing element assessed in this work was the lccβ laccase of T. versicolor. A combination of computational docking (SwissDock) and molecular biology techniques was used to generate rationally engineered laccases with increased ability to process large and persistent PAHs.

However, there are places where the sanitation is not a priority, as often happens in remote communities of the metropolis. It is in these circumstances, recognizing the shortcomings of CPM La Libertad that we took the determination to establish and evaluate the quality of groundwater they consume, since it is the only source of supply which provides the fluid element through the distribution network or directly from the well. It was assumed that the local water was contaminated by fecal waste that entered to the stream through leaching, percolation or directly, mainly due to the proximity of the silos with groundwater wells. - For this reason, we proceeded to perform the following activities: a) Pick 3 samples of well water and 3 of the distribution network twice a year to analyze and compare them using microbiological and <b>physical-chemical</b> <b>tests,</b> whose methodology was according to "Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater 21 th edition, 2005 (APHA, AWWA, WPCF). " b) Evaluation of the permeability degree in CPM soil in order to determine the ease or difficulty of soil drainage and thus correlate with the speed or delay of contaminated groundwater via infiltration. The test methodology to determine the soil type was according to the NTP was 339. 128 ASTM - D 422 for sieve analysis and the NTP 339. 134 ASTM - D 2487 of Soil Classification, SUCS System. c) Evaluation of the morbidity rate of the CPM during the years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 relating to diseases that are caused primarily by the consumption of contaminated water by fecal waste. Data that were provided by the Regional Health Authority-San Martín. It was concluded from the results that the water of the CPM is not suitable for human consumption because it was contaminated by fecal waste. It was also determined that the soil of this community is granular, with high permeability coefficient, which led us to infer, that, therefore, fecal wastes easily reach the stream via infiltration. Regarding the morbidity rate, it was verified that diseases caused primarily by the consumption of water contaminated by fecal waste are increasing each year, which alerted us, this result is consequence of neglect that exists in that CPM. Finally, emphasis should be placed in the primary treatment of this water through residual chlorine with constant monitoring of its quality, since this is a very effective chemical agent to eliminate thermo tolerant bacteria, main causes of the diseases presented in the morbidity. - It is also pertinent to warn people that water need to be boiled before consuming. TesisLa salubridad humana es una de las principales preocupaciones del hombre, dadas las consecuencias negativas que su descuido acarrea; en este contexto es que las sociedades en su conjunto suman capacidades para realizar un seguimiento a la calidad de las fuentes de agua para consumo humano, logrando, en muchas ocasiones, revertir en forma oportuna, las consecuencias contraproducentes, mediante acciones precisas que conllevaron ingentes esfuerzos humanos y económicos. Sin embargo, existen lugares donde esta salubridad no es prioridad, como suele suceder en las comunidades alejadas de la metrópoli. Es en estas circunstancias, reconociendo las carencias del C. P. M. La Libertad, que tomamos la decisión de determinar y evaluar la calidad del agua subterránea que consumen, ya que es la única fuente de abastecimiento que les provee del líquido elemento, mediante la red de distribución o directamente del pozo. Se presumió que el agua del lugar estaba contaminada por residuos fecales que ingresaban al torrente por lixiviación, percolación o directamente, principalmente debido a la cercanía de los silos con los pozos de agua subterránea. - Por esta razón se procedió a realizar las siguientes actividades: a) Recojo de 3 muestras de agua de pozo y 3 de la red de distribución en dos oportunidades durante un año, para analizarlas y compararlas mediante exámenes microbiológicos y físico-químicos, cuya metodología estuvo de acuerdo al “Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater 21 th edition, 2005 (APHA, AWWA, WPCF) “. b) Evaluación del grado de permeabilidad del suelo del C. P. M. para determinar la facilidad o dificultad de drenaje que tiene este suelo y así correlacionar con la rapidez o demora de contaminarse el agua subterránea vía infiltraciones. La metodología de ensayos para determinar el tipo de suelo estuvo de acuerdo al NTP 339. 128 ASTM - D 422 para análisis granulométrico y la NTP 339. 134 ASTM - D 2487 de Clasificación de Suelos, Sistema SUCS c) Evaluación de la tasa de morbilidad de este C. P. M. durante los años 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 y 2008 referente a las enfermedades que son ocasionadas principalmente por el consumo de agua contaminada por residuos fecales. Datos que fueron facilitados por la Dirección Regional de Salud-San Martín. De los resultados obtenidos se pudo concluir que las aguas del C. P. M. no son aptas para el consumo humano, por encontrarse contaminadas a través de residuos fecales. También se pudo determinar que el suelo de esta comunidad es granular, de alto coeficiente de permeabilidad, lo que nos llevó a colegir, que por tal motivo los residuos fecales llegan más fácilmente al torrente por infiltración. Respecto a la tasa de morbilidad, se verificó que cada año se van incrementando las enfermedades producidas principalmente por el consumo de aguas contaminadas por residuos fecales, lo que nos puso en alerta, ya que este resultado es la consecuencia del descuido en que se vive en dicho C.

40|$|In recent years, a new {{generation}} of Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques has rapidly become available to the public, due to the expiration of some AM patents and to open-source movements, which allowed significant cost reductions. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the possibility to use Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques in the field of naval propulsion, in particular in the fabrication of propellers in model scale, for experimental test, where the manufacturing process was remained almost unchanged in the last 50 years. The naval contextualization responds to need for naval experimental laboratories (Towing Tank and Cavitation Tunnel) for which the high costs are an important limitation for both basic research and for industrial testing. A further scope of applicability of the study is the realization of specialized design of custom propeller for fast boats (typically small) for which, the high cost of production, in relation to the commercial value of the product, has frequently a limitation. Emphasis was placed to printing process parameters and physical and mechanical characterization of materials used to provide reliable and accurate data as references for developers, designers and researchers. The used procedures, were specialized in relation to the intrinsic requirements of the propellers and of the chemical and physical characteristics of the materials. Most marine propellers are made of metallic material such as bronze or steel. The advantages of replacing metal with a polymeric and composite materials are that the latter is lighter and corrosion-resistant. AM process has the potential to dramatically reduce the time and cost required realizing functional metal parts. In addition, the process can fabricate complex internal features not feasible using existing manufacturing processes and allow to fabricate customized propeller. The case study propeller INSEAN E 779 a, considered in the literature an adequate benchmark, was taken into account. It was fabricated by Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) EOS M 280 in AlSi 10 Mg metal powder and by an open-source Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3 D printer, Prusa Mendel I 3 in Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS), and UltraT polymeric material.

The evaluation of the printed propellers was carried out by combining their morphological data with the comparison of their performance in respect to the benchmark. A Reverse Engineering system, Faro Articulated Arm Coordinate Measuring Machines (AACMM) CAM 2, was used to get the point clouds of each propeller. Using the iterative closest point algorithm of Geomagic Control software of 3 D Systems, the point cloud of each propeller was aligned with the CAD nominal model. In such a way the analysis of the deviations was carried out. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) test allowed to assess the morphological features and surface roughness of the printed propellers. Towing tank open water propeller tests were carried out and hydrodynamic performance comparison analysis between printed propellers and benchmark, in terms of torque and drag, was analysed. Also, having carried out the measures to 1 kHz sampling frequency, were evaluated the effects, on the hydrodynamic performance of the propellers, of the residual polar asymmetries due to shrinkage associated to AM process. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis were performed to determine the loads acting on the propeller which were used in the experimental bending test on printed propellers. The results, show differences in respect of the thrust generated and of the torque absorbed by the printed propellers, compared to benchmark, as function of the advance coefficient J, of the morphological characteristics and of the materials used. However, the final analysis showed that the substantial adequacy of the AM propellers realized, for most of the studies carried out in Towing Tank. This is due both to the reduced deviations from the nominal model, that to verified constancy of performance offered by each prototype...|$|R
40|$|La {{migration}} et la spéciation de Cr, de Cu et de Pb sont étudiées sur le sol d'une colonne alimentée par les eaux usées de tanneries. La localisation des métaux est évaluée à l'aide du schéma d'extractions sélectives préconisé par Legret et al. (1988). Les résultats ont montré que l'horizon superficiel renferme des teneurs en métaux très élevées. Parmi les métaux étudiés, le Cr s'avère retenu essentiellement dans la phase résiduelle mais il se présente aussi sous des formes plus mobiles. Le Cu est principalement associé avec la phase résiduelle et organique. Le Pb est lié aux phases acido-soluble et réductible. De ce fait, l'épandage des eaux usées de tanneries, sans aucun traitement préalable, peut être une source de contamination des sols et des eaux souterraines, notamment pour le Cr. In Morocco, {{the town}} of Marrakesh, as {{in other areas of}} the country, is subject to multiple daily aggressions generated by industrial pollution, in particular from tanneries. The tannery waste water is discharged directly into the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems without any preliminary processing. In order to evaluate the danger that can be generated by tannery effluents in the receiving ecosystems, and to study the ecotoxicological and environmental impact resulting from that chemical treatment of these effluents, we determined, before and after treatment, the inhibitory effect of the two most polluted effluents originating from manufactured leather: liming-deliming and chromium tanning. The purpose of our investigation was thus to evaluate the acute toxicity of the chromium tanning and epilage-coat waste waters before and after chemical treatment. The invertebrate Daphnia pulex was used for the toxicity test and the toxicity due to these industrial waste waters was evaluated by regression analysis. The processing carried out on the chromium tanning waste water consisted of precipitation with sodium carbonate at different pH values. The treatment of liming-deliming wastewaters consisted of an elimination and recovery of the sulphide compounds without carrying out their degradation. The chromium level was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry with graphite furnace atomization. The results of the toxicity test showed that the investigated chromium tanning and liming-deliming effluents presented were toxic, with respective IC 50 - 24 h values of 0. 15 and 3. 36 (expressed as dilution ratios). This toxicity could be explained by high levels of chromium, sulphides and organic matter in these waste waters. It is however difficult to correlate the IC 50 values obtained with those of the <b>physical-chemical</b> parameters. The <b>tested</b> effluents are very complex matrices. On the other hand, we noticed a notable difference between these two effluents. The mineral tanning effluent is contaminated with chromium and organic matter, whereas the second is especially rich in organic matter and sulphide. The total chromium concentration corresponding to the IC 50 - 24 h value of the raw chromium tanning effluent is lower than that which would be expected on the basis on the known toxicity of K 2 Cr 2 O 7, showing the toxicity of raw chromium waste waters is due not only to chromium, but also to other chemicals used during the manufacturing process of leather. After processing by chemical precipitation, the IC 50 - 24 h values increased from 0. 15 to 26. 6 and from 3. 36 to 11. 1 respectively, for the chromium tanning and the epilage-coat effluents. Consequently, these treated sewages can be classified as low toxicity wastes. The comparison of the results is very difficult considering that the test conditions and the physicochemical and heavy metal characteristics of the effluents vary enormously over time, without forgetting the physicochemical composition of the experimental solution used by standard OECD (fresh water) and the standard ISO (synthetic water). From where necessity to vary tests for determining well the degree of an effluent toxicity which the effects appear differently at various levels trophic. The diminution observed in the toxicity of the effluents is linked to a reduction of suspended matter (95 %), COD (55 %), Cr (90 %) and sulphides (50 %). Hence, this treatment presents at least two advantages. The first is environmental as just mentioned. The second is economic since chromium can be recycled for reuse in leather tanning. The results suggest that the recovered chromium is similar to commercial tanning chromium. These results also show that the fixing of chromium does not depend on the nature of the treated skin. In fact, a technical and economic analysis showed that proposed treatment can be economically beneficial (3112, 5 $ per 1000 tons of skins) ...|$|R
