5|$|The {{success of}} Moo, You Bloody Choir saw Richards {{expected}} by record label Sony BMG {{to produce a}} quality follow-up. He denied being under significant pressure, though the <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> label—"Richo, {{have you got a}} single? Do you have singles? Please, do you have singles?"—was noted. Much of the writing for Augie March's fourth album took place while touring the United States, which Richards argued minimised the band's opportunities to be creative. In 2008, Augie March began recording Watch Me Disappear at Neil Finn's Auckland studios; they also recorded in Melbourne, Sydney, and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand {{to get away from the}} distraction of Melbourne, their hometown, thus allowing them to focus solely on recording.|$|E

5|$|After it {{had been}} {{previously}} forecast to turn northwestward and track along the northeastern Florida coast, the forecast shifted 24hours prior to moving ashore to a landfall point in the east-central portion of the state; the change {{was due to the}} <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge to its north. The hurricane moved over Grand Bahama Island, and in the Bahamas it produced wind gusts of up to 130mph (210km/h). As it approached the Florida coastline it did not strengthen much further, due to an eyewall replacement cycle; this is the process in which an outer eyewall forms, causing the original eye to shrink and dissipate due to lack of moisture. At 0400UTC on September 26, Jeanne made landfall with peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) on the southern end of Hutchinson Island near Stuart, Florida, with an eye 50mi (85km) in diameter. The hurricane moved ashore in almost the same location as Hurricane Frances, which made landfall 21days prior.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Lorenzo {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that exited the coast of Africa on September11. After moving across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, it traversed much of the Caribbean Sea before developing an area of thunderstorms on September21. The system developed a low pressure area on September23 after the northern portion of the wave broke off and crossed the Yucatán Peninsula. Initially, a Hurricane Hunters flight was scheduled to investigate the system, although the low became disorganized over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico due to high wind shear. However, the wind shear decreased, and late on September25, another Hurricane Hunters flight indicated {{the development of a}} closed low-level circulation. Based on that observation, along with sufficient <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thunderstorms, the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen about 190mi (305km) east of Tampico, Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates {{that when}} Kali (Satyavati) was {{ferrying}} the rishi (sage) Parashara {{across the river}} Yamuna, the sage wanted Kali to satisfy his lust and held her right hand. She tried to dissuade Parashara, saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish. She finally gave in, realizing the desperation and <b>persistence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sage and fearing {{that if she did}} not heed to his request, he might topple the boat midstream. Kali agreed, and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be delightful to them both. At these words, Matsyagandha was transformed (by the powers of the sage) into Yojanagandha ("she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana"). She now smelled of musk, and so was called Kasturi-gandhi ("musk-fragrant"). When Parashara, tormented with desire, approached her again she insisted that the act was not appropriate in broad daylight, as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank; they should wait till night. The sage, with his powers, shrouded the entire area in fog. Before Parashara could enjoy her, Satyavati again interrupted him to say that he would enjoy her and depart, robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society. The sage then blessed her with virgo intacta. She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, the sage bathed in the river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance.|$|E
