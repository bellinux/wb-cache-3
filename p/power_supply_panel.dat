The switching frequency of them is controlled over 48 kHz. The high-frequency noise due to the switching of the IGBT choppers has caused the damages to the control system. Furthermore, the capacitors for the RF shield of the ceramics chamber inside the BUHS have been burned by the induced voltage due to the fast falling time of the current pattern and the current ripple of the high frequency. The ground wires that connect to each <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>panel</b> and each magnet has been changed to copper sheets and the neutral ground (ME) resistor of the IGBT assemblies have been installed.

40|$|A {{micro-controller}} based {{embedded system}} has been designed and developed to monitor and control the operation of various types of <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> required for the super conducting cyclotron, from the front panel {{as well as from}} the remote terminal. The main objective of this development is to provide support for the supervisory control of the indigenous <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> developed to energize different magnets like main magnet, trim coils etc. for the operation of the cyclotron. The system is broadly divided into two parts- the interface part and the front panel. The interface part has been designed around Intel 80196 KC micro-controller and has facilities to set the current of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> through 18 -bit DAC. A 16 -bit external ADC has been used to monitor the output current of the <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> through a DCCT. The system has facility to load the status register to indicate the different interlock signals of the <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> The interface card essentially establishes the communication between the personal computer (PC) and the <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> through RS 422 / RS 485 and follows a standard command-response protocol. This facilitates the remote operation of a number of <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> connected in a multi-drop fashion. This card is being used with some indigenously developed current-controlled <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> The front <b>panel</b> which is also connected to the interface card through RS 422 / RS 485 provides local operation of the <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> This card, also developed around Intel 80196 KC micro-controller, is connected to the interface card through RS 422 / RS 485 serial interface.

40|$|Satellite {{networks}} are drawing {{more and more}} attention, since they can provide various services to everywhere on the earth. Communication devices in satellites are typically powered by solar panels and battery cells, which are carefully designed to guarantee <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> and avoid deficiency. However, we find that unrestrained use of energy will cause a satellite to age quickly, {{because the number of}} recharge/discharge of battery cells is limited. Due to the extremely high cost of satellites, the development of energy-efficient satellite routing to save energy and prolong satellite lifetimes has become significantly important. In this paper, we do comprehensive studies. First, we model the power consumption of a space router, <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> by solar <b>panels,</b> and aging of battery cells formally. Second, we define the energy-efficient satellite routing (EESR) problem, and prove that the EESR problem is NP-hard. Then, we develop three algorithms to gradually solve the EESR problem. GreenSR-B is a baseline algorithm which computes link costs iteratively to compute a routing that minimizes the total recharge/discharge cycle number. GreenSR-A selects space routers to switch into sleep mode to improve energy conservation. GreenSR jointly considers energy efficiency and QoS requirements of path length and the maximum link utilization ratio. We evaluate our algorithms by simulations on a low earth orbit satellite network with real Internet usage traces. The results show that GreenSR can prolong the lifetime of satellite battery cells by more than 40 %, with little increment in path length and a small link utilization ratio.
