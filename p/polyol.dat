25|$|<b>Polyols</b> can be {{polyether}} <b>polyols,</b> {{which are}} made by the reaction of epoxides with an active hydrogen containing compounds. Polyester <b>polyols</b> are made by the polycondensation of multifunctional carboxylic acids and polyhydroxyl compounds. They can be further classified according to their end use. Higher molecular weight <b>polyols</b> (molecular weights from 2,000 to 10,000) are used to make more flexible polyurethanes while lower molecular weight <b>polyols</b> make more rigid products.|$|R
25|$|Polyurethanes are {{produced}} by mixing two or more liquid streams. The <b>polyol</b> stream contains catalysts, surfactants, blowing agents and so on. The two components {{are referred to as}} a polyurethane system, or simply a system. The isocyanate is commonly referred to in North America as the 'A-side' or just the 'iso'. The blend of polyols and other additives is commonly referred to as the 'B-side' or as the 'poly'. This mixture might also be called a 'resin' or 'resin blend'. In Europe the meanings for 'A-side' and 'B-side' are reversed. Resin blend additives may include chain extenders, cross linkers, surfactants, flame retardants, blowing agents, pigments, and fillers. Polyurethane can be made in a variety of densities and hardnesses by varying the isocyanate, <b>polyol</b> or additives.|$|E

25|$|Chewing gum is a soft, {{cohesive}} substance {{designed to}} be chewed without being swallowed. Modern chewing gum is composed of gum base, sweeteners, softeners/ plasticizers, flavors, colors, and, typically, a hard or powdered <b>polyol</b> coating. Its texture is reminiscent of rubber because of the physical-chemical properties of its polymer, plasticizer, and resin components, which contribute to its elastic-plastic, sticky, chewy characteristics.|$|E
30|$|The {{isocyanate}} groups can react with any compound containing reactive hydrogen atoms. Products bearing {{two or more}} hydroxyl groups in the molecule are called diols or <b>polyols.</b> Along with the hydroxyl groups, <b>polyols</b> may contain other functionalities such as ester, ether, amide, and acrylic. <b>Polyols</b> with low functionality form linear PUs while <b>polyols</b> of high functionality give crosslinked polymers. In addition, <b>polyols</b> with low molecular weight produce rigid PU with {{a high concentration of}} urethane groups in the polymer chain [7]. Polyester and acrylic <b>polyols</b> are conventional coractants, employed for tailoring high performance PU coatings. Such <b>polyols</b> contain ester and/or acrylic and hydroxylic groups in their backbone. Note that the acrylic <b>polyols,</b> which are generally more expensive, present the advantage of imparting the characteristic properties of acrylics, e.g. thermal stability, to the resulting PU products [7, 9].|$|R

Typically, one metric ton of polyurethane foam needs 616 kg of MDI and 386 kg of <b>polyol,</b> with 54 kg of pentane as a blowing agent. These rigid polyurethane foams are good thermal insulators and used in nearly all freezers and refrigerators worldwide, as well as buildings.

25|$|The {{properties}} of a polyurethane are {{greatly influenced by}} the types of isocyanates and polyols used to make it. Long, flexible segments, contributed by the <b>polyol,</b> give soft, elastic polymer. High amounts of crosslinking give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low crosslinking give a polymer that is very stretchy, short chains with lots of crosslinks produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate crosslinking give a polymer useful for making foam. The crosslinking present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high. In some respects a piece of polyurethane {{can be regarded as}} one giant molecule. One consequence of this is that typical polyurethanes do not soften or melt when they are heated; they are thermosetting polymers. The choices available for the isocyanates and polyols, in addition to other additives and processing conditions allow polyurethanes to have the very wide range of properties that make them such widely used polymers.|$|E

Chapter 1 provides {{the introduction to the}} chemistry of polyurethanes, plant oils and plant oil based <b>polyols.</b> Chapter 2 focus on making oligomeric <b>polyols</b> from unsaturated plant oils through epoxidation and subsequent epoxide ring opening oligomerization that yielded oligomeric <b>polyols.</b> The properties of these oligomeric <b>polyols</b> were influence by the level of unsaturation of the plant oils. In addition, catalyst loading, monomer concentration and reaction time play vital role in determining the properties of the oligomeric <b>polyols.</b> Plant oil based <b>polyols</b> were also prepared by epoxide ring opening with renewable polyhydric alcohols that provide a variety of plant oil based <b>polyols</b> for polyurethane synthesis. Chapter 3 focus on the synthesis of polyurethanes (PU) from various types of plant oil based <b>polyols</b> as well as the evaluation of the mechanical properties of these synthesized PU.

25|$|First, {{gum base}} is {{previously}} prepared through a melting and straining or filtering process. The formulation for gum base is proprietary information known to few individuals within each gum-producing company. Next, other ingredients such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners and flavors {{are added to}} the gum base until the warm mixture thickens like dough. The gum base mixture is heated during this mixing process in order to increase the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape the gum. Next, the gum goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut and wrap (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the extruder using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums. Next, gum is either conditioned by being sprinkled with a powdered <b>polyol</b> or coated via the application of subsequent layers of coating using temperature controlled coating basins before it is sent to packaging.|$|E

2500|$|Hydrogenation is {{a useful}} means for {{converting}} unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives. [...] Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles, which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines.

E.g. 1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. Xylitol, a <b>polyol,</b> is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar xylose, an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles, while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile. For example, isophorone diamine, a precursor to the polyurethane monomer isophorone diisocyanate, is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation/reductive amination by ammonia, wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} goal of {{this research}} is to produce hydrogen from biosustainable <b>polyols,</b> compounds containing a hydrocarbon chain with neighboring hydroxyl groups, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Hydrogen is an energy carrier which can replace oil and reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions when it is generated from renewable sources. At present, hydrogen is derived from fossil fuels such as natural gas, naphtha or coal. We show that hydrogen can be produced by reforming of glycerol, sorbitol, glucose or sucrose in water at a low temperature over supported metal catalysts. A thermodynamic analysis that forms the basis of the process compares aqueous phase reforming of <b>polyols</b> with steam reforming of alkanes. Catalyst screening involving different noble metals and different supports indicates that alumina supported platinum catalysts are effective for hydrogen production by aqueous phase reforming of <b>polyols.</b> In an attempt to achieve high hydrogen yields, the effects of operating temperature, pressure, and nature of the feed are studied. Higher operation temperatures favor higher hydrogen yields while hydrogen production is strongly inhibited by high system pressure. Short chain <b>polyols</b> have better hydrogen selectivities than long chain <b>polyols.</b> An effort is made to show that valuable chemicals can be derived from <b>polyols.</b> Glycerol and other <b>polyols</b> are potential sources of value-added chemicals, such as 1, 2 -propanediol, a major commodity chemical now obtained from petroleum derived propylene. It can be generated by an alternative renewable route through hydrogenolysis of biodiesel-derived glycerol. The effects of hydrogenolysis conditions such as reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure, water content in the feed and catalysts are evaluated. Both high temperature and high hydrogen pressure favor 1, 2 -propanediol formation.

2500|$|Polyols for {{flexible}} applications use low functionality initiators such as {{dipropylene glycol}} (f=2), glycerine (f=3), or a sorbitol/water solution (f=2.75). Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as sucrose (f=8), sorbitol (f=6), toluenediamine (f=4), and Mannich bases (f=4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide {{is added to}} the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many <b>polyol</b> properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styreneâ€“acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone.
