5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with <b>potassium</b> <b>cyanide</b> and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E

ATSDR has derived an intermediate oral MRL of 0. 05 mg/kg/day for cyanide based on a NOAEL of 4. 5 mg/kg/day and a LOAEL of 12. 5 mg/kg/day from a study in which 10 male and 10 female rats were given 0. 2 – 12. 5 mg/kg/day cyanide, as sodium cyanide, in the drinking water for 13 weeks (NTP 1993). EPA reference doses (RfDs) have been established for chronic oral exposure to cyanide and its compounds. These RfDs range from 2 x 10 - 1 mg/kg/day for <b>potassium</b> silver <b>cyanide</b> to 5 x 10 - 3 mg/kg/day for copper cyanide.

An EPA reference concentration (RfC) exists only for chronic inhalation exposure to hydrogen cyanide; this RfC is 3 x 10 - 3 mg/m 3. The RfC was based on central nervous system and thyroid effects in a human occupational study (El Ghawabi et al. 1975).

The study covered {{a wide range of}} geometric parameters such as side of the plate (Sp), thickness of the plate (Tp) and distance of the plate from the entrance of the test section (h). The results revealed that the mass transfer coefficient increased with increase in velocity, side of the plate (Sp), thickness of the plate (Tp) and decreased with increase in distance of the plate from the entrance of the test section (h).

40|$|The {{introduction}} of this thesis reviews the three areas {{of importance to}} the research carried out. These are the nitro-Mannich reaction, the conjugate addition of nucleophiles to nitro-alkenes and the diastereoselectivity of electrophilic additions to substrates bearing an α-stereocentre. The Results and Discussion details the research carried out into {{the development of a}} one-pot 1, 4 -addition/nitro-Mannich reaction. Initially the research focused on triggering the reaction using a cyanide nucleophile. Three cyanide sources were investigated, trimethylsilylcyanide, <b>potassium</b> ferrous <b>cyanide</b> and acetone cyanohydrin. Although the desired one-pot reaction was not achieved using any of these reagents, a new method for the addition of cyanide to nitro-alkenes was successfully developed, and the use of these unusual but highly versatile synthetic building blocks was briefly demonstrated. More success was achieved with alkyl nucleophiles from dialkylzinc reagents. A one-pot 1, 4 -addition/nitro-Mannich sequence was discovered and optimised using diethylzinc. During the optimisation it was realised that the diastereoselectivity of the reaction was tuneable by the choice of solvent, using THF as the solvent provides the syn/anti-diastereoisomer as the major product, whist reactions in Et 2 O provide the syn/syn-diastereoisomer as the major product. The reaction scope was explored, and the reaction was rendered asymmetric via the employment of chiral additives. The reaction scope was determined to be very general, providing high levels of relative and absolute control across three contiguous stereocentres {{for a wide range of}} nitro alkenes and imines, and was also applicable to dimethylzinc and diphenylzinc. Finally a model was proposed for the resulting, solvent dependent stereochemistry. Conclusions regarding the research carried out are presented, along with suggested future studies to be undertaken. These include reactions to further probe the mechanism and stereochemical model, as well as to increase the utility of the reaction further. The experimental section provides procedures and data for all novel compounds, X-ray crystallographic data and a comprehensive list of references...|$|R

In this study, we showed that HIH significantly attenuated a depressor response induced by acute hypoxia. Methodology/Principal Findings: Sprague-Dawley rats received HIH in a hypobaric chamber simulating an altitude of 5000 m. The artery blood pressure (ABP), heart rate (HR) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were recorded in anesthetized control rats and rats received HIH. The baseline ABP, HR and RSNA were not different between HIH and control rats. Acute hypoxia-induced decrease in ABP was significantly attenuated in HIH rat compared with control rats. However, acute hypoxia-induced increases in HR and RSNA were greater in HIH rat than in control rats. After removal of bilateral ascending depressor nerves, acute hypoxia-induced depressor and sympathoexcitatory responses were comparable in control and HIH rats. Furthermore, acute hypoxia-induced depressor and sympathoexcitatory responses did not differ between control and HIH groups after blocking ATP-dependent K+ channels by glibenclamide.

De Beers boron-doped diamond electrodes, manufactured by chemical vapour deposition and containing varying amounts of boron, were therefore investigated {{in order to determine}} their suitability for future electrochemical applications. These electrodes were initially characterised using techniques such as SEM, LA-ICP-MS, Raman spectroscopy and XPS. The electrochemical behaviour of these electrodes was investigated in two redox systems (<b>potassium</b> iron (III) <b>cyanide</b> and cerium (III) sulphate) and two biological systems (dopamine and ascorbic acid).

Porous boron-doped diamond, a novel electrode material, was used for the electrochemical detection of thyroid hormones (L-T 3 and L-T 4). These hormones have never previously been investigated using a boron-doped diamond electrode. The De Beers boron-doped diamond electrode was found to outperform the conventional glassy carbon electrode, which fouled very easily, in the detection of dopamine. Peak separation between dopamine and the interfering ascorbic acid was attained at a pretreated boron-doped diamond electrode.
