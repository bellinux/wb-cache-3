Examples of common outsourced activities involving contractors are usually maintenance and installation tasks, such as assembling pipelines, hot work (welding storage tanks or <b>pipe</b> <b>parts</b> that are connected to equipment containing dangerous substances), cleaning and painting. Contract workers are generally {{not familiar with the}} site or installation and cannot be assumed to have much knowledge about the risks associated with the dangerous substances on the site. Risks that are obvious to employees may not be at all obvious to contract workers. Hence, to a large extent, the individual risk to contractors at a hazard installation is potentially higher than to employees of the site. JRC. G. 5 -Security technology assessmen...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of polyethylene gas pipes by means of x-ray diffraction, which have been in use for 35 years for the supply of gas. A lifetime of 50 years was predicted for these polyethylene (PE) pipes of first generation. A remaining life time of 15 years for all gas pipes installed in the seventies has thus to be expected. In order to prevent expensive and complex replacement of pipes after failure, parts of the pipes are removed from the gas grid. Afterwards, so-called creeping tests are conducted, which serve as a simulation method for the ageing behaviour and for the estimation of the remaining life time. Ageing processes are atomic modifications, for which creeping tests are in- sensitive. In order to gain a more detailed insight into these ageing processes and to identify indicators for ageing, <b>pipe</b> <b>parts</b> {{have been exposed to}} high temperatures and pressures. This procedure leads to an artificial ageing of the material additionally to the natural ageing due to the 35 years period of use. Sample slices have been prepared out of these artificially aged <b>pipe</b> <b>parts</b> and out of the corresponding natural aged pipe, in order to analyse the material's structure depending on the position within the pipe wall and to compare the results. X-ray diffraction, small angle x-ray scattering and x- ray tomography experiments have been conducted at di erent experimental stations to investigate the materials structure on nanometre and micrometre length scales. The sample's crystallinity of the semicrystalline material {{turned out to be the}} searched indicator for ageing. With increasing age, the material becomes more crystalline and thus more brittle. Furthermore, this change was the most pronounced at the inner surface of the pipe wall. Texture analysis showed moreover a preferred orientation of unit cells parallel to the long axis of the pipe, which is also stronger pronounced at the inner surface than for the rest of the pipe wall. These are thus most vulnerable for material failure...|$|E

At first, the internal pressure amount, when a fully plastic state for these components is created, is solved. The amount of the limit pressure is determined analytically, numerically and by appropriate normative relations. The results and stress diagrams of individual solutions are mutually compared. Furthermore, these components are solved in the creep and {{are exposed to the}} maximum allowable normative internal pressure for 200, 000 hours according to the standard – the operating time of components. The place of the maximum equivalent creep strain and the place of the maximum equivalent stress is examined. In these places the principal stresses are depicted depending on the D/d ratio. The results and stress diagrams of individual dimension series are mutually compared. From the available literary sources the condition of the limit state reach is chosen, according to which the evaluation of the limit state reach for individual components is carried out...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} consisted in {{the investigation}} of the flame-sprayed layers and their suitability to protect pipe joints under building site conditions against corrosion. Furthermore, a technical equipment had to set up to ensure a reproducible coating process. Therefore, a device has been assembled that allows programmed coating sequences of sheets and <b>pipe</b> <b>parts.</b> An external powder feeder was constructed to transport the polymer powder to the spray gun for a stable and adjustable feeding process as well. In coordination with the feeding rate, the coating velocity and the number of single coating steps, the layer thickness can be varied. The mechanical investigation of sprayed layers revealed that lower tension strengths will be obtained compared to the non-sprayed material. Besides, a general impairment of the properties was measured, such as the decrease of the elongation after break and the raise of the young's modulus. Voids and interfaces between embedded particles within the layer as well as a higher surface roughness have been seen as the cause of these effects. Yet, comparisons between sprayed and non-sprayed sintered layers have shown that for equal void contents still different mechanical properties were measured. (orig.)

40|$|Techniques {{that can}} {{increase}} the SI- engine efficiency while keeping the emissions very low {{is to reduce the}} engine displacement volume combined with a charging system. Advanced systems are needed for an effective boosting of the engine and today 1 D engine simulation tools are often used for their optimization. This thesis concerns 1 D engine simulation of a turbocharged SI engine and the introduction of CFD computations on components as a way to assess inaccuracies in the 1 D model. 1 D engine simulations have been performed on a turbocharged SI engine and the results have been validated by on-engine measurements in test cell. The operating points considered have been in the engine’s low speed and load region, with the turbocharger’s waste-gate closed. The instantaneous on-engine turbine efficiency was calculated for two different turbochargers based on high frequency measurements in test cell. Unfortunately the instantaneous mass flow rates and temperatures directly upstream and downstream of the turbine could not be measured and simulated values from the calibrated engine model were used. The on-engine turbine efficiency was compared with the efficiency computed by the 1 D code using steady flow data to describe the turbine performance. The results show that the on-engine turbine efficiency shows a hysteretic effect over the exhaust pulse so that the discrepancy between measured and quasi-steady values increases for decreasing mass flow rate after a pulse peak. Flow modeling in pipe geometries that can be representative to those of an exhaust manifold, single bent pipes and double bent pipes and also the outer runners of an exhaust manifold, have been computed in both 1 D and 3 D under steady and pulsating flow conditions. The results have been compared in terms of pressure losses. The results show that calculated pressure gradient for a straight pipe under steady flow is similar using either 1 D or 3 D computations. The calculated pressure drop over a bend is clearly higher 1 D engine simulations of turbocharged engines are difficult to using 1 D computations compared to 3 D computations, both for steady and pulsating flow. Also, the slow decay of the secondary flow structure that develops over a bend, gives a higher pressure gradient in the 3 D calculations compared to the 1 D calculation in the straight <b>pipe</b> <b>parts</b> downstream of a bend.

This paper (Part III [...] Off-center cracks, restraint of bending, thickness transition, and weld residual stresses) examines several practical aspects of crack-opening-area analysis involving off-center cracks, restraint of pressure-induced bending, girth-weld nozzle cracks at thickness transition, and weld-induced residual stresses. Currently, there are no engineering methods or guidelines available to analyze pipes under these conditions. Both linear-elastic and elastic-plastic finite element {{analyses were conducted to}} determine quantitatively their effects on various crack-opening characteristics. From the results of these analyses, recommendations are made on how an off-center crack can be analyzed based on fracturemechanics equations for a centered crack.

Cracks located in the thickness transition with thickness gradients on both sides of a nozzle girth weld were analyzed. Finally, simplifie [...] ...|$|R

The bases of the numerical model are also mentioned. Subsequently, the experimental results are contrasted with those produced by the numerical model, obtaining excellent correlations. It was possible to conclude that the numerical model is a useful tool for the design of this type of pipes, which represents an important step forward to establish the structural fibres as reinforcement for concrete pipes.
