500|$|While {{acknowledging}} that plea bargains {{such as the}} one Webster was probably offered are common and help avoid expensive and time-consuming trials, Byrne-Armstrong stated that accepting Webster's confession helped create a legal fiction that he unquestionably acted alone in both sexually assaulting and murdering Leigh. The actual level of sexual violence that Leigh sustained was accordingly, she said, [...] "all but erased" [...] from the sentencing, and it appeared Justice Wood had only been given the limited information from the <b>post-mortem</b> <b>report</b> that would have corroborated Webster's confession.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} report of the Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young Registry. The Registry which {{was set up in}} 2009 will {{document}} the cause of sudden cardiac death in young people aged 15 - 35 years in Ireland through expert panel review and analysis of <b>post-mortem</b> <b>reports.</b> The current report deals with the years 2005 - 2007 inclusive. This data has been collected with the co-operation of the Central Statistic Office (CSO) and pathologists and coroners throughout the country without whose assistance {{it would not have been}} possible. All deaths in this report were identified through the Central Statistics Office using a wide range of International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes under which a Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) could potentially be coded. All <b>post-mortem</b> <b>reports</b> were supplied through the offices of the relevant coroner. Only deaths in which adequately detailed <b>post-mortem</b> <b>reports</b> were available have been included in the report.

Lord Hutton also decided that evidence related to the death, including the <b>post-mortem</b> <b>report</b> and photographs of the body, should remain classified for 70 years. In October 2010, Hutton claimed that he had done so to protect Kelly's wife and daughters from the distress of further media reports about the death, saying: [...] "My request was not a concealment of evidence because every matter of relevance had been examined or was available for examination during the public inquiry. There was no secrecy surrounding the postmortem report because it had always been available for examination and questioning by counsel representing the interested parties during the inquiry." ...|$|E

Experiments performed by Mengele on twins included unnecessary amputation of limbs, intentionally infecting one twin with typhus or other diseases, and transfusing the blood of one twin into the other. Many of the victims died while undergoing these procedures. After an experiment was over, the twins were sometimes killed and their bodies dissected.

40|$|IT {{is still}} not clear whether pemphigoid is {{associated}} with malignant neoplasms more commonly than one would expect by chance. A strong body of dermatological opinion, however, (for example Sneddon, 1963; Wilson, 1967; Cormia, 1968) accepts {{the significance of this}} association. Only reports since 1953 can be relevant as it was in this year that pemphigoid was separated from the other blistering diseases (Lever, 1953). In a survey of the recent literature, Boyd (1964) found 9 cases in which pemphigoid was accompanied by malignancy and described a tenth.
