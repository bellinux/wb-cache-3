40|$|Suicide as an {{individual}} event {{as well as a}} social phenomenon attracts great interest and attention in various spheres, both in the immediate environment of the self-murderer and in broader public. The definition of suicide differs according to authors and changes in the course of historical development. Most definitions are identical in two essential aspects of suicidal behavior. These are a voluntary individual's intention to terminate his life and a purposeful behaviour leading to death. Suicide is the conscious and intentional killing of oneself. About 95 % of suicidal attempts are just acute intoxications by any amount or kind of a <b>poisonous</b> <b>substance.</b> <b>Acute</b> intoxication belongs to a group of serious conditions threatening human health and life. Acute poisoning is one of the frequent admission diagnoses in the Departments of anesthesiology and resuscitation and Intensive care units. 80 % of poisonings are caused by drugs. Damage to the organism by ingesting a <b>poisonous</b> <b>substance</b> is the more significant the longer is the interval between the exposure to noxae and the professional medical assistance provision. For the future fate of the patient the medical equipment and the competence of health professionals who provide intensive care for these patients is crucial. After stabilization of all physiological functions, balancing inner environment of the patient and after the time that may have led to late complications of intoxication, the following phase of treatment is provided by psychological and psychiatric interventions. Determination of suicidal risk among the most common challenge in urgent psychiatry is suicide risk assessment. The aim is to prevent further suicide attempts. The objective of the thesis was to determine, with regard to the competence of nurses, the predominant character of patients´ experience after intoxication, and also the reasons for aggressive behavior of intoxicated patients towards the nursing staff. The third objective was to establish a standard of nursing care of intoxicated patients. The research was designed as explorative with the goal to map the nursing process in intoxicated patients and to provide information for the establishment of the standard of nursing care, which should include both somatic and psychological aspects. Quantitative and qualitative methods were combined. The outcomes of the thesis should lead to detection of the most frequent problems in nursing care for patients with intentional intoxication with suicidal tendency and the establishment of nursing standards to help improve the care of these patients...|$|R

The association reduces the probability of consuming the same substance (or something that tastes similar) in the future, thus avoiding further poisoning.
