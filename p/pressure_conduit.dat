30|$|As {{found in}} the time series of both the plume height and the SO 2 mass, the {{degassing}} activity was intensified especially in middle August. Then, both values decreased in September, and some extremely high values were observed again in early October (Fig.  5 a, b). The maxima in middle August coincides with the inflation timing of the deep magmatic source observed by GNSS networks (JMA 2017). Thus, the input of deep magma might have started since this period. Both values slightly decreased in September. In early October, the plume height started to increase since 1 October, and the SO 2 mass also increased on 2 October {{as shown in the}} daily SO 2 map (Fig.  5 f). Both values temporally decreased, but the plume height and the SO 2 mass started to increase again on 6 and 7 October, respectively. The decreasing trend from August to October is similar to the decreasing trend of the <b>conduit</b> <b>pressure</b> before Vulcanian explosions proposed by Iguchi et al. (2008). Although the duration of a decrease in this study is much longer than the precursory change in the case of Iguchi et al.

Following this model, the increase in early October might be explicable by leakage of the accumulated gas just before the explosion. This leakage might have contributed to a decrease of the <b>conduit</b> <b>pressure.</b> Consequently, an interaction of magma with infiltrating waters from the hydrothermal system into the conduit and/or a sudden outgassing of the magma might trigger the explosion.|$|R

There were 62 pts who were advised against or had not attempted pregnancy, no pts reported infertility. Fourteen pts had 24 pregnancies resulting in 10 live births, (including one twin pregnancy). There was one neonatal death due to abruptio placenta at 27 wks. Seven deliveries (including the twins; i. e. 8 births), were vaginal and 2 were by cesarean section. Six pregnancies were terminated due to unoperated maternal PA. Miscarriage occurred in 9 / 18 (50 %) of uninterrupted pregnancies in 7 pts (3 in pts without prior cardiac surgery, 4 in pts after palliation, and 2 after complete repair). Six pts had successful pregnancies; 2 unoperated pts had 3 deliveries (including twins; i. e. 4 births), 2 palliated pts had 3 deliveries, and 2 pts had 2 successful and 2 unsuccessful pregnancies after complete repair. Two pts had preterm labor, 1 due to toxemia (twin pregnancy). One pregnancy was complicated by high RV <b>pressure</b> (from <b>conduit</b> obstruction), and 1 by CHF requiring hospitalization for the last month of pregnancy (no prior surgery). The mean maternal Hb in pts with successful pregnancy was 14. 9 ± 1. 3 gms vs 18. 3 ± 2. 1 gms in pts who terminated pregnancy (p= 0. 01) and 16. 4 ± 2. 2 gms in pts with unsuccessful pregnancies (p=NS).

30|$|By {{removing}} the low-permeability debris layer, the <b>conduit</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases. Such a pressure reduction allows the inflow of the hydrothermal system (Namiki et al. 2016).

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is {{thinning}} rapidly and contains sufficient water equivalent to raise global sea levels by ~ 7 m. The dynamic response of ice sheets to rising air temperatures has been well documented, whereby increased surface meltwater accessing the ice sheet bed results in high subglacial water pressures that lubricate the bed and enhance basal motion. This could in turn drastically amplify the contribution of GrIS to sea-level rise (SLR). However, the inadequate formulation of ice dynamics in current ice-sheet models was identified as the largest source of uncertainty in SLR projections in the latest IPCC AR 4 report. This thesis focuses on the supraglacial and subglacial hydrology of the Paakitsoq region in western Greenland to provide an insight into present-day dynamic behaviour of the ice sheet, and its potential response to climatic warming over the 21 st century. Surface meltwater production and routing for 2005 are simulated using a surface mass balance model and a positive-degree day model, which in turn provides the input to a distributed, physically based model of subglacial drainage applied to Paakitsoq. The drainage model is then forced with future climate scenarios based on the IPCC’s new framework of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The simulations produce a distinctive split in “marginal” and “inland” drainage behaviour at Paakitsoq, whereby the inland system is typified by low discharge magnitudes, high water <b>pressures</b> and small <b>conduit</b> CSAs, and the marginal system displays high discharge, mid to low <b>pressures</b> and higher <b>conduit</b> CSAs. Comparisons between measured and modelled proglacial discharge suggest that the appropriate k factor (the ratio of water pressure to ice overburden pressure) for modelling the study system is between 0. 925 and 0. 95. The most extreme climate scenario predicts a ~ 7 oC rise from 2010 to 2100, which will result in proglacial discharge increasing {{by the end of the}} 21 st century to levels four times greater than today. However, significant inter-annual variability in melt production at Paakitsoq will probably lead to high-melt years whose peak subglacial discharges may be even more intense. This could cause considerable inland migration of channelised behaviour. The implications for future ice dynamics in the Paakitsoq region are considered...|$|R

40|$|Volcanic eruptions vary in {{intensity}} {{due to a}} variety of physical and chemical variables. One of the most significant variables that determines if an eruption will be explosive or effusive is the amount of pressure build-up inside the volcano conduit {{at the time of the}} eruption. The source of this pressure is primarily due to exsolved gases (bubbles) in the magma. Under certain conditions, bubbles are able to grow and form extensive networks within the conduit. These bubble-networks are believed to be the primary method for gasses to escape from the magma during an eruption, reducing the <b>pressure</b> within the <b>conduit.</b> Therefore, if the gasses are able to escape from the volcano conduit, an eruption will be effusive, analogous to typical Hawaiian eruptions. However, if the gas is not able to escape, pressure will build up and the volcano will explode in a high-intensity eruption, such as with Mt. St. Helens in 1980. We can better understand why some volcanoes explode and others fizzle by understanding how bubbles behave in the volcano conduit during an eruption...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{interpretation}} of seismic surveys aims at going beyond structural characterization of reservoirs {{on the basis}} of the spatial distribution of velocity. In particular, hydraulic properties of fluid-filled reservoirs are of prime interest for hydrocarbon exploration or water-reservoir management. Such analyses require a physics-based understanding of the processes involved with the propagation of seismic waves in fractured rocks. The main objective of this work is the investigation of the hydro-mechanics of fluid-filled fracture networks and the related diffusion of fluid <b>pressure</b> in the <b>conduits.</b> We apply methods of computational homogenization to discuss an effective Skempton coefficient and analyze it for different setups in time as well as in frequency domain. In the first setup we investigate a modified version of Cryer's problem embedding a spherical sample in a mantle of constant thickness. The kernel and the mantle constitute porous media but with different material properties. The second setup aims to investigate the hydro-mechanical properties of stochastically generated fracture networks. In both setups we apply Biot's theory of linear consolidation. Evaluating the effective Skempton coefficient predicted by computational homogenization for those cases we can show limitations of previously performed laboratory measurements of the Skempton coefficient...|$|R
