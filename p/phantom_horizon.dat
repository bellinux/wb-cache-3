50|$|The concept behind <b>Phantom</b> on the <b>Horizon</b> {{tells the}} fictional {{story of a}} Spanish galleon meeting with a ghost ship from another dimension.|$|R
50|$|The Fall of Troy {{began working}} on <b>Phantom</b> on the <b>Horizon</b> five years prior to its release in the gap between The Fall of Troy and Doppelgänger. In 2004, demos {{of some of the}} tracks that would later be {{featured}} on <b>Phantom</b> on the <b>Horizon</b> were leaked onto the internet and dubbed Ghostship Demos EP. The demos were never released in a physical form of media. In October 2008, The Fall of Troy secretly recorded the album and released it the following month on November 28, 2008.|$|R
2500|$|On November 28, 2008, <b>Phantom</b> on the <b>Horizon</b> was released. The EP {{features}} {{all five}} Ghostship parts, with interludes. Erak {{has described the}} album as [...] "one song separated by tracks." [...] The album was played in its entirety on their West Coast and East Coast tours, followed by some [...] "deep cuts" [...] from the group's catalogue each night of the tour. Only 3,000 copies have been pressed (despite the misprint reverse side of the <b>Phantom</b> on the <b>Horizon</b> CD casing numbering the CD's {{out of a total}} of 3,300) and were sold online and at shows. After the 1500 physical copies held aside for online ordering sold out on December 1, an MP3 version of the album became available online retailers such as iTunes. A vinyl edition followed in 2009, with 1,000 clear copies sold through Hot Topic stores and 1,000 orange copies sold directly from the band's website.|$|R
2500|$|The trio also {{recorded}} their independently released Ghostship EP {{shortly after the}} release of the self-titled, in 2004. Early versions of the demos included keyboards by Jesse Erickson of Mukilteo, WA and had no vocals. The demos on the Ghostship EP; Part I, II, IV, and V, showcase the <b>Phantom</b> on the <b>Horizon</b> concept album, while [...] "Macaulay McCulkin" [...] is on 2005's Doppelgänger.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Phantom</b> on the <b>Horizon</b> is {{a concept}} EP by American {{progressive}} rock band The Fall of Troy that was released on November 28, 2008 through Equal Vision Records. It is the completed version of the Ghostship Demos EP that the band released in 2004. This rerecorded version of the original demos features five [...] "chapters" [...] and was produced by Casey Bates (Fear Before, Chiodos, Portugal. The Man).|$|R
50|$|In the Unlikely Event is {{the fourth}} {{full-length}} album by American progressive rock band The Fall of Troy, that was released on October 6, 2009. The album was recorded with producer Terry Date {{and is the only}} full-length album to feature bassist Frank Ene (first featured on <b>Phantom</b> on the <b>Horizon).</b> It was recorded at Studio Lithio. The album featured a slightly less aggressive style compared to the band's earlier work, in turn facing mixed critical reception.|$|R
40|$|Recently several tools {{have emerged}} to {{dynamically}} build computing environments {{at the level}} of individual nodes. These environments can be based on Bare Metal or Virtual machines and the software build includes IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service e. g. operating system) or that plus PaaS (Platform as a Service e. g. MPI and data libraries) and SaaS (Software as a Service e. g. full data analytics). These tools include templated image libraries [1], authentication and authorization, accounting and metrics [2], user interfaces (dashboards like Nimbus <b>Phantom</b> or OpenStack <b>Horizon),</b> DevOps (e. g. Salt, Chef, Puppet), dynamic provisioning [2] and higher level tools at scheduling level and above. These can be combined with tools like Rocks to manage clusters and support software defined (virtual) clusters. Further at the NaaS (Network as a Service) layer [3], technologies like OpenFlow and projects like GENI support software defined networks that allow higher performance interconnections; combining these ideas, we find software defined systems. The GENI Network Stitching Architecture would perhaps be used [4]. As well as building general distributed compute grids, we consider here the special case of a software defined system that includes localized computing (e. g. a cluster, cloud or even exascale machine) linked using software defined networks to distributed data with software defined networks. Consider the architecture of a data repository which often in the past focused on storage an...|$|R
