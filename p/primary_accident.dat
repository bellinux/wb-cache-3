40|$|Secondary {{accident}} statistics {{can be useful}} for studying the impact of traffic incident management strategies. An easy-to-implement methodology is presented for classifying secondary accidents using data fusion of a police accident database with intranet incident reports. A current method for classifying secondary accidents uses a static threshold that represents the spatial and temporal region of influence of the <b>primary</b> <b>accident,</b> such as two miles and one hour. An accident is considered secondary if it occurs upstream from the <b>primary</b> <b>accident</b> and is within the duration and queue of the <b>primary</b> <b>accident.</b> However, using the static threshold may result in both false positives and negatives because accident queues are constantly varying. The methodology presented in this report seeks to improve upon this existing method by making the threshold dynamic. An incident progression curve is used to {{mark the end of}} the queue throughout the entire incident. Four steps in the development of incident progression curves are described. Step one is the processing of intranet incident reports. Step two is the filling in of incomplete incident reports. Step three is the nonlinear regression of incident progression curves. Step four is the merging of individual incident progression curves into one master curve. To illustrate this methodology, 5, 514 accidents from Missouri freeways were analyzed. The results show that secondary accidents identified by dynamic versus static thresholds can differ by more than 30...|$|E
30|$|Up to now, {{the only}} {{effective}} solution {{appears to have}} been to upgrade LX safety systems [2] even though in over 90 % of the cases, the <b>primary</b> <b>accident</b> cause seems to stem from inadequate human behavior rather than any technical, rail-based issue. Human causes from roadside include all intentional and non-intentional road vehicle driver errors; zig-zagging, warning light violation due to inattention, sun shine or perception of waiting time. The standards set by the European railway sector involve high safety requirements for LX systems which represent a substantial cost which in turn hinders the technological upgrade of existing systems. Railway standards already include a definition of safety risk. It is based on a classification of risks ranging from low to high, and according to which unacceptable levels of risk must be eliminated by the technical system. Nevertheless, the lack of an approved common safety methodology which would allow the industry to quantify the risk to be reduced still leads to the imposition of the highest safety integrity levels for technical solutions in most European countries.|$|E
40|$|AbstractChinese {{coal mine}} safety {{situation}} {{has been very}} serious compared to other countries, and unsafe behavior is especially an important factor causing Chinese coal mine accidents. In this paper, it first through statistics finds {{that the proportion of}} gas explosion's death toll is the largest in the total death toll of Chinse coal mine accidents, and live-line work is the unsafe behavior causing the most death toll in Chinese coal mine gas explosion accidents. Then it gives a brief introduction and comparative analysis on the main behavior control methods at home and abroad – American DuPont company's STOP method, Japanese KYT method of Sumitomo Corporation, and domestic fine, hand pointing and oral description, safety education and training method, etc., and finds that each method has its own merits and faults. On this basis, combining the application of situation teaching and virtual reality in coal mines, two other unsafe behavior correction methods are proposed for Chinese coal mines: scenario design and virtual reality games. At the same time, it also suggests that we can first consider and choose live-line work - the unsafe behavior causing the most death toll in Chinese coal mine's <b>primary</b> <b>accident</b> of gas explosion, to design these two kinds of methods...|$|E

40|$|The {{so called}} {{cascading}} events, {{which lead to}} high-impact low-frequency scenarios are rising concern worldwide. A chain of events result in a major industrial accident with dreadful (and often unpredicted) consequences. Cascading events can {{be the result of}} the realization of an external threat, like a terrorist attack a natural disaster or of “domino effect”. During domino events the escalation of a <b>primary</b> <b>accident</b> is driven by the propagation of the primary event to nearby units, causing an overall increment of the accident severity and an increment of the risk associated to an industrial installation. Also natural disasters, like intense flooding, hurricanes, earthquake and lightning are found capable to enhance the risk of an industrial area, triggering loss of containment of hazardous materials and in major accidents. The scientific community usually refers to those accidents as “NaTechs”: natural events triggering industrial accidents. In this document, a state of the art of available approaches to the modelling, assessment, prevention and management of domino and NaTech events is described. On the other hand, the relevant work carried out during past studies still needs to be consolidated and completed, in order to be applicable in a real industrial framework.

30|$|Every year, {{more than}} 400 people are killed in over 1, 200 {{accidents}} at road-rail level crossings in the European Union. Together with tunnels and specific road black spots, level crossings {{have been identified}} as being a particular weak point in road infrastructure, seriously jeopardizing road safety. In the case of railway transport, level crossings can represent as much as 29 % of all fatalities caused by railway operations. Up to now, the only effective solution appears to involve upgrading level crossing safety systems even though in more than 90 % of cases the <b>primary</b> <b>accident</b> cause is inadequate or improper human behavior rather than any technical, rail-based issue. This article provides results of research done on possible technological solutions {{to reduce the number of}} accidents at level crossings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the latter. Elements of these recommendations and related research activities constitute the main focus of the research work described in this paper. It is organized as follows: In Section 2, we consider statistical data related to LX accidents in certain given European countries. These statistics as well as a European Commission Directive related to safety targets are analyzed and the main trends are drawn. The study was carried out on the basis of the classification by the European Railway Agency of active LXs and passive LXs. These results form the foundation for the work described in Section 3. Section 3 focuses on advanced technology to improve LXs safety. The main thrust of the study is to evaluate low-cost, standard technology that can contribute to a direct decrease in the number of accidents, at an affordable cost. Existing surveillance technologies already used in rail or road transport are first considered. To facilitate LX bi-modality, special emphasis is put on technical solutions which have already demonstrated high efficiency in both environments. In Section 4, the mode of operation of each potential solution is modeled and evaluated considering several operational scenarii, in order to evaluate the aggregate benefits of all the input. Setting models to describe the dynamics surrounding the LX environment will prepare a basis to support the decision making process of a joint rail and road sector strategy on how to control LXs. Finally, section 5 brings the study to a close with a list of the main areas in which to concentrate our future work.|$|E
