5|$|Ngoia <b>Pollard</b> Napaltjarri (born c. 1948; {{also known}} as Ngnoia) is a Walpiri-speaking Indigenous artist from Australia's Western Desert region. Ngoia <b>Pollard</b> married Jack Tjampitjinpa, who became an artist working with the Papunya Tula company, and they had five children.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pollard</b> was at {{the center}} of a small brawl with the San Francisco 49ers in their game on September 28, 1953. The brawl erupted in the fourth quarter, when San Francisco's Charley Powell squared off against <b>Pollard.</b> The Eagles ended up losing 31-21, and <b>Pollard</b> {{received}} no disciplinary action, although Powell was ejected.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war, <b>Pollard</b> served as Assistant Military Liaison Officer at the Australian High Commission, London; during this posting he spent two weeks attached to the British Expeditionary Force in France. Promoted major, he joined the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in June 1940. The provisions of the Defence Act (1903) prohibited members of the PMF (or the CMF) fighting outside Australian territory except as volunteers in the AIF. <b>Pollard</b> was appointed brigade major of the 25th Brigade, an Australian infantry formation raised in England mostly from logistics personnel to help combat a possible invasion by Nazi Germany. The brigade {{became part of the}} Australian 9th Division, and in January 1941 sailed for the Middle East; it was transferred to the 7th Division on arrival. In March, <b>Pollard</b> was assigned to the 7th Division's headquarters staff in Libya under Lieutenant General John Lavarack. On 24April, {{towards the end of the}} campaign in Cyrenaica, <b>Pollard</b> led a raiding party on Giarabub, Libya, to remove Senussi civilians and destroy wells and ammunition. He took command of the 2/31st Battalion at the end of June 1941, during the Syrian campaign, after the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Selwyn Porter, was wounded. A cease-fire on 12July ended the campaign in Syria, and <b>Pollard</b> was mentioned in despatches for his service; the award was gazetted on 30 December 1941.|$|E

5|$|In January 1952, <b>Pollard</b> succeeded Colonel John Wilton as Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters, {{and became}} Chairman of the Joint Planning Committee. That August {{he was one}} of the Australian delegates joining the Minister for External Affairs, Richard Casey, for the inaugural meeting of the ANZUS Council in Honolulu; the US and New Zealand {{delegations}} were led, respectively, by Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Minister for External Affairs Clifton Webb. <b>Pollard</b> also took part in planning for the atomic test at Montebello, Western Australia, in October 1952. Promoted to temporary brigadier in March 1953, <b>Pollard</b> acted as Australian military advisor to Prime Minister Robert Menzies at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London that June. From July to November he served as commander of the Australian Army Component of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea; the role was responsible for managing the turnover of Australian troops in the theatre and the upkeep of their personal records. <b>Pollard</b> was later appointed Deputy Adjutant General at Army Headquarters, and his rank of brigadier became substantive in December 1953.|$|E
5|$|Margaret <b>Pollard,</b> born Margaret Akers in Bristol, Virginia, in {{the early}} 1880s, was the {{youngest}} {{in a family of}} ten children.

In addition, he returned three punts and five kickoffs for 34 and 134 yards, respectively. The Yanks, who offered him a salary of $7,000, waived him in November, and he was signed to the Philadelphia Eagles for $100.|$|E

25|$|An {{incidental}} {{effect of}} <b>pollarding</b> in woodland is {{the encouragement of}} underbrush growth due to increased levels of light reaching the woodland floor. This can increase species diversity. However, in woodland where <b>pollarding</b> was once common but has now ceased, the opposite effect occurs, as the side and top shoots develop into trunk-sized branches.

40|$|Robinia stands under {{different}} <b>pollarding</b> systems. The study of biomass production and soil improvement of two fast growing and multipurpose trees, Leucaena leucocephala and Robinia pseudoacacia, {{was carried out}} in Mosul Forest, in northern Iraq to examine the impact of <b>pollarding</b> height (0, 15, 30 and 45 cm) and frequency (no <b>pollarding,</b> <b>pollarding</b> every three or six months) on growth responses and soil properties. These species are being studied {{as part of a larger}} research programme to develop novel agroforestry systems in Iraq. Leucaena leucocephala showed the greatest response in terms of branching, shoot basal diameter, height, biomass and nitrogen and phosphorus contents of leaves and stems with <b>pollarding</b> every three months at 15 cm. For R. pseudoacacia <b>pollarding</b> once after six months at 45 cm resulted in the greatest growth response of leaves and stems. Physical soil properties such as bulk density, infiltration rate and chemical properties such as pH, total soil organic matter and nitrogen, available potassium and phosphorus were all improved under L. leucocephala and R. pseudoacacia. Management of these trees in Iraq for soil improvement or in agroforestry systems with different crops such as wheat, barley, corn and cotton should take into consideration optimal <b>pollarding</b> frequency and height as well as planting density to produce the desired levels of shade, soil cover and green manure, as well as animal fodder or wood products...|$|R

The tourists were pinned down as <b>Pollard</b> bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run, aiming at leg stump. <b>Pollard</b> was reinforced by Bedser, who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter fell.

40|$|It {{is true that}} {{different}} approaches have been utilised to accelerate the computation of discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves with <b>Pollard's</b> Rho method.

5|$|Ranked {{lieutenant}} in the Permanent Military Force (PMF), <b>Pollard</b> was appointed adjutant/quartermaster of the 17th Battalion (Citizens Military Forces), headquartered at North Sydney, in July 1925. He married Daisy Ethel Potter, a typist, at St Andrew's Anglican Church, Strathfield, on 31 October; The Bathurst Times reported that Daisy cut the cake with her husband's Sword of Honour. <b>Pollard</b> departed for India on attachment to the British Army in September 1927, serving with the Royal Fusiliers and the York and Lancaster Regiment. He returned to Sydney in November the following year and was posted as adjutant/quartermaster to, successively, the 18th Battalion (CMF) and, in September 1932, the 44th Battalion (CMF). In December 1932, while serving with the 44th in Western Australia, {{he was promoted to}} captain. <b>Pollard</b> was camp commandant of the National Rifle Association of Western Australia from 1934 to 1936.

40|$|In {{agroforestry}} systems (AFS) {{with annual}} intercrops, {{the competition for}} light, water and nitrogen plays a key role. Mature trees capture a larger part of the resources, and the yield of the intercrop decreases. When the tree stem density is high (> 50 stems. ha - 1), the yield of the intercrop may therefore drop to unprofitable levels. A possible solution to that competition problem would be {{to reduce the size}} of the trees by <b>pollarding.</b> <b>Pollarded</b> trees produce both timber with the bole and biomass or fodder with the leaves and branches that are regularly pruned every 2 to 10 year. The reduction of the size of the crown would also be profitable to the intercrops, allowing a sustained and profitable yield even with old trees. The concept was evaluated both by modeling with the Hi-sAFe numerical model and by an experiment comparing standard walnut trees and <b>pollarded</b> walnut trees. Numerical runs of the model indicate that AFS with <b>pollarded</b> trees may reach very high levels of tree-crop complementary, achieving higher Land Equivalent Ratios than AFS with standard trees. However, the model predicts that the diameter growth of the trunk could be heavily reduced by the <b>pollarding</b> regime. These predictions should be confirmed by field experiment. We settled an experiment with walnut trees aged 16 years in spring 2013. During the first growing season after <b>pollarding,</b> the girth growth of the <b>pollarded</b> trees was surprisingly not reduced, as compared to standard unpollarded trees. Some hypotheses to explain this behaviour are discussed. If this result is confirmed during the next years, the model should be modified to incorporate this aspect, and the productivity of the AFS with <b>pollarded</b> trees could be even higher...|$|R
