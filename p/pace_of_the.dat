5|$|In April 2014, {{disarmament}} experts such as Ralf Trapp {{characterized the}} <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation as impressively quick. With 92.5% of the arsenal removed or destroyed, Trapp noted {{that many people}} hadn't expected such speed to be achievable given the ongoing civil war.|$|E
5|$|In June 2006 the EIHL {{announced}} {{the adoption of}} the 'zero tolerance' interpretation of the rules with regard to holding, hooking and interference implemented in the National Hockey League during the 2005–06 season. These rules had proved highly successful in the NHL, increasing the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game and leading to a rise in spectator numbers.|$|E
25|$|The DAVID {{trials have}} shown that {{unnecessary}} <b>pacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right ventricle can exacerbate heart failure and increases <b>the</b> incidence <b>of</b> atrial fibrillation. <b>The</b> newer dual chamber devices can keep <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> right ventricle <b>pacing</b> to a minimum and thus prevent worsening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart disease.|$|R
25|$|Dual-chamber pacemaker. Here, wires {{are placed}} in two {{chambers}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart. One lead paces the atrium and one paces the ventricle.

5|$|In a squad {{with much}} less star power than that {{sent to the}} Tour de France, they were again {{middle of the pack}} in the team time trial, {{finishing}} 11th of 22 teams. The squad did not show themselves much, as it was not until stage 10 that they so much as finished in the top ten on a stage. Phinney took fifth place in the stage 10 individual time trial, {{a minute and a half}} off the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day's winner Tony Martin. Frank rode to fourth from a breakaway in the next stage, again a minute and a half off the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day's winner, this time David Moncoutié. All the team had to show for itself from the second half of the Vuelta was a seventh place from Van Avermaet in the field sprint finish to stage 12. Six BMC riders reached the Vuelta's finish, with Van Avermaet in 83rd place being their highest overall finisher.|$|E
5|$|Next, The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) and Kane faced The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns). The <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{match was}} quick; {{the end of}} the match saw Kane being hit by Reigns' {{signature}} spear, and Reigns then hit both Outlaws simultaneously with another spear. The Shield then performed their Triple Powerbomb maneuver on both Outlaws for a decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} elements of first-person shooting; during some sequences the game requires {{a certain number}} of aircraft to be shot down. Battle of Britain received mixed to positive reviews from critics upon release. Critics praised the fast <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gameplay and features, however, one reviewer was divided over the historical accuracy of the battle.|$|E
40|$|Permanent <b>pacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left {{ventricle}} {{was achieved by}} transvenous implantation of a steroid-eluting electrode into the coronary sinus in a patient who had undergone a Fontan operation.

5|$|The {{film was}} an early example of efforts to move beyond theater {{blocking}} conventions. During the police raid, depth was demonstrated by having action take place in both the foreground and the background, and by allowing actors to move between them. This cinematography technique improved <b>the</b> realism and <b>pacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene.|$|R
2500|$|GamePro gave {{a perfect}} score, praising {{graphics}} technology and multiplayer depth. In their review, Edge gave Killzone 2 a 7/10, praising the online multiplayer, attention to detail, [...] "unparalleled graphics" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single-player campaign, but included criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's use <b>of</b> [...] "gameplay clichés" [...] and its weak storyline and characters.|$|R
5|$|Yannick LeJacq of Kotaku, {{commenting on}} the 2014 game MouseCraft which {{incorporates}} elements of Lemmings and Tetris, speculated that games like Lemmings would not be very successful in the current gaming market, as the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game is far too slow to satisfy most players.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} this strength, {{the storm}} slowed and gradually {{took a more}} northwesterly course, heading towards Pinar del Río Province in western Cuba. On September16, the system attained winds of 75mph (120km/h), what would now be considered a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Moving at a slow <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> , <b>the</b> system gradually intensified. Late on September18, {{the center of the}} storm was estimated to have made landfall in Pinar del Río Province with winds of 100mph (155km/h); an atmospheric pressure of 976mbar (hPa; 28.82inHg) was recorded during its passage. The storm's eye passed over the town of Manta for four hours, between 3:00pm and 7:00pm on September17.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of Estonian {{oil shale}} {{resources}} and mining possibilities intensified {{during the early}} 20th century while Estonia {{was part of the}} Russian Empire. Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg (known as Petrograd in 1914–24), but regional fuel resources were in short supply. A large shale oil extraction plant for processing Estonian oil shale was proposed in 1910. The outbreak of World War I, coupled with a fuel supply crisis, accelerated the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{was also}} quiet after lunch, and after one {{long period of}} defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, {{eliciting}} a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and glitches, and the slow <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, {{as part of an}} interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable.|$|E
5|$|Hans Bethe {{once said}} that Klaus Fuchs was the only {{physicist}} he knew who truly changed history. Because {{the head of the}} Soviet project, Lavrenti Beria, used foreign intelligence as a third-party check, rather than giving it directly to the scientists, as he did not trust the information by default, it is unknown whether Fuchs's fission information had a substantial effect. Considering that the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium they could procure, it is hard for scholars to accurately judge how much time this saved.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In {{the quarter}} final against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Arsenal {{initially}} went {{down by a}} goal but an equaliser was gained after a further 15 minutes by Billy Blyth. Both teams had good attacks on goal {{throughout the rest of}} the game, but the only further goal came following a header by Joe Hulme for Arsenal after a run and a cross from Jack Butler. The draw for the semi-final saw Arsenal play Southampton at Stamford Bridge. The muddy state of the pitch hampered the normal <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play shown by Arsenal, but both Buchan and Hulme scored for the gunners to Southampton's single response by Bill Rawlings. Southampton were denied two penalty appeals.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{resembling}} a MOBA, Heavy Metal Machines {{does not follow}} <b>the</b> traditional meaning <b>of</b> this kind of game, especially for not having turrets, different lanes and minions, essential factors for defining a MOBA. Another point that differentiates Heavy Metal Machines from MOBAs is <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, where battles happen with total strength from <b>the</b> very beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match, {{without the need for}} levels or items to be able to destroy your opponents or deliver the bomb.|$|R

5|$|On July 6, Burke {{signed a}} maximum rookie contract—120 {{percent of the}} preset salary scale of $2,032,300—with the Jazz, {{resulting}} in a contract worth in $4,987,320 guaranteed salary for his first two seasons, while the Jazz have team option rights for {{the third and fourth}} years. This cleared the way for Burke to participate in the July 7–12 Orlando Summer League. At point guard, the Jazz had traded Randy Foye and were negotiating with Mo Williams. In the NBA Summer League, Trey Burke shot at 24 percent from the field, including 1–19 on three-point shots, while trying to adjust to the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NBA game. He was even benched for a game. Following Burke's Summer League performance, the Jazz signed John Lucas III.|$|E
5|$|The four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, {{moved to}} the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw {{identical}} scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent. A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1–0 half-time lead. In the second half, {{the strength of the}} United States team was overwhelmed by the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6–1 to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} {{of both the}} car and Webber, who had certainly worked well to out-qualify his vastly more experienced teammate, was highlighted by the closeness they had to other teams which ran the Renault engine and although the Adrian Newey-designed car had flaws which contributed to Webber's scoreless season to that point. Though the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car seemed to be picking up, with Coulthard qualifying in the top-10 for the , Webber was unable to convert his early weekend pace into a competitive grid position due to hydraulic problems. His race was much the same with a similar hydraulic problem leading to him retiring early in the race whilst teammate Coulthard notched up the team's first points with a fifth-place finish.|$|E
