40|$|The {{focus of}} this bachelor's thesis is the {{examination}} of the role of a family back-ground and support which a student does (not) need {{in the course of his}} or her studies. The theoretical part of the study looks into the notion of a family, its func-tion, characteristic features, and family environment. Family, being one of the fac-tors, which determine the student's further development and success, plays a substantial role in his or her period of studies. At the same time, the study is oriented towards a student as an individual personality, and his or her development in the process of <b>psychological</b> <b>maturing</b> which takes place during the period at a secondary school. The practical part of the study is concerned with the student's perception of the family support and his or her family background. The survey is conducted with the method of using a questionnaire distributed to the students of secondary schools in Brno and Olomouc. The retrieved data are analysed with a simple statistical method, and then evaluated in a discussion of this work...|$|E

In {{the result of the}} science literature observation two lists were collected. The first one includes the traits which are attributed to personal (<b>psychological,</b> psychosocial, developmental…) <b>mature</b> individuals. The second one contains the traits which are imputed to professional psychologists. The two lists to a great extent are similar: communicative competence and constructive social relationships, self-reflection, self-development (self-actualization), empathy and emotional stability, responsibility, decision making ability, creativity… Some assumptions are under consideration: a) variation in the level of personal maturity is stronger for entrants of department of psychology than for other entrants; b) positive dynamic of personal maturity are clearer for student-psychologists than for other students; c) the level of personal maturity and success of schooling are positively correlated; d) personal maturation of student-psychologists are differ in different cultural circumstances.

Therefore, the specific influences that fathers have on their children 2 ̆ 7 s education have gone largely unrevealed. This manuscript gives an exhaustive review of the published literature on multiple aspects of father participation/involvement and the impact that those aspects have on their children 2 ̆ 7 s education, kindergarten through the 12 th grade. The majority of the literature reviewed indicated that children with highly involved, encouraging, consistent, available, and/or present fathers possessed more <b>mature</b> <b>psychological</b> characteristics like higher self-confidence or self-esteem. In addition, the research indicated children of highly involved fathers also possessed skills such as better analytical thought and judgment processes, as well as better scholastic performance...|$|R
50|$|Art in the Heptanese shifted towards Western styles {{by the end}} of the 17th {{century with}} the gradual {{abandonment}} of strict Byzantine conventions and technique. Artists were now increasingly influenced by the Italian Baroque and Flemish painters rather than from their Byzantine heritage. Paintings began to have a three dimensional perspective and the compositions became more flexible using Western realism, departing from the traditional representations that embodied Byzantine spirituality. Such changes were also reflected on the technique of oil painting on canvas which replaced the Byzantine technique of egg tempera on panel. Subjects included secular portraits of the bourgeoisie, which became more common than religious scenes. Bourgeois portraiture had an emblematic character which emphasised the class, profession and position of the individual in society. Frequently, however, these works also constitute penetrating <b>psychological</b> studies. The <b>mature</b> phase of the School of the Ionian Islands echoes the social developments as well as the changes that had occurred in the visual arts. Portraits began to lose their emblematic character. The early rigid poses were then succeeded by more relaxed attitudes (Kallyvokas, Iatras, Avlichos). Other subjects from the School of the Ionian Islands includes genre scenes, landscapes and still lifes.|$|R

Negative consequences of transactional influence of the factors associated with illness parameters, a child's personality and his or her environment occur particularly in the emotional and social development. This situation can be also the chance for stimulating a development of a child's personality and his or her growing as a person.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{some of the}} phenomenological features in Lev Vygotsky’s <b>mature</b> <b>psychological</b> theory, especially in Thinking and Speech and The Current Crisis in Psychology. It traces the complex literary and philosophical influences in 1920 s Moscow on Vygotsky’s thought, through Gustav Shpet’s seminars on Husserl and the inner form of the word, Chelpanov’s seminars on phenomenology, Bakhtin’s theory of the production of inner speech, and the theoretical insights of the early Gestalt psychologists. It begins with an exposition of two central Husserlian schemas: part-whole theory and the thesis of the naïve standpoint, both of which Vygotsky was clearly familiar with. This is followed by {{an account of the}} reception of phenomenology in early Soviet Russia. The article’s central sections are concerned with a careful unpacking and critique of Vygotsky’s employment of Husserlian method and analysis in his later doctrine of the ‘inner plane of speech’, his use of part-whole theory, and his identification of Husserl’s position with an untenable version of idealism. The article closes with the contention that Vygotsky misrepresents the phenomenological analysis of meaning formation and appropriates basic Husserlian conceptual terms in his elaboration of the ‘inner form of the word’; but Vygotsky does so {{in such a way that}} he enriches our descriptive access to the individual development of humans’ dynamic use of language...|$|R

(This {{was a form of}} disgrace for the ruling class in Britain: those who failed, like Garron, in the home country were sometimes sent out 'to the Colonies' to try to redeem themselves.) Garron, who [...] "was really going to reform all his slack, shiftless ways" [...] leaves Agnes Laiter heartbroken behind him. He is a man of weak character, but he settles into decent (if not exceptional, as he believes) competence - and as he works, forgets Agnes, other than as a daydream. Her family bring pressure on her, successfully, to marry another (a 'better prospect' than Garron): she writes to Garron to tell him, saying [...] "she would never know a happy moment all the rest of her life. Which was a true prophecy." [...] (Kipling here shows his deft touch with at least seemingly <b>mature</b> <b>psychological</b> insight, and deft narrative detail.) Garron replies with a carefully drafted letter, which ordinary men might have called [...] "the thoroughly mean and selfish work of a thoroughly mean and selfish man": but it makes Agnes cry; and Garron (in Kipling's ironic phrase) [...] "felt every word he had written for at least two days and a half." [...] He takes up shortly after with a Hill-woman called Dunmaya, the daughter of a senior soldier among the troops of the Native Army and marries her.|$|R
40|$|Com o aumento da dura??o da vida humana e do n?mero de idosos na popula??o, o envelhecimento passou a ser um tema privilegiado e um dos grandes desafios da sociedade contempor?nea. Considerado como um per?odo de grandes adversidades e de aumento do estresse (maior conviv?ncia com o risco) pode ser tamb?m considerado como uma nova etapa da vida que pode ser vivenciada de forma positiva. Estudos t?m comprovado que para tal viv?ncia positiva, a resili?ncia ? fundamental, uma vez que est? ligada a processos intraps?quicos de prote??o e risco e de intera??o social, o que a torna importante neste processo de adapta??o e supera??o das adiversidades desta etapa da vida. Aliada ? resili?ncia, tem-se a medida da satisfa??o com a vida, com a qual se realiza um julgamento cognitivo de alguns dom?nios espec?ficos da vida e reflete como a pessoa percebe a sua vida em rela??o ao presente, ao passado e ?s suas perspectivas em rela??o ao futuro, e ? vista como o componente cognitivo fundamental, que complementa a felicidade. Da necessidade de estudar esses construtos, surgiu esta pesquisa que teve como objetivo analisar as liga??es existentes entre a capacidade da resili?ncia e a percep??o do Estresse com o componente cognitivo do Bem-estar Subjetivo (BES) a satisfa??o com a vida - em uma amostra de idosos de Cuiab?, tendo como referencial te?rico o modelo do desenvolvimento humano, com forte influ?ncia da teoria psicossocial de Erikson (1972) e o modelo de Grotberg que {{define a}} resili?ncia como um conceito ligado ao desenvolvimento e ao crescimento humano. M?todo: a pesquisa se caracteriza como um estudo {{transversal}} de abordagem quantitativa. Foi dividido em dois estudos, o primeiro estudo consistiu na adapta??o da Escala de Resili?ncia para Adultos - RSA (por Friborg, Hjemdal, Rosenvinge & Martinussen, 2003), do qual participaram 200 idosos. No segundo estudo, a amostra foi constitu?da de 379 idosos que responderam um question?rio sociodemogr?fico, a escala RSA (Hjemdal, et al. 2006), a escala Perceived Stress Scale (PSS Escala de Estresse Percebido) de Cohen, Karmack & Mermelsteinm (1983), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) Escala de Satisfa??o Com a Vida (ESV), de Diener (1985), e a escala Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) de Zigmond & Snaith (1983). Os dados foram compilados utilizando-se o SPSS vers?o 21 para an?lises estat?sticas. Como resultado, obteve-se no Estudo I um predom?nio de mulheres (n= 146) e com uma m?dia de 67, 23 anos (DP= 5, 9). Na An?lise Fatorial realizada no I estudo, emergiram duas dimens?es Coes?o Familiar (Alfa = 0, 95) e Otimismo (Alfa= 0, 88) e dois itens foram eliminados ficando assim a RSA total (Alfa = 0, 91) adaptada para idosos com 31 itens. Os resultados do II Estudo apontam que a amostra tem um n?vel de resili?ncia m?dio e que a maioria dos idosos avalia estar satisfeita com a vida. Os resultados tamb?m demonstraram que os idosos que apresentaram maiores m?dias nas avalia??es da RSA e da ESV apresentaram menores pontua??es nas escalas PSS e HADS- Ansiedade e Depress?o. A hip?tese do Estudo I n?o foi confirmada, o que sugere que a resili?ncia pode ser medida de forma diferente para os idosos, pois a resili?ncia nesta fase pode refletir o processo de adapta??o positiva em uma fase de maior amadurecimento psicol?gico. No estudo II, os resultados confirmaram as hip?teses do trabalho, as mulheres tiveram maiores pontua??es nas RSA e nas suas dimens?es, sendo que, somente na dimens?o otimismo essa diferen?a foi significativa. Dos resultados que se XVII obteve, concluiu-se haver necessidade de se investir em outras pesquisas para melhor entender os efeitos e consequ?ncias da capacidade da resili?ncia na velhice, pois os resultados trazem a ideia que ? um fator protetor e promotor de bem-estar neste per?odo. A velhice acarreta perdas no que tange ? sa?de, ? capacidade laboral, ao poder aquisitivo e ?s rela??es interpessoais. Portanto, a continuidade da presen?a do quesito satisfa??o com a vida ap?s os 60 anos demonstra que a resili?ncia enquanto processo de adapta??o e supera??o das condi??es adversas que a vida imp?e tornou-se fundamental para n?o s? a manuten??o do sentimento da certeza de ter qualidade de vida, mas tamb?m para a forma como essas perdas s?o absorvidas e ressignificadas na vida dos idosos. The increasing extent {{of human life}} {{and the number of}} elderly in the population, aging has become a privileged theme and one of the great challenges of contemporary society. Aging has been considered as a period of great adversity and increased stress (higher familiarity with the risk) may also be considered as a new stage of life that might be positively experienced. Studies have demonstrated that for such positive experience, the resilience is critical, since it is linked to intrapsychic processes of protection and risk and social interaction, which has relevance in the process of adapting and overcoming the diversity of this stage of life. Tied to the resilience it is the measure of life satisfaction, characterized as performing a cognitive judgment of some specific domains of life and reflects how persons perceives their lives concerning the present, the past and their expectations to the future. This construct is also comprehended as essential cognitive component that complements happiness. The need of studying these constructs, this research was emerged aimed at examining the associations between the capacity of resilience and perceived stress with the cognitive component Subjective well-being (SWB) - the satisfaction with life - in a sample of elderly in Cuiab?, in the state of Mato Grosso. The theoretical model of human development, with a deep influence of Psychosocial Theory of Erikson (1972) and Grotberg s model that defines resilience as a concept associated to human and growth development. Method: This research is characterized as a cross-sectional study of quantitative approach. It was divided into two studies; the first consisted in adapting the Resilience Scale for Adults - RSA (Friborg, Hjemdal, Rosenvinge & Martinussen, 2003) that was submitted to a number of 200 elder participants. In the second study, the sample consisted of 379 elder participants who answered a sociodemographic questionnaire, the RSA scale (Hjemdal, et al. 2006), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) by Cohen, Karmack & Mermelsteinm (1983), Satisfaction with life Scale (SWLS) (Diener, 1985), and scale Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) Zigmond & Snaith of (1983). The data were processed by the software Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 21 for the statistical analysis. The results obtained in the study I showed the predominance of women (n = 146) with an average of 67. 23 years (SD = 5. 9). The findings concerning the Factorial Analysis done in the study I indicated two dimensions - Family Cohesion (alpha = 0. 95) and Optimism (alpha = 0. 88) and two items were eliminated, thus, the RSA totalized (alpha = 0. 91) adapted with 31 items for the elderly people. The results of the study II indicated that the sample has an average score of resilience and the majority of the elderly people answered to be satisfied with their lives. The results also revealed that elderly participants who had higher averages on assessments of RSA and SWLS had lower scores on scales PSS and HADS- Anxiety and depression. The hypothesis of the study I was not confirmed, suggesting that resilience may be measured differently for the elderly people, for the reason that the resilience at this life stage may be reflected in their positive adaptation processes in a <b>psychological</b> <b>mature</b> stage. In study II, the results confirmed the hypothesis of this research, the women had higher scores in RSA and its dimensions, and only in the optimism dimension this difference was significant. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded the need to advance in further research XIX to better understand the effects and consequences of the capacity of resilience in old age, as {{the findings of this study}} revealed the notion of a protective and promoter factor of welfare in this life phase. Old age brings losses concerning health, labor capacity, purchasing power and interpersonal relationships. Consequently, the constant presence of the item life satisfaction after 60 years reveals that resilience as a process of adaptation and overcoming the adversities imposed by life, became fundamental to not only to maintain the sense of certainty of having quality life, but also in the way these losses are absorbed and resignified in the lives of the elderly people...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} transformations in the {{cultural}} context on the structures of the Catholic organization and consequently on the identity and role of priests is explored in this research. The way these transformations affect clergy relationships with the church, diocesan authorities and parishioners, and ultimately the psychological wellbeing of priests, are investigated {{in the light of}} recent research and literature. Quantitative and qualitative data from the Catholic Church Life Surveys (CCLS) of 1996 and 2001 is analyzed, together with qualitative data generated through semi-structured interviews. The theoretical underpinning for the interpretation of changing clerical identity and roles and the relationship dynamics is personality theory, including a neoanalytic model (Horney, 1950), and a psychodynamic approach using an iconic reading of Freud (Cozzens, 2000). Social identity theory (Haslam, 2001), and Fowler 2 ̆ 7 s (1996) theory of faith development also contribute to the theoretical framework. The NEO-FFI personality factors (Costa 2 ̆ 6 McCrae, 1992) are used as covariates throughout the analysis. Four major themes are addressed in this research. First, ambiguities in the identity and role of clergy brought about through structural changes in the organization following the Second Vatican Council. Second, cultural changes which challenged the institutional hierarchical structure of the church and some of its theological and ecclesiological positions. Third, the contribution to satisfaction with ministry and personal wellbeing made by priests 2 ̆ 7 relationships with the organization, diocesan authorities, and parishioners, as well as intimacy with colleagues and friends. Finally, the impact of psychodynamic factors on the spiritual and psychological dimensions of priestly life.; It was found that although the sacramental role of priests remains largely intact, their identity as religious and spiritual leaders is under challenge through greater participation in parish life by educated and theologically trained lay people. It is argued that the competence to appropriately express leadership, preach meaningful homilies and promote spiritual growth in parishioners rests on the attainment of <b>mature</b> <b>psychological</b> development and continued faith and spiritual formation. Analysis of personality factors showed that sound organizational and structural supports are needed to assist priests in their personal and professional lives. Over half the priests {{in the present study were}} found to be vulnerable to emotional and psychological distress, while others had strong resources to cope with increased ambiguity and complexity in ministry. A review of literature suggests that cultural changes over the last 30 years compound the effects of Vatican II, particularly the patriarchal hierarchical structure of the organisation and teachings on sexual morality that are under pressure from changing attitudes by both clergy and laity. Quantitative and qualitative analyses showed that there is little support by priests for the obligation of celibacy, the successful attainment of which demands a high level of mature psychosexual development. It was argued that without a strong clerical commitment to celibacy, education and training programs currently being implemented in seminaries would be largely ineffectual. Key factors impacting on the relationships of priests with parishioners were found to be first, a decline in the authority of priests, second, the revelations of sexual abuse by priests, and third, the difficulty numbers of clergy have with establishing and maintaining close, intimate relationships.;The NEO-FFI factors Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness were found to be significant predictors in the quality of relationships between priests and parishioners, with 30...|$|R
