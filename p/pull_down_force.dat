One {{of the goals of}} this study was to record the maximum forces that the subjects can resist against the pull-down force on their hands while biting a spacer of adjustable height on the right or left side of the jaw. Then EMG measurement was used to determine the EMG-Force relationship of the jaw, neck and arms muscles. This gave us useful insights on the arms strength loss due to the biomechanical effects of the imbalance in the jaw mechanism. Methods In this study to determine the effects of the imbalance in the jaw to the strength of the arms, we conducted experiments with a pool of 20 healthy subjects of both genders. The subjects were asked to resist a <b>pull</b> <b>down</b> <b>force</b> applied on the contralateral arm while biting on a firm spacer using one side of the jaw. Four different muscles – masseter muscles, deltoid muscles, bicep muscles and trapezoid muscles – were involved. Integrated EMG (iEMG) and Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) were used to analyze the EMG signals. Results The results showed that (1) Imbalance in the jaw causes loss of arm strength contra-laterally; (2) The loss is approximately a linear function of the height of the spacers. Moreover, the iEMG showed the intensity of muscle activities decreased when the degrees of jaw imbalance increased (spacer thickness increased). In addition, the tendency of Higuchi fractal dimension decreased for all muscles. Conclusions This finding indicates that muscle fatigue and the decrease in muscle contraction level leads to the loss of arm strength. </p...|$|E

50|$|Congenital {{fibrosis}} of the extraocular muscles, or CFEOM, is a {{class of}} rare genetic disorders affecting {{one or more of}} the muscles that move the eyeballs. Individuals with CFEOM have varying degrees of ophthalmoplegia (an inability to move the eyes in one or more directions) and ptosis. The condition is present from birth and non-progressive, runs in families, and usually affects both eyes similarly. In the most common form, the superior recti are dysfunctional and the inferior recti, lacking proper opposition, <b>pull</b> the eyes <b>down,</b> <b>forcing</b> the head to be tilted upward in order to see straight ahead.|$|R

In order to avoid uplift in the {{supporting}} columns, the span is terminated with a massive concrete end weight. This end weight also carries the turning saddles for the main cables. As seen in the northwest corner image above, there is an upward component to the tension force provided by the main cable, {{and it is this}} component that removes most of the weight of the end cap from its columns. (The greater, horizontal, component is countered by the compressive forces exerted by the box deck structure as is characteristic of this type of bridge.) ...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{relationships}} between dry land strength and power measurements with swimming performance. Ten male national level swimmers (age: 14. 9 ± 0. 74 years, body mass: 60. 0 ± 6. 26 kg, height: 171. 9 ± 6. 26, 100 m long course front crawl performance: 59. 9 ± 1. 87 s) volunteered as subjects. Height and Work were estimated for CMJ. Mean power in the propulsive phase was assessed for squat, bench press (concentric phase) and lat <b>pull</b> <b>down</b> back. Mean <b>force</b> production was evaluated through 30 s maximal effort tethered swimming in front crawl using whole body, arms only and legs only. Swimming velocity was calculated from a maximal bout of 50 m front crawl. Height of CMJ did not correlate with any of the studied variables. There were positive and moderate-strong associations between the work during CMJ and mean propulsive power in squat with tethered forces during whole body and legs only swimming. Mean propulsive power of bench press and lat <b>pull</b> <b>down</b> presented positive and moderate-strong relationships with mean force production in whole body and arms only. Swimming performance is related with mean power of lat <b>pull</b> <b>down</b> back. So, lat <b>pull</b> <b>down</b> back is the most related dry land test with swimming performance; bench press with force production in water arms only; and work during CM...|$|R

50|$|These {{equations}} {{are dependent}} {{on the distribution of}} matter and energy in a region of space, unlike Newtonian gravity, which is dependent only on the distribution of matter. The fields themselves in general relativity represent the curvature of spacetime. General relativity states that being in a region of curved space is equivalent to accelerating up the gradient of the field. By Newton's second law, this will cause an object to experience a fictitious force if it is held still with respect to the field. This is why a person will feel himself <b>pulled</b> <b>down</b> by the <b>force</b> of gravity while standing still on the Earth's surface. In general the gravitational fields predicted by general relativity differ in their effects only slightly from those predicted by classical mechanics, but {{there are a number of}} easily verifiable differences, one of the most well known being the bending of light in such fields.|$|R
