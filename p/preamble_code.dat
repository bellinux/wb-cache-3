By exploiting cross-correlation property among preamble sequences, we propose both network and terminal-side algorithms such that new coming stations {{are attached to the}} base stations (BSs) with relatively low loading in a long-term sense. For the illustration purpose, we consider the <b>preamble</b> <b>code</b> sequences specified by IEEE 802. 16 e standard, and basically assume that a station selects the BS based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Since there is no standard notion of load, we start our discussion from envisaging a certain type of scheduler (or resource allocation policy) is used in each single-cell. More specifically, we consider two well-known scheduling disciplines, namely, resource fair and throughput fair. Through the extensive simulation study, we confirm that the <b>preamble</b> <b>code</b> sequence {{can be used as a}} leverage, which leads to a better cell site selection from the perspective of fairness provisioning.

40|$|Abstract—Energy-detection (ED) {{receivers}} {{can take}} advantage of the ranging and multipath resistance capabilities of impulseradio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) physical layers at a much lower complexity than coherent receivers. However, ED receivers are extremely vulnerable to multi-user interference (MUI). Therefore, the design of IR-UWB ED architectures must take MUI into account. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of two complementary algorithms for reliable and robust synchronization of IR-UWB ED receivers in the presence of MUI: 1) powerindependent detection and <b>preamble</b> <b>code</b> interference cancellation (PICNIC) and 2) detection of start-frame-delimiter through sequential ratio tests (DESSERT). PICNIC addresses packet detection and timing acquisition while DESSERT focuses on startframe-delimiter (SFD) detection. Both algorithms are evaluated with the IEEE 802. 15. 4 a IR-UWB physical layer, standardized for low data-rate networks. The performance evaluation with extensive simulations show that our algorithms outperform nonrobust synchronization algorithms by up to two orders of magnitude in the presence of MUI.

40|$|The {{efficient}} allocation and use {{of radio}} resources is crucial for achieving the maximum possible throughput and capacity in wireless networks. The conventional strongest signal-based user association in cellular networks generally considers only {{the strength of the}} signal while selecting a BS, and ignores the level of congestion or load at it. As a consequence, some BSs tend to suffer from heavy load, while their adjacent BSs may carry only light load. This load imbalance severely hampers the network from fully utilizing the network capacity and providing fair services to users. In this thesis, we investigate the applicability of the <b>preamble</b> <b>code</b> sequence, which is mainly used for cell identification, as an implicit information indicator for load balancing in cellular networks. By exploiting the high auto-correlation and low cross-correlation property among preamble sequences, we propose distributed load balancing schemes that implicitly obtain information about the load status of BSs, for intelligent association control. This enables the new users to be attached to BSs with relatively low load in the long term, alleviating the problem of non-uniform user distribution and load imbalance across the network. Extensive simulations are performed with various user densities considering throughput fair and resource fair, as the resource allocation policies in each cell. It is observed that significant improvement in minimum throughput and fair user distribution is achieved by employing our proposed schemes, and preamble sequences can be effectively used as a leverage for better cell-site selection from the viewpoint of fairness provisioning. The load of the entire system is also observed to be balanced, which consequently enhances the capacity of the network, as evidenced by the simulation results...|$|E

30|$|To {{acquire the}} packet preamble, a {{spread-spectrum}} correlator continually {{looks for the}} preamble pattern on all channels. Once the preamble is detected, an internal timing sequence compares the signal with shifted copies of the DS code via a simple correlator. The shifted copy of the DS code that provides the strongest correlation then demodulates the actual data. To make the signal detection independent of the carrier phase, both phases of the carrier (I and Q) are correlated with the <b>preamble’s</b> <b>code.</b> However, the phase relationship must remain consistent during {{the duration of the}} DS sequence.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Bayesian two-part coding schemes {{as tools}} for parameter estimation and model selection. The Wallace–Freeman message length approximation to strict {{minimum message length}} {{can be used to}} obtain two-part message lengths. However, this approximation relies on some strong assumptions regarding the likelihood function and prior distribution which do not hold for a large range of models. We present a new two-part message length formula that is more widely applicable than the popular Wallace–Freeman message length approximation, while remaining significantly easier to compute than the exact strict minimum message length procedure. 1. MML TWO-PART CODES Consider the problem of choosing a plausible explanation for some observed data yn = (y 1, [...] ., yn) ′ ∈ Yn ⊆ Rn. The possible explanations are the distributions, or (fully specified) models, contained in a countable set of parametric model structures γ ∈ Γ. Let pγ(yn |θ) denote the model 1, in model structure γ, indexed by θ ∈ Θγ ⊆ Rk. The minimum encoding approach [1, 2] to inference suggests that the model that most compresses the data is the most plausible explanation. One way to compress the data is by two-part coding, in which the model and the data are compressed together as a two-part message. This idea is central to the minimum message length principle (MML). The MML principle is explicitly Bayesian in nature, so we further assume that a suitable prior distribution, πγ(θ), θ ∈ Θγ exists for all γ ∈ Γ. The first part of the message, or assertion, states which model, pγ(·|θ), from the structure γ, is to be used to compress the data. The second part, or detail, states the data yn using the nominated model from γ. Let the length of these two terms be denoted by I(θ; γ) and I(yn |θ; γ), respectively. Further, let I(γ) denote the length of a <b>preamble</b> <b>code</b> stating which structure from Γ is being used. Estimation of both a model structure, as well as the model parameters, may be simultaneously performed by solvin...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} results of an ongoing study evaluating civil wireless communication systems or Waveforms (WFs) for their potential use in military radios. It is a continuation of the work presented in [1, 2]. After having evaluated several civilian communication systems in [1], the WLAN IEEE 802. 11 n OFDM WF has been selected as the base WF for further investigation [2]. In addition, the originally included multiple access method has already been replaced by the better suited Unified Slot Assignment Protocol and the <b>preamble</b> <b>coding</b> and detection has been changed [2]. The focus of the present contribution is on potential Electronic Protection Measures for the new Wide Band Waveform (WBWF) to be designed. The studies will contribute to the international activities of standardizing IP and network capable WBWFs for military Software Defined Radios. After an overview on elementary aspects of Electronic Warfare, especially Electronic Protection in the communication area, some interesting WFs are mentioned which are already in military use or at least offered therefore. Afterwards, a number of possibilities for protecting WBWFs, particularly OFDM WFs, are collected and structured. The collection is based on the publicly available literature. In parallel, simulations for testing the susceptibility of an OFDM signal under jammer influences are carried out. Furthermore, first results for a swept jammer with tone and noise source signals are presented which exhibit the jammer influence and its mitigation by a new anti-jam demodulator...|$|R

30|$|For M 2 M {{applications}} {{with small}} data transmission, establishing RRC connection and network connection to transmit several bits is deemed as wasteful. Thus, Chen and Wang [23] suggest either (i) use the MAC PDU that should carry the RRC signaling {{to carry the}} data and (ii) define a special <b>preamble</b> to transmit <b>coded</b> data. The drawbacks of [23] are as follows: (i) the solution based on the preambles is not very scalable due to the limited amount of available preambles and (ii) for a long-term view, the transmission of data in the control plane violate the principle of separation between the control plane and the data plane. Wiriaatmadja and Choi [79] propose to simplify the data communication procedure by allowing MTC devices to send data right after the preamble transmission without explicitly establishing a connection.|$|R

Through several twists in the law drafting process and rounds in the certain committees, the proposition model was accepted. Given that the holographic reality of the network communications, never mind the technical surroundings, causes restlessness among all relevant sectors during the legislative process, it will do certainly do so afterwards as well. Information Society Code is a monolith, that prescribes the norms to the electronic communications, from the general availability to the practical usage. The <b>preamble</b> of the <b>Code</b> explains that the purpose of the legislation is to secure the efficient and interference-free use of radio frequencies, to foster competition, and to ensure that communications networks and services are technologically advanced, of high quality, reliable, safe, and affordable. Furthermore, the complete Code includes confidentially and the data privacy as well. Hence, the nature of the amendment is certainly a complete, conjunctive motion for the need of a modern networked society, where these issues are best gathered under joint tome. Regardless of the compassionate welcoming, the Code is unproven in several fronts, such as network neutrality. The fundaments of the Code retain the consumer base approach, but allows the operators' freedoms that could hypothetically introduce a different kind of pecking order in the fenced environment of the internet infrastructure in the future. Finland registered a head start with the promulgation of this umbrella act alongside with Netherlands, as similar projects are yet to be implemented in most of the countries, including the ones in European Union.
