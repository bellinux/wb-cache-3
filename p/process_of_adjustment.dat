The {{growth of the}} economy relatively slowed down in the year 1993–97, the country failed to attract the foreign investors to boost the economy. Responding to the crises, Benazir Bhutto tightened the control of megacorporations while on the other hand, continued the privatisation of mediocre industries to private-sector. From the period 1994–96, the level of corruption heightened and the charges against Benazir Bhutto gained currency. In midst of 1993, Benazir Bhutto embarked an ambitious medium term programme, Eighth Five-Year Plans, that was aimed to adjust the macroeconomics principles to alleviate the national economy. But, it had produced the short-lived outcomes and in 1994–95, the country had performed the economic results below its potential. Major concessions were made in taxation and monetary policies and the annual budget clearly confirmed the pause in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> and reform, eliciting an adverse market reaction. This policy participated in sharp rise in unemployment and rapid deterioration in the external reserves position, bringing the country back {{to the brink of}} a foreign exchange crisis in October 1995.

Collins (2001) discussed a surprisingly consistent characteristic of leaders who took their organizations from being good to being great. Called “Level 5 Leadership”, this is defined as building enduring greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will.|$|R

50|$|Many CGE {{models are}} comparative-static: they model the {{reactions}} of the economy at only one point in time. For policy analysis, results from such a model are often interpreted as showing {{the reaction of the}} economy in some future period to one or a few external shocks or policy changes. That is, the results show the difference (usually reported in percent change form) between two alternative future states (with and without the policy shock). The <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> to the new equilibrium is not explicitly represented in such a model, although details of the closure (for example, whether capital stocks are allowed to adjust) lead modellers to distinguish between short-run and long-run equilibria.|$|E

The Conjoint Committee an amalgamation of the Russo-Jewish Committee and the Jewish Board of Guardians, aimed to tackle all matters of immigration. This committee collaborated with the Board (between 1893 and 1909) and became {{the primary source of}} aid to the Jewish poor. [...] "The Conjoint Committee was the lineal descendent of the Mansion House Committee [...] " [...] Despite the fact that the two organizations were a partnership, the Board of Guardians continued to dominate the majority of decisions. Sir Julian Goldsmid, chairman of the Russo-Jewish Committee, cooperated with Benjamin Cohen, who was the president of the Jewish Board of Guardians at this time. Any disagreements between the two leaders were settled by the interests of the elite as a whole. As a result of the six month rule, other charities developed in order to aid the immigrants."In the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> those immigrants were helped by relatives, kinsmen, landsleit, and alternative smaller and more flexible institutions, such as Hevras" [...] Hevras, a charity also established in the East End, offered help for immigrants to overcome the distress’ caused by the immigration process. This charity was less hierarchical and more democratic than the Board. For many, Hevras represented traditional Jewish morals within the charities policies. Many immigrants turned to Hevras because of the Board of Guardians restrictive policies, such as the six-month rule.|$|E

40|$|This paper rehabilitates the old wage price spiral. It shows that, {{after an}} {{increase}} in aggregate demand, the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> of nominal prices and nominal wages results from attempts by workers to maintain or increase their real wage and by firms to maintain or increase their markups of prices over wages. Under continuous price and wage setting, the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> would be instantaneous; under staggering of price and wage decisions, the adjustment takes time. The more inflexible real wages and markups are to shifts in demand, the higher is the degree of price level inertia, the longer lasting are the effects of aggregate demand on output. ...|$|E
