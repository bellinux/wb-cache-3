40|$|Warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} show large-scale {{variation in}} G + C content along their chromosomes, a pattern {{which appears to}} be largely absent from cold-blooded vertebrates. However, compositional variation in <b>poikilotherms</b> has generally been studied by ultracentrifugation rather than sequence analysis. In this paper, we investigate the compositional properties of coding sequences from a broad range of vertebrate <b>poikilotherms</b> using DNA sequence analysis. We find that on average <b>poikilotherms</b> have lower third-codon position GC contents (GC 3) than homeotherms but that some <b>poikilotherms</b> have higher mean GC 3 values. We find that most <b>poikilotherms</b> have lower variation in GC 3 than homeotherms but that there is a correlation between GC 12 and GC 3 for some species, indicating that there is systematic variation in base composition across their genomes. We also demonstrate that the GC 3 of genes in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, is correlated with that in humans, suggesting that vertebrates share a basic isochore structure. However, we find no correlation between either the mean GC 3 or the standard deviation in GC 3 and body temperature...|$|R

500|$|To more {{successfully}} hunt {{fast and}} agile prey such as sea lions, {{the great white}} has adapted to maintain a body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a [...] "rete mirabile" [...] (Latin for [...] "wonderful net"). This close web-like structure of veins and arteries, located along each lateral side of the shark, conserves heat by warming the cooler arterial blood with the venous blood that has been warmed by the working muscles. This keeps {{certain parts of the}} body (particularly the stomach) at temperatures up to 14°C (25°F) above that of the surrounding water, while the heart and gills remain at sea temperature. When conserving energy the core body temperature can drop to match the surroundings. A great white shark's success in raising its core temperature is an example of gigantothermy. Therefore, the great white shark can be considered an endothermic <b>poikilotherm</b> because its body temperature is not constant but is internally regulated. Great whites also rely on the fat and oils stored within their livers for long-distance migrations across nutrient-poor areas of the oceans. Studies by Stanford University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium published on 17 July 2013 revealed that In addition to controlling the sharks' buoyancy, the liver of great whites is essential in migration patterns. Sharks that sink faster during drift dives were revealed to use up their internal stores of energy quicker than those which sink in a dive at more leisurely rates.|$|E

50|$|Enzymes have a {{relatively}} narrow temperature range at which their efficiencies are optimal. Temperatures outside this range can greatly reduce the rate of a reaction or stop it altogether. A creature with a fairly constant body temperature can therefore specialize in enzymes which are efficient at that particular temperature.

50|$|Because their {{metabolism}} is {{variable and}} generally {{below that of}} homeothermic animals, sustained high-energy activities like powered flight in large animals or maintaining a large brain is generally beyond <b>poikilotherm</b> animals. The metabolism of poikilotherms favors strategies such as sit-and-wait hunting over chasing prey for larger animals with high movement cost. As they do not use their metabolisms to heat or cool themselves, total energy requirement over time is low. For the same body weight, poikilotherms need only 5 to 10% of the energy of homeotherms.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Poikilotherm</b> animals {{must be able}} to {{function}} over a wider range of temperatures than homeotherms. The speed of most chemical reactions vary with temperature, and in order {{to function}} poikilotherms may have four to ten enzyme systems that operate at different temperatures for an important chemical reaction. As a result, poikilotherms often have larger, more complex genomes than homeotherms in the same ecological niche. Frogs are a notable example of this effect, though their complex development is also an important factor in their large genome.|$|E

40|$|Introduction For cold-blooded or poikilothermic animals, winter {{presents}} {{challenges to}} survival. Since the body temperature (Tb) of <b>poikilotherms</b> is usually {{very close to}} that of their surrounding environment, {{the risk of death}} from freezing is very real when temperatures drop below 0 C. Food is also scare during the winter and some animals also have limited mobility because the cold can make muscle movements slow or even induce a cold coma. It is not surprising, then, that few poikilothermic animals are active during the winter but protective measures must be in place to allow survival of prolonged cold exposures over a hibernation season that may stretch as long as 9 - 10 months in polar and alpine regions. Thermogenesis Although thermogenesis defines the warm-blooded lifestyle and is the reason that many birds and mammals remain active in winter, there is only one known example of <b>poikilotherms</b> that keep themselves warm in the winter by producing metabolic heat an...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change may}} be one of the {{greatest}} environmental catastrophes encountered by modern human civilization. The potential influence of this global disaster on wildlife populations is subject to question. I interpolated how seasonal variation in weather patterns influences growth and reproduction in the Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris blanchardi). Then I extrapolated the influence of future climate conditions on these life history characteristics using fuzzy regression. Fuzzy regression was an accurate predictor of growth and reproduction based on the climate conditions present from 1900 – 2007. It predicted that the climate projections expected for Arkansas by 2100 could reduce total reproductive investment in the Blanchard’s cricket frog by 33 – 94 %. If these results reflect responses by other <b>poikilotherms,</b> climate change could induce major population declines in many species. Because <b>poikilotherms</b> represent the vast majority of vertebrates and significant ecosystem components, it is imperative that we implement strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and circumvent this possible catastrophe...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of intrinsic growth rate has received less attention than other life history traits, {{and has been}} studied differently in plants, homoiotherms, and <b>poikilotherms.</b> The benefits of rapid growth are obvious, so the problems is to explain the costs and tradeoffs that cause organisms to grow below their physiological maximum. Four prevailing themes emerge from the literature: (1) slow growth is adaptive for dealing with nutrient stress, (2) the tradeoff between growth rate and development limits growth in species that require mature function early in life, (3) rapid growth evolves when a minimum size must be reached quickly, such as for sexual maturation or overwintering, and (4) rapid growth may evolve to compensate for slowed growth owing to environmental conditions. Evidence {{for each of these}} themes is detailed for plants, homoiotherms, and <b>poikilotherms.</b> In addition, empirical evidence is reviewed for costs of rapid growth, including increased fluctuating asymmetry, reduced immune capacity, and reduced ability to respond to environmental stress. ...|$|R
50|$|Temperature in {{amphibians}} and reptiles directly affects metabolism in an exponential manner, {{and among}} ectotherms, temperature {{is one of the}} most important factors, acting directly upon metabolism. Since the newt is a <b>poikilotherm,</b> the purpose of this increase in metabolism is not to generate heat to regulate their internal temperature, but to counteract the depressive effect on standard metabolism that low atmospheric temperatures produce. For example, there is a direct correlation between the activity of certain muscle metabolic enzymes and the preferred body temperature of Eastern red spotted newts.|$|E
5000|$|Bernardi {{and colleagues}} first {{uncovered}} the compositional non-uniformity within vertebrate genomes using thermal melting and density gradientcentrifugation. The DNAfragments extracted by the gradient centrifugation were later termed [...] "isochores", which was subsequently defined as [...] "very long (much greater than 200 KB) DNA segments" [...] that [...] "are fairly homogeneous in base composition and {{belong to a}} small number of major classesdistinguished by differences in guanine-cytosine (GC) content". Subsequently, the isochores [...] "grew"and were claimed to be [...] ">300 kb in size." [...] The theory proposed that isochore’scomposition varied markedly between [...] "warm-blooded" [...] (homeotherm) vertebrates and [...] "cold-blooded" [...] (<b>poikilotherm)</b> vertebrates and later becameknown as the isochore theory.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>poikilotherm</b> (...) is {{an animal}} whose {{internal}} temperature varies considerably. It {{is the opposite}} of a homeotherm, an animal which maintains thermal homeostasis. While the term in principle can apply to all organisms, it is usually only applied to animals, and mostly to vertebrates. Usually the variation is a consequence of variation in the ambient environmental temperature. Many terrestrial ectotherms are poikilothermic. However some ectotherms remain in temperature-constant environments {{to the point that they}} are actually able to maintain a constant internal temperature (i.e. are homeothermic). It is this distinction that often makes the term [...] "poikilotherm" [...] more useful than the vernacular [...] "cold-blooded", which is sometimes used to refer to ectotherms more generally.|$|E
40|$|The frog, {{both as a}} {{representative}} of <b>poikilotherms</b> and as experimental ma-terial for adrenocortical investigations, possesses certain advantages over homoiotherms for studies involving penetration rates of known molecular-volume vital dyes and of radioactive physiological ions through its integument (Angerer, 1942), of water into and from the whole organism (Angerer and Angerer, 1949; Angerer, 1950) and into and from skeletal muscles (Angerer and Angerer, 1950), and for studies treating of skin bio-electric potentials (Williams and Angerer, 1950). Recently success has been attained with injections of adrenocortical extract (ACE) into otherwise normal frogs with regard to metabolism (Calhoon and Angerer, 1951) and skin bio-electric potentials (Williams and Angerer, 1952).
