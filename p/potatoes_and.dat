5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E

Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E

40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} normal potato, waxy <b>potato,</b> yam <b>and</b> sweet <b>potato</b> starches were examined <b>and</b> compared.

5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, sweet <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> parsnips. Camas pocket gophers {{are larger than}} other gophers, so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them. Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail, since the gophers will sometimes wall off {{a segment of the}} burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees.|$|E
5|$|The Neolithic age, {{which began}} in the Middle East in about 9500BC, was a time when humans became farmers. This {{agricultural}} revolution embraced the development of monoculture and presented an opportunity for the rapid spread of several species of plant viruses.

The spread of the potyviruses of <b>potatoes,</b> <b>and</b> other fruits and vegetables, began about 6,600 years ago.|$|E

5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E

Some variations exist, including a few sweet versions that include sugar, which may be used on dishes such as pancakes. When used as a topping, it is typically added just before the dish is served. It has also been served melted atop dishes, whereby it is placed atop foods {{during the last few}} minutes of cooking. It may be used in the place of a sauce, and a small amount can significantly add to a dish's overall flavor.|$|E

He put slips of paper in some of the sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.|$|E
