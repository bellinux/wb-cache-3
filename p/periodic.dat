5|$|Once again, {{this is a}} simplification. <b>Periodic</b> {{motions of}} the Moon and {{apparent}} <b>periodic</b> motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude <b>periodic</b> oscillations of Earth's axis, and hence the celestial equator, known as nutation.|$|E
5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the <b>periodic</b> table. Groups usually have more significant <b>periodic</b> trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} <b>periodic</b> table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E
5|$|A {{period is}} a {{horizontal}} {{row in the}} <b>periodic</b> table. Although groups generally have more significant <b>periodic</b> trends, there are regions where horizontal trends are more significant than vertical group trends, such as the f-block, where the lanthanides and actinides form two substantial horizontal series of elements.|$|E
5|$|According to the <b>periodic</b> law, dubnium should {{belong to}} group 5, under vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Several studies {{investigated}} {{the properties of}} element 105 and found a general agreement with the predictions from the <b>periodic</b> law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to relativistic effects, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. (Relativistic effects arise when an object moves on velocities comparable to the speed of light; in heavy atoms, the quickly moving objects are electrons revolving around the nucleus.) These properties have remained challenging to measure: studies have only been performed on single atoms; they generally confirm the assignment of dubnium to the position under tantalum in the <b>periodic</b> table.|$|E
5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, <b>periodic</b> {{paralysis}} was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate of}} thyroid disease in Japanese people with <b>periodic</b> paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 <b>periodic</b> paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as a}} diagnostic test.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the <b>periodic</b> table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the <b>periodic</b> table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in the <b>periodic</b> table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E

5|$|In {{his report}} on The <b>Periodic</b> Law of the Chemical Elements in 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} several unknown chemical elements, including one that would fill {{a gap in the}} carbon family in his <b>Periodic</b> Table of the Elements, located between silicon and tin. Because of its position in his <b>Periodic</b> Table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and he estimated its atomic weight to be about 72.0.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>periodic</b> {{table of}} the elements, dubnium is located in group 5 as the third member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Limited investigation of dubnium chemistry has demonstrated that dubnium behaves as a typical group 5 element and the heavier homologue to tantalum; however, some deviations from <b>periodic</b> trends occur due to relativistic effects.|$|E
5|$|Instead, Venus {{may lose}} its {{internal}} heat in <b>periodic</b> major resurfacing events.|$|E
5|$|Nihonium is {{expected}} to be much denser than thallium, having a predicted density of about 16 to 18g/cm3, due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of its 7s and 7p1/2 orbitals. This is because calculations estimate it to have an atomic radius of about 170pm, {{the same as that of}} thallium, even though <b>periodic</b> trends would predict it to have an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one period further down in the <b>periodic</b> table. The melting and boiling points of nihonium are not definitely known, but have been calculated to be 430°C and 1100°C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, indium, and thallium, following <b>periodic</b> trends.|$|E
5|$|<b>Periodic</b> {{flooding}} of the Canning River {{from the}} dam {{is required to}} disperse seed, stimulate germination and ensure seedlings survive, recharge shallow groundwater tables that are important during periods of drought and to discourage and prevent weed growth. However, during times of low rainfall <b>periodic</b> flooding is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{properties}} of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration, {{the properties}} of the elements likewise show recurring patterns or <b>periodic</b> behaviour, some examples of which are shown in the diagrams below for atomic radii, ionization energy and electron affinity. It is this periodicity of properties, manifestations of which were noticed well before the underlying theory was developed, that led to the establishment of the <b>periodic</b> law ({{the properties of}} the elements recur at varying intervals) and the formulation of the first <b>periodic</b> tables.|$|E
5|$|TPP is {{distinguished}} from {{other forms of}} <b>periodic</b> paralysis (especially hypokalemic <b>periodic</b> paralysis) with thyroid function tests on the blood. These are normal in the other forms, and in thyrotoxicosis the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland. Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of hyperthyroidism.|$|E
5|$|The Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev {{published}} the first widely recognized <b>periodic</b> table in 1869. He developed his table to illustrate <b>periodic</b> {{trends in the}} properties of the then-known elements. Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table. Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered. Mendeleev's <b>periodic</b> table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are a group (column) in the <b>periodic</b> table {{consisting}} of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of the <b>periodic</b> table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide {{the best example of}} group trends in properties in the <b>periodic</b> table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} elements is not known. A very early suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911, {{and based on the}} arrangement of elements in each horizontal <b>periodic</b> table row, was that elements of atomic weight greater than 256± (which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern-day terms) did not exist. A higher—more recent—estimate is that the <b>periodic</b> table may end soon after the island of stability, which is expected to centre around element 126, as the extension of the <b>periodic</b> and nuclides tables is restricted by proton and neutron drip lines. Other predictions of an end to the <b>periodic</b> table include at element 128 by John Emsley, at element 137 by Richard Feynman, and at element 155 by Albert Khazan.|$|E
5|$|The <b>periodic</b> {{table is}} a tabular {{arrangement}} of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. This ordering shows <b>periodic</b> trends, such as elements with similar behaviour in the same column. It also shows four rectangular blocks with some approximately similar chemical properties. In general, within one row (period) the elements are metals on the left, and non-metals on the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of unbiunium in the <b>periodic</b> table {{suggests that it}} would have similar properties to its lighter congeners, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of <b>periodic</b> trends. For example, unbiunium is expected to have a s2p valence electron configuration instead of the s2d of its lighter congeners in group 3, but this is not expected to significantly affect its chemistry, which is predicted to be that of a normal group 3 element; it would on the other hand significantly lower its first ionisation energy beyond what would be expected from <b>periodic</b> trends.|$|E
5|$|The six {{commonly}} recognised metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. Five {{elements are}} less frequently so classified: carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium, and astatine. On a standard <b>periodic</b> table, all eleven {{are in a}} diagonal area in the p-block extending from boron at the upper left to astatine at lower right, along the dividing line between metals and nonmetals shown on some <b>periodic</b> tables.|$|E
5|$|This page shows large-cell {{versions}} of the <b>periodic</b> table. For each element name, symbol, atomic number, and mean atomic mass value for the natural isotopic composition of each element are shown. The <b>periodic</b> table of the chemical elements is a tabular method of displaying the chemical elements.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{the complex}} {{exponential}} function is a <b>periodic</b> function with period 2πi.|$|E
5|$|Within 100 {{years of}} the {{appearance}} of Mendeleev's table in 1869 {{it has been estimated}} that around 700 different <b>periodic</b> table versions were published. As well as numerous rectangular variations, other <b>periodic</b> table formats have been shaped, for example, like a circle, cube, cylinder, building, spiral, lemniscate, octagonal prism, pyramid, sphere, or triangle. Such alternatives are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional <b>periodic</b> tables.|$|E
5|$|Although the Pythagorean tiling {{is itself}} <b>periodic</b> (it has a square lattice of {{translational}} symmetries) its cross sections {{can be used}} to generate one-dimensional aperiodic sequences.|$|E
5|$|As {{the capital}} of Silla, {{commerce}} and trading in Gyeongju developed early on. Samguk Sagi has records on the establishment of Gyeongdosi (capital area market) in March, 490 during King Soji's reign, and Dongsi (East Market) in 509, during King Jijeung's reign. In the 1830s, Gyeongju had five five-day markets which remained very active until the late 1920s. Due to its size Gyeongju Bunaejang (Gyeongju village market) {{was referred to as}} one of the two leading markets in the Yeongnam area, along with Daegu Bunaejang. Transportation developed in the late period of the Japanese occupation, as the Jungang Line and the Daegu Line and the connecting route between Pohang and the northwestern part of Japan were set up, leading to increasing population and developing commerce. After the 1960s, traditional <b>periodic</b> markets gradually transformed into regular markets as the city was flourishing. In <b>periodic</b> markets, agricultural and marine products, industrial products, living necessaries, wild edible greens, herbs, and cattle are mainly traded. As of 2006, Gyeongju had eight regular markets, nine <b>periodic</b> markets and the Gyeongju department store. Traditional <b>periodic</b> markets declined and have become token affairs these days.|$|E

5|$|Thallium is the {{heaviest}} stable element in group 13 of the <b>periodic</b> table. At {{the bottom of}} the <b>periodic</b> table, the inert pair effect is quite strong, because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons. It displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl+ (164pm), K+ (152pm) and Ag+ (129pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 <b>periodic</b> table and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 <b>periodic</b> table. (Mendeleev's 1871 <b>periodic</b> table and Meyer's 1870 <b>periodic</b> table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium. While Tl+ is stabilised by the inert pair effect, this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically, so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution. Additionally, the thallium halides (except TlF) are quite insoluble in water, and TlI has an unusual structure {{because of the presence of}} the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium.|$|E
