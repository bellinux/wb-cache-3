25|$|Class 88 was a three-car diesel-hydraulic {{standard}} gauge multiple unit. Each {{consisted of two}} <b>powered</b> <b>motor</b> cars with a driver's cab and an un-powered center car. The motor cars were initially designated Bmdo Class 1, but were shortly afterwards classified as Cmdo Class 8. The motor cars were numbered 18282–89 and the center cars 18951–54. They were reclassified and renumbered in 1956; the motor cars became Bmdo 88, numbered 88.02–09, the motor cars with kitchen classified as BEmdo 88 and the center cars as Bo3e. The center cars retained their old numbers. The first series of trains were classified as the a-series, the second as the b-series. The latter were delivered with the numbers 88.10–13 and the center cars as 18956–57. All the center cars took the new numbers 88.61–66 in 1970.|$|E
