Public elementary and secondary education were spared from the cuts, as were social workers, public defenders, corrections officers, and Kentucky State Police employees, all of whom received raises under Bevin's proposal. Public colleges and universities were not exempt from the cuts, and Bevin called for a gradual move to performance-based funding for higher education, with all higher education funding tied to performance by 2020.|$|E

5|$|The wider {{political}} environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile.

Nominally, the Confederation formed a part of the Holy Roman Empire. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the Swabian War in 1499, the Confederation had become de facto independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the Duchy of Milan, the Duchy of Savoy, and the Papal States competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. During this time the mercenary <b>pension</b> <b>system</b> became a subject of disagreement.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{transmission}} mechanism from family culture to economic institutions, {{by analyzing the}} impact of the within family organization on the original design of the public <b>pension</b> <b>systems.</b> We build a simple OLG model with families featuring either weak or strong internal ties. When <b>pensions</b> <b>systems</b> are initially introduced, in society with strong ties they replicate the tight link between generations by providing earnings related benefits; whereas in societies with weak family ties they only act as a safety net. To test this transition mechanism, we consider Todd (1982) historical classification of family types across countries. We find that in societies dominated by absolute nuclear families (i. e., weak family ties), <b>pension</b> <b>systems</b> act as a flat safety net entailing a large within-cohort redistribution, and viceversa in societies characterized by stronger family ties where <b>pension</b> <b>systems</b> are more generous. This link between the type of families and the design of <b>pension</b> <b>systems</b> is robust to testing for alternative explanations, such as legal origin, religion, urbanization and democratization of the country {{at the time of their}} introduction. Interestingly, historical family types matter for explaining the design of the <b>pension</b> <b>systems,</b> which represents a persistent feature, but not their size, which have largely changed over time. culture, institutions, historical evidence...|$|R
