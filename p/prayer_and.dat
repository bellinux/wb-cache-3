40|$|Speech {{acts are}} of great {{importance}} primarily {{within the bounds of}} semantics and should be on the basis of mutually shared background information between hearer and speaker. Curses <b>and</b> <b>prayers</b> are commonly used in everyday language. Whenever someone does a favour to us, we may say a prayer to God for him/her. We may curse at someone for making us angry or sad. By and large, we express our inner feelings and attitudes towards the hearer through saying prayers or curses; therefore, they are involved in expressive speech acts. The present article delivers a special classification of <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> curses which are as follows: a) <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> curses which are closely associated with our culture, tradition <b>and</b> religion; b) <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> curses which have been progressed and produced gradually and no specific cultural root can be traced for them. This type of speech acts is itself classified into two categories: the first one is composed of <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> curses which are frequently used by children in different contexts and the second category comprises those <b>prayers</b> <b>and</b> curses which English speakers have in common with Persian speakers.  </p...|$|R
