Cecil, who considered it to be brilliant, convinced him to have it published by Artic. Warriner then came to work for Artic (1985). The cassette tape game was released for the Amstrad CPC in 1986. His next game, which he wrote together with Adam Waring, was Ultima Ratio, a vertical scrolling arcade shoot 'em up, set in space above the earth.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} multiple aspects related to how fan <b>powered</b> <b>terminal</b> units (FPTU), {{as used in}} variable air volume systems, behave under as-built conditions. Whether this behavior conforms to accepted industry norms and expectations and how existing energy simulation tools react {{to a variety of}} input extremes based on program ?defaults? and ?rules of thumb?. The efforts by the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute to update existing energy models of FPTU?s raised the issue of quantifying the static pressure rise observed across FPTU?s. This study has corroborated existing laboratory results with in-situ ?field? measurements ranging between 0. 2 in. w. g. (50 Pa) to 0. 27 in. w. g. (67. 2 Pa). The in-situ measurements were expanded to include qualitative analyses of series and parallel FPTU leakage. The study demonstrated ? through observing temperature differences between the surround plenum and fan <b>powered</b> <b>terminal</b> unit induction port ? that there is no significant evidence of series FPTU leakage, while a single parallel FPTU was observed to have leaked. Coupling that data set with infrared (IR) images captured of pressurized parallel fan <b>powered</b> <b>terminal</b> units (usually considered normal operating conditions for parallel FPTU?s) showing evidence of leakage along the FPTU ?seams?, induction port and interface connections. The in-situ measurement also determined that ?field? FPTU?s operate under lower downstream static pressure conditions than those set by AHRI/ANSI 880. Ranging from 0. 0417 in. w. g. (10. 4 Pa) to 0. 1014 in. w. g. (25. 2 Pa). Previous research efforts independently quantified the two major inputs EnergyPlus requires to simulate fan <b>powered</b> <b>terminal</b> units (static pressure rise across the FPTU and motor efficiency). This study was expanded and aimed to determine which combination of the two inputs ? either within the quantified parameters or a combination of more extreme cases ? contributed to observable differences in energy consumption.

30|$|In the new {{generation}} of broadband mobile communication systems, multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) technique [1, 2] and heterogeneous networks [3 – 5] are key methods to enable the fast and reliable wireless communication access. On one hand, MIMO provides increased channel capacity and data rate using multiple antennas on both base stations and terminals. On the other hand, heterogeneous networks use hybrid networks with lower power nodes (pico, femto cells) and main nodes (macro cells) to achieve high-frequency efficiency and system capacity. The topology of a typical heterogeneous network consists of one macro cell and several pico/femto cells sharing the same frequency within the one area. Such networks bring co-channel interferences (CCI) which need to be eliminated in wireless communications [6 – 8]. For instance, users of the pico/femto cells are affected by the strong power signal from the macro cell, whereas high <b>power</b> <b>terminals</b> at the edge of macro and pico/femto cells produce strong interferences to the surrounding pico/femto cells. It is worthwhile to investigate methods to reduce or eliminate the CCI especially after MIMO be introduced to the heterogeneous networks.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{more and}} more {{electronic}} power switches with a nonlinear behavior generates non-sinusoidal currents in distribution networks, which causes damage to domestic and industrial equipment.

30|$|The {{detailed}} simulation {{process is}} as follows. When t < 6.0 s, outputs of <b>power</b> <b>terminals</b> in AC and DC MGs were Pp,ac = 1.0 and Pp,dc = 0.5. The unified control-based interlinking converters of MGs worked with initial power dispatch settings to P_IC,ac^* = 0.1 and P_IC,dc^* = − 0.2. At t = 6 s. Power dispatch settings of DC-AC and DC-DC interlinking converters of MGs were changed to P_IC,ac^* = − 0.1 and P_IC,dc^* = 0.1, {{which was used}} to simulate coordinated optimal control. Then, AC and DC MG slack terminals became unavailable at t = 7.5 s and at t = 10 s, respectively. It {{can be seen from}} the simulation results shown in Figs.  9 and 10 that, in normal operation mode (referred to t < 7.5 s), DC-AC and DC-DC interlinking converters accurately tracked the power dispatch settings. When the slack terminal of a MG became unavailable, the power dispatching loop of the related interlinking converter reached its limited value, shown in Fig.  9 b. The maximum and minimum values were set as 2 and −  2 respectively in this simulation, which had to be carefully designed for actual applications. As expected, the interlinking converters were seamlessly changed to MG support control with the proposed unified control without operational mode detection, communication, and control system switching.|$|E
