5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were trying to capture.|$|E
5|$|Dooley Wilson as Sam. He {{was one of}} the few American-born {{members of}} the cast. A drummer, he had to fake <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> Even after {{shooting}} had been completed, producer Wallis considered dubbing over Wilson's voice for the songs. He had originally considered changing the character to a woman and casting singers Hazel Scott, Lena Horne, or Ella Fitzgerald.|$|E
5|$|Silver began <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> in his {{childhood}} and had classical music lessons. His father taught him the folk music of Cape Verde. At the age of 11 Silver became interested in becoming a musician, after hearing the Jimmie Lunceford orchestra. His early piano influences included the styles of boogie-woogie and the blues, the pianists Nat King Cole, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Art Tatum, and Teddy Wilson, {{as well as some}} jazz horn players.|$|E
50|$|While Barthelmess's {{character}} sings and <b>plays</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> throughout <b>the</b> film, Barthelmess {{himself did}} not sing or <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> Frank Churchill <b>played</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and Johnny Murray sang into a microphone {{far away from}} Barthelmess while he lip-synced and played a piano which had strings deadened with felt.|$|R

5|$|Starting {{out in a}} {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen standing outside on the street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while trying to walk away without getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> back inside the theater.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{has several}} {{references}} to Christmas films. The title is {{a play on}} Miracle on 34th Street while the scene where everyone rallies around to support the Simpsons {{is reminiscent of the}} last scene of the classic holiday movie It's a Wonderful Life. The film is further spoofed when Homer tells Lisa to stop <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> which parodies a similar scene involving George Bailey.|$|E

5|$|Picard is irritated {{that the}} stellar {{cartography}} department has shut down several systems on the Enterprise, and visits the section {{to discover what}} is going on. He meets {{the head of the}} department, Lt. Commander Nella Daren, who makes an impression on Picard. It is a meeting memorable enough to later discuss with Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden). At a musical recital by Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Picard is surprised to see Daren, once again, <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> The two discuss music, and later meet in Picard's quarters and participate in a duet.

5|$|Uematsu, a self-taught musician, began <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> {{at the age}} of twelve, with English singer-songwriter Elton John as {{his biggest}} influence. Uematsu joined Square in 1986, where he first met Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The two later worked {{together}} on many titles at the company, most notably in the Final Fantasy series. After nearly two decades with Square, Uematsu left in 2004 to create his own production company, which included the Dog Ear Records music label. He has since composed music as a freelancer for other games, including ones developed by Square Enix and Sakaguchi's development studio, Mistwalker.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Compton, the {{chairman}} of the University of Chicago physics department, coordinated the uranium research of Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California, Berkeley. To remove disagreement and duplication, Compton transferred the scientists to the Metallurgical Laboratory at Chicago. Teller was left behind at first, because while he and Mici were now American citizens, they still had relatives in enemy countries. In early 1943, the Los Alamos laboratory was established in Los Alamos, New Mexico to design an atomic bomb, with Oppenheimer as its director. Teller moved there in March 1943. Apparently, Teller managed to annoy his neighbors there by <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> late in the night.|$|E

He enjoyed writing and began keeping a detailed journal of daily activities during his senior year of high school, expressing his aspirations for the future along with occasional doubts. With several classmates, he began a literary club and published a newsletter, The Inkstand. He also showed interest in music, <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and violin, and composed a song for his high school senior class. When it was not selected by the class officers, he wrote in his journal of his disappointment.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Kimball {{began work}} at the Thatcher branch of the Arizona Trust and Savings Bank, where he was {{eventually}} promoted to assistant cashier at $225 per month, a high salary at the time. The bank failed in 1923, {{in the aftermath of}} the Depression of 1920–21; Kimball lost his $3000 investments in bank stock and was forced to take a lower-paying job at another bank. Kimball also performed a variety of other local jobs to earn extra income to support his wife and children, including <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and singing at local events, stringing with Camilla for local newspapers, distributing for an herbal laxative company, and clerical work for local stores.|$|E
5|$|Summerhayes {{hoped that}} Titterton {{would be able}} to enter the University of Cambridge, but the paper mill that his father worked for closed due to the Great Depression, leaving his father {{unemployed}} for a time, and unable to afford it. Instead, in 1934, Titterton was accepted into University of Birmingham on a teacher's scholarship, which paid his tuition fees, board and residence at Chancellor's Hall, a hostel for male undergraduates. Due to his achievements at secondary school, Ernest was allowed to begin his tertiary studies with second-year subjects, and even then he was said to have found them easy. He obtained his Bachelor of Science in 1936 with distinctions in both pure and applied mathematics and, of course, physics. An honours year quickly followed, and Titterton topped the year in physics. He continued his interest in music, <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> at social events. He also played hockey with the university First XI from 1934 to 1936.|$|E

5|$|The clip {{starts with}} a bride reaching, on a limousine, the chapel on which she's about to get married. As she is shown walking inside the chapel's doors, Arjona starts to sing while sit on the chairs in the empty chapel. Then, the bride is shown again {{alongside}} the groom in the altar, ready to make the vows, while the chapel {{is filled with the}} invitees. Then, scenes of Arjona <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and singing, and scenes of the ceremony are interpolated, showing the behaviour of the invitees. Later, the invitees are shown involved in discussions and fights while Arjona keeps singing the chorus and verses of the song. As the fights between the invitees increase, the groom rejects the bride and she, stunned, escapes from the chapel. Then, it is shown that all was an illusion from the bride, and they are shown exiting the chapel, married. As of 11 July 2012, the video has reached 14 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} two men fighting, {{including}} one of them being thrown to the floor by the latter. Stanlistening to the action from her houseleaves the place by car, following which she and her boyfriend are presented sitting {{at opposite ends of}} a bed. The singer is eventually left by the male alone in the room, with him being shown entering a supermarket while Stan lays on the ground near a piano. Later, he gets back to her house again, but Stan closes the door in his face. Subsequently, she is portrayed traveling with a red car previously shown in the beginning, arriving at an old vehicle and holding a bird on her arm. Over the rest of the music video, the singer is shown meeting her love interest face to face two more times, including a performance of the song to a bar's crowd in which he is featured, sporting a white dress and head accessory. Her suitor ends struggling with alcohol issues. Scenes interspersed through the main video present the singer laying over the abandoned vehicle, and <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> in her room.|$|E
5|$|The film's setting, {{which appears}} to be a major city, is never {{identified}} in The Brute Man, but {{it has been suggested that}} it is Manhattan, since that is where House of Horrors took place. Commentators have noted similarities between The Brute Man and other films, including the Charlie Chaplin silent comedy City Lights (1931), and the Universal Pictures horror film Bride of Frankenstein (1935). City Lights, like The Brute Man, included a protagonist (Chaplin's Tramp character) who falls in love with a blind girl and seeks money for an operation to restore her eyesight. Likewise, the scenes between the Creeper and Helen Paige share a similar premise and dialogue as the scenes between Frankenstein's monster and the blind hermit in Bride of Frankenstein. In both films, the protagonists are shunned by society based on their physical appearance, but find companionship in a blind loner who knows nothing about their deformities. In both instances, the protagonist is first drawn to their blind companions by music. The Creeper heard Helen <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> while Frankenstein's monster heard the hermit playing the violin. Commentators have noted other similarities between the two films. For example, the Creeper smashes a mirror after looking at his misshapen face, much like the Monster lashes out at his reflection in a waterfall pool.|$|E
