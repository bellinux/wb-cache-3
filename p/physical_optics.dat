5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on <b>physical</b> <b>optics</b> and radiative transfer).|$|E
25|$|Gaussian beam {{propagation}} is {{a simple}} paraxial <b>physical</b> <b>optics</b> model for the propagation of coherent radiation such as laser beams. This technique partially accounts for diffraction, allowing accurate calculations of {{the rate at which}} a laser beam expands with distance, and the minimum size to which the beam can be focused. Gaussian beam propagation thus bridges the gap between geometric and <b>physical</b> <b>optics.</b>|$|E

25|$|Classical optics {{is divided}} into two main branches: {{geometrical}} (or ray) optics and physical (or wave) optics. In geometrical optics, light is considered to travel in straight lines, while in <b>physical</b> <b>optics,</b> light is considered as an electromagnetic wave.|$|E

25|$|Descartes is not {{the first}} to use the {{mechanical}} analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes' theory of light is regarded as the start of modern <b>physical</b> <b>optics.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first <b>physical</b> <b>optics</b> {{model of}} {{diffraction}} that {{relied on the}} Huygens–Fresnel principle was developed in 1803 by Thomas Young in his interference experiments with the interference patterns of two closely spaced slits. Young showed that his results could only be explained if the two slits acted as two unique sources of waves rather than corpuscles. In 1815 and 1818, Augustin-Jean Fresnel firmly established the mathematics of how wave interference can account for diffraction.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to birefringence and dichroism in extended media, polarization effects can also {{occur at the}} (reflective) interface between two materials of different refractive index. These effects are treated by the Fresnel equations. Part of the wave is transmitted and part is reflected, with the ratio depending on angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. In this way, <b>physical</b> <b>optics</b> recovers Brewster's angle. When light reflects from a thin film on a surface, interference between the reflections from the film's surfaces can produce polarization in the reflected and transmitted light.|$|E

25|$|Newtonian optics was {{generally}} accepted {{until the early}} 19th century when Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel conducted experiments on the interference of light that firmly established light's wave nature. Young's famous double slit experiment showed that light followed the law of superposition, which is a wave-like property not predicted by Newton's corpuscle theory. This work led to a theory of diffraction for light and opened an entire area of study in <b>physical</b> <b>optics.</b> Wave optics was successfully unified with electromagnetic theory by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{principle}} of Huygens {{is that the}} speed of light is finite, a point which had been the subject of an experimental demonstration by Olaus Roemer (1679 at the Paris Observatory), but which Huygens is presumed to have believed already. The theory is kinematic and its scope largely restricted to geometric optics. It covers little of what would now be termed <b>physical</b> <b>optics.</b> It deals with wave fronts and their normal rays, with propagation conceived by means of spherical waves emitted along the wave front (see also Huygens–Fresnel principle). It was justified as an ether theory, involving transmission via perfectly elastic particles, a revision of the view of Descartes. The nature of light was therefore a longitudinal wave.|$|E
25|$|Most optical {{phenomena}} can {{be accounted}} for using the classical electromagnetic description of light. Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however, often difficult to apply in practice. Practical optics is usually done using simplified models. The most common of these, geometric optics, treats light {{as a collection of}} rays that travel in straight lines and bend when they pass through or reflect from surfaces. <b>Physical</b> <b>optics</b> is a more comprehensive model of light, which includes wave effects such as diffraction and interference that cannot {{be accounted for}} in geometric optics. Historically, the ray-based model of light was developed first, followed by the wave model of light. Progress in electromagnetic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
50|$|Unlike optical illusions that {{utilize the}} {{misinterpretation}} {{of the human}} brain to create illusionary perception different from the <b>physical</b> measurement, illusion <b>optics</b> changes the optical response or properties of objects.

25|$|Classically, Fermat's {{principle}} can {{be considered}} as a mathematical consequence of Huygens' principle. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extrema (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes ABj, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or <b>physical</b> <b>optics.</b> The various optical paths ABj will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. But if there is a shortest route AB0, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB0 will have optical paths differing from AB0 by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB0 will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.|$|E
25|$|Refractive {{processes}} {{take place}} in the <b>physical</b> <b>optics</b> limit, where the wavelength of light is similar to other distances, as a kind of scattering. The simplest type of scattering is Thomson scattering which occurs when electromagnetic waves are deflected by single particles. In the limit of Thomson scattering, in which the wavelike nature of light is evident, light is dispersed independent of the frequency, in contrast to Compton scattering which is frequency-dependent and strictly a quantum mechanical process, involving the nature of light as particles. In a statistical sense, elastic scattering of light by numerous particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light is a process known as Rayleigh scattering while the similar process for scattering by particles that are similar or larger in wavelength is known as Mie scattering with the Tyndall effect being a commonly observed result. A small proportion of light scattering from atoms or molecules may undergo Raman scattering, wherein the frequency changes due to excitation of the atoms and molecules. Brillouin scattering occurs when the frequency of light changes due to local changes with time and movements of a dense material.|$|E

There are two approaches {{to the study of}} reflection: <b>physical</b> and geometrical <b>optics.</b> While geometrical models may be consumed as mere approximations to physical models, they possess simpler mathematical forms that often render them more usable than physical models. However, geometrical models are applicable only when the wavelength of incident light is small compared to the dimensions of the surface imperfections. Therefore, it is incorrect to use these models to interpret or predict reflections from smooth surfaces, and only physical models are capable of describing the underlying reflection mechanism...|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, physics {{had evolved}} to the point at which {{classical}} mechanics could cope with highly complex problems involving macroscopic situations; thermodynamics and kinetic theory were well established; geometrical and <b>physical</b> <b>optics</b> could be understood in terms of electromagnetic waves; and the conservation laws for energy and momentum (and mass) were widely accepted. So profound were these and other developments that it was generally accepted that all the important laws of physics had been discovered and that, henceforth, research would be concerned with clearing up minor problems and particularly with improvements of method and measurement. However, around 1900 serious doubts arose about the completeness of the classical theories—the triumph of Maxwell's theories, for example, was undermined by inadequacies that had already begun to appear—and their inability to explain certain physical phenomena, such as the energy distribution in blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect, while some of the theoretical formulations led to paradoxes when pushed to the limit. Prominent physicists such as Hendrik Lorentz, Emil Cohn, Ernst Wiechert and Wilhelm Wien believed that some modification of Maxwell's equations might provide the basis for all physical laws. These shortcomings of classical physics were never to be resolved and new ideas were required. At the beginning of the 20th century a major revolution shook the world of physics, which led to a new era, generally referred to as modern physics.|$|E

40|$|Entanglement between {{large numbers}} of quantum modes is the quintessential {{resource}} for future technologies such as the quantum internet. Conventionally the generation of multimode entanglement in optics requires complex layouts of beam-splitters and phase shifters in order to transform the input modes in to entangled modes.

Here {{we report on the}} highly versatile and efficient generation of various multimode entangled states with the ability to switch between different linear optics networks in real time. By defining our modes to be combinations of different spatial regions of one beam, we may use just one pair of multi-pixel detectors each with M photodiodes in order to measure N entangled modes, with a maximum number of N=M modes.
