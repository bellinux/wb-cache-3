60|$|The others quite {{agreed with}} Captain Reuben's views, {{and the next}} morning the ship's head was pointed west. Two days later, when passing an island they saw, on opening a headland, a port with many houses, and a Spanish flag flying from a mast on shore. Two large Spanish vessels were lying there.

50|$|In <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> {{that range}} from {{close-hauled}} to a broad reach, sails act substantially like a wing, with lift predominantly propelling the craft. In <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> from a broad reach to down wind, sails act substantially like a parachute, with drag predominantly propelling the craft. For craft with little forward resistance ice boats and land yachts, this transition occurs further off the wind than for sailboats and sailing ships.|$|R
60|$|General Hunter had, before sitting down, {{introduced}} him to all the members with a few pleasant words, which had put him at his ease.

60|$|The volcano went {{to sleep}} again {{for a short time}} after that little {{indication}} of its power, and you may be sure that old Rigonda did not wait for its reawakening. One of his own ships was on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> that very day. He went on board--after cleaning himself--got Brooks to wind up their business relations in the cabin, and left for England with a fair wind.|$|E
60|$|Harry {{remained}} but a {{few days}} in Bombay, wound up his affairs with his agents there and, being fortunate in finding a vessel that was on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing,</b> took passage in her for England. The voyage was an uneventful one. They experienced bad weather off the Cape but, with that exception, carried all canvas till they entered the Channel. Here they encountered another gale, but arrived safely in the Thames, four months after leaving Calcutta.|$|E

50|$|Three sail shape {{controls}} which {{control the}} leech tension, and therefore sail twist, are the mainsheet, the boom vang and the traveler. The mainsheet pulls the boom (and therefore the foot <b>of</b> the <b>sail)</b> primarily inwards at lower <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> and downwards at higher <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> Manipulation <b>of</b> the traveler can counteract {{this because it}} always pulls the boom laterally. The vang {{on the other hand}} does the opposite, it always changes the height of the boom.|$|R

"I {{have always}} stayed before till the crew were paid off; but {{no sooner had}} we cast anchor {{than one of the}} owners came on board, and told the captain that another cargo was ready, that the ship was to be {{unloaded}} with all speed, and to take in cargo and sail again in a fortnight at the utmost, as a fleet was on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> for the West Indies under a strong convoy." ...|$|E
60|$|Rhoda met them, with Miss Scudamore, at Portsmith, having {{received}} a letter telling them of Tom's wound, and of their being upon the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing.</b> There was a great reduction of the army {{at the end of}} the war, and the Scudamores were both placed upon half pay. This was a matter of delight to Rhoda, and of satisfaction to themselves. They had had enough of adventure to last for a life-time; and with the prospect of a long peace the army no longer offered them any strong attraction.|$|E
60|$|The sky was clear; it blew hard, and {{was bitter}} cold; {{a great deal}} of {{daylight}} lingered; and the moon, which was nearly full, shone brightly. The brig was close hauled, so as to round the southwest corner of the Island of Mull, the hills of which (and Ben More above them all, with a wisp of mist upon the top of it) lay full upon the lar-board bow. Though it was no good <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> for the Covenant, she tore through the seas at a great rate, pitching and straining, and pursued by the westerly swell.|$|E
50|$|For {{apparent}} wind angles {{aligned with the}} entry <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sail,</b> the sail acts as an airfoil and lift is the predominant component of propulsion. For {{apparent wind}} angles behind the sail, lift diminishes and drag increases as the predominant component of propulsion. For a given true wind velocity over the surface, a sail can propel a craft to a higher speed, on <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> when the entry <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sail</b> is aligned with the apparent wind, than it can with the entry point not aligned, because {{of a combination of}} the diminished force from airflow around the sail and the diminished apparent wind from the velocity of the craft. Because of limitations on speed through the water, displacement sailboats generally derive power from sails generating lift on <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> that include close-hauled through broad reach (approximately 40° to 135° off the wind). Because of low friction over the surface and high speeds over the ice that create high apparent wind speeds for most <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail,</b> iceboats can derive power from lift further off the wind than displacement boats.|$|R
50|$|Most {{match racing}} is between one-design boats, meaning that ideally the boats should perform identically on all <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> {{and that any}} {{differences}} in performance are attributable to the crew. The most notable match race is the America's Cup which was until 2007 <b>sailed</b> by boats <b>of</b> the International America's Cup Class, which is a formula class. The design of America's Cup Class boats is controlled by a complex formula which allows designers a fair bit of room to optimize for different expected conditions. This has resulted in boats that do not perform identically on all <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail,</b> which opens up another match racing tactic of forcing the opponent onto an unfavored <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> During the 2003 America's Cup Challenger Series between Oracle BMW Racing and Alinghi, for example, the Alinghi boat was heavier but more powerful and favored on higher <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> downwind. Alinghi used the tactic of getting to leeward of Oracle on a downwind leg and forcing her up onto a course where Alinghi was comparatively faster, although Alinghi herself could have sailed faster {{to the finish line}} on a lower course.|$|R

60|$|There was a haze on the water, but a {{light wind}} was stirring, and the vessel was {{moving through the}} water at some three knots an hour. As soon as her course had been changed, so as to bring the wind forward of the beam, which was her best <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing,</b> the men {{were sent to the}} guns; the first mate placing himself at a long {{eighteen}} pounder, which was mounted as a pivot gun aft, a similar weapon being in her bows.

60|$|I {{will not}} take up my readers' time with a minute account of all that {{occurred}} before I took my final leave of my dear parents.

My mother gave me her blessing and a small Bible; and her last request was that I would never forget to read a chapter every day and say my prayers, which I promised, with tears in my eyes, that I would certainly do.|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} six months Gervaise worked at various duties in the town. He was {{employed}} for a fortnight in the infirmary, then for a while he was transferred to the galleys; {{but for the most part}} he was with the slaves working on the fortifications. At the end of that time he was, to his great delight, informed by the bailiff that he was one of the six knights of the langue told off to join a galley that was on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing.</b> Among those going in her was Sir Ralph Harcourt, one of his companions on the journey from England.|$|E

50|$|Self {{steering}} aboard Winnibelle II on its Atlantic crossing from Douarnenez, France, to New York in 1933 {{was somewhat}} {{similar to a}} Braine gear, using twin jibs (Trinquettes jumelles) with their sheets connected to the rudder via an array of blocks and lines. The long keeled Winnibelle II was perfectly stable on course on close-hauled or beam reach <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> but the self steering twin jib system could take over in the trickier downwind broad reaches and running <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sailing {{employs the}} wind—acting on sails, wingsails or kites—to propel a craft {{on the surface}} <b>of</b> the water (<b>sailing</b> ship, sailboat, windsurfer, or kitesurfer), on ice (iceboat) or on land (land yacht) over a chosen course, which is often {{part of a larger}} plan of navigation. A course defined with respect to the true wind {{direction}} is called a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> Conventional sailing craft cannot derive power from <b>sails</b> on a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> that is too close into the wind. On a given <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail,</b> the sailor adjusts the alignment <b>of</b> each <b>sail</b> with respect to the apparent wind direction (as perceived on the craft) to mobilize the power of the wind. The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull, keel, and rudder <b>of</b> a <b>sailing</b> craft, by forces from skate runners of an iceboat, or by forces from wheels <b>of</b> a land <b>sailing</b> craft to allow steering the course.|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding {{the natural}} and common-place manner in which this {{separation}} took place, there was much distrust on board each vessel, {{and a good deal}} of consummate management on the part of Spike. The latter knew that every foot the sloop-of-war went on her course, carried her just so far to leeward, placing his own brig, in-so-much, dead to windward of her. As the Swash's best <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing,</b> relatively considered, was close-hauled, this was giving to Spike a great security against any change of purpose {{on the part of the}} vessel of war. Although his people were aloft and actually sent down the topgallant-mast, it was only to send it up again, the spar being of admirable toughness, and as sound as the day it was cut.|$|E
60|$|We {{had been}} in hopes that we might {{possibly}} reach Clawbonny before the tidings of our loss. This intelligence was likely to defeat the expectation; but, luckily, {{one of the fastest}} sloops on the river, a Hudson packet, was on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing,</b> and, though the wind held well to the northward, her master thought {{he should be able to}} turn up with the tides, as high as our creek, in the course of the next eight-and-forty hours. This was quite as much as the Wallingford could do, I felt well persuaded; and, making a bargain to be landed on the western shore, Rupert and I put our things on board this packet, and were under way in half an hour's time.|$|E

They escape in a boat and drift ashore upon a beautiful volcanic island, where, after sundry adventures, they come upon the half-burned remains of the ship, out of whose timbers they construct a small vessel, but when on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> are discovered by the Malays. They are in great peril, when a volcanic eruption, while increasing their danger, relieves them of their enemies, and they finally escape and reach a civilized port.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> {{clarify the}} realities <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> into the wind. One <b>of</b> the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> is [...] "Head to Wind." [...] A boat turns through {{this point on}} each tack. It is {{the point at which}} the boat is neither on port tack or {{starboard}} tack and is headed directly into the wind. However, a boat cannot sail directly into the wind, thus if it comes head to the wind it loses steerage and is said to be [...] "in irons." [...] Thus boats sailing into the wind are actually sailing [...] "Close Hauled" [...] (i.e., with sails tightly trimmed).|$|R
