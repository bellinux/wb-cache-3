Large plasmids have been shown experimentally to increase the virulence of NMEC in the rat model of neonatal meningitis.

One hundred and forty-three strains (71 serovars) of salmonella and 35 strains of other species were tested using specific oligonucleotide primers. The amplification products were identified by a specific oligonucleotide probe. Forty-nine salmonella strains from ten serovars (S. abortus ovis, S. choleraesuis, S. dublin, S. enteritidis, S. gallinarum/pullorum, S. hessarek, S. typhimurium, S. IIIa 48 :z 4, z 23, S.

40|$|Crown gall tumors {{produced}} octopine or nopaline or neither compound, {{depending on}} the bacterial strain that incited the tumor. The genes specifying production of octopine or nopaline by the tumor were transferred to recipient bacterial strains when the large plasmid associated with virulence was transferred by either conjugation or deoxyribonucleic acid-mediated transformation. Our results, which confirm the work of others (Bomhoff et al., 1976; Goldman et al., 1968; Petit et al., 1970), indicate that, in general, the strains that utilize octopine induce tumors that synthesize octopine, and those that utilize nopaline induce tumors that synthesize nopaline. However, there were several notable exceptions. One class utilized both octopine and nopaline, but the tumors induced by these strains produced only nopaline. Another class utilized nopaline, but their tumors synthesized neither nopaline nor octopine. Mutants were isolated {{from a number of}} either octopine- or nopaline-utilizing strains that no longer could utilize the relevant guanido amino acid. These strains, which were mutant in the gene specifying octopine or nopaline oxidase, still retained the permease for these amino acids as well as virulence. Tumors induced by these mutants still synthesized approximately the same levels of octopine and nopaline as tumors induced by their parents. These results suggest that the <b>plasmid</b> <b>gene</b> that determines production of octopine or nopaline by the tumor is distinct from the <b>plasmid</b> <b>gene</b> that determines their catabolism by the bacteria...|$|E

The system {{is based on}} production of catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase [CatO 2 ase; catechol:oxygen 2, 3 -oxidoreductase (decyclizing), EC 1. 13. 11. 2] encoded by the Pseudomonas putida TOL <b>plasmid</b> <b>gene</b> xylE. The gene was transferred to aB. subtilis/Escherichia coli plasmid vector to construct pTG 402. Although xylE is functionally expressed in E. coli, CatO 2 ase is not detected in B. subtilis unless a fragment of DNA capable of promoting gene expression is ligated into a cleavage site on pTG 402 upstream from xylE. Fragments of chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, and E. coli are shown to promote xylE gene expression in B. subtilis. The special feature {{of the system is}} the method of detection: colonies of cells that express xylE become yellow within seconds after selection plates are sprayed with catechol, a colorless substrate that is converted by CatO 2 ase to the yellow product, 2 -hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. The complete nucleotide sequence of xylE is presented. Strong complementarity between the ribosome binding site and 16 S rRNA suggests that xylE mRNA translation in B. subtilis may commence at the same site as that recognized by P. putida.

50|$|Bacteria can {{incorporate}} DNA {{from many different}} species into their own genetic libraries. Two {{of the most common}} methods involve plasmids and bacteriophages. Incorporation of DNA from plasmids between two bacterial cells usually involves the creation of a pilus. One bacteria, the donor cell, initiates transmition by extending the pilus to connect with the acceptor cell. The DNA from the plasmid is cut by an endonuclease and a single strand is transferred to the donor cell. Both cells replicate the single strand into a double strand. Plasmids can become incorporated into the full bacterial chromosome. The restriction sites still exist, meaning various lengths of DNA can be transposed from one cell to another directly from the chromosome.

40|$|Mobile genetic {{elements}} such as plasmids are important {{for the evolution of}} prokaryotes. It has been suggested that there are differences between functions coded for by mobile genes and those in the "core” genome and that these differences can be seen between plasmids and chromosomes. In particular, {{it has been suggested that}} essential genes, such as those involved in the formation of structural proteins or in basic metabolic functions, are rarely located on plasmids. We model competition between genotypically varying bacteria within a single population to investigate whether selection favors a chromosomal location for essential genes. We find that in general, chromosomal locations for essential genes are indeed favored. This is because the inheritance of chromosomes is more stable than that for plasmids. We define the "degradation” rate as the rate at which chance genetic processes, for example, mutation, deletion, or translocation, render essential genes nonfunctioning. The only way in which plasmids can be a location for functioning essential genes is if chromosomal genes degrade faster than <b>plasmid</b> <b>genes.</b> If the two degradation rates are equal, or if <b>plasmid</b> <b>genes</b> degrade faster than chromosomal genes, functioning essential genes will be found only on chromosome...|$|R
