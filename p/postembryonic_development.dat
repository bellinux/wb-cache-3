50|$|The {{life cycle}} {{takes place in}} 1-3 years. The <b>postembryonic</b> <b>development</b> {{consists}} of four larval stages (instars) and one pupa. The larvae of the first instar differ from other stages in both ethology and trophic regime. The larvae of most known asilids live in the soil {{or in the case}} of some taxonomic groups, in rotting organic material, usually wood and the bark of dead trees. With regard to feeding behavior, most of the literature gives the larvae of the Asilidae as entomophagous, but there are doubts about the real nature of the trophic regime and its mechanisms. The entomophagy of some species had indeed been already hypothesized by some authors of the nineteenth century, based on the findings of larvae of asilids associated with larvae of other insects, but Melin (1923) asserted that, in reality, predation was occasional and secondary to the plant-based diet. More recent studies have confirmed the entomophagy of some asilids without extending this species's feeding behavior for the whole family. Less certain, however, is the mechanism of implementing entomophagy: in general, the behavior is cited as predation, but for some species may be ectoparasitoids. Musso (1983) described the feeding behavior of the larvae of Machimus rusticus and its evolution during <b>postembryonic</b> <b>development</b> : in particular, the larvae of the first instar does not feed on insects, those of the second instar feed on secretions by larvae of beetles (and may cause death), while the larvae of the third and fourth instars actually behave like predators. In short, the feeding behavior of larval asilids can configure as intermediate between predation and ectoparasitism.|$|E

The phenotype of the rml 1 mutant, which was also evident in the roots of wild-type Arabidopsis and tobacco treated with an inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis, could be relieved by applying GSH to rml 1 seedlings.

50|$|Embryogenesis may {{be divided}} up into two phases, the first {{involves}} morphogenetic events which form the basic cellular pattern {{for the development}} of the shoot-root body and the primary tissue layers; it also programs the regions of meristematic tissue formation. The second phase, or <b>postembryonic</b> <b>development,</b> involves the maturation of cells, which involves cell growth and the storage of macromolecules (such as oils, starches and proteins) required as a 'food and energy supply' during germination and seedling growth. Embryogenesis involves cell growth and division, cell differentiation and programmed cellular death. The zygotic embryo is formed following double fertilisation of the ovule, giving rise to two distinct structures: the plant embryo and the endosperm which together go on to develop into a seed. Seeds may also develop without fertilization, which is referred to as apomixis. Plant cells can also be induced to form embryos in plant tissue culture; such embryos are called somatic embryos and can be used to generate new plants from single cells.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the high}} number of species of this family, the biology of juveniles of most species is poorly understood. The <b>postembryonic</b> <b>development</b> is of the type hypermetamorphic, with {{parasitoid}} or hyperparasitoid larvae. Exceptions are the larvae of Heterotropinae, whose biology {{is similar to that of}} other Asiloidea, with predatory larvae that do not undergo hypermetamorphosis. Hosts of bee flies belong to different orders of insects, but mostly are among the holometabolous orders. Among these are Hymenoptera, in particular the superfamilies of Vespoidea and Apoidea, beetles, other flies, and moths. Larvae of some species including Villa sp. feed on ova of Orthoptera. Bombylius major larvae are parasitic on solitary bees including Andrena. Anthrax anale is a parasite of tiger beetle larvae, and A. trifasciata is a parasite of the wall bee. Several African species of Villa and Thyridanthrax are parasitic pupae of tsetse flies. Villa morio is parasitic on the beneficial ichneumonid species Banchus femoralis. The larvae of Dipalta are parasitic on antlions.|$|E

Although much is known about embryonic neurogenesis, {{little is known about}} the genetic control of <b>postembryonic</b> brain <b>development.</b> Here we use mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) to study the role of the brain tumor (brat) gene in neural proliferation control and tumour suppression in <b>postembryonic</b> brain <b>development</b> of Drosophila. Our findings indicate that overproliferation in brat mutants is due to loss of proliferation control in the larval central brain and not in the optic lobe. Clonal analysis indicates that the brat mutation affects cell proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner and cell cycle marker expression shows that cells of brat mutant clones show uncontrolled proliferation, which persists into adulthood. Analysis of the expression of molecular markers, which characterize cell types in wild-type neural lineages, indicates that brat mutant clones comprise an excessive number of cells, which have molecular features of undifferentiated progenitor cells that lack nuclear Prospero (Pros). pros mutant clones phenocopy brat mutant clones in the larval central brain, and targeted expression of wild-type pros in brat mutant clones promotes cell cycle exit and differentiation of brat mutant cells, thereby abrogating brain tumour formation.

In contrast, very little is known about neuroblasts, neural lineages, or any other aspect of the <b>postembryonic</b> <b>development</b> in the SEG. Here we characterize the neuroanatomy of the larval SEG in terms of tracts, commissures, and other landmark features as compared to a thoracic ganglion. We then use clonal MARCM labeling to identify all adult-specific neuroblast lineages in the late larval SEG and find a surprisingly small number of neuroblast lineages, 13 paired and one unpaired. The Hox genes Dfd, Scr, and Antp are expressed in a lineage-specific manner in these lineages during <b>postembryonic</b> <b>development.</b> Hox gene loss-of-function causes lineage-specific defects in axonal targeting and reduction in neural cell numbers. Moreover, it results in the formation of novel ectopic neuroblast lineages. Apoptosis block also results in ectopic lineages suggesting that Hox genes are required for lineage-specific termination of proliferation through programmed cell death. Taken together, our findings show that <b>postembryonic</b> <b>development</b> in the SEG is mediated by a surprisingly small set of identified lineages and requires lineage-specific Hox gene action to ensure the correct formation of adult-specific neurons in the Drosophila brain...|$|E

The actions of T 3 are mediated by T 3 receptors (TRs) that bind T 3 response elements (T 3 REs) in the genome and regulate gene transcription through recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes. Methylation of DNA is another critical epigenetic modification that controls gene transcription. Using mouse and frog (T 3 controls tadpole metamorphosis), I investigated T 3 -dependent modulation of DNA methylation, regulation of genes that control this epigenetic modification, and roles of DNA methylation in regulation of gene expression programs in the brain. I discovered that TRs directly activate the transcription of the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3 a (Dnmt 3 a) gene that encodes a key enzyme that establishes genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in the developing brains of mouse and frog. I identified two functional T 3 REs that support T 3 -dependent transactivation of the Dnmt 3 a genes. I found strong sequence conservation of the mouse T 3 REs among eutherian mammals. I found that the tadpole brain genome became demethylated during metamorphosis, which correlated with activation of genes {{that are involved in}} active DNA demethylation (tet 2, tet 3, apobec 2, gadd 45 β, gadd 45 γ and tdg). Treating premetamorphic tadpoles with exogenous T 3 induced tet 3, gadd 45 γ and tdg mRNAs. I found that T 3 REs for known T 3 -regulated genes (klf 9 and dnmt 3 a) became demethylated during metamorphosis and in response to T 3. In vitro methylation of DNA fragments containing these T 3 REs subcloned into reporter plasmids abrogated T 3 -dependent transactivity, suggesting that DNA demethylation of T 3 REs activates T 3 -regulated genes. To identify gene expression programs that are regulated by DNA methylation, I conducted methylated DNA capture sequencing and RNA-sequencing in tadpole brain. I identified ~ 142, 000 genomic regions enriched for methylated DNA and 855 regions that showed changes during metamorphosis. More than 5, 000 genes showed changes in expression, and I identified thirteen patterns of expression dynamics and enriched biological pathways among these genes.

The head length of newly born G. aequicauda was approximately 0. 23 mm (0. 1 mg dry weight), and the head reached a maximum length of about 1. 8 mm (11. 85 mg) after 140 d. There was a significant correlation between hea...|$|R
