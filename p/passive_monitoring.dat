The region examined included rural and suburban areas, and the highly industrialised area of Windsor, Ontario, which is situated directly across the US-Canada border from Detroit, MI. Photolytic NO 2 monitors were collocated with standard NO 2 monitors to provide qualitative data regarding NO z interference during the campaign. The accuracy of the OMI-inferred concentrations was tested using two-week integrative NO 2 measurements collected with <b>passive</b> <b>monitors</b> at 18 locations, approximating a 15 km grid across the region, for 7 consecutive two-week periods. When compared with these passive results, satellite-inferred concentrations showed an 18 % positive bias.

OMI-inferred concentrations were then calculated for four years to show an overall declining trend in surface NO 2 concentrations in the region.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Passive</b> network <b>monitors,</b> {{known as}} telescopes or darknets, have been {{invaluable}} in detecting and characterizing malware outbreaks. However, {{as the use}} of such monitors becomes commonplace, it is likely that malware will evolve to actively detect and evade them. This paper highlights the threat of simple, yet effective, evasive attacks that undermine the usefulness of <b>passive</b> <b>monitors.</b> Our results raise an alarm to the research and operational communities to take proactive countermeasures before we are forced to defend against similar attacks appearing in the wild. Specifically, we show how lightweight, coordinated sampling of the IP address space can be used to successfully detect and evade <b>passive</b> network <b>monitors.</b> Equally troubling is the fact that in doing so attackers can locate the âlive â IP space clusters and divert malware scanning solely toward active networks. We show that evasive attacks exploiting this knowledge are also extremely fast, overtaking the entire vulnerable population within seconds...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) {{is one of}} many {{airborne}} pollutants {{emitted by}} concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). However, few studies have characterized ambient H 2 S levels near these facilities, largely {{due to the lack of}} low-cost, reliable, and easily transportable instrumentation available to researchers. We determined intermediate environmental H 2 S exposure near CAFOs using Radiello <b>passive</b> <b>monitors.</b> First, a laboratory study was performed to determine the accuracy of the device. Next, a total of eight passive H 2 S monitors were deployed bi-weekly in close proximity (< 40 m) to a medium-sized swine confinement for seven months in order to determine the temporal and spatial variability of H 2 S. Finally, we measured H 2 S concentrations across two rural Iowa counties to characterize ambient exposure near thirteen CAFOs and two schools. The value of the temperature-adjusted H 2 S passive diffusion rate provided by the supplier was 29 % larger than the 24 h rate determined experimentally. Concentrations of H 2 S measured near the medium-sized confinement were varied and ranged from 0. 2 to 48. 6 ppb depending on the sampling period and proximity to a lagoon on the property. Two-week concentrations near the schools were low (< 1 ppb), while concentrations near the thirteen CAFOs ranged from 0. 1 to 42. 9 ppb. The <b>passive</b> <b>monitors</b> were effective in measuring H 2 S concentrations near a swine CAFO as long as they were exposed for a sufficient period of time (two weeks). Radiello <b>passive</b> <b>monitors</b> are a promising new device in measuring intermediate H 2 S exposure in rural populations. Measured values in excess of an Iowa state limit of 30 ppb (24 h average) suggest that enforcement actions are needed to mitigate H 2 S migration from swine CAFOs.
