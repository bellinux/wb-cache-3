5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard <b>popping</b> <b>noises</b> resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E
5|$|People with OCD report activity-related {{pain that}} {{develops}} gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, <b>popping</b> <b>noises,</b> and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom {{may be a}} restriction {{in the range of}} movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stageI; however, the onset of stageII occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stageII, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.|$|E

50|$|One gruesome {{aspect of}} being {{stretched}} too far {{on the rack}} is the loud <b>popping</b> <b>noises</b> made by snapping cartilage, ligaments or bones. One powerful method for putting pressure upon prisoners was {{to force them to}} watch someone else being subjected to the rack. Confining the prisoner on the rack enabled further tortures to be simultaneously applied, typically including burning the flanks with hot torches or candles or using pincers made with specially roughened grips to tear out the nails of the fingers and toes. Usually, the victim's shoulders and hips would be separated and their elbows, knees, wrists, and ankles would be dislocated.|$|E
50|$|A 3-way socket {{has three}} {{electrical}} contacts. In {{addition to the}} two contacts of the standard socket, a third contact is added. This contact is positioned off-center {{in the bottom of}} the socket (contact two in photo). This extra contact matches a ring-shaped contact on the bottom of a 3-way bulb, which creates the connection for the second filament inside the bulb. A problem of these devices is that the ring contact of the socket (contact two in photo) digs into the lead seal on the lamp bulb's contact ring and this connection tends to fail early (sometimes in months), leading to intermittent flashes, <b>popping</b> <b>noises,</b> and loss of power to the low wattage filament as the lead seal on the bulb's ring alternately melts and solidifies.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{requirement}} for fast robust T/R switches, the main factor affecting good QSK operation is the ability for the radio receiver to recover its sensitivity quickly whilst operating quietly (without <b>popping</b> <b>noises)</b> {{during and after the}} fast transient signals created by the fast T/R switch operation. Many receivers have automatic gain control (AGC) circuits with time constants that take many milliseconds to recover their sensitivity and volume level after a strong transient signal is presented to their antenna input port. Without modifications or AGC circuit re-design such receivers are not suitable for QSK operation. In cases of slow responding AGC circuitry operators may accept the thumping noise and loss of AGC functionality and choose to turn their receiver AGC function off, instead operating their receivers using only manual gain control during QSK operation.|$|E

50|$|Salamanders {{are usually}} {{considered}} to have no voice and do not use sound for communication {{in the way that}} frogs do; however, some species can make quiet ticking or <b>popping</b> <b>noises,</b> perhaps by the opening and closing of valves in the nose. The California giant salamander can produce a bark or rattle, and a few species can squeak by contracting muscles in the throat. The arboreal salamander can squeak using a different mechanism; it retracts its eyes into its head, forcing air out of its mouth. The ensatina salamander occasionally makes a hissing sound, while the sirens sometimes produce quiet clicks, and can resort to faint shrieks if attacked. Vocalization in salamanders has been little studied and the purpose of these sounds is presumed to be the startling of predators.|$|E
5000|$|Cheshm-Zakhm (lit. [...] "a blow by the eye"), {{the evil}} eye (Chashm also occurs alone with the same meaning; cf.

50|$|High {{fidelity}} {{made great}} advances during the 1970s, as turntables became very precise instruments with belt or direct drive, jewel-balanced tonearms, some with electronically controlled linear tracking and magnetic cartridges. Some cartridges had frequency response above 30 kHz {{for use with}} CD-4 quadraphonic 4 channel sound. A high fidelity component system which cost under $1,000 could {{do a very good}} job of reproducing very accurate frequency response across the human audible spectrum from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz with a $200 turntable which would typically have less than 0.05% wow and flutter and very low rumble (low frequency noise). A well-maintained record would have very little surface noise, though it was difficult to keep records completely free from scratches, which produced <b>popping</b> <b>noises.</b> Another characteristic failure mode was groove lock, causing a section of music to repeat, separated by a popping noise. This was so common that a saying was coined: you sound like a broken record, referring to someone who is being annoyingly repetitious.|$|E

50|$|Abdulmutallab {{spent about}} 20 {{minutes in the}} toilet as the flight {{approached}} Detroit, and then covered himself with a blanket after returning to his seat. Other passengers then heard <b>popping</b> <b>noises,</b> smelled a foul odour, and some saw Abdulmutallab's trouser leg and {{the wall of the}} plane on fire. Fellow passenger Jasper Schuringa, a Dutch film director, jumped on Abdulmutallab and subdued him as flight attendants used fire extinguishers to douse the flames. Abdulmutallab was taken {{toward the front of the}} aircraft cabin, was seen to have lost his trousers due to the fire, and had burns on his legs. When asked by a flight attendant what he had in his pocket, he replied: “Explosive device.” The device consisted of a six-inch (15-cm) packet which was sewn into his underwear containing the explosive powder PETN, which became a plastic explosive when mixed with the high explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP) (the same two explosives that were used by Richard Reid in 2001), and a syringe containing liquid acid. Abdulmutallab created the explosive by mixing PETN with TATP and other ingredients.|$|E
5000|$|Burton cites a work called Syntagma de Diis ("A Compendium of the Gods") by Lilius Giraldus as his {{source for}} the {{existence}} of such a god; by this reference, Burton probably meant Giraldus' Historia de diis gentium ("History of the Pagan Gods"); but because Burton wrote in what he called an [...] "extemporean" [...] style, quicquid in buccam venit ("whatever came into his head"), Burton's quotations and references are not always reliable. [...] Because of Burton's mixed Latin and English style, this passage may not say that there was a god named [...] "Crepitus Ventris", (Latin for [...] "intestinal noise"), but only that there was a god of intestinal noise. The Latin word crepitus, moreover, did not exclusively mean the sound generated by intestinal gas; it referred to squeaks, groans, knocks, and any nondescript noise in general. In The City of God, Augustine elsewhere refers to crepitus cymbalorum, the clang of cymbals. [...] Medical jargon gives the name crepitus to the creaking or <b>popping</b> <b>noises</b> made by the joints. The Latin word for [...] "to fart" [...] is pēdere.|$|E
50|$|The {{tensile testing}} of the {{polypropylene}} and sisal twines {{was done with the}} aid of an Instron tensile testing machine using capstan grips in the Material Science Lab at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. At the point of each type of twine’s ultimate tensile strength, it is apparent that polypropylene is a stronger material. With approximately an ultimate tensile strength of 270 MPa, it has more than 100% more tensile strength than that of sisal twine which has an ultimate tensile strength of 100 MPa. The two twines broke differently, however, as it {{can be seen in the}} two videos. Polypropylene twine had a straight break, where all of its fibers broke at once; this resulted in the straight line dropping to zero on the graph. The sisal twine broke in a different fashion. As the force load increased on the twine sample, individual fibers that were carrying the load broke and new ones became engaged. Thus was created the <b>popping</b> <b>noises</b> in the video; these properties directly correlate to the strength properties. Because all the fibers are engaged at once in polypropylene, it gives the twine high strength; the downside is that all the fibers break at once. Because only certain fibers in sisal twine carry the force of the load at one time, it doesn’t have as high of a strength as polypropylene twine. It does, however, allow the twine to stay intact much longer as each new fiber becomes engaged.|$|E
