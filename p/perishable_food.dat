5|$|Grey jays are {{classified}} as least concern (LC) according to the IUCN Red List, having stable populations over a very large area of boreal and subalpine habitats only lightly occupied by humans. Significant human impacts may nevertheless occur through anthropogenic climate warming. Grey jays at the northern edges of their range may benefit from the extension of spruce stands out onto formerly treeless tundra. A study of a declining population {{at the southern end}} of the grey jay's range linked the decline in reproductive success to warmer temperatures in preceding autumns. Such warm temperatures may trigger spoilage of the <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> items stored by grey jays upon which success of late winter nesting partly depends.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E

25|$|The cost of food {{irradiation}} {{is influenced by}} dose requirements, the food's tolerance of radiation, handling conditions, i.e., packaging and stacking requirements, construction costs, financing arrangements, and other variables particular to the situation. Irradiation is a capital-intensive technology requiring a substantial initial investment, ranging from $1million to $5million. In the case of large research or contract irradiation facilities, major capital costs include a radiation source, hardware (irradiator, totes and conveyors, control systems, and other auxiliary equipment), land (1 to 1.5acres), radiation shield, and warehouse. Operating costs include salaries (for fixed and variable labor), utilities, maintenance, taxes/insurance, cobalt-60 replenishment, general utilities, and miscellaneous operating costs. <b>Perishable</b> <b>food</b> items, like fruits, vegetables and meats would still require to be handled in the cold chain, so all other supply chain costs remain the same.|$|E

25|$|Service on Flowers in the North Atlantic was {{typically}} cold, wet, monotonous and uncomfortable. Every dip of the forecastle into an oncoming wave {{was followed by}} a cascade of water into the well deck amidships. Men at action stations were drenched with spray, and water entered living spaces through hatches opened to access ammunition magazines. Interior decks were constantly wet and condensation dripped from the overheads. The head (or sanitary toilet) was drained by a straight pipe to the ocean; and a reverse flow of the icy North Atlantic would cleanse the backside of those using it during rough weather. By 1941 corvettes carried twice as many crewmen as anticipated in the original design. Men slept on lockers or tabletops or in any dark place that offered a little warmth.

2500|$|The {{refrigerated}} {{rail car}} (refrigerated van or refrigerator car), {{along with the}} dense railroad network, became an exceedingly important link between the marketplace and the farm allowing for a national opportunity rather than a just a regional one. Before {{the invention of the}} refrigerated rail car it was impossible to ship <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> products long distances. The beef packing industry made the first demand push for refrigeration cars. The railroad companies were slow to adopt this new invention because of their heavy investments in cattle cars, stockyards, and feedlots. [...] Refrigeration cars were also complex and costly compared to other rail cars, which also slowed the adoption of the refrigerated rail car. [...] After the slow adoption of the refrigerated car, the beef packing industry dominated the refrigerated rail car business with their ability to control ice plants and the setting of icing fees. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated that in 1916 over sixty-nine percent of the cattle killed in the country was done in plants involved in interstate trade. [...] The same companies that were also involved in the meat trade later implemented refrigerated transport to include vegetables and fruit. [...] The meat packing companies had much of the expensive machinery, such as refrigerated cars, and cold storage facilities that allowed for them to effectively distribute all types of perishable goods. [...] During World War I, a national refrigerator car pool was established by the United States Administration to deal with problem of idle cars and was later continued after the war. [...] The idle car problem was the problem of refrigeration cars sitting pointlessly in between seasonal harvests. [...] This meant that very expensive cars sat in rail yards for {{a good portion of the}} year while making no revenue for the car’s owner. [...] The car pool was a system where cars were distributed to areas as crops matured ensuring maximum use of the cars. Refrigerated rail cars moved eastward from vineyards, orchards, fields, and gardens in western states to satisfy Americas consuming market in the east. [...] The refrigerated car made it possible to transport perishable crops hundreds and even thousands of miles. The most noticeable effect the car gave was a regional specialization of vegetables and fruits. The refrigeration rail car was widely used for the transportation of perishable goods up until the 1950s. [...] By the 1960s the nation's interstate highway system was adequately complete allowing for trucks to carry the majority of the <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> loads and to push out the old system of the refrigerated rail cars.|$|E
