50|$|The {{describing}} authors placed Datanglong in the Carcharodontosauria, in a basal position, {{making use}} of a previous cladistic analysis of Matthew Carrano. Soon after the publication, the Italian paleontologist Andrea Cau pointed out that this analysis had been strongly focused on the basal Tetanurae and therefore contained few traits of the Coelurosauria. That carried the danger that basal coelurosaurians were misplaced. Cau entered the traits of Datanglong into his own, more comprehensive, analysis and this indeed revealed that Datanglong was a basal coelurosaur. If this is correct, {{it would be the}} first known basal coelurosaur of a truly large size. He also directed attention to the fact that all synapomorphies that Datanglong shared with the Carcharodontosauria (the pneumatized cavities in the ilium and the <b>pin-and-socket</b> connection between the ilium and the ischium) were also shared with the Megaraptora.|$|E
40|$|Today, the use {{of surface}} mount {{connectors}} to increase the component density of printed circuit boards is growing as a total percentage of connectors processed in various printed circuit boards. Resources have been channeled to develop various requirements pertaining to the design and processing of surface mount connectors. This paper summarizes {{some of the key}} developments in relation to the evolution of the pager design. Pagers have become small, cheap and reliable. With the drive towards smaller and slimmer pagers with increased functions, a two-printed-circuit-board-construction is needed for design flexibility due to the great variations in language and feature sets. What you can hold in your hand, you can drop. Therefore the pager (and the connector inside) must be mechanically rugged enough to take the various impacts in the course of its useful life and continue to function as designed. 2 To minimize the void area in the pager, the board-to-board connector stacked height is driven down to the height of the tallest components. Besides switching from through-hole to surface mount technology, connector density has been moved from 1. 27 mm to 1. 0 mm, and gradually to 0. 8 mm and 0. 5 mm pitch {{in order to meet the}} demands for miniaturization. Added to that, connectors also switched from <b>pin-and-socket</b> to blade-on-beam design technology to meet the demand for a robust system that can withstand physical shocks suffered by smaller, denser and more complex pagers. In conclusion, connectors will continue to evolve and remain one of the key elements in the evolution of packaging and interconnect solutions for pagers...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} tool {{would be}} used to inspect alignments of mating twinaxial-connector assemblies on interconnecting wiring harnesses. More specifically, the tool {{would be used}} to inspect the alignment of each contact pin of each connector on one assembly with the corresponding socket in the corresponding connector on the other assembly. It is necessary to inspect the alignment because if mating of the assemblies is attempted when any pin/socket pair is misaligned beyond tolerance, the connection will not be completed and the dielectric material in the socket will be damaged (see Figure 1). Although the basic principle of the tool is applicable to almost any type of mating connector assemblies, the specific geometry of the tool must match the <b>pin-and-socket</b> geometry of the specific mating assemblies to be inspected. In the original application for which the tool was conceived, each of the mating assemblies contains eight twinaxial connectors; the pin diameter is 0. 014 in. (. 0. 35 mm), and the maximum allowable pin/socket misalignment is 0. 007 in. (. 0. 18 mm). Incomplete connections can result in loss of flight data within the functional path to the space shuttle crew cockpit displays. The tool (see Figure 2) would consist mainly of a transparent disk with alignment clocking tabs that can be fitted onto either connector assembly. Sets of circles or equivalent reference markings are affixed to the face of the tool, located at the desired positions of the mating contact pairs. An inspector would simply fit the tool onto a connector assembly, engaging the clocking tabs until the tool fits tightly. The inspector would then align one set of circles positioning a line of sight perpendicular to one contact within the connector assembly. Mis alignments would be evidenced by the tip of a pin contact straying past the inner edge of the circle. Socket contact misalignments would be evidenced by a crescent-shaped portion of the white dielectric appearing within the circle. The tool could include a variable magnifier plus an illuminator that could be configured so as not to cast shadows...|$|E
