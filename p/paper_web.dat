25|$|Vegetable (paper) {{parchment}} is made {{by passing}} a waterleaf (an unsized paper like blotters) made of pulp fibers into sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural organic polymer, cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The <b>paper</b> <b>web</b> is then washed in water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable parchment paper its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.|$|E
5000|$|In the dry {{end of the}} {{papermaking}} process, the <b>paper</b> <b>web</b> is rewetted with a starch based solution. The {{process is}} called surface sizing. Starches used have been chemically, or enzymatically depolymerized at the paper mill or by the starch industry (oxidized starch). The size/starch solutions are applied to the <b>paper</b> <b>web</b> by means of various mechanical presses (size presses). Together with surface sizing agents the surface starches impart additional strength to the <b>paper</b> <b>web</b> and additionally provide water hold out or [...] "size" [...] for superior printing properties. Starch is also used in paper coatings {{as one of the}} binders for the coating formulations which include a mixture of pigments, binders and thickeners. Coated paper has improved smoothness, hardness, whiteness and gloss and thus improves printing characteristics.|$|E

50|$|The {{second section}} of the paper machine is the press section, which removes much of the {{remaining}} water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press felts that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water.

50|$|Glassine is {{a smooth}} and glossy paper that is air, water and grease resistant. It is usually {{available}} in densities between 50-90 g/m2.

50|$|Sensors {{measuring}} the paper quality (online meters) {{are attached to}} a sensor platform that move across the web guided by the scanner beam.

It can also be directed and stopped to a specific, fixed point on the web to measure the machine-direction (MD) variation at a single point.|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{papermaking}} {{machines are}} based on the principles of the Fourdrinier Machine, which uses a specially woven plastic fabric mesh conveyor belt (known as a wire as it was once woven from bronze) in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a continuous <b>paper</b> <b>web.</b> After the forming section the wet web passes through a press section to squeeze out excess water, then the pressed web passes through a heated drying section.|$|E

50|$|Another type {{forming section}} is the {{cylinder}} mould machine using a mesh-covered rotating cylinder partially {{immersed in a}} tank of fibre slurry in the wet end to form a <b>paper</b> <b>web,</b> giving a more random distribution of the cellulose fibres. Cylinder machines can form a sheet at higher consistency, which gives a more three dimensional fibre orientation than lower consistencies, resulting in higher calliper (thickness) and more stiffness in the machine direction (MD).

40|$|To {{be able to}} {{simulate}} the different processes involved in paper machines, models, numerical methods and algorithms have to be developed which capture {{as much as possible}} of the real physical phenomena. In this paper a model for calculation of the chemical and physical interaction between objects included in a fiber suspension is presented.

The contact model has been used in an existing framework {{to simulate}} the build-up of low density <b>paper</b> <b>webs.</b> In the framework fibers are modeled as elliptical cylinders whose movements are described by finite-strain beam theory which includes shearing. The fluid flow is computed using a Navier-Stokes solver and immersed boundary methods are utilized to resolve the flow around each fiber.
