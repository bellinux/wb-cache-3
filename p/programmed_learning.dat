2500|$|Johnson {{began his}} work on social {{interdependence}} theory and the appropriate use of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic efforts in the mid-1960s. At that time, elementary, secondary, and university teaching was dominated by competitive and individualistic learning.

F. Skinner’s work on <b>programmed</b> <b>learning</b> and behavioral modification. In the 60's and 70's, while cooperative learning was generally ignored by educators, Johnson challenged the prevailing competitive and individualistic practices by presenting the theory and research on cooperative, competitive, and individualistic learning, creating operational procedures for cooperative learning and appropriate competition, and implementing cooperative learning in schools and universities.|$|E

40|$|AbstractComputer <b>programming</b> <b>learning</b> {{requires}} declarative {{and procedural}} knowledge. Novice learners acquire programming declarative knowledge via lectures, tutorials, and self-assessment. Cognitive overload within <b>programming</b> <b>learning</b> materials {{is one of}} several learning barriers. Self-assessing is important to assist learners to identify misconceptions and to encourage the correct construction of knowledge. Self-Test Questions (STQ) and solutions in print are common learning methods used in a typical <b>programming</b> <b>learning</b> environment. Comparatively, Self-Assessment Object (SAO) is a type of learning object used to examine usefulness in order to impart declarative knowledge. One hundred and three foundation engineering students, enrolled in a C programming module, took part in this study and were randomly assigned to two groups. A control group used STQ and an experimental group used SAO in a programming lab over seven teaching weeks. Post-test and supporting survey results suggest that SAO was able to support <b>programming</b> <b>learning</b> and mitigate the learning difficulties addressed in this study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In typical {{practical}} applications of automated <b>program</b> <b>learning,</b> {{the scope of}} potential inputs to the <b>programs</b> being <b>learned</b> are narrowed down during a preliminary “feature selection “ step. However, this approach will not work if one wishes to apply <b>program</b> <b>learning</b> as {{a key component of}} an AGI system, because there is no generally applicable feature selection heuristic, and in an AGI context one cannot assume a human cleverly tuning the feature selection heuristics to the problem at hand. A novel technique, LIFES (Learning-Integrated Feature Selection), is introduced here, to address this problem. In LIFES, one integrates feature selection into the learning process, rather than doing feature selection solely as a preliminary stage to learning. LIFES is applicable relatively broadly, and is especially appropriate for any learning problem possessing properties identified here as “data focusable“ and “feature focusable. It is also applicable {{with a wide variety of}} learning algorithms, but for concreteness is presented here in the context of the MOSES automated <b>program</b> <b>learning</b> algorithm. To illustrate the general effectiveness of LIFES, example results are given from applying MOSES+LIFES to gene expression classification. Application of LIFES to virtual and robotic agent control is also discussed. ...|$|R
