40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} of groundnut tolerance to pre and <b>post</b> <b>flowering</b> drought stress is important for improving its yield and phenological development in the drylands. The mechanisms of drought tolerance {{are known to be}} under variable genetic control. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the mechanism of drought tolerance of various groundnut genotypes to pre and <b>post</b> <b>flowering</b> drought stress. Screen house trials were undertaken between March and June 2014. Three moisture management treatments were imposed on 10 groundnut cultivars. Three cultivars (Ex-Oakar, Samnut 23 and Samnut 24) are known to have some drought tolerance characteristics; two cultivars (Samnut 21 and Samnut 22) do not tolerate drought, while the drought response ofthe remaining five cultivars (Samnut 25, Samnut 26, Sabiya, Kwankwaso and Yar Oigir) is not known. The water managements were: Field Capacity throughout the period of experimentation (FCT), Imposition of PreFlowering Moisture Stress (PrFS) and Imposition of <b>Post</b> <b>Flowering</b> Stress (PoFS). Stomatal conductance and relative water content (RWC) were recorded at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 days after emergence. Total dry matter samples (shoots and pods) were collected at 15 and 25 days after emergence, R 5 and R 7. From these samples, shoot and pod growth rates were calculated. Two ofthe drought tolerant cultivars were found to tolerate only pre-flowering drought and only Ex-Oakar tolerate both pre and <b>post</b> <b>flowering</b> drought stress. Among the two susceptible cultivars, Samnut 22 was found to tolerate post-flowering stress, but was susceptible to pre flowering stress. Samnut 26 and Kwankwaso tolerated both pre and <b>post</b> <b>flowering</b> stress, while Sabiya and Yar Oigir were susceptible to both stresses. Most of the cultivars adopted the mechanism of conserving water by reducing transpiration to maintain high RWC. Only Samnut 24 showed the mechanism of improving assimilate partitioning to the pods at grain filling phase. The knowledge gathered could be used for breeding groundnut that will be suited to the drylands in order to escape periods of intermittent drought...|$|E

Image and statistical analysis revealed four sets of genes with distinctive and similar expression profiles over the course of berry development. The first set was composed of genes which had maximum RNA expression in flowers followed by a steady decrease in expression. The most prominent group within this set were genes which have a role in photosynthesis. The second set of cDNAs were dominated by genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and had a peak of expression week two <b>post</b> <b>flowering.</b> The data clearly illustrates co-ordinate regulation of flavonoid biosynthetic genes which code for the enzymes 4 -coumarate-CoA ligase, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, flavonone hydroxylase, anthocyanidin reductase and cytochrome b 5. The third set of cDNAs were those that exhibited maximum expression week 5 <b>post</b> <b>flowering,</b> midway between flowering and veráison, a period of rapid berry growth. This set of cDNAs is dominated by genes which code for structural cell wall proteins. The fourth set of genes were dramatically upregulated at veráison and remain upregulated until 13 weeks <b>post</b> <b>flowering</b> and is composed of a diverse range of genes, a reflection of complexity, most with no known function indicating ripening requires the activity of genes unique to this process...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the analgesic and the anti-inflammatory activity of Opuntia microdasys at <b>post</b> <b>flowering</b> stage, F 3 (OMF 3) in rat and, in other hand, its antigenotoxic effects by the Allium cepa test. Methods: OMF 3 extracts were screened for activity of analgesic and anti-inflammatory using, respectively, the acetic acid writhing test in mice and the carrageenan-induced paw oedema assay in rats. The antigenotoxic has been evaluated by A. cepa test. Key findings: OMF 3 extracts showed a higher analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity at 100 mg/kg (72. 03 % and 70. 11 %) as determined by the tests of acetic acid-induced writhing and carrageenan-induced oedema, respectively. Furthermore, the OMF 3 aqueous extracts have a preventive antimutagenic potential, at lower concentration (EC 50 ≈ 60 μg/ml), against H 2 O 2 -mediated DNA damage in A. cepa root meristem cells with an efficient restoration of the mitotic index in comparison with controls.

40|$|<b>Post</b> <b>flowering</b> stalk rot (PFSR) {{is one of}} {{the major}} biotic {{constraints}} to maize production in tropical and sub-tropical environments. It is a complex disease caused by multiple pathogens, among which Fusarium moniliforme and Macrophomina phaseolina are the major ones that cause severe yield losses in the Asian tropics. A set of maize inbred lines was evaluated at two locations for Fusarium stalk rot (FSR) and Macrophomina stalk rot (MSR). Based on line evaluation trials, resistant and susceptible lines were selected and crossed following a Diallel mating design IV to study the gene action for resistance to these stalk rots and the estimating the combining ability of inbred lines. A 9 × 9 diallel (Diallel-A) produced 36 hybrids for studying FSR resistance, and a 12 × 12 diallel (Diallel-B) produced 66 hybrids to analyse the resistance towards both FSR and MSR. These hybrids were evaluated at two locations for MSR and one location for FSR with artificial inoculation. The hybrids differed significantly for FSR (p < 0. 05), as was the general combining ability (GCA) effects (p < 0. 01), while Specific combining ability (SCA) effects were found to be non-significant. The analysis of the trials under MSR, showed significant difference for GCA, SCA, GCA × environment (p < 0. 01), and hybrid × environment (p < 0. 05) while SCA × environment was non-significant. The Baker ratio, which shows the relative importance of GCA over SCA, was close to unity for both the stalk rots, and hence a predominant additive gene effect was inferred towards resistance to these diseases. Though the GCA × environment interaction was significant for MSR, this study identified lines and their cross combinations with high resistance and large GCA and SCA effects across environments for FSR and MSR This offers scope for source population improvement for resistance to these stalk rots, as well as developing maize hybrids with stable resistance to <b>Post</b> <b>flowering</b> stalk rot...|$|E
