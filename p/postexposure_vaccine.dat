40|$|AbstractA {{majority}} of the 50, 000 annual human rabies deaths worldwide occur in canine endemic regions with a large stray dog population. Control of the disease is hampered by cultural and economic realities. The high cost of imported modern tissue culture vaccines {{is the main reason}} why dangerous neural tissue derived products are still being used throughout the developing world. Several studies have shown that reduced-dose intradermal <b>postexposure</b> <b>vaccine</b> regimens are safe, effective, and economical. Their use has been approved by the Rabies Committee of the World Health Organization. Recent well-studied rabies vaccine treatment failures have demonstrated that rabies immune globulins are essential biological products that save lives. There is now a critical worldwide shortage of human and purified equine rabies immune globulins. Oral vaccination of stray dogs in developing countries appears promising but has not yet been studied on a large scale. Recent studies have provided better understanding of pitfalls in postexposure management and the handling of special problems that are not uncommon in countries where canine rabies is endemic. This essay endeavors to present the current rabies problem {{from the vantage point of}} an infectious diseases consultant practicing in a rabies endemic region of Asia...|$|E
40|$|The 2003 monkeypox virus (MPXV) {{outbreak}} {{and subsequent}} laboratory studies {{demonstrated that the}} black-tailed prairie dog is susceptible to MPXV infection and that the ensuing rash illness is similar to human systemic orthopoxvirus (OPXV) infection, including a 7 - to 9 -day incubation period and, likely, in some cases a respiratory route of infection; these features distinguish this model from others. The need for safe and efficacious vaccines for OPVX in areas where it is endemic or epidemic is important to protect an increasingly OPXV-naïve population. In this study, we tested current and investigational smallpox vaccines for safety, induction of anti-OPXV antibodies, and protection against mortality and morbidity in two MPXV challenges. None of the smallpox vaccines caused illness in this model, and all vaccinated animals showed anti-OPXV antibody responses and neutralizing antibody. We tested vaccine efficacy by challenging the animals with 105 or 106 PFU Congo Basin MPXV 30 days postvaccination and evaluating morbidity and mortality. Our results demonstrated that vaccination with either Dryvax or Acambis 2000 protected the animals from death with no rash illness. Vaccination with IMVAMUNE also protected the animals from death, albeit with (modified) rash illness. Based {{on the results of}} this study, we believe prairie dogs offer a novel and potentially useful small animal model for the safety and efficacy testing of smallpox vaccines in pre- and <b>postexposure</b> <b>vaccine</b> testing, which is important for public health planning...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{effective}} tuberculosis (TB) vaccines {{is a high}} priority. We use mathematical {{models to}} predict the potential public health impact of new TB vaccines in highincidence countries. We show that preexposure vaccines would be almost twice as effective as <b>postexposure</b> <b>vaccines</b> in {{reducing the number of}} new infections. <b>Postexposure</b> <b>vaccines</b> would initially have a substantially greater impact, compared to preexposure vaccines, on reducing the number of new cases of disease. However, the effectiveness of <b>postexposure</b> <b>vaccines</b> would diminish over time, whereas the effectiveness of preexposure vaccines would increase. Thus, after 20 to 30 years, post- or preexposure vaccination campaigns would be almost equally effective in terms of cumulative TB cases prevented.

40|$|The {{control of}} chronic {{bacterial}} diseases with high prevalence {{in areas of}} endemicity would strongly benefit from availability of <b>postexposure</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The development of these vaccines against mycobacterial infections, such as (para) tuberculosis, is hampered by lack of experience in natural hosts. Paratuberculosis in cattle is both a mycobacterial disease of worldwide importance and a natural host model for mycobacterial infections in general. The present study showed beneficial effects of therapeutic heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) vaccination in cattle with naturally acquired chronic infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Vaccination-induced protection was associated with antibody responses, rather than with induction of specific T helper 1 cells. Targeted therapeutic postexposure vaccination complementary to selective use of antibiotics could be an effective approach for control of chronic mycobacterial infections. W.

40|$|The hamster {{kidney cell}} rabies vaccine was {{investigated}} {{as a substitute}} for classical ner-vous tissue rabies vaccine. The Beijing strain of fixed rabies virus was adapted to primary hamster kidney cells (PHKCs), and four types of rabies vaccine (plain, adju-vant, concentrated, and concentrated adjuvant vaccines) were developed for human use. The potencies of the vaccines met the requirements of the World Health Organiza-tion, and these vaccines elicited rather satisfactory antibody responses in volunteers. The <b>postexposure</b> use of <b>vaccine</b> was evaluated in 301 individuals, 97 of whom had been bitten by proven rabid animals. None of the individuals contracted rabies during the observation period. After several years of field trials with both pre- and <b>postexposure</b> <b>vaccines,</b> the evidence indicates that the PHKC rabies vaccines are effective and safe for human use. Rabies is a terrifying illness ending invariably in death. Fortunately, a prophylactic nervous tissue vaccine was introduced by Louis Pasteur. Many other nervous tissue vaccines have been developed, including Semple vaccine, which is still widely used all over the world today. However, after they are injected, some nervous tissue vaccines induce severe allergic encephalomyelitis with an incidence of 1 : 100 - 1 : 10, 000 [1 - 3]. Although duck embryo vaccine and suckling mouse brain vaccine have been used with some success, these vaccines {{do not appear to be}} entirely devoid of risk [4, 5]. Preparation of purified high-titered virus suspensions from cell cultures has in-tensified the search for a more potent and safer rabies vaccine.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In this study, we {{have used}} a chemometrics-based method to {{correlate}} key liposomal adjuvant attributes with in-vivo immune responses based on multivariate analysis. METHODS: The liposomal adjuvant composed of the cationic lipid dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) and trehalose 6, 6 -dibehenate (TDB) was modified with 1, 2 -distearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine at a range of mol% ratios, and the main liposomal characteristics (liposome size and zeta potential) was measured along with their immunological performance as an adjuvant for the novel, <b>postexposure</b> fusion tuberculosis <b>vaccine,</b> Ag 85 B-ESAT- 6 -Rv 2660 c (H 56 vaccine). Partial least square regression analysis was applied to correlate and cluster liposomal adjuvants particle characteristics with in-vivo derived immunological performances (IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2 b, spleen proliferation, IL- 2, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 10, IFN-γ). KEY FINDINGS: While a range of factors varied in the formulations, decreasing the 1, 2 -distearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine content (and subsequent zeta potential) together built the strongest variables in the model. Enhanced DDA and TDB content (and subsequent zeta potential) stimulated a response skewed towards a cell mediated immunity, with the model identifying correlations with IFN-γ, IL- 2 and IL- 6. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the application of chemometrics-based correlations and clustering, which can inform liposomal adjuvant design...|$|R
40|$|Objective/background: There is {{an urgent}} need for a more {{effective}} vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Although CD 4 + T cells {{play a central role}} in host immunity to Mtb, recent evidence suggests a critical role of CD 8 + T cells in combating Mtb. In the present study, we have predicted HLA antigen class I binding peptides of DosR operon using an in-silico approach. This method is useful as an initial computational filtration of probable epitopes based on their binding ability and antigenicity. Methods: CD 8 + epitopes were predicted by software NetMHC 3. 4 and BIMAS. Self-peptides were found and excluded by indigenously developed Perl script. Antigenicity of promiscuous peptides was predicted using a VaxiJen server. The top VaxiJen scoring antigenic peptides were docked to globally relevant HLA allele using CABS dock and Hex program. Results: A total of 1436 overlapping nonamer peptides were generated which gave 46 promiscuous epitopes, 25 were predicted to be antigenic. Rv 2627 epitope “SAFRPPLV” which gave the highest Vaxijen score of 1. 9157 and showed binding to all the three HLA loci. The top VaxiJen scoring antigenic peptides were docked and had significant interactions with residues of the HLA class I molecule indicating them to be good cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes. Conclusion: Our study has generated several promiscuous antigenic peptides capable of binding to major histocompatibility complex class I with high affinity.

40|$|Passively {{transferred}} neutralizing antibodies {{can block}} lentivirus infection, but {{their role in}} postexposure prophylaxis is poorly understood. In this nonhuman-primate study, the effects of short-term antibody therapy on 5 -year disease progression, virus load, and host immunity were explored. We reported previously that postinfection passive treatment with polyclonal immune globulin with high neutralizing titers against SIVsmE 660 (SIVIG) significantly improved the 67 -week health of SIVsmE 660 -infected Macaca mulatta macaques. Four of six treated macaques maintained low or undetectable levels of virus in plasma, compared with one of ten controls, while two rapid progressors controlled viremia {{only as long as}} the SIVIG was present. SIVIG treatment delayed the de novo production of envelope (Env) -specific antibodies by 8 weeks (13). We show here that differences in disease progression were also significant at 5 years postinfection, excluding rapid progressors (P = 0. 05). Macaques that maintained ≤ 103 virus particles per ml of plasma and ≤ 30 infectious virus particles per 106 mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and lymph nodes had delayed disease onset. All macaques that survived beyond 18 months had measurable Gag-specific CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells, regardless of treatment. Humoral immunity in survivors beyond 20 weeks was strikingly different in the SIVIG and control groups. Despite a delay in Env-specific binding antibodies, de novo production of neutralizing antibodies was significantly accelerated in SIVIG-treated macaques. Titers of de novo neutralizing antibodies at week 12 were comparable to levels achieved in controls only by week 32 or later. Acceleration of de novo simian immunodeficiency virus immunity in the presence of passively transferred neutralizing antibodies is a novel finding with implications for <b>postexposure</b> prophylaxis and <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Taiwan {{had been}} free of {{indigenous}} {{human and animal}} rabies case since canine rabies was eliminated in 1961. In July 2013, rabies was confirmed among three wild ferret-badgers, prompting public health response to prevent human rabies cases. This descriptive study reports the immediate response to the reemergence of rabies in Taiwan. Response included enhanced surveillance for human rabies cases by testing stored cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with encephalitides of unknown cause by RT-PCR, prioritizing <b>vaccine</b> use for <b>postexposure</b> prophylaxis (PEP) during periods of vaccine shortage and subsequent expansion of PEP, surveillance of animal bites using information obtained from vaccine application, roll out of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with vaccine stock restoration, surveillance for adverse events following immunization (AEFI), and ensuring surge capacity to respond to general public inquiries by phone and training for healthcare professionals. Enhanced surveillance for human rabies found no cases after testing 205 stored CSF specimens collected during January 2010 -July 2013. During July 16 to December 28, 2013, we received 8, 241 rabies PEP application; 6, 634 (80. 5 %) were consistent with recommendations. Among the 6, 501 persons who received at least one dose of rabies <b>vaccine</b> <b>postexposure,</b> 4, 953 (76. 2 %) persons who were bitten by dogs; only 59 (0. 9 %) persons were bitten by ferret-badgers.
