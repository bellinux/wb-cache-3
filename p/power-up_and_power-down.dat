Remote administration includes remote <b>power-up</b> <b>and</b> <b>power-down,</b> remote reset, redirected boot, console redirection, pre-boot access to BIOS settings, programmable filtering for inbound and outbound network traffic, agent presence checking, out-of-band policy-based alerting, access to system information, such as hardware asset information, persistent event logs, and other information that is stored in dedicated memory (not on the hard drive) where it is accessible even if the OS is down or the PC is powered off. Some of these functions require the deepest level of rootkit, a second non-removable spy computer built around the main computer. Sandy Bridge and future chipsets have [...] "the ability to remotely kill and restore a lost or stolen PC via 3G". Hardware rootkits built into the chipset can help recover stolen computers, remove data, or render them useless, but they also present privacy and security concerns of undetectable spying and redirection by management or hackers who might gain control.|$|E

50|$|A {{simple way}} of looking at it is a slogan adopted by self-advocates 'nothing about us, without us' , {{encouraging}} educators to co-teach with people who have lived experience of mental illness or distress.A key concept in this ontolology is the idea of saneism - a sixth structural oppression to go alongside those associated with race, gender, disability, age and class. It is also defined as Mentalism (discrimination) :“From where we stand , saneism is a devestating sic? form of oppression , often leading to negative stereotyping, discrimination, or arguments that Mad individuals are not fit for professional practice or , indeed, for life (Poole et al., 2012). According to Kalinowski and Risser (2005), saneeism also allows for a binary that separates people into a <b>power-up</b> group <b>and</b> a <b>power-down</b> group. The power-up group is assumed to be normal , healthy <b>and</b> capable. The <b>power-down</b> group is assumed to be sick,disabled,unreliable, and , possibly violent. This factional splitting ensures a lower standard of service for the <b>power-down</b> group <b>and</b> allows the <b>power-up</b> group to judge, reframe <b>and</b> belittle the <b>power-down</b> group in pathological terms”.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{motivated}} by the power demands of the modern Intel microprocessors. These microprocessors require a very stable and tightly controlled core supply voltage in order to reliably operate at their correct clock frequency. The core supply voltage has to remain within the prescribed window during normal operation, as well as during <b>power-up</b> <b>and</b> <b>power-down</b> when the processor current can change from almost zero to 16 A or more in 200 - 300 ns. Maintaining tight processor voltage regulation during these current transients can be difficult. In addition to stringent load transient specifications, a microprocessor power supply has to meet efficiency requirements, as well as size and cost requirements. Size requirements become especially important in portable computer systems where space is at a premium. The work presented in this thesis deals with the optimization of the microprocessor power supply for performance, size and cost, {{with the emphasis on}} size. Every aspect of the power supply is carefully analyzed and optimized through the size prism: the topology, the control algorithm, and the components. Design and optimization tools are developed, and the theoretical calculations are verified in hardware. The result of the optimization is a microprocessor power supply that meets Intel Pentium III electrical performance specs in approximately one-fifth of the specified volume, resulting in a power density of roughly 40 W/in^ 3...|$|E
40|$|The Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) branch at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is {{currently}} undergoing preparations for ground {{testing of the}} Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) to prepare its subsystems for EM- 1 (Exploration Mission- 1). EM- 1, Orions second unmanned flight, is a three-week long lunar mission during which the vehicle will complete a 6 -day retrograde lunar orbit before returning to Earth. This paper focuses on the work done during the authors 16 -week internship with the Mechanical Engineering Branch of KSCs Engineering Directorate. The authors project involved assisting with the preparations for testing the Orion MPCVs ammonia boiler system. The purpose of the ammonia boiler system {{is to keep the}} spacecraft sufficiently cool during the reentry portion of its mission, from service module (SM) separation to post-landing. This system is critical for keeping both the spacecraft (avionics and electronics) and crew alive during reentry, thus a successful test of the system is essential to the success of EM- 1. XXXX The author was able to draft a detailed outline of the procedure for the ammonia system functional test. More work will need to be done on the vehicle <b>power-up</b> <b>and</b> <b>power-down</b> portions of the procedure, but the ammonia system testing portion of the procedure is thorough and includes vehicle test configurations, vehicle commands, and GSE. The author was able to compile a substantial list of questions regarding the ammonia system functional test {{with the help of her}} mentors. A significant number of these questions were answered in the teleconferences with Lockheed Martin...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} written {{with the purpose}} to find a {{solution}} to the high levels of energy consumption that there are nowadays. The current proliferation of network devices that are continuously powered on produces an urgent need to think about a simple and effective way to reduce their power consumption. We find out that most people prefer to leave their PCs always on; this mainly dues to the little sensibility that people have toward the cost of keeping a PC on and the cost of both, in terms of time and technical skill, to properly and quickly switch on and off a PC. These somehow surprising facts suggested us to design a solution able to control the power state of PCs in the Campus, explicitly targeting the ease of use. The result is Polisave, a centralized web-based architecture which allows users to schedule power state of their PCs; the server remotely triggers <b>power-up</b> <b>and</b> <b>power-down</b> events by piloting a custom software which has to be installed in each PC. This thesis is based on the realization of Polisave for Linux. This project examines how to perform actions to turn on, suspend, hibernate or shut down computers with Linux through the programming. There is also a great survey of two complex technologies such as HAL, which allows obtaining the hardware characteristics of a computer and DBUS, which allows multiple applications to communicate. It also analyses other simple but important technologies in the Linux software such as logs, daemons, GUI [...] . Therefore, the result of this thesis is not only a software to perform energy saving actions, but a small study with examples of technologies which can help anyone interested in learning these technologies...|$|E
