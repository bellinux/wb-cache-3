5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone <b>protein</b> <b>core</b> around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E
25|$|The {{solubility}} {{of proteins}} in aqueous buffers {{depends on the}} distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residues on the protein's surface. Hydrophobic residues predominantly occur in the globular <b>protein</b> <b>core,</b> but some exist in patches on the surface. Proteins that have high hydrophobic amino acid content on the surface have low solubility in an aqueous solvent. Charged and polar surface residues interact with ionic groups in the solvent and increase the solubility of a protein.

25|$|The {{most common}} poly{{histidine}} tags are formed of six histidine (6xHis tag) residues - which are added at the N-terminus preceded by Methionine or C-terminus before a stop codon, in the coding {{sequence of the}} protein of interest. The choice of the end where His-tag is added will depend mainly {{on the characteristics of}} the protein and the methods chosen to remove the tag. Some ends are buried inside the <b>protein</b> <b>core</b> and others are important for the protein function or structure. In those cases the choice is limited to the other end. On the other hand, most available exopeptidases can only remove the His-tag from the N-terminus; removing the tag from the C-terminus will require the use of other techniques. It is important to take into account that the computer simulation (by molecular dynamic) will help you to choose between options, for example, whether the His-tag must be digested or engineered to the N- or C-terminal.|$|E

The results show that interfaces differ from <b>protein</b> <b>cores</b> and non-interface surfaces in residue composition, sequence entropy, and secondary structure. Since interfaces, <b>protein</b> <b>cores,</b> and non-interface surfaces have different solvent accessibilities, {{it is important to}} investigate whether the observed differences are due to the differences in solvent accessibility or differences in functionality. We separate out the effect of solvent accessibility by comparing interfaces with a set of residues having the same solvent accessibility as the interfaces. This strategy reveals residue distribution propensities that are not observable by comparing interfaces with <b>protein</b> <b>cores</b> and noninterface surfaces. Our conclusions are that there are larger numbers of hydrophobic residues, particularly aromatic residues, in interfaces, and the interactions apparently favored in interfaces include the opposite charge pairs and hydrophobic pairs. Surprisingly, Pro-Trp pairs are over represented in interfaces, presumably because of favorable geometries. The analysis is repeated using three datasets having different constraints on sequence similarity and structure quality. Consistent results are obtained across these datasets.

40|$|The {{adenovirus}} genome forms chromatin-like {{structure with}} viral <b>core</b> <b>proteins.</b> This complex supports only {{a low level}} of transcription in a cell-free system, and thus <b>core</b> <b>proteins</b> have been thought to be negative factors for transcription.
