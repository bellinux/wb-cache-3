50|$|ANOVA on ranks {{means that}} a {{standard}} analysis of variance is calculated on the rank-transformed data. Conducting factorial ANOVA on the ranks of original scores has also been suggested. However, Monte Carlo studies, and subsequent asymptotic studies found that the rank transformation is inappropriate for testing interaction effects in a 4x3 and a 2x2x2 factorial design. As the number of effects (i.e., main, interaction) become non-null, and as {{the magnitude of the}} non-null effects increase, there is an increase in Type I error, resulting in a complete failure of the statistic with as high as a 100% probability of making a false positive decision. Similarly, {{it was found that the}} rank transformation increasingly fails in the two dependent samples layout as the correlation between <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> posttest scores increase. It was also discovered that the Type I error rate problem was exacerbated in the context of Analysis of Covariance, particularly as the correlation between the covariate and the dependent variable increased.|$|E

Using a quasi-experimental design, it tracks 46 underprepared students, admitted to the USIU in the Summer Semester of 2011 who failed to make the threshold for university course in a placement test (<b>pretest)</b> <b>and</b> went through a remedial English course for 14 weeks. On completion of the course, they were given the same placement test (posttest). Comparisons between the scores in the <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> those on the post-test are used to determine the significance of the change the treatment gives the students. Further comparisons are made between the scores in composition and in the grammar sections of the <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> posttest and variation between the scores of students. T-tests establish a significant and positive difference at p value of p= 0. 00 between overall performance between the <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> posttest and between grammar and composition aspects of the tests.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} fifth graders 2 ̆ 7 written responses to literature in dialogue journals. ^ Sixteen picture books from four different genres (fantasy, traditional literature, contemporary realistic fiction, and historical fiction) were read to twenty-three fifth graders. Students were asked to respond to the books in dialogue journals. ^ <b>Pretest</b> <b>and</b> posttest writing instruments, adapted from Diederich 2 ̆ 7 s (1974) analytical scale, were used to determine changes in writing after the dialogue journal process. Four raters scored the <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> posttest writings, and analysis of variance was utilized to determine differences in the writings by sex and time. A significant interaction was found. Girls scored significantly higher on the pretest than the posttest. T-tests were conducted to determine significant differences between boys and girls both in the <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> posttest. The girls scored significantly higher than the boys on the pretest. ^ Both the <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> posttest writings, as well as the dialogue journal entries, were examined in terms of the percentage of T-units (Hunt, 1965) of the Purves - Rippere (1968) categories of response (engagement, perception, interpretation, evaluation, and miscellaneous comments). A T-test was utilized to compare the frequency of occurrence of the categories in the <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> posttest writings. A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to determine any significant frequency of occurrence of the Purves - Rippere (1968) categories in the dialogue journal entries within the four different genres of books read to the children. Frequencies of occurrence were significantly different for all categories, as determined by a Tukey (1977) test. In order of frequency of occurrence, these categories were engagement, evaluation, perception, interpretation, and miscellaneous statements. This was the order for all genres except fantasy, where miscellaneous comments were fourth in order of occurrence and interpretation was last. ^ It was concluded that the dialogue journals had been effective in eliciting more engagement responses, but students had not shown significant gains in their overall writing, as measured by the <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> posttest. ...|$|E
