When dealing with ombrogenous matrices such as <b>peats</b> <b>ashing</b> alone or in combination with acid digestion usually suffices [29]. Current best practice for extraction of tephra from mineral-rich sediments is the physical density-separation method described by Turney [60] and further refined with important down-stream improvements by Blockely et al. [61]. This method is based on the initial concentration of shards in each sample via ashing and sieving, followed by flotation of particles in a heavy liquid, usually sodium polytungstate (SPT) at 2.5 g cm- 3. It {{is important to note that}} if tephra samples are prepared for geochemical analysis they should be neither ashed nor should they come into lengthy contact with corrosive chemicals, which has been shown to significantly but unsystematically alter the chemical composition of the glass shards. Such corrosion makes the correct geochemical identification and correlation of the extracted tephra difficult if not impossible and a modified extraction procedure needs to be followed [61]. The useful protocol summaries of Swindles et al. [29], Turney [60], and Blockley and colleagues [61] lay out the guidelines for these complementary methods.|$|R

This study examines the effects of <b>peat</b> <b>ash</b> fertilization on the nutritional status and growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on drained mire areas in which the trees were suffering from P and K deficiencies of varying degree. <b>Peat</b> <b>ash</b> increased the volume growth of the stands, and the effect was progressively stronger {{all the way to}} the end of the study period, 30 years from the treatment.

Raw leachate was pre-treated with aeration and sedimentation, followed by several parallel individual steps such as bioremediation, chemical oxidation, ozonation, and geo-bed filters. The efficiency of different treatment steps was evaluated according to one previously developed protocol, which includes measurements of several parameters such as conductivity, pH, nutrients, chloride, metals, organic compounds, and acute toxicity before and after a treatment step. The treatment steps which showed the highest efficiency towards organic pollutants in leachate were ozone treatment and chemical oxidation.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} adsorbent materials for treatment of contaminated waters and remediation of contaminated soils. Natural and waste product materials showed high adsorption capacity for metals and organic pollutants and {{proved to be a}} good alternative to commercial adsorbents. Adsorption of Pb, Cu, Zn and Cr onto peat moss, fibre sludge ash, pine bark, sawdust, shrimp shells and seaweed was studied in batch adsorption systems. Artificial solutions and real landfill leachates were used. All the materials showed high uptake of metals from solutions with a concentration range typical for severely polluted groundwater. The adsorption capacities found for the conditions applied were 1. 3  1. 8 mgg 1. Materials having the highest uptake for metals, including peat moss, fibre sludge ash and bark were further studied in column experiments for possible implementation in treatment of leachate at a landfill. The adsorption capacities for adsorption from the artificial solution were one order of magnitude higher than those for the real leachate. This was attributed to competition between different metals for adsorption sites {{in the case of the}} leachate. These results may indicate that laboratory tests with artificial solutions can overestimate the performance of an adsorbent, and that specific experiments using real leachates are needed when a water treatment application is developed. A peat-ash mixture showed lower adsorption capacity than the peat itself, and these materials are suggested to be used separately. The presence of Fe in the solution reduced the adsorption of all studied metals to half the normal. Thus, Fe precipitation is recommended as a pretreatment step. Adsorption of Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu and Zn in low concentrations onto <b>peat</b> and <b>ash</b> was studied in detail since adsorption mechanisms were suggested to depend on concentration. Kinetic and equilibrium batch adsorption studies were conducted and data complied with a second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm model. An empirical model for predicting adsorption of metal ions at a given time was derived from kinetic model constants. Possible mechanisms of adsorption onto biosorbents and mineral surfaces were summarised and suggestions made for the mechanisms of adsorption onto <b>peat</b> and <b>ash.</b> An explanation for the orders of affinity of metal ions to adsorption sites found was proposed on the basis of the chemical properties of the metals.

In order to assess the mentioned influence, test specimens of both untreated and stabilized soil have been tested in the laboratory so that their permeability could be evaluated. Falling head and one dimensional consolidation tests of laboratory permeability were performed on the clay specimens and the chemical compositions of the materials as well as microstructure of the stabilized soil with 18 % cement, 2 % <b>peat</b> <b>ash,</b> and 5 % silica sand were investigated, using X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy respectively. Results show that for soil stabilization with up to 8 % cement content (of the dry weight of the soil), the average value of coefficient of permeability (kv) {{is very close to}} that of untreated soil, whereas the kv value decreases drastically for 18 % cement under identical void ratio conditions. It is further revealed that addition of 18 % cement, 2 % <b>peat</b> <b>ash,</b> and 5 % silica sand had decreased the coefficient of permeability by almost 2. 2 folds after 24 h, while about 1. 7 folds increase was observed in coefficient of permeability once 13. 5 % of cement, 1. 5 % of <b>peat</b> <b>ash,</b> and 20 % of silica sand were added.

It {{turns out that the}} vertical section of Daniugou <b>peat</b> <b>ash</b> is primarily constituted by clay and silt particles, and the content of sand is relatively small. Grain-size frequency curves generally show a single-peak modality while a bimodal pattern is detected in the upper layer. The grain-size component and peak pattern of grain-size frequency curves also illustrate that <b>peat</b> <b>ash</b> materials were transported to the peatland by long-range aeolian dust during the deposition process, while there existed short-distance dust influence in peat deposition of the upper layer. Comparisons of grain-size parameters and the discriminative Y-value of Daniugou <b>peat</b> <b>ash</b> with those of typical aeolian sediments show close similarities, suggesting the possibility that atmospheric dust transport processes were involved in the accumulation of peat again. Moreover, the variations of grain-size distribution suggest the local environmental deterioration which is just the driving force of local dust elevation.

Thin section analysis was undertaken in order to investigate and compare the characteristics of these layers. The investigation also draws on earlier analyses of the Iron Age agricultural soil around the settlement and the midden deposits that accumulated within the settlement, to create a 'joined-up' analysis which considers the way material from the settlement was used and then recycled as fertiliser for the fields. Peat was collected from the nearby uplands and was used for fuel and possibly also for flooring. It is suggested that organic-rich floors from the structures were periodically removed and the material was spread onto the fields as fertilisers. More organic-rich material {{may have been used}} selectively for fertiliser, while the less organic <b>peat</b> <b>ash</b> was allowed to accumulate in middens. Several of the structures may have functioned as byres, which suggests a prehistoric plaggen system...|$|E
40|$|Wetlands {{are well}} known to be {{efficient}} at sequestering pollutants from contaminated water. We investigated metal accumulation in the peats of the Klip River, a natural wetland that has received contaminated water from gold mining operations in Johannesburg for over 130 years. Previous work conducted in the downstream portion identified the wetland as an important system for sequestering metals. We focused on the upstream section of the wetland, more proximal {{to the source of}} acid mine drainage, to provide {{a better understanding of the}} pollutant sources and the role of the wetland in pollutant attenuation. Geochemical and mineralogical analyses of peat cores revealed considerable metal enrichments in the <b>peat</b> <b>ash,</b> particularly in Co, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cu and U. Metal concentrations are typically between 4 to 8 times higher than those previously reported for the downstream, more distal portion of the wetland. The distribution of metal accumulation within the peat profiles suggests that contamination arises from a combination of sources and processes. Elevated concentrations in the shallow peat are attributed to the input of contaminated surface water via tributaries that drain the Central Rand Goldfield, whereas enrichments in the deeper peat suggest significant sub-surface inflow of contaminated water through the underlying dolomitic rocks. Metal immobilisation occurs through a combination of mechanisms, which include the precipitation of gypsum, metal sulfides, Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and phosphates. Our study highlights the environmental and economic importance of natural wetland systems which have the ability to accumulate large quantities of metals and thus remediate polluted waters...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the most suitable irrigation scheduling of fresh market tomato (Fantastic- 144) grown on volcanic <b>ash,</b> <b>peat</b> and their mixture (1 : 1) under Plastic house conditions at Alata Horticultural Research Institute in the Mediterranean Region of Turkey in 1998. The quality and yield response of Fantastic- 144 to trickle irrigation was also investigated. Four different irrigation levels (WL 1 = 75 %, WL 2 = 100 %, WL 3 = 125 % and WL 4 = 150 % of Class A Pan evaporation) and two irrigation frequencies (once and twice daily applications) were evaluated. Highest yield and fruit number {{were obtained from the}} ash+peat (1 : 1) with irrigation once a day at WL 4 and ash+peat (1 : 1) with twice a day watering at WL 3 and WL 4 irrigation levels. Soluble solids of tomato fruit decreased with increasing available water. The highest WUE value of 67. 5 kg m - 3 was obtained from WL 1 with peat+ash (1 : 1). WUE decreased in all treatments as the amount of irrigation water increased...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{scientists}} {{have tried to}} establish a chronological point for this pharaoh's reign at 1159BC, based on a 1999 dating of the Hekla 3 eruption of the Hekla volcano in Iceland. Since contemporary records show that the king experienced difficulties provisioning his workmen at Deir el-Medina with supplies in his 29th Year, this dating of Hekla 3 might connect his 28th or 29th regnal year to c. 1159BC. A minor discrepancy of one year is possible since Egypt's granaries could have had reserves to cope {{with at least a}} single bad year of crop harvests following the onset of the disaster. This implies that the king's reign would have ended just three to four years later, around 1156 or 1155BC. A rival date of [...] "2900BP" [...] (950BC) has since been proposed by scientists based on a re-examination of the volcanic layer. Given that no Egyptologist dates Ramesses III's reign to as late as 1000BC, this would mean that the Hekla 3 eruption presumably occurred well after Ramesses III's reign. A 2002 study, using high-precision radiocarbon dating of a <b>peat</b> deposit containing <b>ash</b> layers, put this eruption in the range 1087–1006 BC.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the stabilization potential of Class F pond ash (PA) from a coal fired {{thermal power station}} on tropical peat soil. Peat or highly organic soils are well known for their high compressibility, natural moisture content, low shear strength and long-term settlement. This study investigates the effect of different amount (i. e., 5, 10, 15 and 20 %) of PA on peat soil, collected from Sarawak, Malaysia, mainly compaction and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) properties. The amounts of PA added to the peat soil sample as percentage of the dry peat soil mass. With the increase in PA content, the maximum dry density (MDD) of peat soil increases, while the optimum moisture content (OMC) decreases. The UCS value of the peat soils increases significantly {{with the increase of}} PA content and also with curing periods. This improvement on compressive strength of tropical peat soils indicates that PA {{has the potential to be}} used as a stabilizer for tropical peat soil. Also, the use of PA in soil stabilization helps in reducing the pond volume and achieving environment friendly as well as a sustainable development of natural resources.
