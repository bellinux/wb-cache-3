Four hundred and forty eight Aceh construction organizations participated in this study. Partial correlation analysis was utilized for hypotheses testing. In general, the result of the partial correlation analysis showed that technology utilization moderated the relationship between seven of the nine functions of project management and overall project performance.

Network diagrams communicate numerical scheduling information. While research has addressed network analysis, the graphical comprehension has been addressed less. Software applications do not optimize their graphical output, but may obscure dependencies, rather than clarify them, and lack guidelines to produce quality schedule diagrams. This paper describes an arrangement algorithm to simplify the representation of CPM networks toward few crossings. The algorithm asserts that fundamentally the nodes and links bear an equivalence that makes them graphically interchangeable, so that it may operate even on deeply nested dependencies. It is designed with abstraction for potential application beyond CPM scheduling. It attempts to replicate the human intuition of a scheduler to minimize the computational time to support its adoption, places no special demands on implementation and requires only integer arithmetic and array memory storage capabilities...|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. In all companies, {{there exists}} many {{opportunities}}. With these opportunities comes benefits {{as well as}} uncertainties and therefore risks. To expedite these opportunities, {{it is crucial that}} the expected monetary value associated with the gain of the opportunity exceeds the expected monetary value associated with the loss due to the risk impact. It is therefore imperative that all projects with associated risks be carefully identified and assessed, with mitigation steps to reduce or eliminate the impact of the risks, if possible. The management of identifying, assessing and mitigating risks with mitigation and contingent plans or allowances, is known as risk management. Risk management identifies strategies and the relevant stakeholders to best handle risks by seeking innovative but practical solutions, based on experience and sound judgements. Risk management forms a vital part of <b>project</b> <b>management</b> since risk is present throughout the life cycle of any project. Risks are present in all <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>functions.</b> These risks arise due to changes in scope also known as scope creep, unrealistic cost or time estimation and factors influencing quality, etc. It is believed that risk management is an influencing factor that determines the success of a project. According to the literature review, the success of a project is defined according to a time - budget - performance model, where the project is regarded as successful if it is completed within the projected timeline and budget and meets all the quality requirements. This research paper explored the definition of project success at Sasol 1 in Secunda and the influence of risk management on the success of a project. A questionnaire 1 Sasol in Secunda, will from hereon be defined as and referred to as the organization survey was distributed to selected persons using email at the organisation to investigate their opinions towards risk management. From the findings of the study, it was found that this research study is fitting to the theoretical belief that effective risk management is an important influencing factor on the success of a project and that a successful project is defined as a project completed within the projected schedule and budget and meets all requirements. It was also an objective to determine which of the <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>functions</b> should be focussed on to improve project success at the organisation. The <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>functions</b> believed to have most risk attached to it, was further compared to the actual <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>functions</b> with most risks attached to it during the actual project execution. This has proven to be an opportunity to optimise on which <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>functions</b> should be the focus areas, by comparing the belief, to the factors that actually have major risk impacts. The risk management process at the organisation was further investigated to ensure that it was the most efficient risk management process. Following the research, it can be concluded that the risk management model at the organisation is the most optimised model in accordance with that of literature. The scope of this dissertation includes risk classification, the process of risk management, risk management techniques based on theory and an investigation into a case study. This theoretical understanding is then compared to the actual research findings based on the questionnaire conducted, on the effects of risk management and its effects on the success of a project...|$|R

Many times actual percentage of waste generation is much higher than envisaged initially causing needless utilization of resources. It means there is a plenty of scope for enhancing project productivity simply by taking waste out of construction. Disposing of waste is not the right solution. Many countries are facing the problem of scarcity of dumping yards and exhaust of landfill spaces forcing researchers to look for an alternate and efficient waste management system. The literature review is carried out to identify construction waste management techniques being used in the construction industry. An attempt is made in this paper to quantify concrete waste and locate causes of its generation in housing projects.

Interviews were held with 23 industry role-players made up of clients, contractors and consultants. The interviews solicited input on the role-players’ perception and experience related to the influence of Project Management over the past 10 years, not only on a list of success criteria relative to their own role in the industry, but also their perception of the influence on the other defined role-player groups. Included in the interview questionnaire was also a range of general questions to refine the feedback and further test the hypotheses. The data were interpreted and analysed by comparing the feedback of the respondents as a combination and separately as groups. The results of the study indicate that: · Project Management could be seen as a legitimate part of the industry; · The industry role-players perceive Project Management as making an impact and having a growing influence on the industry; · A specific but broad set of skills are required by Project Managers; · The <b>Project</b> <b>Management</b> <b>function</b> cannot be fulfilled by other consultants, but there are project related criteria which should be considered before making a final judgment.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Vanderbijlpark Campus [i. e. Potchefstroom Campus], 2008. The {{relationship}} between project management and procurement as an organisational function {{is often a}} clash of wills. The field of project management is ripe with stories of clashes between project managers and procurement officers who, for whatever reason do not work well together. There is no lack of literature on project failure and reasons why projects fail. Available literature concludes that successful projects are defined as those completed on time, within budget, and in ways that meet objectives. The biggest challenge to project managers is to mitigate risk in an environment filled with uncertainties. Marketplace forces such as unstable commodity markets and economic fluctuations are among the competitive forces experienced by project managers. Suppliers play an integral role within the project life cycle and therefore {{it is essential to}} ensure that the right suppliers are selected. The role of procurement has changed from functional to strategic and is no longer viewed as a backroom function, which converts requests into supplier orders. The main reason for the change is due to challenging factors such as globalisation, inflation, technological innovations, and fluctuations in exchange rates and commodity markets. Due to the large portion of expenditure spend by the procurement department within the organisation the savings on purchasing costs can have a substantial effect on the profitability of the organisation. Procurement savings initiatives are now far more visible on the agendas of senior management. Selection of the right suppliers is crucial for any organisation striving to achieve the business objectives of the organisation and meet the expectations of customers and shareholders. The procurement department apply certain tools and techniques to select, evaluate, and measure the performance of suppliers. Various tools and techniques are available, the focus of the study is on three of these tools and techniques namely: negotiations, material budgets, and the SESPA(Supplier Evaluation, Selection, and Performance Appraisal) process. According to the literature reviewed, a project life cycle can be broken down into four to five key phases namely: the conceptual, planning, execution, close out, and control phases and procurement process into five steps namely: define the requirements, select the supplier, produce an agreement, administer day-to-day activities, and assess the performance of suppliers. A comparison between the steps within the procurement process and the phases within the project management life cycle reveals commonality and the potential of benefits that the tools and techniques applied by procurement can contribute to the project life cycle. Thus the challenge to the procurement office is how to partner with the <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>function</b> in a manner that will positively impact on the project management life cycle and the project success. With these obstacles facing most organisations, it is time for procurement and project management to focus on cooperation instead of confrontation. Developing a culture that sees individual projects as elements of a business plan will require change. There is no lack of literature on resistance to change. Change is seldom easy and old ways die hard, even when there is wide agreement that change is needed. Therefore whatever the reason for change, it is essential for organisations to realise that successful implementation of change will require a systematic change implementation process. Master...|$|E

Combining Foucault’s concept of the productive power of governmentality {{with the notion of}} timescapes into an analytical lens, the ethnography opens up the black box to reveal how <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>functions</b> as a powerful disciplinary technique. I show what escapes the imposed boundaries of the project as, in contrast to rational representations of the linearity of the project life cycle, decisions are retrospectively framed and the past rewritten. Simultaneously, project managers attempt to bring an uncertain future under control, discursively enrolling actors into their visions. Discursive and symbolic meanings of projects link to materiality as resources are represented as plentiful or meagre. Financial year-end exerts a disciplinary force so that time gets compressed and decision making becomes expedient. As resources move between budgets, governmentality is enacted, while budget headings of ‘other’ account for inevitable remaindering. Creative ‘time tactics’ are an adaptive response to achieving externally imposed targets while performing local project success. It turns out that time is at once metaphysical and mundane.

40|$|Research Assistants (RAs) are {{a crucial}} yet often under-recognised and under-supported group in acadaemia. RAs are {{involved}} in every facet of scholarly research, and undertake research functions ranging from basic tasks to highly skilled analysis, writing and <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>functions.</b> In the context of escalating Government pressure for Universities to improve efficiency, productivity and accountability in all areas, skilled RAs are increasingly essential to the achievement of research performance indicators. However, {{there is some evidence}} to suggest that through university casualisation and under-resourcing, RAs may often not be acknowledged or receive adequate professional development. This paper profiles Queensland University of Technology Faculty of Education RAs in terms of their skill sets, employment circumstances and educational backgrounds. While nearly all RAs in the study were female and employed on a casual basis, they were otherwise a heterogenous group, including some undergraduates with minimal research experience, and some highly experienced and well-qualified RAs with specialised research capabilities. This study identifies key opportunities for skills enhancement, research community involvement, and career advancement (including research-focussed academic pathways), and makes recommendations regarding RA development initiatives...|$|R
