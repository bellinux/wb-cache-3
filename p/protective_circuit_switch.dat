40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of an Internet that uses <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> instead of, or in addition to, packet switching. On the face of it, this would seem a pointless exercise; the Internet is packet switched, and was deliberately built that way to enable the efficiencies afforded by statistical multiplexing, and the robustness of fast re-routing around failures. But link utilization is low, and falling, particularly {{at the core of}} the Internet, which means that statistical multiplexing is less important than it once was. And <b>circuit</b> <b>switches</b> today are capable of rapid reconfiguration around failures. There is also renewed interest in <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> because of the ease of building very high capacity optical <b>circuit</b> <b>switches.</b> While several proposals have suggested ways in which <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> may be introduced into the Internet, this paper is based on TCP Switching, in which a new circuit is created for each application flow. Here, we explore {{the performance of}} a network that uses TCP Switching, with particular emphasis on the reponse time experienced by users. We use simple M/G/ 1 and M/G/N queues to model application flows in both packet <b>switched</b> and <b>circuit</b> <b>switched</b> networks, as well as ns- 2 simulations. We conclude that because of high bandwidth long-lived flows, it does not make sense to use <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> in shared access or local area networks. But our results suggest that in the core of the network, where high capacity is needed most, and where there are many flows per link, there is little or no difference in performance between <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> and packet <b>switching.</b> Given that <b>circuit</b> <b>switches</b> can be built to be much faster than packet switches, this suggests that a <b>circuit</b> <b>switched</b> core warrants further investigation.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a framework for}} the design, synthesis and cycle-accurate simulation for parallel computing networks of 128 + processors. In order to accurately characterize the network, we present a bottom-up design methodology in which each of the components are designed using a hardware description language and synthesized to an FPGA for performance estimation of the final ASIC implementation. The components are then integrated to form a parallel computing network and simulated using a cycle-accurate simulator with network traffic described by command files. This enabled us to simulate various switching techniques, three of which are presented in this paper: wormhole <b>switching,</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> and a newly introduced technique called predictive <b>circuit</b> <b>switching.</b> In our experiments, four different representational traffics are generated for our simulation and, to show the flexibility of this model, we vary the cable lengths and thus their latency for all four test cases. Our results show that this hardware design, synthesis, and cycle-accurate simulation methodology provides a useful method for evaluating design tradeoffs in parallel networks. A non-blocking queue, with up to 128 internal queues, and a real-time bandwidth scheduler, for up to 128 ports, were designed in hardware with hardware synthesis results presented. From our network simulation results, we conclude that predictive <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> exceeds the performance of packet switching Preprint submitted to Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing 8 November 2004 for highly predictable traffic, like collective communications, and for heavily loaded unpredictable traffic with small packet sizes.

40|$|Hybrid <b>circuit</b> and packet <b>switching</b> {{for data}} center {{networking}} (DCN) has received considerable research attention recently. A hybrid-switched DCN employs a much faster <b>circuit</b> <b>switch</b> that is reconfigurable with a nontrivial cost, {{and a much}} slower packet switch that is reconfigurable with no cost, to interconnect its racks of servers.
