40|$|Abstract. The {{upcoming}} {{operation of}} Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) will {{be supported by}} an Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) system working at 140 GHz in second harmonic at the nominal magnetic field of 2. 5 T. Because the optimization of the plasma breakdown is crucial {{to ensure a successful}} plasma build-up, dedicated <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> experiments were performed on three stellarator/heliotron devices: Heliotron J, LHD and WEGA. Start-up behavior and dependencies on ECRH injected power, neutral gas pressure and rotational transform were obtained in X 2 heating. <b>Plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> delay time decreases with the increase in ECRH input power. However, this behavior saturates when low pre-fill neutral gas pressure conditions are met. Both the delay time and the electron density are an increasing function of the gas pressure. On Heliotron J and WEGA devices, the higher the rotational transform is, the faster the start-up and the higher the plasma density are. Analysis of the temporal evolution of the <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> shows that <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> on stellarators is a two-step process. In addition, off-axis heating experiments are characterized by a longer <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> duration compared to on-axis heating discharges. Third harmonic in X-mode has been attempted on LHD for different neutral gas puffing settings but no plasma breakdown was achieved. This multi-machine study was useful to define ECRH start-up scenarios for W 7 -X. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of an}} {{existing}} 28 GHz gyrotron (200 kW, 40 ms) for pre-ionisation and plasma current start-up in the MAST tokamak is under consideration. The proposed scheme assumes that low-density plasma will be produced by RF pre-ionisation around the fundamental electron cyclotron (EC) resonance layer. Then a double mode conversion scheme is considered for electron Bernstein wave (EBW) excitation in plasmas with densities lower than the O-mode cut-off density (1019 m- 3 for 28 GHz). The scheme consists of {{the conversion of the}} O-mode, incident from the low field side of the tokamak, into the X-mode {{with the help of a}} grooved mirror-polariser incorporated in a graphite tile on the central rod. The X-mode reflected from the polariser propagates back to the plasma and experiences a subsequent X-EBW mode conversion near the upper hybrid resonance. Finally the excited EBW mode is totally absorbed at the EC resonance. The absorption of EBW remains high even in a cold plasma. Furthermore, EBW can generate significant plasma current during the <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> phase giving the prospect of a fully non-inductive <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> scenario...|$|E
40|$|Removal of {{the central}} solenoid is {{essential}} to realize an economical spherical tokamak fusion reactor, but non-inductive <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> is a challenge. On the TST- 2 spherical tokamak, non-inductive <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> using lower-hybrid (LH) waves has been investigated. Using the capacitively-coupled combline (CCC) antenna installed at the outboard midplane, fully non-inductive plasma current ramp-up up to a quarter of that of the typical Ohmic discharges has been achieved. Although it was desirable to keep the density low during the plasma current ramp-up to avoid the LH density limit, it was recognized {{that there was a}} maximum current density that could be carried by a given electron density. Since the density needed to increase as the plasma current was ramped-up, the achievable plasma current was limited by the maximum operational toroidal field of TST- 2. The top-launch CCC antenna was installed to access higher density with up-shift of the parallel index of refraction. Numerical analysis of LH current drive with the outboard-launch and top-launch antennas was performed and the results were qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations...|$|E

40|$|Spherical tokamaks (STs) have a {{particular}} need for non-inductive start-up methods, due to the limited space for a shielded inboard solenoid. <b>Plasma</b> current <b>start-up</b> assisted by electron Bernstein waves (EBW) has been demonstrated successfully {{in a number of}} experiments. The dynamic start-up phase involves a change in field topology, as the initially open magnetic field lines form closed flux surfaces (CFS) under the initiation of a plasma current. This change in field topology will bring about a change in the current drive (CD) mechanism, and, although various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of CFS, no detailed theoretical studies have previously been undertaken. This thesis reports on the development of a kinetic start-up model for EBW-assisted <b>plasma</b> current <b>start-up</b> in MAST. In order to ensure the model is tractable and computationally manageable, the time evolution of the electron distribution function is studied in zero spatial and two momentum dimensions under several effects thought to be important during start-up. In order to obtain numerical solutions to the time evolution of the distribution function, a positivity-preserving solution to two-dimensional advection-diffusion equations including mixed derivative terms are required. A numerical scheme for solving these equations is presented, and shown to improve the accuracy of lower-order finite difference schemes. It is shown that the open magnetic field line configuration allows electrons to freely stream out of the plasma, but that the addition of a small vertical magnetic field leads to the preferential confinement of a selection of electrons and the generation of a plasma current. Collisions then act to "feed" this loss mechanism by increasing the parallel momentum of electrons through pitch-angle scattering, leading to greater losses and a greater plasma current. This CD mechanism is shown to be consistent with several experimentally observed effects, providing a theoretical understanding of these effects, while comparisons between simulation and experiment is good.

The detailed engineering design and infrastructure setup for R & D have been completed in 2001. In March 2008, after the construction period of seven years, the KSTAR assembly has been completed, by connecting the cryogenic transfer lines between the tokamak and the cryogenic distribution system. The commissioning on KSTAR has been progressed from March to July 2008, through following four steps: vacuum, cryogenic cool down, superconducting magnet test, and <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up.</b> KSTAR has successfully passed the vacuum and cool down commissioning at the first trial. All of the subsystems have been tested and showed to satisfy the design requirements. All of the magnets were cooled down to 4. 5 K stably and then charged successfully without any serious faults. The first ohmic plasma was achieved on June 10 th. The breakdown was successfully achieved at Bt = 1. 5 T at 1. 8 m. After several tens of breakdown shots, the first plasma of more than 100 kA has been successfully achieved on June 13 th 2008. At the <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> stage, it was verified that the key issues for the breakdown and the current ramp-up are: the null field, breakdown electric field, toroidal field, gas pressure, blip duration, ECH pulse length and impurity control.

The development of non-inductive (NI) plasmas {{is a major}} long-term research goal for NSTX-U. Time dependent numerical simulations of 28 GHz electron cyclotron (EC) heating of low density NI start-up plasmas generated by Coaxial Helicity Injection (CHI) in NSTX-U predict a significant and rapid increase of the central electron temperature (Te(0)) before the plasma becomes overdense. The increased Te(0) will significantly reduce the Ip decay rate of CHI plasmas, allowing the coupling of fast wave heating and neutral beam injection.

30|$|The {{calculation}} of EFIT (including offline EFIT and RTEFIT) requires {{a large number}} of electromagnetic measurement data from magnetic probes, flux loops, etc. The plasma-forming process is quite complex in the Tokamak start-up phase. The <b>start-up</b> <b>plasma</b> is not in equilibrium state, and the result of magnetic measurement hardly reflects the real situation of plasma current because of the existence of induced eddy current in the vacuum chamber wall (Liu et al. 2008; Zhou et al. 2015). Thus, the calculated result from EFIT is inaccurate and unusable for reliable plasma current and its position control. In addition, during the discharge process, the distance from the outer closed magnetic surface to the inner wall of mid-plane of the high field side (also called as Gap) is a very important parameter. During the preliminary discharge stage, the Gap influences the initiation of plasma, and accurate Gap control becomes helpful for reliable plasma current and position control.

Scaling of previous ECH-only startup experiments on CDX-U and DIII-D indicate that 400 kW of ECH should be capable of driving 42 kA of pressure driven current on NSTX and possibly higher levels after optimizing the process.

40|$|The RFX {{power supply}} system is a {{combination}} of electrical devices, such as a. c. -d. c. converters, direct current interrupters, large capacitor banks and fast closing switches, whose coordinated operation allows the investigation of plasmas in the reverse field pinch (RFP) configuration. The large electrical power, required for the pulses, is derived partly from the 400 kV high voltage Italian grid and partly by the transfer to the plasma of energy stored before the pulse in the capacitor banks or in the machine magnets. The circuit operation phases to obtain RFP configurations are initially described: after premagnetizing the machine and charging the capacitor banks, the <b>plasma</b> current <b>start-up</b> follows (between 5 and 50 ms long) during which the energy stored is transferred to the plasma. Then, by means of the a. c. -d. c. converters, the steady state of the plasma configuration is sustained for a maximum duration of 0. 25 s. In the design of the power supply units a few aspects have been taken into account which have a great impact on the technical solutions: the possible fault conditions, which can in a few cases heavily damage the devices; the presence of high electromagnetic interference (EMI) which can induce noises in signals and errors in the circuit operations; the request for easy reconfigurations of the circuits, to cope with different types of plasma investigations. The fault protection led in RFX to the development of an active logic able to command the required protective actions, which have to operate within 1 ms of the fault. The EMI reduction was obtained with a careful analysis of the EMI source, related to the magnetic stray field caused by the machine magnetizing winding and by the operation of converters, capacitor banks, interrupters and ignitrons; screening of the area with control equipment, the signal insulation and a particular solution for the ground system was adopted.

40|$|The edge {{transport}} {{properties of}} the toroidally discrete limiter configuration in the ITER start-up phase has been analysed, using the 3 D edge transport code, EMC 3 -EIRENE. Because of the finite magnetic shear in the edge, {{the interaction of the}} limiters with flux surfaces of different g-values introduces a complex 3 D pattern in the connection length (L-C) profiles, where long and short flux tubes co-exist in the scrape-off layer. The severity of problems associated with very long flux tubes in the edge, which could bring a large amount of energy (proportional to the square root of L-C) and cause a hot spot on the limiter, was mitigated and no significant localized power load was found. This can be justified as follows. (i) For long flux tubes, the perpendicular energy transport time becomes shorter than the parallel energy transport time, resulting in no net energy input to the flux tube. (ii) Perpendicular transport was found to be very effective to smear out the difference in the parallel energy flux conducted by the various flux tubes, if they interact within a perpendicular transport scale, about a few cm, which is usually the case in high <b>plasma</b> current ITER <b>start-up</b> configuration. These two effects significantly reduce the dependence of energy deposition on L-C. At the high plasma current (e. g. 6. 5 MA), the peak power load is found to be close to the engineering limit, especially for lowest perpendicular transport coefficients and the highest input power. Comparing the results of the 3 D modelling with a radial exponential decay model, it was found that by neglecting the 3 D geometrical effects, the simple model overestimates the peak power load by similar to 30 % for corresponding input power and radial decay of energy flux...|$|R

A 28 GHz electron cylotron resonance heating (ECRH) system is currently being planned for NSTX-U. A 1 MW 28 GHz gyrotron will be employed. Intially the system will use short, 10 - 50 ms, 1 MW pulses for ECRH-assisted discharge start-up. Later the pulse length will be extended to 1 - 5 s to study electron Bernstein wave heating (EBWH) during the plasma current flat top. A mirror launcher {{will be used to}} couple microwave power to the plasma via O-mode to the slow X-mode to EBW (O-X-B) double mode conversion. This paper presents a pre-conceptual design for the ECRH/EBWH system proposed for NSTX-U and includes ray tracing and Fokker-Planck modeling results for 28 GHz ECRH during <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> and EBW heating and current drive during the plasma current flattop of a NSTX-U advanced H-mode plasma scenari...|$|E
40|$|The National Spherical Torus Experiment Upgrade (NSTX-U) {{will operate}} at axial {{toroidal}} fields of ≤ 1 T and plasma currents, Ip ≤ 2 MA. The development of non-inductive (NI) plasmas {{is a major}} long-term research goal for NSTX-U. Time dependent numerical simulations of 28 GHz electron cyclotron (EC) heating of low density NI start-up plasmas generated by Coaxial Helicity Injection (CHI) in NSTX-U predict a significant and rapid increase of the central electron temperature (Te(0)) before the plasma becomes overdense. The increased Te(0) will significantly reduce the Ip decay rate of CHI plasmas, allowing the coupling of fast wave heating and neutral beam injection. A megawatt-level, 28 GHz electron heating system is planned for heating NI start-up plasmas in NSTX-U. In addition to EC heating of CHI start-up discharges, this system {{will be used for}} electron Bernstein wave (EBW) <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up,</b> and eventually for EBW heating and current drive during the Ip flattop...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Heating {{and current}} drive (H&CD) systems must fulfill several roles in ITER {{operating}} scenarios: heating through the H-mode transition and to ignition, plasma burn control, current drive and current profile control in steady-state scenarios, {{and control of}} MHD instabilities. They must also perform ancillary functions, such as assisting <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> and wall conditioning. It is recognized that no one system can satisfy all of these requirements with the degree of flexibility which ITER will require. Four heating and current drive systems are therefore under consideration for ITER: electron cyclotron waves (ECW) at a principal frequency of 170 GHz, fast waves (FW) operating in the range 40 - 70 MHz (ion cyclotron waves, ICW), lower hybrid waves (LHW) at 5 GHz, and neutral beam injection using negative ion beam technology for operation at 1 MeV energy. It is likely that several of these systems will be employed in parallel. The systems have been chosen {{on the basis of}} the maturity of physics understanding and operating experience in current experiments and on the feasibility of applying th...|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} {{operational}} phase (OP 1. 1) of Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) {{electron cyclotron resonance}} heating (ECRH) was the exclusive heating method and provided <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up,</b> wall conditioning, heating and current drive. Six gyrotrons were commissioned for OP 1. 1 and used in parallel for plasma operation with a power of up to 4. 3 MW. During standard X 2 -heating the spatially localized power deposition with high power density allowed controlling the radial profiles of the electron temperature and the rotational transform. Even though W 7 -X was not fully equipped with first wall tiles and operated with a graphite limiter instead of a divertor, electron densities of n e > 3 · 1019 m- 3 could be achieved at electron temperatures of several keV and ion temperatures above 2 keV. These plasma parameters allowed the first demonstration of a multipath O 2 -heating scenario, which is envisaged for safe operation near the X-cutoff-density of 1. 2 · 1020 m- 3 after full commissioning of the ECRH system in the next operation phase OP 1. 2...|$|E
40|$|The National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) {{is being}} built at PPPL to test the fusion physics {{principles}} for the ST concept at the MA level. The NSTX nominal plasma parameters are R 0 = 85 cm, a = 67 cm, R/a 1. 26, BT = 3 kG, Ip = 1 MA, q 95 = 14, elongation k £ 2. 2, triangularity d £ 0. 5, and plasma pulse length of up to 5 sec. The plasma heating / current drive (CD) tools are High Harmonic Fast Wave (HHFW) (6 MW, 5 sec), Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) (5 MW, 80 keV, 5 sec), and Coaxial Helicity Injection (CHI). Theoretical calculations predict that NSTX should provide exciting possibilities for exploring {{a number of important}} new physics regimes including very high plasma beta, naturally high plasma elongation, high bootstrap current fraction, absolute magnetic well, and high pressure driven sheared flow. In addition, the NSTX program plans to explore fully non-inductive <b>plasma</b> <b>start-up</b> as well as a dispersive scrape-off layer for heat and particle flux handling. 1...|$|E
