50|$|The Cannery and Agricultural Workers' International Union (CAWIU), {{formerly}} known as the Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union (AWIU), was a Communist-aligned union active in California in the early 1930s. Early in its career the CAWIU involved itself primarily in spontaneous agricultural strikes, including the Santa Clara Valley cannery workers strike in July 1931 and the California <b>pea</b> <b>pickers</b> strike in May 1932. However, the union focused little on recruiting and organizing a large group of permanent members. Following the failures of these two strikes the CAWIU leaders realized the difficulty of establishing a solid agricultural labor movement around spontaneous and unplanned uprisings.|$|R

A twenty-five-cent pay cut meant that the next winter would be even worse...|$|R
