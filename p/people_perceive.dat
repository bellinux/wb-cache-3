5|$|Lastly, Asch {{suggested}} that group influence can change how <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example). This {{is the most}} obscure of Asch's major ideas, {{in large part because}} it has not been cited frequently (Levine, 1999), but is none-the-less important because it speaks to the power of group influence.|$|E
5|$|Living {{things like}} orchids, hummingbirds, and the peacock's tail have {{abstract}} designs with a beauty of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match. The beauty that <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> in nature has causes at different levels, {{notably in the}} mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living things in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{continued}} his experiments on perception, branching into studies on pseudoscopic vision, stereoscopic acuity, eye movements, symmetry and visual illusions, how <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> depth seeing surroundings either one-eyed or two-eyed, acuity {{and limits of}} peripheral vision, apparent motion, afterimages impressed on the eye when a person stares at an object for long and then looks away, and problems with sight in half the visual field (hemianopsia). He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement {{was more than the}} sum of seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E

25|$|Changes {{in the way}} <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> {{attachment}} tend {{to occur}} with {{changes in the way}} <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> support. One study looked at college students' perceptions of attachment to their mothers, fathers, same-sex friends, and opposite-sex friends and found that when students reported changes in attachment for a particular relationship, they usually reported changes in support for that relationship as well. Changes in attachment for one relationship did not affect the perception of support in other relationships. The link between changes in attachment and changes in support was relationship-specific.|$|E
25|$|Judgments of {{numerical}} {{differences are}} anchored on left-most digits, a behavioral phenomenon {{referred to as}} the left-digit anchoring effect. This hypothesis suggests that <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> the difference between 1.99 and 3.00 to be closer to 2.01 than to 1.01 because their judgments are anchored on the left-most digit.|$|E

Together, they have given the English language a dominant role in many sectors of the modern world. In addition to the Special Relationship between the {{two countries}}, most British <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> the U.S. positively, with the U.S. coming {{in the top three}} of polls consistently; according to a 2015 Gallup poll, 90% of Americans view the United Kingdom favourably.|$|E
25|$|The {{prospect}} of memory erasure or alteration raises ethical issues. Some of these concern identity, as memory seems {{to play a}} role in how <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> themselves. For example, if a traumatic memory were erased, a person might still remember related events in their lives, such as their emotional reactions to later experiences. Without the original memory to give them context, these remembered events might prompt the subjects to see themselves as emotional or irrational people. In the United States, the President's Council on Bioethics devoted a chapter in its October 2003 report Beyond Therapy to the issue. The report discourages the use of drugs that blunt the effect of traumatic memories, warning against treating human emotional reactions to life events as a medical issue.|$|E
25|$|At low refresh rates (60Hz and below), the {{periodic}} scanning {{of the display}} may produce a flicker that some <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> more easily than others, especially when viewed with peripheral vision. Flicker is commonly associated with CRT as most televisions run at 50Hz (PAL) or 60Hz (NTSC), {{although there are some}} 100Hz PAL televisions that are flicker-free. Typically only low-end monitors run at such low frequencies, with most computer monitors supporting at least 75Hz and high-end monitors capable of 100Hz or more to eliminate any perception of flicker. Non-computer CRTs or CRT for sonar or radar may have long persistence phosphor and are thus flicker free. If the persistence is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.|$|E

25|$|Contextual {{factors that}} are thought to {{contribute}} to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, {{with higher levels of}} anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences. Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. Interestingly enough, the difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.|$|E
25|$|According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, {{such that}} coolness {{is in the}} eye of the beholder. <b>People</b> <b>perceive</b> things (e.g., other people, {{products}} or brands) to be cool based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something is perceived to be cool when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.|$|E
25|$|Once one accepts The Matrix as a {{generated}} {{reality of}} malicious machines invention {{then this is}} Descartes' First Meditation, or evil demon, a hypothesis that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise {{can be found in}} Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. One can make a connection between the premise of The Matrix and Plato's Allegory of the Cave; once one accepts that The Matrix is an illusion, then the allegory of the cave becomes clear. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most <b>people</b> <b>perceive</b> only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.|$|E
40|$|As Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) {{have become}} {{established}} tools for communication, organizations increasingly use computer-mediated work groups to support various business processes and find creative solutions to organizational problems. In such a context, groups’ creative performance can greatly contribute to organizational success. Previous literature {{has examined the}} influence of various factors on different outcomes of group collaboration. However, mechanisms through which creativity can be improved, and how to design ICT’s interfaces to increase creativity have received little attention. In this study, we aim to understand the effects of two specific motivational affordances, namely, performance targets and performance feedback, on <b>people’s</b> <b>perceived</b> competence and creativity {{within the context of}} computer-mediated collaboration. Using computer-mediated idea generation as an instantiation of collaboration systems, we test the effects of performance targets and different types of feedback on <b>people’s</b> <b>perceived</b> competence and creativity in a controlled laboratory experiment. Our results show that the difficulty of performance targets and the type of performance feedback interact, influencing <b>people’s</b> <b>perceived</b> competence, which in turn influences their creativity in group collaboration. We conclude our study with a discussion of implications for the design of human–computer interfaces for computer-mediated idea generation...|$|R
