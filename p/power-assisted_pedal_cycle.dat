5000|$|In New Zealand, the {{regulations}} read: [...] "AB (<b>Power-assisted</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>cycle)</b> A pedal cycle to which is attached {{one or more}} auxiliary propulsion motors having a combined maximum power output not exceeding 300 watts." [...] This is explained by NZTA as [...] "A power-assisted cycle is a cycle that has a motor of up to 300 watts. The law treats these as ordinary cycles rather than motorcycles. This means {{that it is not}} necessary to register or license them. Note that the phrase [...] "maximum power output" [...] that is found in the regulation (but omitted in the explanation) may create confusion because some e-bike motor manufacturers advertise and print on the motor their [...] "maximum input power" [...] because that number is larger (typically motors run at about 80% efficiency [...] ) thus give the impression the buyer is getting a more powerful motor. This can cause misunderstandings with law enforcement officers who do not necessarily understand the difference, and when stopping a rider on an e-bike in a traffic stop, look at the number on the motor to determine if the e-bike is legal or not.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the current}} {{investigation}} was to utilize a musculoskeletal simulation approach to resolve muscle forces during the <b>pedal</b> <b>cycle,</b> in order to specifically {{examine the effects of}} chainring geometry on patellofemoral loading during cycling. METHODS: Fifteen healthy male recreational cyclists rode a stationary cycle ergometer at a fixed cadence of 70 RPM in two chainring conditions (round and oval). Patellofemoral loading was explored using a musculoskeletal simulation and mathematical modelling approach. Differences between chainring conditions across the entire <b>pedal</b> <b>cycle</b> were examined using 1 -dimensional statistical parametric mapping and patellofemoral force experienced per 20 km was explored using a paired samples t-test. RESULTS: No significant (P> 0. 05) differences in patellofemoral force or stress were found throughout the <b>pedal</b> <b>cycle</b> between chainring conditions. It was also shown that no significant (P> 0. 05) differences in patellofemoral force per 20 km joint were evident (round 38576. 40 N/kg·s & oval = 35637. 00 N/kg·s). CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis found no effects of chainring geometry, on the forces experienced by the patellofemoral joint during the <b>pedal</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore factors that are {{associated}} with fatal and a small number of serious injury pedal cyclist crashes involving trucks that occurred in London between 2007 and 2011. Methods: Data were collected from police collision files for 53 crashes, 27 of which involved a truck (≥ 3. 5 tonnes) and a <b>pedal</b> <b>cycle.</b> A systematic case review approach was used to identify the infrastructure, vehicle road user and management factors that contributed to these crashes and injuries and how these factors interacted. Results: Trucks turning left conflicting with pedal cyclists traveling straight ahead was a common crash scenario. Key contributory factors identified included the pedal cyclists not being visible to the truck drivers, road narrowing and inappropriate positioning of pedal cyclists. Conclusions: Crashes involving trucks and pedal cyclists are complex events that are caused by multiple interacting factors therefore multiple measures are required to prevent them from occurring...|$|R
