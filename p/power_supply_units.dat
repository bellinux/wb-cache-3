40|$|A {{device for}} the AC switch-on {{limitation}} of an inductive <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> (1) features {{a set of}} primary electrical AC power switches (23, 45) connected in series and a phase control circuit which enables {{the connection between the}} primary winding (4) and the AC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (25, 26) which is delayed after the instant of switch-on. The control electrode (44, 45) of the initial electrical AC power switch (23) of the phase control circuit with <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> backup (30) is connected to the output of a control circuit which enables a synchronized igniting voltage to be generated when the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> (1) is switched on from a preset (60, 61) phase angle of between 90 and 0 degrees before a zero crossing (115) of the AC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (2, 25, 26). The igniting voltage can be suppressed in order to switch off the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> (1) prior to reaching a zero crossing (115) of the AC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (2, 25, 26). A capacitor (86) connected in parallel with the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> (1) enables the remanence to be set before switch-on and after switch-off so that the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> (1) can be switched on under any conditions without the risk of an inrush peak current in excess of the load current...|$|R

50|$|The Aurora R1 (Discontinued) - This {{model was}} based on the Intel's X58 {{platform}} (LGA 1366 Socket). It shared identical hardware with the Aurora ALX R1.

Sealed liquid cooling units for the processors came factory installed. The X58 platform also uses Intel Xeon Processors, but none were used in the Aurora. The R1 used triple channel Memory and had Dedicated Graphics Card options from AMD's HD 5000 series line as well as Nvidia GeForce 400 Series and Nvidia GeForce 500 Series line. <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> options included a 525 watt <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>Unit,</b> 875 watt <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>Unit</b> and a 1000W <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>Unit.</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> and Motherboard supports both SLI and CrossfireX.|$|R
