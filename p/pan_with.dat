The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program for that period. It {{was so successful}} that NBC restaged it as a live {{broadcast a}} mere ten months later; in 1960, long after Producers' Showcase had ended its run, Peter <b>Pan,</b> <b>with</b> most of the 1955 cast, was restaged again, this time as a standalone special, and was videotaped {{so that it would}} no longer have to be performed live on television.|$|E

25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce <b>pan</b> <b>with</b> {{a small amount of}} water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E

Centuries ago, Lo Pan, a great warrior and even greater wizard, was defeated in battle by the first sovereign emperor, Qin Shi Huang.
