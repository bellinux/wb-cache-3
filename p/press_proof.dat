50|$|Since {{the first}} days of Johannes Gutenberg, {{proofing}} has just been press proofs - one makes a short run on the press in order to verify {{what is to be done}} on a production run. As technology evolved to lower the per-copy cost of a printing job, the cost of starting a production run continued to rise. Today, it can be very costly to start up a production press, and thus it is cost-prohibitive to run a <b>press</b> <b>proof.</b> While some people may think a <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> is the ultimate proof quality, this is not necessarily so, especially if the production run is done days or weeks later when press conditions may have changed, or the production run is done on a different press than the <b>press</b> <b>proof.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Press</b> <b>proof</b> {{is a test}} {{print of}} the data {{directly}} on a printing press. This can be the press for the production run or a comparable press (using the same print technology) prepared especially for proof purposes. Short runs of 50 or 100 copies can be produced more cost-effectively than with other color proof processes. The individual proof is, however, hardly economically justifiable.|$|E

40|$|Halftone gravure {{has become}} the {{accepted}} front end imaging procedure for the publication gravure industry. Halftone gravure refers to using screened or halftone film when imaging a gravure cylinder.

Therefore, the possibilities of an allowable color tolerance between a halftone gravure print and a SWOP standard offset <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> in hue, saturation, and brightness needed to be studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether an allowable color tolerance could be achieved between the gravure production print and the SWOP standard offset <b>press</b> <b>proof.</b> The experimental design involved the research of the effects of clear extender varnish modifications of gravure inks used to produce an allowable color tolerance between a gravure print and a SWOP standard offset <b>press</b> <b>proof.</b> It was important to compare the gravure print to the SWOP standard offset <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> because the publication gravure industry recognized the SWOP standard offset <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> as the standard or control parameter.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to quantitatively analyze off-press color {{proofing}} methods for advertising material appearing in halftone publication gravure printing. This type of proofing has been an area of debate for the publications industry, especially in reference to the print quality of advertising material. The correlation between dot gain characteristics and the resulting color differences of off-press color proofing methods has been the center of greatest controversy. This paper has tested to determine if a correlation exists between dot gain characteristics and the resulting colorimetric-matching ability for color proofing methods used in halftone publication gravure. The variable dot-gain feature of an electrophotographic proofing system was tested to determine if this feature improved the color matching ability of the off-press proof to the SWOP offset <b>press</b> <b>proof.</b> This system was analyzed by its 2 ̆ 7 ability to objectively match the SWOP offset <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> for dot gain aimpoints. These aimpoints are used as the quality control tool for advertising material appearing in both halftone gravure and web offset publications printing. The experiment concluded that the dot gain characteristic curve of the electrophotographic off-press proof could be altered to quantitatively match closer to the dot gain of an offset <b>press</b> <b>proof</b> printed to SWOP/GAA Specifications. However, the data did not completely support the authors 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis. A direct correlation between dot gain and the resulting delta E values could not be established. None of the data collected from the electrophotographic test sets completely proved that a change in dot gain produced a closer colorimetric match to the SWOP/GAA Offset <b>Press</b> <b>Proof...</b>|$|E

Here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band- 6 and Band- 7 observations of the transition disc Sz 91 showing that the continuum emission at 870 μm, which is dominated by emission from large dust grains, is localized in an optically thin narrow ring. We find {{that most of the}} emission (∼ 95 %) is concentrated in a ring located at 110 au from the central star that is only about 44 au wide. In contrast, the ^ 12 CO (2 - 1) emission peaks closer to the star and is detected up to ∼ 488 au from the star. The concentration of large grains in a ring-like structure while the gas disc extends much further in and further out is in qualitative agreement with predictions of hydrodynamical models of planet-disc interactions including radial drift and gas drag.

It is important to customers that the colors on a digitally printed proof will match the colors printed on an offset press. The Larry Brink Printing Laboratory at Western Michigan University uses a Xerox Docucolor 12 for printing proofs for a Shinohara offset press. This project examines digital color <b>proofing</b> the offset <b>press.</b> In order to accomplish this, an ICC profile target was printed on multiple substrates on the offset press and the digital printer.

The galaxy distributions in the inner regions of the clusters look similar to the X-ray intensity maps, suggesting {{that most of the}} optical structures trace physically bound systems. We also compared the structures of the three clusters with those of model clusters in a numerical simulation (N-body + semi-analytic model) by parameterising the shapes of the iso-density contours of galaxies, and found a broad agreement. Our results provide good evidence that cluster-scale assembly takes place along filaments during hierarchical clustering, while the structures found here need to be confirmed spectroscopically in the near future.

40|$|Contract {{proofing}} {{for printing}} has been traditionally done by press proofing. This is costly and wasteful, {{not just in}} terms of equipment and labor but also in terms of expendables. The advent of off-press proofing was greeted with some degree of uncertainty by the printing industry. With press proofing, the proof was literally a preview of what would happen on a press. The <b>press</b> <b>proof,</b> although often printed on a different press, generally used the same type of inks, plates and substrate that would characterize the final print. With offpress proofing, printers were comparing apples to oranges; instead of comparing a press sheet to a press sheet they were comparing a press sheet to an approximation of a press sheet. However, over time as printers learned to read off-press proofs, they became accepted as contract proofs. The same situation has now befallen digital proofs. In the particular case of flexography, the proofing problem is a bit different. Off-press analog proofs were designed with lithography in mind, they were characterized to simulate lithographic dot gain. In order to make a proof that looks like a flexographic press sheet, two sets of films are required; one which compensates for flexographic dot gain (this is the set from which the job would be printed) and one which has extra dot gain built into the highlight and quarter- tones (this is the set that the proof would be made from). This extra set of films is wasteful and time consuming to generate. Digital proofing seems to be well suited for flexography, because the dot gain can be built into the proofing system and no extra film is required to create the proof. At the most basic level {{there are two types of}} digital proofers available; those which simulate halftone dots and those that do not. Whether or not the dots are necessary is open to discussion, however, in the case of flexography the dots appear to be crucial. For this research document it was decided that the halftone dots were preferred. The reason for this is that at about 133 lpi the rosette patterns formed by halftone dots are at the threshold of resolution by the human eye. For more course screen rulings this is even more critical. Much of flexography is printed at screen rulings of 133 lpi or lower, so very often the dots can be resolved by the eye. Therefore, the mindset at the beginning of the research was that if the dots can be resolved on the press sheet then the dots should be resolved on the proof. The major thrust of this research was to observe whether or not a halftone-based digital proofer can simulate the appearance of a flexographic press sheet. A flexographic test form was created and printed on a film based substrate. A press sheet was sent to two vendors who manufacture halftone proofers. The proofing systems are not mentioned by name; they are instead referred to as Digital Proof A and B. They then attempted to match the press sheet as closely as possible. Thus, through reverse engineering, the vendors created a device profile for this set of printing conditions. Upon receipt of the proofs, they were compared to the press sheet in terms of optical density, hue (AE) and halftone dot size. Later, a visual assessment was executed to observe how closely the digital proofs matched the press sheet using a 3 M Matchprint, that had been altered to approximate flexography, as the reference or control proof. The results showed that there were significant differences between proof and press sheet in some instances and insignificant differences in others. In terms of the physical structure of the halftone dots, the 3 M Matchprint had the closest match to the press sheet dot structure. In terms of physical dot size; digital proof A best matched the 50 and 75 % dots and the Matchprint matched the 5 % dots the best. In terms of optical density; digital proof A best matched the density of the 25 % dots, digital proof B best matched the density of the 5 % dots and the Matchprint best matched the 50 and 75 % dot patches. In terms of AE values (color or hue difference); the Matchprint most closely matched the press sheet, digital proof B was next, and digital proof A was last. In terms of a visual match, the three proofs were found to be statistically equal in their ability to visually match the press sheet. The visual match being the most powerful of the criteria; shows that the measurable differences in the proofs did not directly affect their ability to match the press sheet. The results show that either of the two halftone digital proofs could have been used in place of the 3 M Matchprint. The results also question the need for halftone dots in a proof. This is primarily because the two halftone digital proofs utilized a different RIP than the Agfa generated films for the 3 M Matchprint and flexographic press sheet. Yet the visual observations made by the judges could not, at a normal viewing distance, discern this difference. The conclusion is that there is no visual difference between the halftone digital proofs and the 3 M Matchprint proof in terms of visually matching the press sheet...|$|E

On one hand, these technologies provide lower cost, high quality advertisement which target larger, more diverse audiences. On the other hand, the same technological innovations (high speed digital transmission, high quality input and output devices, and the widespread use of portable computing) have created a means for local newspapers to protect their advertising base and realize increased customer satisfaction through on-site interaction in early phases of ad development through remote data transmission.
