5|$|In {{addition}} to the specific amino acid codes, <b>placeholders</b> are used in cases where chemical or crystallographic analysis of a peptide or protein cannot conclusively determine {{the identity of a}} residue. They are also used to summarise conserved protein sequence motifs. The use of single letters to indicate sets of similar residues is similar to the use of abbreviation codes for degenerate bases.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} {{pieces were}} stolen {{at an estimated}} loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as <b>placeholders</b> for when they are returned. One of the paintings, The Concert, was Gardner's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It {{is thought to be}} the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting, with a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, is Rembrandt's only known seascape. The bronze finial was taken from the top of a Napoleonic flag, possibly appearing like gold to the thieves. The museum is offering a $100,000 reward for this piece alone.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the zero}} gravity scenes were handled by Pacific Data Images, while phaser beams and {{transporter}} effects were generated by Visual Concept Engineering, {{an offshoot of}} ILM that had contributed to The Wrath of Khan and The Final Frontier. Despite the overall count of effects shots being dropped from over 100 to 51, the project was still large, and required virtually the entire ILM staff to complete. Farrar's goal was to economize the remaining effects; if three shots were similar, {{they would try to}} tell the story with only one. Cheap animatics provided Meyer with <b>placeholders</b> to cut into the film and avoid costly surprises. Stock footage from previous films were used whenever possible, but it was often unfeasible to do so; as the original USS Enterprise had been destroyed in , all shots of the USS Enterprise-A had to feature the updated ship registry.|$|E

50|$|Tomasulo's Algorithm uses {{register}} renaming {{to correctly}} perform out-of-order execution. All general-purpose and reservation station registers hold either a real value or a <b>placeholder</b> value. If a real value is unavailable to a destination register during the issue stage, a <b>placeholder</b> value is initially used. The <b>placeholder</b> value is a tag indicating which reservation station will produce the real value. When the unit finishes and broadcasts the result on the CDB, the <b>placeholder</b> {{will be replaced}} with the real value.|$|R
5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as <b>placeholders</b> while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E
5|$|The stolen {{works were}} {{originally}} purchased by art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840â€“1924) and {{intended to be}} left on permanent display at the museum {{with the rest of}} her collection. Since the collection and its layout are permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as <b>placeholders</b> for when they are returned. Experts are puzzled by the choice of paintings that were stolen, especially since more valuable artwork was untouched. Among the stolen works was The Concert, one of only 34 known works by Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting at over $200 million. Also missing is The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, Rembrandt's only known seascape. Other works by Rembrandt, Degas, Manet, and Flinck were also stolen.|$|E

25|$|Self-paced reading: The {{participants}} {{are faced with}} a screen, on which a text appears in successive segment. They are asked to process each sequent segment by pressing a key. A trial starts with the presentation of groups of dashes separated by spaces. Each group serving as a placeholder for a word in the text, which is to be presented on that trial and each dash representing a letter. When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, say the first two words, replacing the corresponding <b>placeholders</b> for the right words, while the <b>placeholders</b> for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, the two words from the first segment are replaced by their <b>placeholders</b> again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding <b>placeholders.</b> This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. The interval between the two successive key presses is measured and registered as the response time.|$|E

25|$|Leading and {{trailing}} zeroes are {{not significant}} because they exist only {{to show the}} scale of the number. Therefore, 1,230,400 usually has five significant figures: 1, 2, 3, 0, and 4; the final two zeroes serve only as <b>placeholders</b> and add no precision to the original number.|$|E

25|$|Since February 2017, Microsoft {{has been}} in the process of {{migrating}} Microsoft Windows development to Git, migrating from Perforce. In order to handle the size of the Windows source code tree, Microsoft was required to develop customizations to the software, including Git Virtual File System (GVFS), a system which allows cloned repositories to use <b>placeholders</b> whose contents are downloaded only once a file is accessed.|$|E
25|$|An {{accurate}} and comprehensive {{history of the}} revolution has proven difficult to compile {{for a number of}} reasons. There are no contemporary accounts, and most sources were written more than a century after the revolution. Because most historical sources were written under Abbasid rule, the description of the Umayyads must be taken with a grain of salt; such sources describe the Umayyads, at best, as merely <b>placeholders</b> between the Rashidun and Abbasid Caliphates.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} when processing death certificates {{to confuse the}} date of birth and date of death fields, which would increase the apparent number of certificates in which these coincide. Additionally, where the exact date is not known, the 1st and 15th of the month are often used as <b>placeholders.</b> These will cause an excess of births and deaths recorded on these dates. However studies also find changes in the mortality rate in the days immediately before and after (which {{are unlikely to be}} caused by data processing anomalies), which suggests that statistical artifacts alone cannot explain the birthday effect.|$|E
25|$|Windows Media Player 11 {{features}} a revised interface. Media Library is now presented without the category trees which were {{prominent in the}} earlier versions. Rather, on selecting the category in the left pane, the contents appear on the right, in a graphical manner with thumbnailsâ€”a departure from textual presentation of information. Missing album art can be added directly to the <b>placeholders</b> in the Library itself (though the program re-renders all album art imported this way into 1:1 pixel ratio, 200x200 resolution JPEG images). Views for Music, Pictures, Video and Recorded TV are separate and can be chosen individually from the navigation bar. Entries for Pictures and Video show their thumbnails. Search has been upgraded to be much faster.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of his {{appointment}} to the bench, the position was seen as particularly risky, because it was a clear representation of anti-British authority whose <b>placeholders</b> were thought to be risking their lives should the British succeed in putting down the rebellion. [...] The most noteworthy case Sullivan sat on was a preliminary hearing in Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison, one of the Quock Walker cases where the court in 1783 decided that slavery was incompatible with the state constitution.
