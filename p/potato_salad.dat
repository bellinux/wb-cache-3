500|$|When in England {{and not on}} a mission, Bond dines {{as simply}} as Fleming did on dishes such as grilled sole, oeufs en cocotte and cold roast beef with <b>potato</b> <b>salad.</b> When on a mission, however, Bond eats more extravagantly. This was partly because in 1953, when Casino Royale was published, many items of food were still rationed in the UK, and Bond was [...] "the ideal {{antidote}} to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power".
