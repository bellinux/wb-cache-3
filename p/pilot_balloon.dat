50|$|In {{its basic}} (standard) version, the {{laryngeal}} tube {{is made up}} of a tube with a larger balloon cuff in the middle (oropharyngeal cuff) and a smaller balloon cuff at the end (oesophageal cuff). The tube is kinked at an angle of 30-45° in the middle; the kink is located in the larger cuff. There are two apertures, located between the two cuffs, through which ventilation takes place. Both cuffs are inflated through a single small lumen line and <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon.</b> The cuffs are high-volume, low-pressure cuffs with inflating volume ranging from 10 ml (size 0) to 90 ml (size 5). A large bore syringe, which is marked with the required volume for each size, is used to inflate the cuffs. A cuff inflator can also be used, in which case the cuffs should be inflated to a pressure of 60 cm H2O. Three black lines on the tube indicate the depth of insertion when aligned with the teeth.|$|E

5000|$|The Sky Anchor system, {{originally}} developed at Texas A&M University in 1976, is usually applied to unmanned balloons, {{but the concept}} was also applied to a <b>piloted</b> <b>balloon.</b> The [...] "Earthwinds" [...] balloon system used a tandem balloon arrangement for a planned circumnavigation record attempt using the jet stream winds.

50|$|During the flight, the pilot's only {{ability to}} steer the balloon {{is the ability to}} climb or descend into winds going {{different}} directions. Thus, {{it is important for the}} pilot to determine what direction the wind is blowing at altitudes other than the balloon's altitude. To do this, the pilot uses a variety of techniques. For example, to determine wind directions beneath the balloon a pilot might simply spit or release a squirt of shaving cream and watch this indicator as it falls to determine where possible turns are (and their speed). Pilots are also looking for other visual clues such as flags on flagpoles, smoke coming from chimneys, etc. To determine wind directions above the balloon, the pilot will obtain a weather forecast prior to the flight which includes upper level wind forecasts. The pilot will also send up a helium <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon,</b> known as a met-balloon in the UK and pibal in the USA, prior to launch to get information about what the wind is actually doing. Another way to determine actual wind directions is to watch other hot air balloons, which are the equivalent of a large met-balloon.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: An intact <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> {{is crucial}} to proper {{function}} of a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT). Failure of the <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> or disruption of the inflation tubing results in cuff deflation which may lead to inadequate ventilation and aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions.

40|$|We have {{assessed}} {{the feasibility of}} retrograde nasotracheal intubation using a flexometallic tracheal tube with a detachable <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> and connector {{in a study of}} 20 consecutive adult patients undergoing oropharyngeal surgery. The technique consisted of: (1) laryngostope-guided orotracheal intubation; (2) insertion of an 18 -gauge Foley catheter through the nose and retraction into the mouth; (3) detachment of the anaesthesia circuit, <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> and connector; (4) insertion of the Foley catheter tip into the proximal end of the tracheal tube and inflation of the Foley catheter cuff; (5) withdrawal of the Foley catheter and attached tracheal tube back through the nose; (6) deflation of the Foley catheter cuff; and (7) reattachment of the <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon,</b> connector and anaesthesia circuit. The technique was successful at the first attempt in all patients. Mean time taken to insert the Foley catheter and retract it into the mouth was 19 (range 12 - 30) s. Mean time taken from disconnection to reconnection of the anaesthesia circuit was 8 (6 - 10) s. Heart rate increased after intubation, but there were no significant changes in arterial pressure. Nasal bleeding, airway problems and hypoxic events did not occur. No anatomical abnormalities or nasal trauma were detected at rhinoscopy. We conclude that retrograde nasotracheal intubation is feasible using a flexometallic tracheal tube with a detachable <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> and connector...|$|E

50|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{theodolite}} use in measuring winds aloft, by using specially-manufactured theodolites to track the horizontal and vertical angles of special weather balloons called ceiling <b>balloons,</b> or <b>pilot</b> <b>balloons</b> or pibal. Early attempts at this were made in the opening years of the nineteenth century, but the instruments and procedures weren't fully developed until a hundred years later.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s in situ {{observations}} (land and sea surface observations, upper air observations by radiosondes, <b>pilot</b> <b>balloons,</b> wind profilers, and aircraft observations) on the short-term forecast skill provided by the ACCESS (Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator) global numerical weather prediction (NWP) system is evaluated using an adjoint-based method. This technique makes use of the adjoint perturbation forecast model utilized within the 4 D-Var assimilation system, {{and is able to}} calculate the individual impact of each assimilated observation in a cycling NWP system. The results obtained show that synoptic observations account for about 60 % of the 24 -h forecast error reduction, with the remainder accounted for by aircraft (12. 8 %), radiosondes (10. 5 %), wind profilers (3. 9 %), <b>pilot</b> <b>balloons</b> (2. 8 %), buoys (1. 7 %) and ships (1. 2 %). In contrast, the largest impact per observation is from buoys and aircraft. Overall, all observation types {{have a positive impact on}} the 24 -h forecast skill. Such results help to support the decision-making process regarding the evolution of the observing network, particularly at the national level. Consequently, this 4 D-Var-based approach has great potential as a tool to assist the design and running of an efficient and effective observing network...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> design {{on the ability of}} {{experienced}} anaesthetists to assess and inflate tracheal tube cuffs to safe pressures. A model trachea was designed, incorporating a degree of compliance and an air leak, to evaluate six different pilot balloons grafted onto identical tracheal tubes. Pilot balloons were inflated to one of four pressures and anaesthetists were asked to estimate whether the pressure was acceptable, too low or too high. Anaesthetists were then asked to inflate the cuff of each tube. Overall, 103 (42. 9 %) of anaesthetists' assessments of tracheal tube cuff pressures were correct (33 % correct would be expected by chance, p = 0. 002). Pressures generated by anaesthetists inflating tracheal tube cuffs were very variable. Median (IQR [range]) pressures for each <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> ranged from 29 (17 - 43 [9 - 56]) cmH(2) O to 74 (49 - 114 [4 - 140]) cmH(2) O (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Estimation of cuff {{pressure}} by palpating the <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> is not accurate {{to determine the}} cuff pressure of endotracheal tube (ETT). Hence, this study we conducted to compare the accuracy of indirect measurements between <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> palpation method (MP) and passive release technique (MSP). This was a single blind randomized crossover study performed in june 2014 at Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung, in which patients received each technique and as a control group. Subjects were 94 patients aged 18 − 65 years old with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I−III who underwent surgery requiring tracheal intubation. These subjects were randomized into two groups. After induction of anesthesia, the cuff was inflated with two different techniques: <b>pilot</b> <b>balloon</b> palpation technique (n= 48) and passive release technique (n= 46). Data were statistically analyzed using independent t-test and chi-square test. The mean cuff pressures of group MP was 57. 7 ± 26. 0 cmH 2 O and for group MSP was 28. 7 ± 4. 5 cmH 2 O, whereas the precision of measurements in the MSP group was 56. 5 % and 6. 2 % in the MP group (p< 0. 001). It is conclude that the palpation method for cuff inflation are inadequate. Therefore, {{it is suggested that}} the endotracheal tube cuff pressure must be kept within the optimal range using a standard manometer...|$|E
