6000|$|One of {{the last}} scuffles I {{remember}} of Olaf's having with his refractory heathens, was at a Thing in Hordaland or Rogaland, far in the North, where the chief opposition hero was one Jaernskaegg ("ironbeard") Scottice ("Airn-shag," [...] as it were!). Here again was a grand heathen temple, Hakon Jarl's building, with a splendid Thor in it and much idol furniture. The king stated what was his constant wish here as elsewhere, but had no sooner entered upon the subject of Christianity than universal murmur, rising into clangor and violent dissent, interrupted him, and Ironbeard took up the discourse in reply. Ironbeard did not break down; on the contrary, he, with great brevity, emphasis, and clearness, signified [...] "that the <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> their old gods was in the highest degree unacceptable to this Thing; that it was contrary to bargain, withal; so {{that if it were}} insisted on, they would have to fight with the king about it; and in fact were now ready to do so." [...] In reply to this, Olaf, without word uttered, but merely with some signal to the trusty armed men he had with him, rushed off to the temple close at hand; burst into it, shutting the door behind him; smashed Thor and Co. to destruction; then reappearing victorious, found much confusion outside, and, in particular, what was a most important item, the rugged Ironbeard done to death by Olaf's men in the interim. Which entirely disheartened the Thing from fighting at that moment; having now no leader who dared to head them in so dangerous an enterprise. So that every one departed to digest his rage in silence as he could.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{political}} <b>proposals</b> had attempted <b>to</b> address the growing discrepancy whereby Italians {{made a significant}} contribution to Rome's military force, while receiving disproportionately small shares of land and citizenship rights. These efforts came to a head under the impetus of Marcus Livius Drusus in 91 BC. His reforms would have granted the Roman allies Roman citizenship, giving them a greater say in the external policy of the Roman Republic. Most local affairs came under local governance and were not as important to the Romans as, for example, when the alliance would go to war or how they would divide the plunder. The response of the Roman senatorial elite <b>to</b> Drusus' <b>proposals</b> was <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> his ideas and assassinate him. This brusque dismissal of the granting of rights that the Italians considered to be long overdue greatly angered them, and communities throughout Italy attempted to declare independence from Rome in response, sparking a war.|$|R

40|$|Maximally stable extremal regions (MSER), {{which is}} a popular method to {{generate}} character proposals/candidates, has shown superior performance in scene text detection. However, the pixel-level operation limits its capability for handling some challenging cases (e. g., multiple connected characters, separated parts of one character and non-uniform illumination). To better tackle these cases, we design a character proposal network (CPN) {{by taking advantage of}} the high capacity and fast computing of fully convolutional network (FCN). Specifically, the network simultaneously predicts characterness scores and refines the corresponding locations. The characterness scores can be used for <b>proposal</b> ranking <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> non-character <b>proposals</b> and the refining process aims to obtain the more accurate locations. Furthermore, considering the situation that different characters have different aspect ratios, we propose a multi-template strategy, designing a refiner for each aspect ratio. The extensive experiments indicate our method achieves recall rates of 93. 88 %, 93. 60 % and 96. 46 % on ICDAR 2013, SVT and Chinese 2 k datasets respectively using less than 1000 proposals, demonstrating promising performance of our character proposal network...|$|R
50|$|The first well-sampled {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study of}} the vittarioids {{was based on the}} chloroplast gene rbcL.

A later molecular phylogeny, published in 2016, established the genus Antrophyopsis (formerly a subgenus of Antrophyum) for three species placed in Scoliosorus but more distant from the type of that genus than Antrophyum.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to offer a {{response}} {{to the question of how}} it is that a hearer can get knowledge from testimony. The project has two main components. The first is to suggest that the obstacle to getting knowledge through testimony (the obstacle of epistemic vulnerability) is one that can be ignored. The second is to set out how it is that mere communication could be sufficient to explain how testimony can be a source of knowledge. The first component constitutes a <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> the problem of testimony as it is usually conceived. Testimony is often seen to be epistemically distinct and interesting because of the apparent epistemic vulnerability posed by its being an indirect source of knowledge. Viewing the problem in this way has led most epistemologists to set out on a project of justification: the challenge is to explain how it is that hearing an assertion can be sufficient grounds for coming to know what is asserted. Whether one is a reductionist or a non-reductionist, the aim has been to establish that essential link between hearing a speaker assert that p, and p's being true. I will argue that seeing the problem of testimony as one of epistemic vulnerability is only inevitable if one has a particular view of knowledge. If we take knowledge to be a state metaphysically distinct from belief, a state not dependent on its justification to establish it as knowledge, then the indirectness of testimony does not inevitably result in a problem of vulnerability. The second component constitutes a positive explanation for the possibility of knowledge through testimony. I argue that (rather than seeking to justify our testimony-based beliefs) we ought to try to understand the mechanism whereby knowledge can be made available to a hearer simply by understanding an assertion. In this endeavour, I propose a certain theory of communication, such that understanding a communicative utterance entails coming to recognise the speaker's actual mental state. If successful communication gives the hearer access to the speaker's actual mental state, then successful communication can explain how understanding an assertion that p can get a hearer to know that p. I argue that correctly understanding an assertion that p entails coming to know that p. I defend the idea that the institution of communication explains how knowledge through testimony is possible...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} new {{detection}} strategy for gravitational waves (GWs) below few Hertz {{based on a}} correlated array of atom interferometers (AIs). Our <b>proposal</b> allows <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> the Newtonian Noise (NN) which limits all ground based GW detectors below few Hertz, including previous atom interferometry-based concepts. Using an array of long baseline AI gradiometers yields several estimations of the NN, whose effect can thus be reduced via statistical averaging. Considering the km baseline of current optical detectors, a NN rejection of factor 2 could be achieved, and tested with existing AI array geometries. Exploiting the correlation properties of the gravity acceleration noise, we show that a 10 -fold or more NN rejection is possible with a dedicated configuration. Considering a conservative NN model and the current developments in cold atom technology, we show that strain sensitivities below 1 × 10 ^- 19 /√(Hz) in the 0. 3 - 3 Hz frequency band can be within reach, with a peak sensitivity of 3 × 10 ^- 23 /√(Hz) at 2 Hz.

500|$|The first Soviet {{atomic bomb}} test in August 1949 was {{embarrassing}} to the British (who {{had not expected}} a Soviet atomic weapon until 1954) for having been beaten, but {{it was for the}} Americans another reason for cooperation. The agreement on raw materials was due to expire {{at the end of the}} year. The Americans offered to make bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to end their atomic bomb programme. This offer was rejected on the grounds that it was not [...] "compatible with our status as a first class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance." [...] Instead, the British suggested that there would be a full exchange of atomic information, and in return for ending the production of atomic bombs in Britain, American bombs would be stored in Britain under British control. This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952. The opposition of several key officials, including the United States Atomic Energy Commission's Lewis Strauss, and Senators Bourke B. Hickenlooper and Arthur Vandenberg, coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of Fuchs, who was working at Harwell, as a Soviet spy, caused the <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> be <b>rejected.</b>|$|R

40|$|Are {{the special}} {{sciences}} autonomous from physics? Those {{who say they}} are need to explain how dependent special science properties could feature in irreducible causal explanations, but that’s no easy task. The demands of a broadly physicalist worldview require that such properties are not only dependent on the physical, but also physically realized. Realized properties are derivative, so it’s natural to suppose that they have derivative causal powers. Correspondingly, philosophical orthodoxy has it that if we want special science properties to bestow genuinely new causal powers, we must reject physical realization and embrace a form of emergentism, in which such properties arise from the physical by mysterious brute determination. In this paper, I argue that contrary to this orthodoxy, there are physically realized properties that bestow new causal powers in relation to their realizers. The key <b>to</b> my <b>proposal</b> is <b>to</b> <b>reject</b> causal-functional accounts of realization and embrace a broader account that allows for the realization of shapes and patterns. Unlike functional properties, such properties are defined by qualitative, non-causal specifications, so realizing them does not consist in bestowing causal powers. This, I argue, allows for causal novelty of the strongest kind. I argue that the molecular geometry of H 2 O—a qualitative, multiply realizable property—plays an irreducible role in explaining its dipole moment, and thereby bestows novel powers. On my proposal, special science properties can have the kind of causal novelty traditionally associated with strong emergence, without any of the mystery...|$|R

The population consists of individuals having distinct social ranks which {{is determined by}} the individual's resource holding potential. Each member of the population is interested in gaining access to a food resource, either individually or via a coalition. At any given stage of the game, a player can either propose a specific coalition or he can be proposed to in order to join one. Hence, the strategy of a player consists of a sequence of decisions regarding who to propose to for the formation of a coalition and which <b>proposals</b> <b>to</b> accept or <b>reject.</b> We derive the preferences of the players over the various coalition structures under the assumption that the probability of a coalition to obtain the resource is given by a logistic distribution as a function of relative strengths of the players.
