5000|$|The Morrill Tariff Act of March 2, 1861, {{signed into}} law by President Buchanan, {{authorized}} the Secretary of the Treasury to issue six percent interest Treasury Notes if he was unable to issue previously authorized bonds at par. [...] Sixty-day and two-year notes were issued, <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>order,</b> receivable in payment of all debts due to the United States, and exchangeable for bonds at par.

The only exception is that if an instrument meets the definition of a cheque (a bill of exchange payable on demand and drawn on a bank) and is not <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> (i.e. if it just reads [...] "pay John Doe") then it is treated as a negotiable instrument.|$|E

[...] These notes were <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> <b>order,</b> but the Treasury would issue them in blank form if requested. Secretary of the Treasury Chase suggested this rate of interest in hopes that the ease of interest calculation (a $50 note would accrue {{interest at}} one cent per day) would allow the notes to circulate as money, but apparently this did not prove to be the case. [...] Further issues of Seven-Thirties were made in 1864 and 1865.

60|$|What Sir Harry {{did with}} Captain Stubber {{need not be}} {{minutely}} described. There {{can be no doubt}} that Cousin George was not spared by the Captain, and that when he understood what might be the result of telling the truth, he told all that he knew. In that matter of the £500 Cousin George had really been ill-treated. The payment had done him no sort of service whatever. Of Captain Stubber's interview with Sir Harry nothing further need now be said. But it must be explained that Sir Harry, led astray by defective information, made a mistake in regard to Mrs. Morton, and found out his mistake. He did not much like Mrs. Morton, but he did not leave her without an ample apology. From Mrs. Morton he learned nothing whatever in regard to Cousin George,--nothing but this, that Mrs. Morton did not deny that she was acquainted with Captain Hotspur. Mr. Boltby had learned, however, that Cousin George had drawn the money for a cheque <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> her <b>order,</b> and he had made himself nearly certain of the very nature of the transaction.|$|R

Lady Byron wrote to an [...] intermediate person exactly what she thought of the case. Whether the [...] judgment of the sufferer was right or mistaken was nobody's business [...] but her own: this was the first point. Next, a voluntary poverty [...] could never be pitied by anybody: that was the second.

The notes and mortgage were afterwards transferred by Harris to Charles Morgan. The mortgage was still in force, when on January 20, 1865, the United States filed, in Louisiana District Court, a libel of information against the property, to condemn it as confiscated under the Act of July 17, 1862, 12 Stat. 589, entitled [...] "An act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes".

5000|$|A Treasury Note {{is a type}} {{of short}} term debt {{instrument}} issued by the United States prior {{to the creation of the}} Federal Reserve System in 1913. Without the alternatives offered by a federal paper money or a central bank, the U.S. government relied on these instruments for funding during periods of financial stress such as the War of 1812, the Panic of 1837, and the American Civil War. While the Treasury Notes, as issued, were neither legal tender nor representative money, some issues were used as money in lieu of an official federal paper money. However the motivation behind their issuance was always funding federal expenditures rather than the provision of a circulating medium. These notes typically were hand-signed, of large denomination (at least $50), of large dimension (bigger than private banknotes), bore interest, were <b>payable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>order</b> of the owner (whose name was written on the front of the note), and matured in no more than three years - though some issues lacked one or more of these properties. Often they were receivable at face value by the government in payment of taxes and for purchases of publicly owned land, and thus [...] "might to some extent be regarded as paper money." [...] On many issues the interest rate was chosen to make interest calculations particularly easy, paying either 1, 1½, or 2 cents per day on a $100 note.|$|R
