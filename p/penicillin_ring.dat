5000|$|He {{draws an}} analogy between human {{progress}} {{and the growth}} of bacteria that suggests that humanity has been bred in certain strains for various traits (e.g. artistic ability) and that such breeding is what produced the Athens of Pericles and the Renaissance. He further states that the experimenters use a <b>penicillin</b> <b>ring,</b> or killing boundary, that makes humans want to kill each other should their abilities grow too great, as mental increase leads to greater [...] "infectivity," [...] and humanity is dangerous to the experimenters. The most recent strain began with the Industrial Revolution, and its development for over a century has made it extremely dangerous. Therefore, the theoretical experimenters intend to use the atomic bomb to incite industrialized nations to kill each other. He claims that the aliens are exerting pressure on his mind to kill himself before he can help produce a defence against atomic weapons, since such a defence would protect humanity against a planned extinction {{at the hands of the}} aliens.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{efficient}} completion of RDX synthesis, John Sheehan {{had the experience}} of applying organic chemistry to real-life problems. Having struggled against pneumonia and mastoiditis in his earlier years, Sheehan was eager to start working on antibiotics. He wrote, [...] "If my doctors had had a course of treatment as effective as that made possible by penicillin, I would probably not have lost that year." [...] In 1941, he accepted a position at Merck & Co. in Rahway, New Jersey. He worked there until 1946 as a senior research chemist under the supervision of Dr. Max Tishler. Sheehan had good results for his work on many projects, including those on calcium pantothenate, streptomycin, and vitamin B6. However, he wanted to pursue the synthesis of penicillin, which was hard in an industrial setting driven by results given that many scientists of his time believed that it was impossible. John Sheehan's work attracted the attention of Arthur C. Cope, who {{was the head of the}} Department of Chemistry at the M.I.T. at the time. He decided to join the M.I.T. faculty as an assistant professor at a salary that was half of what he made at Merck. Within his first few years at M.I.T., John Sheehan was already recognized for his ingenuity in synthetic organic chemistry, especially for his new methods of synthesis of peptides, three new syntheses of β-lactams, first synthesis of the <b>penicillin</b> <b>ring</b> system, and his work on several other natural products.|$|E
40|$|Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase from Streptomyces clavuligerus catalyses the {{conversion}} of the five-membered <b>penicillin</b> <b>ring</b> to the unsaturated six-membered cephem ring of deacetoxycephalosporin C. The effects on enzyme activity of the penicillin substrate sidechain and various cofactors were investigated using a continuous spectrophotometric assay. The conversion of penicillin G to phenylacetyl- 7 -aminodeacetoxycephalo sporanic acid (G- 7 -ADCA) was confirmed, and further details of the reaction were elucidated. The conversion of ampicillin to cephalexin was faster than that of acetyl- 6 -APA to acetyl- 7 -ADCA kcat = 0. 120 +/- 0. 001 s(- 1) versus 0. 035 +/- 0. 001 s(- 1), but they had similar Km values: 4. 86 +/- 0. 12 and 3. 28 +/- 0. 26 mM, respectively. Amoxycillin and penicillin V were also converted at low levels. Conversion was not detected for penicillanate, 6 -aminopenicillanate, carbenicillin, temocillin, ticarcillin or benzylpenicilloic acid, suggesting that the enzyme has a relatively strict selectivity for the sidechain of the penicillin substrate...|$|E
40|$|Using resting {{cells and}} {{extracts}} of Streptomyces clavuligerus NP 1, {{we have been}} able to convert penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) to deacetoxycephalosporin G. Conversion was achieved by increasing by 45 × the concentration of FeSO 4 (1. 8 mM) and doubling the concentration of α-ketoglutarate (1. 28 mM) as compared with standard conditions used for the normal cell-free conversion of penicillin N to deacetoxycephalosporin C. ATP, MgSO 4, KCl, and DTT, important in cell-free expansion of penicillin N, did not play a significant role in the <b>ring</b> expansion of <b>penicillin</b> G by resting cells or cell-free extracts.

40|$|An ion-pair, reversed-phase, {{high-pressure}} liquid chromatographic {{method for}} the analysis of <b>penicillin</b> N <b>ring</b> expansion activity has been developed which allows simultaneous measurement of both substrate and product. The high-pressure liquid chromatography conditions were as follows: stationary phase, C 18; flow rate, 2 ml/min; detection, 220 nm. The stationary phase was preconditioned with 4. 5 mM tetrabutylammonium bromide in 0. 05 M KH 2 PO 4 (pH 4. 0) -methanol (85 : 15, vol/vol) and then equilibrated with 0. 06 mM tetrabutylammonium bromide in 0. 05 M KH 2 PO 4 (pH 4. 0) -methanol (95 : 5, vol/vol) for analysis of reaction mixtures. These conditions separated authentic samples of penicillin N and desacetoxycephalosporin C and allowed cell-free studies of the <b>ring</b> expansion of <b>penicillin</b> N to desacetoxycephalosporin C by a partially purified enzyme from Streptomyces clavuligerus to be followed conveniently...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of penicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, {{changed the way}} humans thought about infectious disease. Unfortunately, {{the widespread use of}} antibiotics has lead to a concomitant increase in bacterial resistance to these drugs. One of the most common mechanisms of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics is mediated through the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by beta-lactamases. In order to combat resistance two strategies have been employed: identification of antibiotics resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, and the development of beta-lactamase inhibitors. This thesis describes studies on enzymes/proteins in the biosynthetic pathways of beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors. DAOCS is a non-heme Fe(II) dioxygenase that catalyses the oxidative ring expansion of the penicillins to cephalosporins. The expansion of the five-membered <b>penicillin</b> <b>ring</b> to a six-membered cephem ring provides increased resistance to beta-lactamases. The work described here led to the production of crystals with an alternate packing of molecules (belonging to a new space group), which did not show twinning, an anomaly hampering previous structural work. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of class A bacterial beta-lactamases. CAD is a short chain reductase responsible for the catalysis of the penultimate step in clavulanic acid biosynthesis: the NADPH-dependent reduction of the unstable intermediate clavulanate- 9 -aldehyde to clavulanic acid. Structures of CAD in complex with the NADPH co-factor, and clavulanic acid, are described here, leading to a proposed reaction mechanism, and an increased understanding of how the enzyme is able to catalyse a reaction involving such a labile intermediate. Approximately half of the genes in the clavulanic acid biosynthesis gene cluster are open reading frames, without a known function. The gene product of Orf 15 {{has been shown to be}} essential for clavulanic acid production. The structure reported here reveals that it shares similarity with substrate-binding proteins. The complex of ORF 15 with L-arginine, a precursor of clavulanic acid, suggests multiple roles for the protein...|$|E
40|$|The first identfied 2 -oxoglutarate (2 OG) {{dependent}} oxygenase was a collagen modifying enzyme in {{the work}} by Hutton et al. in 1967. Subsequent work has revealed that 2 OG dependent oxygenases are a large family with diverse biological roles. With small molecule substrates, these enzymes catalyse {{a wide range of}} oxidative reactions, including those that form part of antibiotic biosynthetic pathways. The currently accepted consensus mechanism for catalysis by 2 OG-dependent oxygenases is based on crystallographic data, kinetics and on quantum chemical calculations. The consensus mechanism involves oxidative decarboxylation of 2 OG by reaction with an oxygen molecule producing CO 2, succinate and a reactive oxidising species that reacts with the `prime' substrate. Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) is a 2 OG-dependent oxygenase involved in cephalosporin biosynthesis. The mechanism of DAOCS is of particular interest because it has recently been proposed to be different from the consensus mechanism. The new mechanism proposal from Valeg ard et al. is primarily based on high-resolution crystallographic data with support from steady-state kinetic experiments and quantum-chemical calculations. The work in discussed in this thesis aimed to test the proposal of Valegård et al. by using a combination of spectroscopic and spectrometric methods analysing enzyme-substrate interactions. Substrate binding was investigated using both protein-observe (Chapter 3) and ligand-observe (Chapter 4. 1 and 4. 2) methods. Preliminary UV-visible data on enzyme-substrates complex formation was also obtained. The strength of substrate and cosubstrate binding was characterised through dissociation constant measurement. An activity assay (Chapter 2) that allows for direct and simultaneous monitoring of 2 OG decarboxylation and <b>penicillin</b> <b>ring</b> expansion was optimised. Both the ligand-observe and protein-observe binding experiments as well as the preliminary UV-visible data indicate that the formation of a ternary complex between DAOCS, 2 OG and the penicillin substrate is viable. The activity assay conclusively showed that in the presence of unnatural substrates, such as penicillin G, 2 OG oxidation is significantly uncoupled from penicillin oxidation. Uncoupled turnover does not occur {{in the presence of the}} natural substrate, penicillin N, which is an aspect that should be considered in the analysis of the steady-state kinetic data. Overall, the results provide evidence that, the consensus mechanism for 2 OG-dependent oxygenases is viable for DAOCS, at least in the presence of the natural substrate, penicillin N. It is possible that in the presence of an unnatural substrate, the catalytic process undergoes a more complex mechanism, possibly with the direct involvement of reducing agents in the system.

40|$|The Fe(II) / 2 -oxoglutarate (2 OG) {{dependent}} oxygenases are {{a widespread}} enzyme family, which are characterised by structurally similar active sites and proposed {{to employ a}} common reaction mechanism. The work described in this thesis concerned kinetic and biophysical studies on 2 OG oxygenases, with a particular focus on the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) hydroxylases and mechanistic aspects of their reaction with oxygen. The four human HIF hydroxylases regulate cellular levels and transcriptional activity of HIF by catalysing its post-translational hydroxylation in response to changes in oxygen availability. The three prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs 1 - 3) and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) are proposed to act as cellular oxygen sensors and provide a direct link between oxygen availability and the hypoxic response. Previous transient kinetic {{studies have shown that}} PHD 2 (the most important human PHD isoform) reacts slowly with oxygen, a factor proposed to be related to its oxygen-sensing role. The molecular mechanisms for the slow PHD 2 reaction with oxygen were investigated using a range of kinetic and biophysical techniques to probe the effects of key active site substitutions. The studies reveal that a conservative substitution to an Fe(II) /H 2 O binding residue results in 5 -fold faster reaction with oxygen, suggesting a role for H 2 O release from the active site in limiting the ability of oxygen to react with PHD 2. This thesis also describes the first transient kinetic studies of FIH. The obtained results show that the rate of the FIH reaction with oxygen was significantly faster than for PHD 2. Further, FIH catalyses hydroxylation not only of HIF-α, but also of proteins containing ankyrin repeat domains (ARD). The rate of the FIH reaction with oxygen was shown to be substrate dependent; faster oxygen activation of the reaction in the presence of ARD compared with HIF substrates was observed. Mechanistic studies were performed to investigate a report that PHD 2 is involved in the enzymatic oxidation of an oncometabolite (R) - 2 -hydroxyglutarate (2 HG) to give 2 OG, in what would be an unprecedented reaction for a 2 OG oxygenase. This work found that 2 HG does not substitute for 2 OG in PHD 2 catalysis. Instead, the non-enzymatic transformation of 2 HG to 2 OG was observed, which could potentially contribute to the reported 2 HG-dependent PHD activation in vivo. The biophysical and transient kinetic techniques used for studying the HIF hydroxylases were also applied to study the mechanism of deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS, the enzyme catalysing <b>penicillin</b> N <b>ring</b> expansion). Previously, {{it has been suggested that}} the DAOCS mechanism differs from the consensus 2 OG oxygenase mechanism. The results described in this thesis provide strong evidence that DAOCS employs the consensus ordered mechanism characteristic of 2 OG oxygenases, supporting the proposal that the consensus mechanism is a common feature of the 2 OG oxygenase family. Overall, the work described in this thesis is supportive of the proposal that most, if not all, 2 OG oxygenases employ a common mechanism. However, the differences in the kinetics of their reaction with oxygen, presented throughout the thesis, suggest that different 2 OG oxygenases have different rate-limiting steps. Thus, the kinetics of specific oxygenases may be adapted to their biological function, in particular that of PHD 2 as the key cellular O 2 sensor.
