2500|$|Trimethoxyboroxine(TMB)liquid is a boron {{compound}} {{dissolved in}} methanol {{to give it}} proper fluidity {{and allow it to}} be discharged from a <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher.</b> It was developed in the late 1950s by the U.S. Navy for use on magnesium fires, especially crashed aircraft and aircraft wheel fires from hard landings. It is unique as an extinguishing agent in that the agent itself is a flammable liquid. When TMB contacts the fire, the methanol ignites and burns with a greenish flame due to the boron. As the methanol burns off, a glassy coating of boric oxide is left {{on the surface of the}} metal, creating an air-excluding crust. These extinguishers were made by the Ansul Chemical Co. utilizing TMB agent manufactured by the Callery Chemical Company, and were modified 2.5-gallon water extinguishers (Ansul used re-branded Elkhart extinguishers at the time), with a variable-stream nozzle that could deliver a straight stream or spray at the squeeze of a lever. A 6-inch fluorescent orange band with the letters [...] "TMB" [...] stenciled in black identified TMB from other extinguishers. This agent was problematic in that it had a shelf life of only six months to a year once the extinguisher was filled, since the methanol is extremely hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air), which causes corrosion to the extinguisher and renders its use on fire dangerous. These extinguishers were used from the 1950s–70s in various applications, such as the MB-1 and MB-5 crash trucks. The current SOP is to use water fog and cool/burn out the burning metal.|$|E

5000|$|The Manby Mortar {{was invented}} by Captain George William Manby, also the {{inventor}} of the <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher.</b> On 18 February 1807, Manby looked on helplessly as a Naval ship, the Snipe, ran aground 60 yards off Great Yarmouth during a storm. By some accounts, a total of 214 people drowned, including French prisoners of war, women and children. Following this tragedy, Manby experimented with mortars, and so invented the Manby Mortar, later developed into the breeches buoy, which fired a thin rope from shore into the rigging of a ship in distress. A strong rope, attached to the thin one, could then be pulled aboard the ship. His successful invention followed an experiment as a youth in 1783, when he shot a mortar carrying a line over Downham church. His invention was officially adopted in 1814, and a series of mortar stations were established around the coast. [...] The Manby Mortar was used by the Waterguard and later by H M Coastguard for many years. The first recorded rescue using the Manby mortar was on 18 February 1808; Manby himself {{was in charge of the}} mortar and a crew of seven were brought to safety from the Plymouth Brig Elizabeth stranded off the shore at Great Yarmouth.|$|E

40|$|Investigations of past fires {{suggest that}} {{building}} occupants {{faced with a}} fire have problems defining the severity of it, especially {{in the early stages}} of the fire. An experiment was therefore carried out to study people’s ability to estimate fire growth, and their perceived ability to extinguish a fire using a <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher.</b> A total of 535 persons, namely 304 men and 231 women, were asked to fill out a questionnaire that was divided into three parts.

The second part involved estimations of the own ability to extinguish a fire with a <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> <b>extinguisher.</b> The third part involved general questions about age, gender and academic background. The results suggest that people in general are not very good at defining the severity of a fire when it is visually accessible.

40|$|NASA is {{developing}} a Fine Water Mist <b>Portable</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Extinguisher</b> for use on the International Space Station. The International Space Station presently uses {{two different types of}} fire extinguishers: a water foam extinguisher in the Russian Segment, and a carbon dioxide extinguisher in the US Segment and Columbus and Kibo pressurized elements. Changes in emergency breathing equipment make Fine Water Mist operationally preferable. Supplied oxygen breathing systems allow for safe discharge of a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, without concerns of the crew inhaling unsafe levels of carbon dioxide. But the Portable Breathing Apparatus offers no more than 15 minutes of capability, and continued use of hose based supplied oxygen systems increases the oxygen content in a fire situation. NASA has developed a filtering respirator cartridge for use in a fire environment. It is qualified to provide up to 90 minutes of capability, and because it is a filtering respirator it does not add oxygen to the environment. The fire response respirator cartridge does not filter carbon dioxide, so a crew member discharging a CO 2 fire extinguisher while wearing this filtering respirator would be at risk of inhaling unsafe levels of CO 2. Fine Water Mist extinguishes a fire without creating a large volume of air with reduced oxygen and elevated CO 2. Compared to the carbon dioxide based <b>Portable</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Extinguisher,</b> the flight qualification of Fine Water Mist systems requires special care. Qualification of the CO 2 based <b>Portable</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Extinguisher</b> began with the assumption that any fire on ISS would be extinguished if the air in the fire environment reached a critical concentration of CO 2. Qualification of a CO 2 based system requires the developers to make assertions and assumptions about vehicle geometry and the ability of the extinguisher to deliver CO 2 in different geometric configurations, but the developers did not need to make assertions or assumptions {{about the size of the}} fire, the temperature, or the heat generation rate. Fine Water Mist systems extinguish a fire predominantly by removing heat [...] so qualification standards must evaluate geometry, but also temperature, heat transfer, and heat generation rate.
