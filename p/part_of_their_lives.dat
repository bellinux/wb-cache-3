5|$|Lina Prokofiev outlived her {{estranged husband}} by many years, dying in London in early 1989. Royalties from her late husband's music {{provided}} {{her with a}} modest income, and she acted as storyteller for a recording of her husband's Peter and the Wolf (currently released on CD by Chandos Records) with Neeme Järvi conducting the Scottish National Orchestra. Their sons Sviatoslav (1924–2010), an architect, and Oleg (1928–1998), an artist, painter, sculptor and poet, dedicated a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to the promotion of their father's life and work.|$|E
5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how much support there was for {{persecution}} within the aristocracy. After Gallienus's peace, Christians reached high ranks in Roman government. Diocletian appointed several Christians to those positions himself, {{and his wife}} and daughter may have been sympathetic to the church. There were many individuals willing to be martyrs, and many provincials willing to ignore any persecutory edicts from the emperors as well. Even Constantius was known to have disapproved of persecutory policies. The lower classes demonstrated little of the enthusiasm they had shown for earlier persecutions. They no longer believed the slanderous accusations that were popular in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Perhaps, as the historian Timothy Barnes has suggested, the long-established Church had become another accepted <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sabah {{culture is}} diverse {{due to a}} wide range of {{different}} ethnicity. In the coastal areas, Sabahan culture has been influenced by the Bruneian Malays and West Coast Bajaus on the west coast side while in the east coast it is influenced by either East Coast Bajau, Bugis and Suluk cultures with Islam being the important <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Christianity plays an important part to the indigenous cultures in the interior side in the daily lives of the Kadazan-Dusun, Lundayeh, Murut and Rungus beside their old practice of the traditional Animism and Paganism. Interracial marriage among the different ethnicity and religion are common in Sabah.|$|E
5|$|Housing {{and social}} {{organization}} among the Mikea {{can vary from}} one individual or community to the next. Some Mikea remain in the forest their entire lives, while others live <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> in villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of virgin forest in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of thatch and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for {{three to five years}} as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses. During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups that relocate deeper into the forest to settle near babo tuber patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and thatch sunshades, and some individuals not living in shelters at all. In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.|$|E
5|$|When Robbins wins {{a prestigious}} grant to help treat {{children}} in Malawi, a disgruntled Torres agrees to move there with her, as the position {{will last for}} three years; however, her lack of enthusiasm causes Robbins to end their relationship and go without her. A heartbroken Torres moves in with Sloan, {{and they have a}} one-night stand. Robbins returns for Torres, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness, but Torres initially rebuffs her, and later reveals that she is pregnant with Sloan's baby. Robbins agrees to raise the child with her, but dislikes that Sloan will be a permanent <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> En route a weekend getaway, Robbins proposes to Torres, but before Torres can reply, the two are in a head-on collision with a truck, leaving Torres severely injured. In an attempt to save her life, obstetrician-gynecologist Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), delivers Torres's premature baby. Torres survives, and agrees to marry Robbins. After twelve weeks of recovery, both Torres and baby Sofia are discharged and allowed to leave the hospital. Torres recovers from her surgery, but deals with the backlash from her mother (Gina Gallego)'s attitude toward the wedding and her granddaughter. Torres and Robbins marry in a garden after the minister's wife falls ill, with general surgeon Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), officiating the ceremony.|$|E

25|$|A 2006 {{inquiry in}} Flanders, {{considered}} to be a more religious region than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious and that 36% believed that God created the universe. On the other hand, Wallonia has become one of Europe's most secular/least religious regions. Most of the French-speaking region's population does not consider religion an important <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> and as much as 45% of the population identifies as irreligious. This is particularly the case in eastern Wallonia and areas along the French border.|$|E

25|$|Pelagic organisms {{spend all}} or <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> {{in the open}} water, where habitat is defined not by edges but by {{physiological}} tolerance to salinity and temperature. The Low Salinity Zone (LSZ) of the San Francisco Estuary constitutes a habitat for a suite of organisms that are specialized to survive in this unique confluence of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine influences. While there are many habitats with distinct ecologies {{that are part of}} the estuary (including marine, freshwater, intertidal marsh and benthic mudflat systems) each is linked to the LSZ by export and import of freshwater, nutrients, carbon, and organisms.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the start}} of the 13th century, many eremetical communities, {{especially}} in the vicinity of Siena, Italy, sprang up. These were often small (no more than ten) and composed of laymen, thus they lacked the clerical orientation of the canons. Their foundational spirit was one of solitude and penance. With time, some of the communities adopted a more outward looking way of life. As the number of hermit-priests increased, assisting the local clergy in providing spiritual care for their neighbors became a larger <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> In 1223 four of the communities around Siena joined in a loose association, which had increased to thirteen within five years.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of squat lobsters are benthic, spending {{their lives on}} the sea-floor. A few, however, spend <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> living in the water column, often forming dense pelagic swarms of juveniles, especially in areas with high densities of plankton; this behaviour is seen in the species Pleuroncodes planipes (off Baja California, Mexico), P.monodon (Peru and Chile) and Munida gregaria (Otago, New Zealand and southernmost South America). Although Munida quadrispina also has pelagic juveniles, they have not been observed to form swarms. As well as these pelagic swarms, many species form dense aggregations on the sea floor. This is particularly prominent around hydrothermal vents, where species such as Shinkaia crosnieri are particularly abundant.|$|E

25|$|With {{the start}} of World War II, the Isle of Man was chosen {{as a base for}} {{internment}} camps for enemy aliens. After a short time the rules of detention were relaxed for those internees who posed no threat to the Allies, enabling them to be utilised for work in local Manx farms. Posted to the Douglas' family farm at Ballaragh were a party of Italians from a camp on the promenade at Douglas, amongst them Leonida Nikolai Giovannelli. After Giovannelli's eventual release from internment, he and Douglas ran an experimental upland farm at the Clarum, close to Douglas' parents' farm. After six years of operation, the farm had to be sold to meet rising debts in 1949. This <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> was recorded in Giovannelli's books, Experiments on a Manx Hill Farm (1956) and Exile on an Island (1969). By this time Douglas' father had died and when her mother also passed on, in 1953, she inherited 'Thie ny Garee', and she would later expand this to also run the Clarum.|$|E
25|$|Organisms that {{spend at}} least <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> within the {{pitchers}} of Nepenthes species are often called Nepenthes infauna. The most common infaunal species, often representing the top trophic level of the infaunal ecosystem, are many species of mosquito larvae. Other infaunal species include fly and midge larvae, spiders, mites, ants, and even a species of crab (Geosesarma malayanum). Many of these species specialise to one pitcher plant species and are found nowhere else. These specialists are called nepenthebionts. Others, often associated with but not dependent on Nepenthes species, are called nepenthophiles. Nepenthexenes, on the other hand, are rarely found in the pitchers, but will often appear when putrefaction approaches a certain threshold, attracting fly larvae that would normally not {{be found in the}} pitcher infaunal community. The complex ecological relationship between pitcher plants and infauna is not yet fully understood, but the relationship may be mutualistic: the infauna is given shelter, food, or protection, and the plant that harbours the infauna receives expedited breakdown of captured prey, increasing the rate of digestion and keeping harmful bacterial populations repressed.|$|E
500|$|Adult insects {{typically}} {{move about}} by walking, flying or sometimes swimming [...] As {{it allows for}} rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles. Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight. Many insects spend at least <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> under water, with larval adaptations that include gills, and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming. Some species, such as water striders, are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain bees, ants and termites, are social and live in large, well-organized colonies. Some insects, such as earwigs, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young. Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways. Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances. Other species communicate with sounds: crickets stridulate, or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males. Lampyridae in the beetle order communicate with light.|$|E
