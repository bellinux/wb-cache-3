50|$|<b>Per-second</b> <b>billing</b> on Fido's postpaid monthly plans was {{discontinued}} on July 4, 2012. Customers {{with plans}} created and activated before that date are kept on <b>per-second</b> <b>billing</b> until they {{change to a}} newer plan.|$|E
50|$|The law was amended in 2009 {{based on}} a review carried out under the 2007 {{regulation}}. The expiry date of the 2007 regulation was extended to 30 June 2012 and was extended to text messages and data roaming. It also provided for further annual reductions in the price capping until the expiry of the regulation and for compulsory <b>per-second</b> <b>billing</b> after 30 seconds for calls made, and <b>per-second</b> <b>billing</b> throughout for calls received.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{current and}} {{prospective}} Koodo customers became disappointed and {{frustrated with the}} removal of <b>per-second</b> <b>billing</b> on Koodo Mobile's February 2012 monthly voice plans. Customers were given no advance warnings of these changes, although a third-party blog did provide a leaked brochure of the new per-minute plans. These plans cost $5/month more than their previous counterpart and include the caller ID and voicemail features, but are billed per minute instead of per second. One of the five plans was also lowered to 100 minutes instead of the 150 previously included, but the backlash to this change prompted the company to reverse this decision. Customers on Koodo's Facebook profile and the operator's Get Satisfaction Internet forum criticized the removal of <b>per-second</b> <b>billing,</b> perceiving it as [...] "one step forward, two steps back". Existing customers with old plans are grandfathered with <b>per-second</b> <b>billing,</b> but will receive per-minute billing if they change their plan. There are currently over 100 frustrated customers voicing their support for <b>per-second</b> <b>billing,</b> some threatening to leave the operator. An April Fools' Day spoof joking about Koodo billing per hour has also been posted by the thread's creator.|$|E
5000|$|Koodo is a {{discount}} wireless brand, offering budget plans since its launch, with no activation fee, system access fee or carrier-charged [...] "911 fee". <b>Per-second</b> <b>billing</b> was also offered at that time. Later, Fido mimicked Koodo's service offerings.|$|E
50|$|Over time, Solo {{began to}} imitate its {{competitors}} instead of offering unique, innovative options for wireless services. Similarly to its competitor Fido, Solo offered <b>per-second</b> <b>billing</b> {{after the first}} minute of every month for postpaid customers starting in 2008. Prepaid clients, however, receive per-minute billing. The monthly plans for both prepaid and postpaid customers were practically identical to those of Koodo Mobile.|$|E
50|$|Telecom Finland, who co-founded the GSM MoU (now GSM Association), was the {{technical}} partner {{and the seven}} paging companies each contributed their billing and customer care experience and access to RF planning and sites access. PEWC was the largest shareholder (and the only Taiwanese shareholder to have involved in bidding of a PCS license in HK), who also had a 5% stake in the world-renowned Iridium Satellite communication project and increasing foothold and exposure in their home country. Taiwan had chosen focus their resources and capabilities for Taiwan and hence chose to exit the Hong Kong markets, which inadvertently had led to the sale of P-Plus to SmarTone in 1998. P-Plus was the first carrier in Hong Kong to have proposed to OFTA and to have offered <b>per-second</b> <b>billing</b> plan which intended to offer to the mass-market an alternative pricing-plan solution for a market that is only adapted to per-minute billing increments. P-Plus was then using Nokia's mobile network infrastructure and had deployed Hong Kong wide services.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, in {{cooperation}} with Ericsson and the Czech Technical University it opened a Research and Development Center. Between 2001 and 2002, Oskar won 5 nominations for the prestigious World Communication Award for the best mobile operator.It closed its partnership with the world's mobile Vodafone family in 2005 {{and a year later}} of Oskar Mobil a.s. became Vodafone Czech Republic a.s. Within a few months, there was a complete rebranding and Oskar Vodafone later became Vodafone.In 2007, Vodafone OneNet was launched offering companies converged mobile and fixed voice and data services including Internet access. As the first operator to do so, it started to offer services for free in exchange for viewing the ad on your mobile phone. In the following years they began the construction of a 3G network {{and at the end of}} 2012 already covered 73.2% of the population. In the same year, Vodafone was the first operator to bring <b>per-second</b> <b>billing</b> and the first tablet under its own brand. The year 2013 was marked by unlimited tariffs, the test LTE network and cooperation with virtual operators.|$|E
5000|$|On February 3, 2012 all {{the monthly}} plans were again changed. The Canada-wide plans {{increased}} in price by $5. While they now feature the caller ID and voicemail calling features, <b>per-second</b> <b>billing</b> {{was replaced with}} per-minute billing. Also, the new $30/month plan has 100 minutes instead of 150 minutes. The cost of additional minutes has increased from 35¢/min to 45¢/min, {{and the cost of}} additional outgoing text messages is now 20¢/text. As well, the roaming rate while in the United States has increased from $1.35/min to $1.50/min. Customers who signed up on February 2, 2012 or earlier are grandfathered with their older plan, and are thus unaffected by these changes unless they switch to a newer plan. [...] These changes were met with criticism from both existing and potential customers, as Koodo's older plans offered a much better value for airtime. It should be noted that unlimited SMS and MMS are no longer included in the City Koodo plan, because it has been replaced by the new calling features. Only the first 50 messages are free of charge. One must either purchase the unlimited messaging add-on, or pay-per-use, to send additional messages.|$|E
30|$|Aneka [6] is a {{framework}} for developing distributed applications on the cloud. It provides developers with an API for managing resources and expressing the business logic of applications by using programming abstractions. Aneka provides tools monitoring a deployed infrastructure, scaling resources based on the completion times of requests. If the current set of resources is unable to complete a newly arriving request before its deadline, additional resources may be acquired. Resources are released when certain threshold conditions are met. The authors of [24] propose a system that employs a cloud brokerage service to reserve resources from a public cloud provider instead of acquiring them on-demand. Their broker reserves resources at a bulk price that {{is lower than the}} on-demand price. The broker shares the resources with multiple users while offering them <b>per-second</b> <b>billing.</b> The goal {{of this paper is to}} reduce user cost. The approach discussed in [24] does not ARs when provisioning resources. In addition, the approaches in both [6] and do not consider broker profit as a factor when deciding whether to acquire or release resources. Finally, these approaches do not employ proactive auto-scaling via the technique introduced in this paper. Amazon’s CloudWatch also utilizes target metrics specified by its users to trigger actions upon reaching their thresholds. Proactive resource management may attempt to predict the future workload when making scaling decisions [25]. Moore et al. [25] uses a similar technique for resource provisioning. However, resource provisioning may also be achieved without predicting the future workload as discussed in [26], where the authors propose a technique for dynamically adapting thresholds to meet QoS targets.|$|E
