40|$|An {{improved}} solid agar medium (MP medium) {{has been}} developed which allows detection of <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity</b> in bacteria. Organisms tested exhibited a variety of regulatory controls governing pectate lyase synthesis. The medium contains mineral salts, pectin, and yeast extract. After growth of the organisms, the agar plate is flooded with a polysaccharide precipitant, and <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity</b> is shown by clear zones around active colonies. High concentrations of phosphate are shown to be necessary for pectic enzyme formation on solid media. The medium has successfully been used to detect pectolytic organisms in soil, forest litter, and rotting vegetable samples...|$|E
40|$|Extracts of {{nematodes}} of the Raleigh, North Carolina (RNC), Waynesville, N. C. (WNC), {{and onion}} populations of Ditylenchus dipsaci were examined for <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity.</b> RNC nematodes contained a NaCl-stimulated endo-polymethylgalacturonase with optimal pH for activity of 6. 0, whereas nematodes of the WNC and onion populations possessed a NaCl-stimulated endo-polygalacturonase with pH optimum of 4. 0. Nematodes of each population also contained a CaCl₂-activated endo-pectin methyl-trans-eliminase with optimal pH of 9. 0. Nematode extracts containing 0. 5 M NaCl macerated potato discs. RNC and onion nematodes induced gall formation in Wando pea seedlings, but WNC nematodes induced a resistant, hypersensitive response.

30|$|The {{application}} of proteolytic activities {{does not have}} any significant role in the degradation of cell walls and this whatever the harvest date. Contrariwise, the {{application of}} <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities</b> on olives allow a very significant degradation of olives tissue structures with a decrease in protopectins levels from veraison to maturity and these levels are lower than those of the control mainly when these <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities</b> act in combination with the proteolytic activities. Under these conditions, the use of these activities results in a weakening of the parietal cell and membrane structures allowing the release of a larger amount of the cell contents. These observations are also confirmed by the liberation and enrichment of oil with phenolic compounds. In fact, {{in the absence of any}} enzymatic activity, the contents of phenolic compounds in oils decrease about 68  % during the maturation, while the contents in olives only decreased by 10 – 20  % which confirms the hypothesis of the presence of a physical barrier preventing their release. This hypothesis, which states a bond of polyphenols with polysaccharides of the cell walls and the component proteins of vacuolar membranes, is confirmed by the use of pectolytic and proteolytic activities: If the proteolytic activities alone have no influence on the release of phenolic compounds from olives, the <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities</b> alone and especially in combination with the proteolytic activities allow to enrich the oils with these compounds and this from veraison. The levels of oils enrichment with phenolic compounds by the combination of exogenous proteolytic and <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities</b> increase during the first stages of ripening when the cell walls of olives are not completely weakened by endogenous activities then these levels decrease towards the end of ripening when the parietal structures are naturally degraded by endogenous activities. Under these conditions, the hypothesis of the presence of a mechanical barrier which opposes the release of phenolic compounds in the oils is verified: we can conclude that the <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities</b> degrade the parietal structures releasing the polyphenols related to parietal structures but also the polyphenols that are released by the degradation of the component proteins of vacuolar membranes. The use of proteolytic and <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities</b> on the insoluble material alcohol consisting mainly of pectocellulosic structures of olives cell walls confirms the hypothesis of the presence of polyphenols bound to the cell walls of the fruit, but also to the vacuolar membranes making their release difficult during the extraction of oil. The release of these polyphenols in the medium is made possible by the degradation of the parietal and membrane structures of the cells by enzymatic activities. These results are in agreement with those of Vierhuis et al. (2001) who have shown that the use of enzyme preparations leads to an increase of the levels of derivatives secoiridiode as the aldehyde form of elenolic acid linked to 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl ethanol (3, 4 -DHPEA-EDA) and the isomer of oleuropein aglycone (3, 4 -DHPEA-EA) in olive oil and also confirm the results obtained from the grapes that show an increase in levels of tannins during red winemaking when the enzyme activities are added to the vintage (Amrani Joutei and Glories 1995).|$|R
30|$|The {{application}} {{effect of}} ethephon on cell maturity, fat extractability, and diffusion of phenolic compounds in {{virgin olive oil}} during the olives ripening of the Moroccan Picholine variety has been studied. In this study, we {{have shown that the}} treatment of olive trees by ethephon at fruit set or veraison produces chemical thinning of the fruit and very important precociousness of the harvest due to an increase in the endogenous <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities</b> which result in a very rapid and intense decrease in the protopectin contents, thus facilitating the fat flow and a very important diffusion of the PCs in the virgin olive oil.|$|R
30|$|During the extraction, {{a portion}} of oil remains trapped inside the cells and its release {{requires}} the degradation of the walls and cell membranes, especially when the fruits have not reached a maximum maturity {{which is likely to}} cause an optimal embrittlement of the parietal structures and cell membrane. This can be done by specific enzymes necessary for the degradation of various cellular barriers. Three different enzyme treatments proteolytic, pectolytic or both are applied on the Moroccan Picholine olives from veraison to maturity of the fruit. The effect of these treatments is evaluated by olive oil diffusion, its phenolic content (PC) and cellular embrittlement determination of olives during ripening. The <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities</b> lead to a significant increase in both the oil extractability (76  % at veraison and 14  % at maturity) and the PC (up to 50  % of gain compared to the control at veraison and 27  % at maturity). The proteolytic activities applied alone have no significant effect on the extractability and the polyphenols levels of oils. Furthermore, when these proteolytic activities are added in combination with the <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities,</b> the oil extractability is doubled at veraison and its flowing up to 99  % at maturity that barely 84  % in the control in addition to a richness of polyphenols which can reach 84  % more compared to the control. This increase in polyphenols wealth is probably due to the degradation of cell walls, cellular and vacuolar membranes by enzyme activities releasing PCs that were previously associated with these structures in the drupe.|$|R
40|$|Annotation: For {{the purpose}} of {{acquiring}} a highly active producer of pectolytic enzymes, there was a probe of isolating 140 species of Aspergillus’s fungi from different substrates (soils, grape malts, grapes, apples and sugar beet shreds). The isolated kinds of fungi were kept on a slant agar surface according to Chapek, with 2 % of pectin. Testing {{was performed on the}} isolated layers of fungi as to the production of pectinolytic enzymes. The nourishing base used was the synthetic Chapek base with 2 % pectin, 2 % lactose and 0. 7 % (NH 4) 2 HPO 4, and a natural base of 1 % refuse apple pulp. Within 48 hours after cultivating the fungi, the filtrates were tested by the viscozimetric method to determine their entire <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity.</b> The acquired results showed that a fungus was gained with a high <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity</b> on a natural refuse apple pulp.

30|$|The {{role of the}} {{proteolytic}} {{activities in}} combination with <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity</b> was studied on {{the release of the}} fat and phenolic compounds during the extraction of olive oil. In this study, we were able to highlight the presence of phenolic compounds linked to difficult releasable parietal structures during oil extraction. Furthermore, we showed that the application of proteolytic activities alone are ineffective on extractability of the cell contents, while their use with the presence of <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity</b> causes an increase in the diffusion of the fat and it is wealthy on phenolic compounds mainly when olives have not reached sufficient maturity. The action of these activities {{lies in the fact that}} firstly the proteolytic activities degrade the component proteins of membrane structures releasing the polyphenols associated with these structures and promotes the diffusion of the oil, on the other hand, the pectolytic activities degrade the parietal structures allowing the passage of the cell contents and releasing the same time the polyphenols associated with cell walls that can enrich the phenolic content of oil.|$|E
40|$|Effect of Trichoderma viride T 1433 on the <b>pectolytic</b> enzyme <b>activity</b> of Rhizopus stolonifer (= R. artocarpi) {{during the}} {{development}} of soft rot of jackfruit was studied. Activity of different fractions of pectolytic enzymes like PG, PME and PL was investigated during pathogenesis and correspondingly the associated resistance of the host was assayed. It was noticed that the biocontrol agent, Trichoderma significantly interacts with the <b>pectolytic</b> enzyme <b>activity</b> of the pathogen. It caused an appreciable reduction in enzymatic action. The reduction in the activity of polygalacturonase enzyme (PG) was recorded to be the highest among all the fractions of pectolytic enzymes. Such a trend appeared to be more pronounced in 'Kujja' than in 'Ghula' cultivar of jackfruit. The reduction in <b>pectolytic</b> enzyme <b>activity</b> {{was found to be}} coupled with {{a significant increase in the}} activity of polyphenol oxidase enzyme of the host tissues and a concomitant increase in host phenol content. Such inter-relationship between these two enzyme systems plays a key role to stimulate the defense mechanism of the host plant against infection. Significant increase in total phenol content of the host tissue during Trichoderma plant pathogen interaction that was recorded may correspond with the host defense response...|$|R
30|$|The {{mesocarp}} (the flesh) and the pericarp (the skin) contain 96 – 98  % of {{the olive}} oil and only 2 – 4  % is in the endocarp (pit). During extraction, a portion of oil remains trapped inside the cells and release requires the degradation of the walls and cell membranes, especially when the fruits have not reached an optimal fragility. This {{can be done by}} specific enzymes necessary for degradation of various cellular barriers. Enzymes present in the fruit {{of the olive}} are generally made ineffective during the process of extracting oil or grinding step because of their inhibition by phenolics compounds present in the cells. Furthermore, many studies have been conducted on the effects of exogenous enzymes on the extraction and the characteristics of the olive oil (Domínguez et al. 1994; Garcia et al. 2001; Ranalli and De Mattia 1997, 1996; Vierhuis et al. 2001, 2003). Most of these works relate only <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities</b> while proteolytic activities have been very little studied.|$|R

Of the 34 strains isolated from imported seed tubers or potato plants grown from imported seed, 32 were typed as ‘D. solani’ and only two were characterized as Dickeya dianthicola. Biovar typing indicated that all ‘D. solani’ strains were biovar 3. ‘Dickeya solani’ strains were most closely related to Dickeya dadantii subsp. dieffenbachiae according to PFGE and dnaX analyses and both species exhibited high <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity.</b> Expression levels of two putative virulence genes, pelL (encoding a pectic enzyme) and dspE (encoding a type III effector) were significantly induced in ‘D. solani’ strains isolated from potato plants or tubers grown in hot climates such as the Negev region in Israel, compared to those isolated from seed tubers imported from the Netherlands, France or Germany.

40|$|<b>Pectolytic</b> <b>activity</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is due to}} the {{secretion}} of an endo-polygalacturonase encoded by the PGU 1 gene. The {{ability to}} degrade polygalacturonic acid has been shown to vary between different strains. In this study, we attempted to elucidate how <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity</b> is regulated in S. cerevisiae and to determine whether the means of regulation differ between strains. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains from different genetic backgrounds, with varying ability to degrade pectin, were compared. Activity was found not to be regulated by sequence differences in the PGU 1 gene, but by the transcription level of the gene. Expression of PGU 1 was found to be determined by the transcription level of its two transcription factors TEC 1 and STE 12. The activation of PGU 1 transcription by galactose was found to be strain specific, independent of the strain being an industrial or a domesticated one. The EUROSCARF yeast deletion library was screened for genes encoding inhibitors and activators of polygalacturonase activity. Fourteen strains were identified, in which deletion of a specific gene resulted in a recovery of polygalacturonase activity; these genes were identified as encoding inhibitors of polygalacturonase activity, and two activators were identified. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

40|$|The typical {{citrus canker}} lesions {{produced}} by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac) have water-soaked margins. Three new variants of Xac producing atypical symptoms were recently described in Taiwan. The variant designated A(r) type produces lesions without water-soaked margins on {{the leaves of}} citrus species and does not possess <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity</b> on polypectate media. Five pectolytic genes pel 1, pel 2, pel 3, peh 1, and peh 2 from strains XW 19 (a typical canker lesion-producing strain) and XW 121 (a strain of A(r) type) were PCR-amplified, cloned and characterized. Only the 1. 2 -kb pel 1 gene from XW 19 expressed <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity.</b> Sequence analyses revealed over 99 % homology in nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences among pel 1 genes from XW 19 and XW 121, and a pel homolog from strain 306 (GenBank accession No. NC 003919. 1, XAC 3562). The pel 1 gene from XW 19 and XW 121 encoded a Pel 1 protein of 377 amino acids. However, there was a stop codon located at the 350 (th) amino acid residue of the gene from XW 121. When the pel 1 gene from XW 19 was transformed into XW 121, the transformant exhibited pectate lyase activity and also induced water-soaked margins surrounding the lesions on grapefruit leaves. The results suggest that expression of the pel 1 gene of Xac is associated with formation of the water-soaked margin of the bacterial canker lesion...|$|E

40|$|The {{association}} between grass roots and Azospirillum brasilense Sp 7 was {{investigated by the}} Fahraeus slide technique, using nitrogen-free medium. Young inoculated roots of pearl millet and guinea grass produced more mucilaginous sheath (mucigel), root hairs, and lateral roots than did uninoculated sterile controls. The bacteria were found within the mucigel that accumulated on the root cap and along the root axes. Adherent bacteria were associated with granular material on root hairs and fibrillar material on undifferentiated epidermal cells. Significantly fewer numbers of azospirilla attached to millet root hairs when the roots were grown in culture medium supplemented with 5 mM potassium nitrate. Under these growth conditions, bacterial attachment to undifferentiated epidermal cells was unaffected. Aseptically collected root exudate from pearl millet contained substances which bound to azospirilla and promoted their adsorption to the root hairs. This activity was associated with nondialyzable and proteasesensitive substances in root exudate. Millet root hairs adsorbed azospirilla in significantly higher numbers than cells of Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Azotobacter, Klebsiella, or Escherichia. <b>Pectolytic</b> <b>activities,</b> including pectin transeliminase and endopolygalacturonase, were detected in pure cultures of A. brasilense when this species was grown in a medium containing pectin.

30|$|The {{extraction}} {{of olive oil}} {{is closely related to}} the cellular maturity state, itself related to the fragility degree of the parietal and membrane structures of the fruit which constitute a physical barrier preventing the release of the cell contents and the effective recovery of the fat. The fragility of the plant cells is estimated by the protopectin contents which ensure the rigidity of the cell walls. In our case, whatever the treatment, these protopectins decrease during the olives ripening but in a very intense and fast way in the fruit of olive trees treated both at the fruit set and at veraison. This promotes the softening of the parietal and membrane structures of the fruit, thus facilitating the fat flow, and ensures an effective recovery of the virgin olive oil. These results disagree with the work of Mínguez-Mosquera and his collaborators [31] on olives cv. Hojiblanca who observed that protopectin levels remained stable during the olives ripening. Moreover, pectin degradation is closely related to the olives levels in endogenous <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities.</b> Ethephon influences the activity of these endogenous enzymes regardless of whether the treatment is carried out at fruit set or at veraison. These physiological events result in the more or less intense embrittlement of the parietal structures and the release of cellular contents, leading to a flow of fat estimated at 87 % for the treatment at fruit set and 83 % for the treatment at veraison. The control olives have not yet matured and their percentages of flow have reached only 70 %.|$|R

In plants treated with NaCl, all the ripening parameters of the fruits of the nor mutant increased, but those of the rin mutant did not. The ripening of the fruits of the NaCl-treated nor plants was characterized by the development of a red color and taste, increased <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity,</b> and increased evolution of CO 2 and ethylene. These changes do not normally take place in nor under control conditions. The values of these ripening parameters in nor were lower than those of the normal Rutgers fruits. In addition, both in nor and rin and in the normal variety, exposure of the plants to NaCl shortened the developmental period of the fruit, decreased the fruit size, and increased the concentrations of total soluble solids, Na+, Cl−, reducing sugars, and titratable acids in the fruit.

The enzyme was largely extracellular and was produced constitutively in basal medium supplemented with a variety of carbon sources including polygalacturonic acid. Lesions on grape seedling roots inoculated with A. tumefaciens biovar 3 strain CG 49 yielded polygalacturonase activity with a pI {{similar to that of the}} enzyme produced by the bacterium in culture.

30|$|Nevertheless, the {{embrittlement}} of the cells’ parietal structures {{does not}} allow an important diffusion of the phenolic compounds in the fat during extraction; a small proportion {{is found in the}} oil and this proportion decreases during the olives ripening. The passage of these compounds is related to a modification of the phenolic profile [32]. However, the fruits of olive trees treated by ethylene show an increase in the cellular fragility from the veraison compared to the control following a rapid and intense degradation of the parietal structures. These observations are confirmed by the very important decrease in pectins and the increase in <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities,</b> mainly the PG activities, which allow the degradation of protopectins. This phenomenon is observed as soon as the olives are treated, both at fruit set and at veraison. These results are in agreement with those of Amrani on grapes [10] and of Agravante and his collaborators [33] and Lohani and his collaborators [34] on the banana ripening. Furthermore, the study of gene expression encoding the parietal hydrolases showed that most of them are induced during ripening and regulated by ethylene [35 – 38]. These physiological processes allow embrittlement of the olives’ cell walls, which has the consequence of facilitating the release of the phenolic compounds and the enrichment of the virgin olive oil by these compounds. Thus, the treatment of olive trees by ethylene at fruit set or veraison makes it possible to extract at total maturity an oil rich in total polyphenols with a gain of these compounds at about 150 % in comparison with the phenolic charge of oils of the control olives.|$|R

30|$|The {{location}} {{of fat in}} cells of the olives {{has been the subject}} of numerous works: according to B. Rangel, the fat accumulates in the cytoplasm of cells of oil-bearing mesocarp, endocarp, and epicarp [22]. According Ranalli, this fat is localized in the cytoplasm in bound form but also in the vacuoles in free form [23]. In any case, the extraction of the oil is in close relation with the state of cellular maturity, itself linked to the degree of brittleness of cell membranes and walls which constitute a physical barrier to its flow. The brittleness of plant cells is estimated by the contents of protopectins that ensure the rigidity of the cell walls. In our case, regardless of the treatment performed, these protopectins decrease during ripening of olives but in a very intense and quickly in olives treated at fruit set and less than those treated at veraison. This promotes the softening of the parietal and membrane structures of the fruit thus facilitating the flow of the fat. These results are in disagreement with the work of Isabel Mínguez-Mosquera on olives cv. Hojiblanca who observed that the protopectins content remains stable during the ripening of olives [24]. Furthermore, pectin degradation is related to the contents of olives of endogenous <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activities.</b> These enzymes convert the protopectins to soluble substances firstly by demethylation using pectinesterases activities, then hydrolysis leading to small chains of galacturonic acids using polygalacturonase. These physiological events that are influenced by the period of the application of ABA, result in more or less intense embrittlement of the parietal structures and release of cell contents causing a flow of fat that exceeds 83 % at full maturity of olives when they are treated by the ABA at fruit set. At that stage, control drupes have not reached yet their maturity and they present a flowing percentage estimated at 70 %. When olives are treated at veraison, a similar but less important phenomenon is observed, leading to a slight acceleration of ripening and diffusion of fat.|$|R

JS- 79 - 291) {{were given}} pre-sowing soak treatment for 24 h {{in a range}} (IO·s, 10 - 4,and 10. 3 M) of dilute solutions of 6 metal salts, selected out of 14 initially tested, viz. barium sulphate, lithium sulphate, manganese sulphate, cupric chloride, ferric chloride, and zinc chloride, and pot-grown 2 -week-old plants were soil inoculated with Sclerotium rolfsii, the first 5 salts substantially (61 - 77 %) inhibited disease symp-toms and reduced plant mortality by 45 to 75 % {{as compared to the}} control. Zinc chloride recorded milder effects. Only manganese sulphate had graded concentration effect, with the maximum at 10 · 3 M;for others optimum was either at 10 - 4 or lO. sM. None of the salts had any appreciable inhibitory effect on sclerotium germination. Biochemical studies with infected stem tissue from the optimum treatment for each salt and the control showed that the former usually recorded appreciable. increase in total phenol and o-dihydroxyphenol contents and also in peroxidase activity but reductions in <b>pectolytic</b> enzyme <b>activity</b> as compared to the latter. Possible use of these salts in plant disease control has been discussed...|$|R
40|$|In many plant species, {{the daily}} release of {{hundreds}} {{to thousands of}} healthy cells from the root cap into the soil is a normal process, whose function is unknown. We studied {{the separation of the}} cells in pea (Pisum sativum) using an aeroponic system in which separated cells were retained on the root until they were washed off for counting. We found that cell separation is a developmentally regulated, temperature-sensitive process that appears to be regulated independently of root growth. No cells were released from very young roots. When plants were grown aeroponically, cell numbers increased with increasing root length to a mean of 3400 cells per root, at which point the release of new cells ceased. The process could be reset and synchronized by washing the root in water to remove shed cells. Cell separation from the root cap was correlated with <b>pectolytic</b> enzyme <b>activity</b> in root cap tissue. Because these cells that separate from the root cap ensheath the root as it grows and thus provide a cellular interface between the root surface and the soil, we propose to call the cells “root border cells. ...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-three Monilinia {{isolates}} {{of various}} origin {{were identified and}} compared by morphological means and by biomolecular protocols based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, and on PCR detection by species-specific primer pairs. The identification of most Monilinia isolates by PCR and RAPD confirmed the identification by morphological criteria, although two isolates initially identified as M. fructigena by morphological means were attributed to M. fructicola by the biomolecular techniques. Monilinia isolates were also compared {{in terms of their}} in vitro <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity</b> and isoenzyme patterns. All the isolates produced polygalacturonase and pectin methylesterase, but pectin lyase activity was found only in M. fructicola and M. fructigena, and not in most M. laxa isolates. The Monilinia isolates differed significantly in their isoenzyme patterns. Based on RAPD-PCR and PCR amplification and pectolytic isoenzymes, the isolates analysed clustered in three major groups, each corresponding to a Monilinia species. Artificial inoculations in peach and pear fruits revealed differences in virulence between the Monilinia species and within isolates. No correlation was found between the amount of pectolytic enzymes produced in vitro and virulence. Variations between and within the Monilinia species may depend at the physiological level on variations in the isoenzyme patterns of the pectolytic enzymes...|$|E
40|$|The {{preliminary}} phytochemical {{screening of}} extracts of Rumex vesicarius L. and Ziziphus spina-christi (L.) Willd. showed {{the presence of}} compounds that are biologically active against the two root rot pathogens Drechslera biseptata and Fusarium solani in vitro. The relative efficacy of this action, however, differed according to the extracted plant, solvent used, extract concentration, the target fungus and phase of growth. Ethanolic extract ranked first, followed by the remaining aqueous layer fraction. Eight flavonoid subfractions (rutin, quercetin, myricetin, apigenin, quercetin- 3 -O-galactoside, luteolin, kaempherol and kaempherol- 3 -O-robinoside) and six flavonoid subfractions (apigenin- 7 -O-glucoide, quercitrin, quercetin, isovitexin, rutin and quercetin- 3 -O lucoside- 7 -O-rhamnoside) were isolated from the remaining aqueous layer fraction of R. vesicarius and Z. spina-christi, respectively. Generally, spore production and germination as well as cellulolytic and <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity</b> of F. solani were affected by plant extracts more than that of D. biseptata. F. solani failed completely to produce spores when treated with ethanolic extract of Z. spina-christi at the concentration of 20 %. However, growth of D. biseptata was more sensitive to plant extracts than that of F. solani. Maximum activity of plant extracts was observed against spore production. It was evident that plant extracts could provide potential source of antifungal compoundsKing Saud universit...|$|E
40|$|Polyphasic {{analysis}} exposed important heterogeneity between bacterial strains catalogued as Xanthomonas arboricola pv. fragariae (Xaf) {{from different}} culture collections. Two draft whole-genome sequences revealed pathogenicity related genes of the type-three secretion system in strain LMG 19146, whereas none {{were found in}} the Xaf pathotype strain LMG 19145. Also, considerable sequence divergence was observed in the phylogenetic marker genes gyrB, rpoD, dnaK and fyuA. Further study of 16 Xaf culture-collection strains showed that co-classification is not justified. Partial 16 S rRNA gene and gyrB sequencing demonstrated that 12 strains belonged to X. arboricola, but that they did not form one homogeneous group within the species. The four remaining strains were identified as Xanthomonas fragariae and Xanthomonas sp. All sequence-based identifications were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting. Also, the pathogenicity genes hrcQ and avrBs 2 were detected in only three of the 12 analysed X. arboricola strains. The X. arboricola and Xanthomonas sp. strains showed <b>pectolytic</b> <b>activity,</b> and upon inoculation in strawberry none of the strains reproduced the leaf blight symptoms reported for Xaf. This study demonstrates that (i) no clear criteria exist for the identification of strains as Xaf, (ii) the name Xaf is currently used for a genetically diverse assortment of strains, and (iii) the species X. arboricola holds many undetermined plant-associated bacteria besides the described pathovars...|$|E
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} research, {{performed}} by some students in Food Science and Technology of Foggia University, is to show how perform {{the selection of a}} functional starter through a step-by-step procedure. Fifteen yeast strains were studied in order to assess their biotechnological traits, e. g. catalase, urease, B-glucosidase, <b>pectolytic</b> and xylanolytic <b>activities,</b> production of H 2 S, resistance to copper, SO 2 and acetic acid, growth at different temperatures, alkaline pH, in presence of different amounts of ethanol and glucose, and some probiotic properties.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 This {{investigation}} was undertaken to determine 1) {{the effects of}} various carbon sources in defined media on pectolytic enzyme production, 2) {{the effect of the}} incubation period on <b>pectolytic</b> enzyme <b>activity,</b> and 3) the development of improved methods for the purification and characterization of the polygalacturonases (PG) produced by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Optimum PG and pectinesterase (PE) production on pectin medium occurred in nine days while 11 days were required for optimum pectin methyl trans-eliminase (PMTE) synthesis. PMTE was the predominant enzyme synthesized on polygalacturonic acid (PGA) with trace amounts of PG and PE. Optimum PMTE synthesis occurred in five days, while PG and PE activity decreased after three days of incubation. Only trace amounts of PG and PMTE were detected in cultures in which glucose was the sole carbon source, and PE production was greater on glucose than on PGA. Polygalacturonate trans-eliminase was not detected in any of the cultures. The action of these enzymes was determined on purified pectic substrates, using improved viscosity reduction and reducing group assays, as well as thin layer chromatography (TLC) procedures for the detection of hydrolysis products. Only endo-PG and endo-PMTE activity was present in the pectin, PGA, and glucose culture filtrates. The results obtained from the TLC of the PG-reaction-mixtures indicated a preferential release of mono-galacturonic acid from PGA, which suggest exo-PG activity. However, this enzyme probably was not an exo-PG because {{only a small number of}} the total α- 1, 4 linkages were hydrolyzed at relatively high levels of viscosity reduction. About 90...|$|R
40|$|The phytopathogenic enterobacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi excretes {{multiple}} isozymes of {{the plant}} tissue-disintegrating enzyme, pectate lyase (PL). Genes encoding PL were cloned from E. chrysanthemi CUCPB 1237 into Escherichia coli HB 101 by inserting Sau 3 A-generated DNA fragments into the BamHI site of pBR 322 and then screening recombinant transformants for the ability to sink into pectate semisolid agar. Restriction mapping of the cloned DNA in eight pectolytic transformants revealed overlapping portions of a 9. 8 -kilobase region of the E. chrysanthemi genome. Deletion derivatives of these plasmids were used to localize the pectolytic genotype to a 2. 5 -kilobase region of the cloned DNA. PL gene expression in E. coli was independent of vector promoters, repressed by glucose, and not induced by galacturonan. PL accumulated largely in the periplasmic space of E. coli. An activity stain {{used in conjunction with}} ultrathin-layer isoelectric focusing resolved the PL in E. chrysanthemi culture supernatants and shock fluids of E. coli clones into multiple forms. One isozyme with an apparent pI of 7. 8 was produced at a far higher level in E. coli and was common to all of the <b>pectolytic</b> clones. <b>Activity</b> staining of renatured PL in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels revealed that this isozyme comigrated with the corresponding isozyme produced by E. chrysanthemi. The PL isozyme profiles produced by different clones and deletion derivative subclones suggest that the cloned region contains at least two PL isozyme structural genes. Pectolytic E. coli clones possessed a limited ability to macerate potato tuber tissues...|$|R
