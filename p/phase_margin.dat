40|$|A {{new method}} for {{analyzing}} {{the stability and}} robustness of multirate and periodically time varying systems is presented. It is shown that a multirate or periodically time varying system can be transformed into an equivalent time invariant system. For a SISO system, traditional gain and <b>phase</b> <b>margins</b> can be found by direct application of the Nyquist criterion to this equivalent time invariant system. For a MIMO system, structured and unstructured singular values {{can be used to}} determine the system's robustness. The limitations and implications of utilizing this equivalent time invariant system for calculating gain and <b>phase</b> <b>margins,</b> and for estimating robustness via singular value analysis are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Due to a {{need for}} {{improved}} reliability and performance in aerospace systems, there is increased interest {{in the use of}} adaptive control or other nonlinear, time-varying control designs in aerospace vehicles. While such techniques are built on Lyapunov stability theory, they lack an accompanying set of metrics for the assessment of stability margins such as the classical gain and <b>phase</b> <b>margins</b> used in linear time-invariant systems. Such metrics must both be physically meaningful and permit the user to draw conclusions in a straightforward fashion. We present in this paper a roadmap to the development of metrics appropriate to nonlinear, time-varying systems. We also present two case studies in which frozen-time gain and <b>phase</b> <b>margins</b> incorrectly predict stability or instability. We then present a multi-resolution analysis approach that permits on-line real-time stability assessment of nonlinear systems...|$|R
25|$|In 1938, he {{developed}} asymptotic phase and magnitude plots, {{now known as}} Bode plots, which displayed the frequency response of systems clearly.

25|$|When the {{open-loop}} gain has several poles, {{rather than the}} single pole of the above example, feedback can result in complex poles (real and imaginary parts). In a two-pole case, the result is peaking in the frequency response of the feedback amplifier near its corner frequency and ringing and overshoot in its step response. In the case {{of more than two}} poles, the feedback amplifier can become unstable and oscillate.

40|$|A multirate {{control law}} {{synthesized}} algorithm {{based on an}} infinite-time quadratic cost function, was developed along with a method for analyzing the robustness of multirate systems. A generalized multirate sampled-data control law structure (GMCLS) was introduced. A new infinite-time-based parameter optimization multirate sampled-data control law synthesis method and solution algorithm were developed. A singular-value-based method for determining gain and <b>phase</b> <b>margins</b> for multirate systems was also developed. The finite-time-based parameter optimization multirate sampled-data control law synthesis algorithm originally intended {{to be applied to}} the aircraft problem was instead demonstrated by application to a simpler problem involving the control of the tip position of a two-link robot arm.

The VNAV control system has a speed-on-elevator control mode to pitch the aircraft for tracking a calibrated airspeed (CAS) or Mach number profile and a path control mode for tracking the VNAV altitude profile. Mode control logic was developed for engagement of either the speed or path control modes. The control system will level the aircraft {{to prevent it from}} flying through a constraint altitude. A stability analysis was performed that showed that the gain and <b>phase</b> <b>margins</b> of the VNAV control system significantly exceeded the design gain and <b>phase</b> <b>margins.</b> The system performance was assessed using a six-deg-of-freedom non-linear transport aircraft simulation and the performance is illustrated with time-history plots of recorded simulation data...|$|R

If we know f180 for the amplifier at hand, the gain margin can be found approximately, but f180 then depends on the third and higher pole positions, as does the gain margin, unlike the estimate of <b>phase</b> <b>margin,</b> which is a two-pole estimate. [...] The procedure outlined in the Bode plot article is followed. Figure 5 is the Bode gain plot for the two-pole amplifier in the range of frequencies up to the second pole position. The assumption behind Figure 5 is that the frequency f0dB lies between the lowest pole at f1=1/(2πτ1) and the second pole at f2=1/(2πτ2). As indicated in Figure 5, this condition is satisfied for values ofα≥1.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} that examined how {{changes in a}} motion platform drive filter affect pilot-vehicle performance and opinion {{was conducted on the}} NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator. Pilots controlled a simplified helicopter model in the vertical or the directional axis and tracked a randomly moving target aircraft {{in the presence of a}} random disturbance. With both tasks, variations from full motion to fixed-base conditions were made in the high-pass drive filter gain and natural frequency. The results indicate that vertical motion did not affect the open-loop pilot-vehicle target-tracking crossover frequency, but target-tracking <b>phase</b> <b>margins</b> improved with increased filter gain or decreased natural frequency. Vertical disturbance-rejection crossover frequency increased with decreasing filter natural frequency, while disturbance rejection <b>phase</b> <b>margins</b> improved with increasing filter gain.

2500|$|The primary {{function}} is to determine loop dynamics, also called stability. [...] This is how the loop responds to disturbances, such as changes in the reference frequency, changes of the feedback divider, or at startup. [...] Common considerations are the range over which the loop can achieve lock (pull-in range, lock range or capture range), how fast the loop achieves lock (lock time, lock-up time or settling time) and damping behavior. [...] Depending on the application, this may require {{one or more of}} the following: a simple proportion (gain or attenuation), an integral (low pass filter) and/or derivative (high pass filter). [...] Loop parameters commonly examined for this are the loop's gain margin and <b>phase</b> <b>margin.</b> [...] Common concepts in control theory including the PID controller are used to design this function.|$|E
5000|$|In practice, {{feedback}} amplifiers must {{be designed}} with phase margins substantially {{in excess of}} 0°, even though amplifiers with phase margins of, say, 1° are theoretically stable. The reason is that many practical factors can reduce the <b>phase</b> <b>margin</b> below the theoretical minimum. A prime example is when the amplifier's output is connected to a capacitive load. Therefore, operational amplifiers are usually compensated to achieve a minimum <b>phase</b> <b>margin</b> of 45° or so. This means that at the frequency at which the open and closed loop gains meet, the phase angle is &minus;135°. The calculation is: -135° - (-180°) = 45°. [...] See Warwickor Stoutfor {{a detailed analysis of}} the techniques and results of compensation to ensure adequate phase margins. See also the article [...] "Pole splitting". Often amplifiers are designed to achieve a typical <b>phase</b> <b>margin</b> of 60 degrees. If the typical <b>phase</b> <b>margin</b> is around 60 degrees then the minimum <b>phase</b> <b>margin</b> will typically be greater than 45 degrees. A <b>phase</b> <b>margin</b> of 60 degrees is also a magic number because it allows for the fastest settling time when attempting to follow a voltage step input (a Butterworth design). An amplifier with lower <b>phase</b> <b>margin</b> will ring for longer and an amplifier with more <b>phase</b> <b>margin</b> will take a longer time to rise to the voltage step's final level.|$|E
