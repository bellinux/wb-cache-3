40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the readability of fluorescent paint marks {{for the development}} process concerning code marking of logs using automatic vision systems. The result indicates that using fluorescent paint is a technique with many advantages e. g. offering the possibility to be read under ice. An imprint marking technique was tested in the recently finished European Community LINESET project. One disadvantage of using paint instead of the imprint technique {{is the cost of}} paint. Another is its sensitivity to weather conditions during marking, but the paint is much better discernible for a vision system than the imprint code-mark also the mechanical constraints at <b>paint</b> <b>marking</b> are lower than at the imprinting. Key words: Code-marking of logs, marking-reading system, fluorescence paint, environmental conditions in wood processing chain 1. INTRODUCTION — WH...|$|E
40|$|Payloads {{for small}} robotic {{platforms}} {{have historically been}} designed and implemented as platform and task specific solutions. A consequence {{of this approach is}} that payloads cannot be deployed on different robotic platforms without substantial re-engineering efforts. To address this issue, we developed a modular countermine payload that is designed from the ground-up to be platform agnostic. The payload consists of the multi-mission payload controller unit (PCU) coupled with the configurable mission specific threat detection, navigation and marking payloads. The multi-mission PCU has all the common electronics to control and interface to all the payloads. It also contains the embedded processor {{that can be used to}} run the navigational and control software. The PCU has a very flexible robot interface which can be configured to interface to various robot platforms. The threat detection payload consists of a two axis sweeping arm and the detector. The navigation payload consists of several perception sensors that are used for terrain mapping, obstacle detection and navigation. Finally, the marking payload consists of a dual-color <b>paint</b> <b>marking</b> system. Through the multi-mission PCU, all these payloads are packaged in a platform agnostic way to allow deployment on multiple robotic platforms, including Talon and Packbot...|$|E
40|$|Chip seals {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the US for preventive maintenance. However, damage due to snow plows, wet and cold weather and extensive solar radiation contribute to poorer performance than at lower elevations. Therefore, an experimental program was begun to evaluate these and other factors affecting long term performance of chip seals. Fog seals are often placed on chip seals in the US immediately after chip sealing, but the benefits have not been well documented. Also, chip seals often do not adhere to reflective <b>paint</b> <b>marking</b> after sealing. This paper describes an experimental pavement constructed to evaluate {{the performance of a}} chip seal placed at the top of Poncha Pass, CO (elevation 9012 ft/ 2745 m) and also {{at the bottom of the}} pass (elevation 6825 ft/ 2081 m) to evaluate the benefits of fog sealing and removal of reflective paint markings prior to sealing [...] Twenty test sections were constructed in all to evaluate the performance of the seals with and without fog sealing, with and without paint removal, with controls. Results indicate that fog sealing may be effective when placed after chip sealing and that reflective paint removal is the only effective method to assure against chip loss due to reflective paint...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on studies of Formica lugubris from 1972 - 1975. While this species 2 ̆ 7 range is {{diminishing}} in Ireland, the nests are quite common in the State plantations of South Tipperary. It is not certain that the species is indigenous. Above-ground activity occurs from late-February {{to the end of}} October; foraging begins in April. Two territorial "spring-battles" between neighbouring nests are described. Most active nests produced alatae of both sexes and flights were observed on successive June mornings above l 7. 5 °C air temperature. Both polygyny and polycaly seem to be rare. Where the nests occur commonly, the recorded densities are similar to those reported from the continent. Most nests persisted at the same site since 1973. The nest-sites are described by recording an array of nest, soil, tree, vegetation and location variables at each site. Pinus sylvestris is the most important overhead tree. Nests seem to be the same age as their surrounding plantation and reach a maximum of c. 30 years. Nearest-neighbour analysis suggests the sites are overdispersed. Forager route-fidelity was studied and long-term absence from the route, anaesthetization and "removal" of an aphid tree had little effect on this fidelity. There were no identifiable groups of workers specifically honeydew or prey-carriers. Size-duty relationships of workers participating in adult transport are described. Foraging rhythms were studied on representative days: the numbers foraging were linearly related to temperature. Route-traffic passed randomly and an average foraging trip lasted c. four hours. Annual food intake to a nest with 25 000 foragers was estimated at approximately 75 kg honeydew and 2 million prey-items. Forager-numbers and colony-size were estimated using the capture-mark - recapture method: <b>paint</b> <b>marking</b> was used for the forager estimate and an interval radiophosphorus mark, detected by autoradiography, was used for the colony-size estimate. The aphids attended by lugubris and the nest myrmecophiles are recorded...|$|E
