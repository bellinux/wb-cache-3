A certain understanding of the practical aspects of numerical modeling is also a useful facet in computer science education. The reason is that, in addition to their traditional prime r^ole in computational science and engineering, numerical techniques are also increasingly employed in seemingly nonnumerical settings as large-scale data mining and web searching.

40|$|Evidence-based crime {{prevention}} requires sound evaluations to be conducted. Unfortunately, few {{crime prevention}} programs in Australia are ever rigorously evaluated.

The course is taught to small groups of up to three students and takes 1 - 3 hours to complete. This practical course is not a substitute for site-specific On-the-Job Training; it does, however, provide a good introduction in core laser safety practices that can be broadly applied. Alignment and diagnostic tasks are performed with low power lasers. Students learn safe alignment and diagnostic techniques and how to avoid common mistakes that might lead to an accident. The class is taught by laser supervisors, enabling them to assess the skill level of new laser personnel and determine the subsequent level of supervision needed. The course has six alignment tasks. For each task, discussion points are given for the instructor to review with the students. The optics setup includes different wavelength lasers, a beam expander, mirrors, irises, a periscope, a beam-splitting polarizer and a diffraction grating. Diagnostic tools include viewing cards, an IR viewer and a ccd camera. Laser eyewear is available to block some laser wavelengths in the setup...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{numerous}} {{computer assisted}} learning (CAL) programmes based on new teaching methods, as {{for example the}} principles of cognitive apprenticeship and problem based learning, have euphorically been developed for various medical fields. However, many of these programmes failed due to either low acceptance, economic inefficiency, or, most seriously, problems with the implementation and evaluation in medical curricula. In 1999, the <b>practical</b> <b>training</b> <b>course</b> ‘Dermatology 2000 ’, an interactive multimedia programme for dermatological education, was developed and completely integrated into the regular dermatological curriculum of five German medical schools. The formative evaluation of an implemented relational database revealed contemporary information about the programme's quantity of use. So far, 3050 students have participated in 6557 lessons. The evaluation of two online questionnaires showed a high learner acceptance regarding the programme's instructional design, ergonomics, and didactical presentation and, after completion of Dermatology 2000, an increased interest in medical education software. A comparison of the objective learning outcome illustrated that Dermatology 2000 students (n =  31) not only outperformed non-participants (n =  7) but also showed a (10 %) lower rate of errors in a conventional knowledge test. Additionally, single-case studies demonstrated the increased ability of participating students to apply the acquired knowledge to diagnostic problems. We conclude that the implementation of CAL in present medical curricula can contribute to reformations of medical education. The instructional design of Dermatology 2000 is well accepted and suitable to provide both theoretic biomedical knowledge and clinical skills...|$|E
40|$|Objectives : Since the {{laboratory}} medicine {{students have a}} special training course for improving their practical skills in different laboratories, {{it is necessary to}} pay more attention to this course to minimize the diagnostic errors committed by these students. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the students' knowledge and practical skills to prevent and minimize the common diagnostic errors made by them. Method : In this descriptive cross-sectional study, the knowledge and practice of 75 laboratory students, who were passing the <b>practical</b> <b>training</b> <b>course,</b> were evaluated for the factors that might cause diagnostic errors in medical mycology laboratory. Results : The students' knowledge was better than their practical skills on factors that caused errors in diagnostic mycology laboratory. On the whole, 64. 7 % of the participants had good knowledge about factors that caused false positive and/or false negative results in direct microscopy. However, the rate of their practical skills was only 39. 9 % in this regard. In reporting the culture results, 65. 35 % of students had desirable knowledge about the false positive and false negative results, but only 46 % of them had good practical skills in cultivation and reading the cultures. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference between the students' knowledge and practice with their sex (p = 0. 073). Conclusion : Since there is currently an increasing trend in the prevalence of fungal opportunistic infections, accurate and prompt diagnosis can be very useful. It is important to have more inspection on the medical laboratory technology students' training course for accurate and useful courses...|$|E
30|$|Program Description Public Sector Work {{programs}} are state-funded temporary employment {{opportunities in the}} public sector that usually involve production of socially valuable goods or services. The {{programs are}} mainly aimed at creating employment opportunities and giving youth some work experience. While they may comprise parallel participation in <b>practical</b> <b>training</b> <b>courses,</b> they are often intended to familiarize inexperienced, disadvantaged youth with a routine work environment. Participants usually receive a low level of remuneration during participation. While this may increase the willingness of youth to participate in the program, this may also have the unintended effect of reducing the search effort for “real” jobs. Also, as public work programs do not establish contact to “real” firms or employers, they do not offer a direct way into the labor market.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} my thesis is Nosocomial infections spread by the {{personnel}} of {{intensive care unit}} in the hospital in Liberec. The main reason for the choice of this topic was my encounter with this infection when I worked as a nurse during my <b>practical</b> <b>training</b> <b>course.</b> Nosocomial infection {{can be defined as}} an infection originating from the encounter between a micro-organism and a patient. The patient can be weakened by his or her primary disorder and therapeutic interventions. This fact helps create an optimal environment for spreading the infection. Nosocomial infections occur only in specific conditions. They represent a problem which is necessary to solve. They affect on average 5 to 10 % of patients. If they are present in organism, the course of primary disorder can worsen and the permanent consequence or death may occur. They also bring adverse economic consequences because they require significant financial costs linked to treatment with prolonged stay in hospital. My thesis was divided into two parts-theoretical and practical. In both of them I tried to find answers to my questions (in form of hypotheses). In theoretical part I described the history of nosocomial infections, which is narrowly related to construction of hospitals; then I mapped the origin and spread of nosocomial infections and also their laboratory diagnostics, treatment and prevention. In practical part I devoted myself to research which is focused on evaluation of level of sanitary washing in medical personnel in intensive care units, and also on personnel ´s knowledge of nosocomial infections by means of questionnaires. I evaluated eighty questionnaires, which were distributed in the hospital in Liberec. The questionnaires were also filled in by students of nursing subject at university in Liberec. These students perform their practical training in the hospital in Liberec. The results of research show that sanitary washing of medical personnel in intensive care unit is adequate and their knowledge of nosocomial infections is average. The knowledge of students is average, too. The research proves that sanitary washing is not an adequate prevention of nosocomial infections...|$|E
