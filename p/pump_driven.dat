25|$|The full remedy {{was to use}} the Bendix-Stromberg {{pressure}} carburettor, {{which allowed}} more precise metering {{of the amount of}} fuel used by the engine and prevented fuel starvation. This new carburettor was used from the Merlin 66 series and on all Griffon engines. In these engines the carburettor injected fuel at 5 psi through a nozzle direct into the supercharger and the compressed air-fuel mixture was then directed to the cylinders. The final development was the SU injection carburettor, that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures; although this was fitted to the 100 series Merlins, which were not used in production Spitfires, it was used in the Griffon 60 and 80 series.|$|E

500|$|The {{low-pressure}} fuel turbopump (LPFTP) is an axial-flow <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by a two-stage turbine {{powered by}} gaseous hydrogen. It boosts {{the pressure of}} the liquid hydrogen from 30 to 276 psia (0.2 to 1.9 MPa) and supplies it to the high-pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP). During engine operation, the pressure boost provided by the LPFTP permits the HPFTP to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPFTP operates at around 16,185 rpm, and is approximately [...] in size. It is connected to the vehicle propellant ducting and is supported in a fixed position by being mounted to the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E
500|$|The HPFTP is a three-stage {{centrifugal}} <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by a two-stage hot-gas turbine. It boosts {{the pressure}} of the liquid hydrogen from 1.9 to 45 MPa (276 to 6,515 psia), and operates at approximately 35,360rpm with a power of 71,140hp. The discharge flow from the turbopump is routed to, and through, the main valve and is then split into three flow paths. One path is through the jacket of the main combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is used to cool the chamber walls. It is then routed from the main combustion chamber to the LPFTP, where it is used to drive the LPFTP turbine. A small portion of the flow from the LPFTP is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to the liquid hydrogen tank to maintain pressurization. The remaining hydrogen passes between the inner and outer walls of the hot-gas manifold to cool it and is then discharged into the main combustion chamber. A second hydrogen flow path from the main fuel valve is through the engine nozzle (to cool the nozzle). It then joins the third flow path from the chamber coolant valve. This combined flow is then directed to the fuel and oxidizer preburners. The HPFTP is approximately [...] in size and is attached to the hot-gas manifold by flanges.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} economy {{situation}} companies {{try to reduce}} their expenses. One of the solutions {{is to improve the}} energy efficiency of the processes. It is known that the energy consumption of pumping applications range from 20 up to 50 % of the energy usage in the certain industrial plants operations. Some studies have shown that 30 % to 50 % of energy consumed by pump systems could be saved by changing the pump or the flow control method. The aim of this thesis is to create a mobile measurement system that can calculate a working point position of a <b>pump</b> <b>drive.</b> This information can be used to determine the efficiency of the <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> operation and to develop a solution to bring pump’s efficiency to a maximum possible value.

2500|$|With {{a view to}} {{improving}} the drainage of the Chase, an Act of Parliament obtained in 1862 created the Corporation of the Level of Hatfield Chase, which took over {{the management of the}} drainage from the individual Participants who had formerly been responsible for it. This act authorised further construction work, including a steam pumping engine for {{the northern part of the}} Chase. The areas which were subject to taxation were extended, and the act listed 21 townships and parishes which would be required to pay for the drainage works. The jurisdiction of the Court of Sewers was replaced by the meetings of the Corporation from 1862. The Corporation spent £8,887 on a new pumping station at Dirtness which was operational by 1865. The building contained two compound beam engines, driving a single scoop wheel which was [...] and weighed 80 tons. Bull Hassocks pumping station was upgraded in 1892. Two [...] centrifugal pumps were driven by [...] steam engines, and when both were running, the station could discharge 300 tons per minute (440 Megalitres per day (Mld)) into the South Engine Drain. Diesel engines gave way to electric pumps at Dirtness in 1928, when they were replaced by a Gwynnes Limited <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by an electric motor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or timing chain. [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used gear drive as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high maintenance routine. Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a timing belt. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the oil and fuel pumps. [...] Some vehicles may have the power steering <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> by the camshaft. [...] With some early fuel injection systems, cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive to the gear drive VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|E
2500|$|The Alexander Chaplin & Co. distilling {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} initially {{for use on}} board steam vessels where it could be supplied with steam from either the main boiler or a donkey boiler with cooling water circulation from a <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> from the main engine or an auxiliary. The subsequent addition of a steam powered circulating pump integral with the apparatus meant it could then {{also be used as}} a standalone apparatus on any vessel equipped with an existing donkey (auxiliary) boiler, such as a sailing ship equipped with steam winches. The apparatus consisted of a coiled condensing pipe approximately [...] in length placed inside a cylindrical casing filled with constantly changed cooling water. The casing was cast iron and the coils were made of copper. The coils were supplied with steam either from the exhaust of the engine, or from a feed directly from the boiler. A circulating pump, either driven from the main engine on a steam ship, or integrated with the apparatus on a sailing ship, supplied a constant stream of cooling water flowing through the condenser. A covered brass cup with small adjustable holes around the circumference was fitted at {{the upper end of the}} steam coil. In operation, a steam jet drew air in from the circumferential openings in the cup and filled the coils with a mixture of air and steam, both cooling the steam and reducing its pressure. As it passed down the coil, the air/steam mixture was further cooled by the surrounding water, and condensed as water droplets on the walls of the coil. The aerated water would collect as a clear, bright and odourless liquid at a temperature of about [...] at the bottom of the coil, to be drawn off for use. The machine could supply approximately [...] of water per hour. [...] "The samples of water subjected to analysis were collected at different times directly from the Patent Apparatus on board ship... and the results of my experiments with the water distilled in Alexander Chaplin & Co.'s are conclusive in showing that is of excellent quality in every particular." ...|$|E
