5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the <b>phrenic</b> nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior <b>phrenic</b> artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons. The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the <b>phrenic</b> nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve.|$|E
25|$|From above, the {{diaphragm}} receives blood from {{branches of the}} internal thoracic arteries, namely the pericardiophrenic artery and musculophrenic artery; from the superior <b>phrenic</b> arteries, which arise directly from the thoracic aorta; and from the lower internal intercostal arteries. From below, the inferior <b>phrenic</b> arteries supply {{the diaphragm}}.|$|E
25|$|If {{either the}} <b>phrenic</b> nerve, {{cervical}} spine or brainstem is damaged, this will sever the nervous {{supply to the}} diaphragm. The most common damage to the <b>phrenic</b> nerve is by bronchial cancer, which usually only affects {{one side of the}} diaphragm. Other causes include Guillain–Barré syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosis.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications include severe chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease, and paresis of the <b>phrenic</b> nerve on {{the opposite}} side as the block.|$|E
25|$|The <b>phrenic</b> nerve (which {{supplies}} the diaphragm) was cut or crushed {{so as to}} permanently paralyse the diaphragm on that side. The paralysed diaphragm would then rise up and the lung on that side would collapse, thus closing the cavity.|$|E
25|$|To {{its right}} side below is the brachiocephalic trunk, and above, the trachea, the {{inferior}} thyroid veins, and {{the remains of}} the thymus; to its left side are the left vagus and <b>phrenic</b> nerves, left pleura, and lung. The left subclavian artery is posterior and slightly lateral to it.|$|E
25|$|The nerves {{supplying}} the thymus {{arise from the}} vagus nerve and the cervical sympathetic chain. Branches from the <b>phrenic</b> nerves reach the investing capsule, but do not enter into the thymus itself. Although present, the exact role of the nerve supply of the thymus is little understood.|$|E
25|$|For the {{respiratory}} system, the LTF facilitated by intermittent hypoxia aids in increasing <b>phrenic</b> motor nerve output. This {{has been shown}} to help people with obstructive sleep apnea and COPD. The ability to increase muscle activity, specifically for walking, has also been demonstrated in both rats and humans after spinal cord injury.|$|E
25|$|The diaphragmatic {{surface of}} the spleen (or <b>phrenic</b> surface) is convex, smooth, and is {{directed}} upward, backward, and to the left, except at its upper end, where it is directed slightly to the middle. The spleen lies beneath the left diaphragm, beneath the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. The diaphragm separates the spleen from the pleura and base of the left lung.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the close}} {{proximity}} of the lung to the brachial plexus {{at the level of}} the clavicle, the complication most often associated with this block is pneumothorax — with a risk as high as 6.1%. Further complications of supraclavicular block include subclavian artery puncture, and spread of local anesthetic to cause paresis of the stellate ganglion, the <b>phrenic</b> nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
25|$|Complications {{associated}} with brachial plexus block include intra-arterial or intravenous injection, {{which can lead}} to local anesthetic toxicity. This may be characterized by serious central nervous system problems such as epileptic seizure, central nervous system depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects of local anesthetic toxicity include slowing of the heart rate and impairment of its ability to pump blood through the circulatory system, which may lead to circulatory collapse. In severe cases, cardiac dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death may occur. Other rare but serious complications from brachial plexus block include pneumothorax and persistent paresis of the <b>phrenic</b> nerve.|$|E
25|$|A {{very rare}} form {{includes}} the diaphragmatic flutter, the Belly Dancer's Syndrome, or Van Leeuwenhoek's disease. It was first described by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1723, {{who suffered from}} it. The condition characterizes spoken communication {{that sounds like a}} short-breathed hiccup. These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day. Rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the average rate found to be 150. Studies show that possible causes include disruptions within the central or peripheral nervous systems, anxiety, nutritional disorder, and certain pharmaceuticals. No single treatment has proven effective, though blocking or crushing of the <b>phrenic</b> nerve can provide instantaneous relief when pharmacologic treatment has proven ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Madonna was {{admitted}} to Sanator in September 1950. She found this hospital {{very different from the}} Indian San. The grounds around the building were landscaped with trees and flowers, and patients were allowed to wear their own clothing and walk around the grounds. Her doctor, Dr. W. L. Meyers vowed to Madonna’s parents that he would do everything in his power to help their daughter. The initial treatment was to pump air into the abdomen, and after that proved to be unsuccessful, they tried pumping air into her back to collapse the bad lung, which also failed. They next tried an operation called a <b>phrenic</b> which would permanently collapse her infected lung, again it failed to kill the TB.|$|E
25|$|Reduced partial {{pressures}} of {{oxygen in the}} arteries due to intermittent hypoxia are sensed by and stimulate the carotid body, a chemoafferent receptor. The activated carotid body triggers the release of serotonin that attach to serotonin receptors {{on the surface of}} motoneurons, such as the <b>phrenic</b> motoneuron in the case of respiratory recovery. This signal transduction pathway then uses downstream molecules such as TrkB, BDNF, and PKA to increase the synaptic output of the involved motor neuron which in turn increases the motor output of the involved muscles and, thus, decreases functional impairment. As the amount of intermittent hypoxia changes the amount of serotonin release and, as a result, the amount of LTF, this process exhibits metaplasticity. Metaplasticity occurs when the LTF is itself plastic or variable.|$|E
25|$|The {{axillary}} {{block is}} particularly useful in providing anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgery to the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. The axillary block {{is also the}} safest of the four main approaches to the brachial plexus, as it does not risk paresis of the <b>phrenic</b> nerve, nor does it {{have the potential to}} cause pneumothorax. In the axilla, the nerves of the brachial plexus and the axillary artery are enclosed together in a fibrous sheath which is a continuation of the deep cervical fascia. The easily palpated axillary artery thus serves as a reliable anatomical landmark for this block, and the injection of local anesthetic close to this artery frequently leads to a good block of the brachial plexus. The axillary block is commonly performed due to its ease of performance and relatively high success rate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{diaphragm}} {{is primarily}} innervated by the <b>phrenic</b> nerve which is formed from the cervical nerves C3, C4 and C5. [...] While the central {{portion of the}} diaphragm sends sensory afferents via the <b>phrenic</b> nerve, the peripheral portions of the diaphragm send sensory afferents via the intercostal (T5–T11) and subcostal nerves (T12).|$|E
2500|$|Because the {{earliest}} {{element of the}} embryological diaphragm, the septum transversum, forms in the cervical region, the <b>phrenic</b> nerve that innervates the diaphragm originates from the cervical spinal cord (C3,4, and 5). [...] As the septum transversum descends inferiorly, the <b>phrenic</b> nerve follows, accounting for its circuitous route from the upper cervical vertebrae, around the pericardium, finally to innervate the diaphragm.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brachial plexus}} is {{a bundle of}} nerves innervating the {{shoulder}} and arm and can be blocked at different levels {{depending on the type}} of upper extremity surgery being performed. [...] Interscalene brachial plexus blocks can be done before shoulder, arm, and elbow surgery. The interscalene block is done at the neck where the brachial plexus emerges between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. [...] Lidocaine is injected first to numb the skin and then a blunt needle is used to protect the nerves from damage as the physician places the needle very close to the nerves. The needle goes in about 3–4cm and a single shot of local anesthetic is injected or a catheter is placed. The most common local anesthetics used at the site of the nerves are bupivicaine, mepivicaine, and chloroprocaine. [...] There is a very high chance that the <b>phrenic</b> nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, will be blocked so this block should only be done on patients who have use of their accessory respiratory muscles. The block may not affect the C8 and T1 roots which supply part of the hand, so it is usually not done for hand surgeries.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{important}} or common causes of {{shortness of breath}} include cardiac tamponade, anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease, panic attacks, and pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac tamponade presents with dyspnea, tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, and pulsus paradoxus. The gold standard for diagnosis is ultrasound. Anaphylaxis typically begins over a few minutes in {{a person with a}} previous history of the same. Other symptoms include urticaria, throat swelling, and gastrointestinal upset. The primary treatment is epinephrine. Interstitial lung disease presents with gradual onset of shortness of breath typically with a history of a predisposing environmental exposure. Shortness of breath is often the only symptom in those with tachydysrhythmias. Panic attacks typically present with hyperventilation, sweating, and numbness. They are however a diagnosis of exclusion. Around 2/3 of women experience shortness of breath {{as a part of a}} normal pregnancy. Neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury, <b>phrenic</b> nerve injuries, Guillain–Barré syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy can all cause an individual to experience shortness of breath. Shortness of breath can also occur as a result of vocal cord dysfunction (VCD). [...] Another condition involving shortness of breath is empty nose syndrome.{Citation needed} ...|$|E

60|$|Section 133. There {{are eight}} {{cervical}} (spinal) nerves, {{one in front}} of the atlas, and one behind each of the cervical vertebrae. The last four and the first thoracic (spinal) contribute to a leash of nerves running out to the fore limb, the brachial plexus (plexus, literally network, but here meaning a plaited cord). The fourth cervical also sends down a <b>phrenic</b> nerve (p.n., Figure 1), along by the external jugular vein and the superior caval vein to the diaphragm. The last three lumbar and the sacral nerves form a sacral plexus, supplying the hind limb.|$|E
6000|$|Second Dissection.-- Skin {{front of}} thorax and neck. Note subclavian veins running out to fore limbs-- avoid cutting these. Cut through ribs and remove front of thorax, to expose its contents; cut up middle line of neck, and clear off small muscle bands, to expose bloodvessels; pick away {{carefully}} whatever {{is left of}} thymus gland; make out structure of heart and blood-vessels, as described, in Chapter 3; note larynx and trachea. Now proceed to {{the examination of the}} nerves of this region. See <b>phrenic</b> nerve, by vena cava inferior, and between heart and lungs, and sympathetic, running {{over the heads of the}} ribs. By the common carotids will be found the large white vagus nerve, the greyish sympathetic, and a small branch of X., the depressor. Make out branches of X. named in text. The big white cervical spinal nerves will be evident dorsally. Clear forward into the angle between the jaw and the bulla tympani, to see XII. and XI.; IX. will be found, lying deeper, dorsal to the carotid artery and body of the hyoid. Compare with figure given of this. Skin the cheek, and see VII. running over it. Cut through malar and remove it; cut through lower jaw-bone and turn it back, to see the third branch of the fifth nerve on its inner side; examine the muscles of eyeball, and remove it, to expose the first and second branches of V.-- the latter is especially deep within orbit. Remove, open, wash out, and examine the heart. Shave off the dorsal wall of cranium, to expose hemispheres of brain, and then put the head in strong spirit for a week or so. With a second rabbit, this dissection may advantageously be varied by removing the lower jaw, cutting -up- [through] soft palate, and observing openings of the Eustachian tubes. [The tonsils (on the ventral side of the soft palate) must not confused with these.] The heart should also be cut out, washed out and examined (Compare Sections 38, 44.) ...|$|E
50|$|Most {{often it}} is {{a branch of the}} nerve to the subclavius and may contain {{numerous}} <b>phrenic</b> nerve fibers. If the accessory <b>phrenic</b> nerve is present, it lies lateral to the main nerve and descends posterior and occasionally inferior to the subclavian vein.

The right <b>phrenic</b> nerve may be crushed by the vena cava clamp during liver transplantation. [...] Severing the <b>phrenic</b> nerve, or a phrenectomy, will paralyse that half of the diaphragm. Diaphragm paralysis is best demonstrated by sonography. Breathing will be made more difficult but will continue provided the other nerve is intact.|$|E
50|$|The Mark IV Breathing Pacemaker is a <b>phrenic</b> nerve stimulator, {{also called}} a {{diaphragm}} pacemaker. <b>Phrenic</b> nerve stimulation {{is a technique}} whereby a nerve stimulator provides electrical stimulation of the <b>phrenic</b> nerve to cause diaphragmatic contraction. It consists of surgically implanted receivers and electrodes mated to an external transmitter by antennas worn over the implanted receivers. An external battery-operated transmitter sends radiofrequency energy to the receiver through an antenna, which {{is placed on the}} skin overlying the receiver. The receiver converts this energy into an electric current that is directed to the <b>phrenic</b> nerve in order to stimulate the nerve, thereby causing contraction of the diaphragm. The surgery can be performed via either a cervical or thoracic approach. <b>Phrenic</b> pacing provides ventilatory support for patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency whose diaphragm, lungs, and <b>phrenic</b> nerves have residual function.|$|E
