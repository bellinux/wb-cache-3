40|$|The lateral {{response}} of axially restrained beams with various end conditions is presented herein using nonlinear analysis. The beams were studied for three end conditions, with two lengths per end condition and two magnitudes of point loads per length. The {{method of analysis}} was performed using geometrically non-linear analysis. Material nonlinear analysis was not considered. This method of analysis, {{which is based on}} Eulerian (corotational) formulation and includes thermal effects, was published by Kassimali and Garcilazo (2010). Graphical results are shown for the {{response of}} the beams. The results are also compared to published values given in the AISC manual. 	The following conclusions were shown from this study: 1) 	When comparing the <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> (both deflection and bending moment) found in this study to the <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> given in the AISC manual, the data shows similar values in the pre-buckling region. However, once the temperature is raised high enough and the beam enters the post-buckling region, significant difference in the <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> can be seen. The beams in this study showed that the <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> do not increase greatly during post-buckling. The values given in the AISC manual on the other hand show an indefinite increase in <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> once the buckling stage is reached. It is thought that this decrease in <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> in post-buckling is due to the increased strength in the beams from catenary forces that are developed. 2) 	When comparing similar beams (same end conditions and same lateral loads), the length of the beam will {{play a role in the}} lateral response to thermal loading. It was consistently shown in all end support conditions that the shorter beams developed higher <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> compared to the longer beams. This difference was not substantial in the pre-buckling stage, but once the beam approached the critical temperature and into the post-buckling range, the difference in <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> became significant. 3) 	Along the same lines, comparing beams with the same end conditions and same length, the magnitude of the lateral load also played a role in the lateral response of the beams. The beams with the lighter lateral loads would develop higher <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> than the heavier loaded beams. As with the length, the lateral loads didn’t have much difference until the beams would approach the critical temperature. However, after that point, the difference of the <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> would become quite large...|$|R

Its spatial and temporal variability is strongly controlled by spatial and temporal variability in soil hydraulic properties and hydrologic forcings. Unfortunately, it is not clear how to parameterize soil hydraulic properties and hydrological processes as a function of scale, and how to test deterministic models with regard to epistemic uncertainties. In this study, high resolution simulations were conducted in the highly instrumented Wüstebach catchment with the TERENO observatory Eifel/Rur. Digital elevation models (DEMs) with a resolution of 1, 5, 10, and 20 m were used to calculate information loss of profile curvature by spatial aggregation. An <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> was applied to upscale interpolated hydraulic conductivity to compensate for the loss of information content of curvature distribution caused by spatial aggregation from high resolution case (1 m) to lower resolution cases (5 m, 10 m, and 20 m). Four different cases with respect to the use of the <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> were analyzed and discussed: 1) no <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> applied, 2) <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> applied to all aggregated grid cells, 3) <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> applied to aggregated grid cells where high standard deviation of slopes exist in the 1 m DEM, and 4) <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> applied to aggregated grid cells with low values of average slope over maximum slope within each 10 x 10 block in the 1 m DEM.

40|$|The {{management}} {{of a network}} of existing road bridges involves interventions in order to maintain safety and the priority of these interventions is often determined by safety criteria. During the evaluation of safety, the dynamic effect of traffic actions is considered using equivalent static loads determined by multiplying the effect calculated using traffic load models by a dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor.</b> During the evaluation of a deck slab, the application of inappropriate dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> could have significant financial implications, all the more since the local dynamic effects of overloaded trucks are determinant for this type of structural element. Dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> defined in codes have usually been derived from the measurement of global traffic action effects in the main structural elements of bridges. Unfortunately, local dynamic effects in deck slabs have not been studied in detail until now. A better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of deck slabs will lead to the definition of more accurate dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> and avoid the use of values that are too conservative. The behaviour of deck slabs of six typical Swiss highway bridges has been simulated in order to study their dynamic response during the passage of trucks. The structural arrangement of the deck slab was different for each of the six bridges. A parametric study was based on the simulation of various scenarios involving the passage of trucks for various combinations of speed, path and road surface roughness. Deck slab response was obtained by numerical simulation based on models of the bridge, truck and road surface. This system was resolved using a prediction - correction algorithm that considers the dynamic interaction between a bridge and trucks. Dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors</b> were subsequently calculated from strains and deflections obtained from independent static and dynamic simulations. The simulation of numerous scenarios enabled the evaluation of the influence of different parameters on the dynamic response of a deck slab: The road surface roughness was found {{to be one of the}} most important parameters, with an increase in roughness leading to an increase in dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors.</b> An overloaded truck produces a lower dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> in a deck slab than an empty truck. The truck speed influences the dynamic interaction, but a clear relationship between speed and dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> could not be identified. The maximum dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> does not vary significantly from one point to another over a deck slab in a girder bridge. The structural arrangement of a deck slab in a girder bridge has little influence on dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factors.</b> Overall, the different deck slabs on the girder bridges studied were all equally sensitive to the dynamic effects of road traffic. In many cases considered for the framed slab bridge, the maximum dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor</b> was found to occur over the supports. For such bridges, the sensitivity of the deck slab to the dynamic effects of road traffic is not uniform. Finally, two approaches to evaluating deck slabs of existing road bridges are proposed. The first approach is only applicable in certain situations and involves a simplified evaluation using an updated traffic load model and a dynamic <b>amplification</b> <b>factor.</b> In situations where a simplified evaluation is not applicable, the second approach is to evaluate a deck slab using numerical or experimental analyses...|$|R
