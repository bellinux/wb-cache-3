As amostragens foram realizadas {{de janeiro}} de 2004 Ã dezembro de 2008, com periodicidade trimestral nos reservatÃrios de Foz do Areia, Segredo e Salto Caxias, enquanto que nos reservatÃrios de Salto Santiago e Salto OsÃrio as amostragens foram bimestrais. As capturas foram realizadas com o auxÃlio de redes de espera simples (malhas de 2, 4 a 16 cm) e tresmalhos (feiticeiras de 6, 7 e 8 cm entre nÃs nÃo adjacentes), operadas na superfÃcie, margem e fundo, expostas por 24 horas com revistas Ãs 8 : 00, 16 : 00 e 22 : 00 horas. Os peixes capturados foram identificados, medidos e pesados. A estrutura da comunidade foi avaliada pelos seus atributos nÃmero de espÃcies (riqueza), abundÃncia (biomassa e nÃmero de indivÃduos) e Ãndice de diversidade de Shannon. As variÃveis ambientais foram plotadas em uma matriz (fÃsica e quÃmica), sendo essa sumarizada pela anÃlise de componentes principais (PCA). Para sumarizar os dados de composiÃÃo e estrutura da assembleia de peixes nativos e nÃo nativos, a anÃlise de escalonamento multidimensional nÃo-mÃtrico (NMDS) foi utilizada. O grau de associaÃÃo entre as matrizes multivariadas (variÃveis ambientais e composiÃÃo e estrutura da assembleia de peixes nativos e nÃo nativos) foi avaliado por meio de uma rotina Procrustes. Durante o perÃodo amostral foram coletados 152. 007 exemplares, sendo 148. 084 indivÃduos de espÃcies nativas e 3. 923 exemplares de espÃcies nÃo nativas, que foram distribuÃdos em seis ordens, 16 famÃlias, 32 gÃneros e 50 espÃcies. As espÃcies nativas mais abundantes foram Astyanax sp. B (40, 1 %), Astyanax sp. C (19, 1 %) e Pimelodus britskii (9, 1 %). As espÃcies nÃo nativas mais abundantes foram Odontesthes bonariensis (85, 1 %), Prochilodus lineatus (7, 5 %) e Tilapia rendalli (4, 9 %). A distribuiÃÃo de abundÃncia, em nÃmero de indivÃduos e peso foi maior em Salto Santiago, tanto para espÃcies nativas como nÃo nativas. DiferenÃas espaciais e temporais significativas foram verificadas para a riqueza, tanto para espÃcies nativas como nÃo nativas, entretanto o Ãndice de diversidade de Shannon, mostrou diferenÃas significativas somente para as espÃcies nativas. A composiÃÃo e estrutura da assembleia de peixes nativos e nÃo nativos, apresentaram diferenÃas significativas ao longo do gradiente longitudinal do rio IguaÃu. As variÃveis fÃsicas e quÃmicas (temperatura da Ãgua, transparÃncia da Ãgua, pH e condutividade elÃtrica), foram significativas para a separaÃÃo dos reservatÃrios ao longo do gradiente longitudinal. A anÃlise de Procrustes mostrou que existe associaÃÃo entre as variÃveis fÃsicas e quÃmicas, e o arranjo espacial da composiÃÃo e estrutura da assembleia de peixes nativos. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the composition and structure of the assemblages of native and nonnative fish along the temporal and spatial gradient on the IguaÃu River, and their relations with environmental variables in five reservoirs. Samples were collected from January 2004 to December 2008, with <b>periodicity</b> <b>quarterly</b> in reservoirs Foz do Areia, Segredo and Salto Caxias, while in reservoirs Salto Santiago and Salto OsÃrio samples were bimonthly. Catches were made with the aid of gillnets (mesh size of 2. 4 to 16 cm) and trammel nets (witches, 6, 7 and 8 cm between non-adjacent), operated on the surface, margin and bottom, exposed for 24 hours with checked at 8 : 00, 16 : 00 and 22 : 00 hours. Fish caught were identified, measured and weighed. The community structure was evaluated by its attributes of species (richness), abundance (biomass and number of individuals) and diversity index of Shannon. The environmental variables were plotted on a matrix (physics and chemistry) and is summarized by principal component analysis (PCA). To summarize the data on the composition and structure of the assemblages of native and nonnative fish, analysis of non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used. The degree of association between multivariate matrices (environmental variables and the composition and structure of the assemblages of native fish and non-native) was assessed by means of a Procrustes routine. During the study period were collected from 152, 007 specimens, 148, 084 individuals of native species and 3, 923 specimens of non-native species, which were divided into six orders, 16 families, 32 genera and 50 species. The most abundant native species were Astyanax sp. B (40. 1 %), Astyanax sp. C (19. 1 %) and Pimelodus britskii (9. 1 %). The non-native species were more abundant Odontesthes bonariensis (85. 1 %), Prochilodus lineatus (7. 5 %) and Tilapia rendalli (4. 9 %). The distribution of abundance in numbers and weight was higher in Salto Santiago, both native and non native. Spatial and temporal differences were apparent for wealth, for both native and non native, but the Shannon diversity index showed significant differences only for native species. The composition and structure of the assembly of native and nonnative fish showed significant differences along the longitudinal gradient of the IguaÃu River. The physical and chemical variables (water temperature, water transparency, pH and electrical conductivity) were significant for the separation of the reservoirs along the longitudinal gradient. Procrustes analysis showed that an association exists between the physical and chemical variables, and the spatial arrangement of the composition and structure of the assemblages of native fish...|$|E

40|$|We {{simulate}} {{the effects of}} a hypothetical H 1 N 1 epidemic in the U. S. using a quarterly CGE model. <b>Quarterly</b> <b>periodicity</b> allows us to capture the short-run nature of an epidemic. We find potentially severe economic effects in the peak quarter. Averaged over the epidemic year the effects are considerably damped. Our results indicate that the macroeconomic consequences of an epidemic are more sensitive to demand-side effects such as reductions in international tourism and leisure activities than to supply-side effects such as reductions in productivity. This suggests that demand stimulus policies might be an appropriate economic response to a serious epidemic. Influenza epidemic Quarterly CGE modelling...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{the global}} {{economic}} effects of two influenza pandemics that represent extremes along the virulence-infectiousness continuum of possible pandemics: a high virulence-low infectiousness event and a low virulence-high infectiousness event. We do this by applying results from a susceptible-infected-recovered epidemiological model to a detailed, quarterly computable general equilibrium model. Our findings indicate that global economic activity will be more strongly affected by a pandemic with high infection rates rather than high virulence rates, all else being equal. At the regional level, regions with {{a higher degree of}} economic integration with the world economy will be affected more strongly than less integrated regions. computable general equilibrium, pandemic influenza, <b>quarterly</b> <b>periodicity...</b>|$|R

I was tempted {{to say that this}} is the only such periodical, but that would have been unfair to the Law Library News, and to several local publications issued by law libraries. The Law Library Journal, published by the American Association of Law Libraries and now in its twenty-seventh volume, began its life as a non-identical twin of the Index to Legal Periodicals, when that Index was born in January, 1908. It is still published in conjunction with the Index, its <b>periodicity</b> being <b>quarterly</b> like that of the Index. During most of its life, it has been used·chiefly as the vehicle for publishing the papers and proceedings of the annual meetings of the American Association of Law Libraries. This has been its chief function, and only occasionally have the limited funds available permitted the publication of other material. Despite this limitation, the Journal is the most complete repository in existence of information concerning the history, management and problems of law librarianship. Even under difficulties, it has proved itself to be a professional journal indispensable to law libraries...|$|R

40|$|Early 2009 saw the {{emergence}} of an H 1 N 1 influenza epidemic in North America that eventually spread to become the first pandemic of the twenty-first century. Previous work has suggested that pandemics and near-pandemics can have large macroeconomic effects on highly affected regions; here, we estimate what those effects might be for Australia. Our analysis applies the MONASH-Health model: a computable general equilibrium model of the Australian economy. We deviate from previous work by incorporating two important short-run mechanisms in our analytical framework: <b>quarterly</b> <b>periodicity</b> and excess capacity. The analysis supports the assertion that an H 1 N 1 epidemic could have significant short-run macroeconomic effects but the size of these effects is highly dependent on the degree of inertia in the markets for physical capital and labour...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} when a country implements capital controls {{is to prevent}} large fluctuations in the exchange rate and asset price volatility. The direct mechanism through which these policies work is simple: a tax on foreign borrowing reduces flows, which prevents the price from changing considerably. Since foreign borrowing involves transactions in the foreign exchange market, {{the price of the}} asset can also be thought of as the exchange rate. However, the empirical literature has not come to a consensus on the effectiveness of capital controls on managing the exchange rate. Therefore, could there be other channels, different from their direct effect on flows, through which capital controls have the undesired effect of increasing fluctuations in the exchange rate? In particular, can capital controls increase the sensitivity of prices to sudden changes in capital flows?The dissertation answers this question using two approaches. First, I embed into a market microstructure model a mechanism through which capital controls reduce the ability of the market to sustain large amounts of foreign capital without a substantial change in their price. This characteristic is called market depth. The deeper the market, the price reacts less to adjust for an excess supply or demand of the asset. Second, I verify the existence of the theoretical mechanism in the data by analyzing the case of Mexico and Brazil. I focus on these countries because they are two similar foreign investment destinations, but with the main difference that Brazil has implemented capital controls in the past and Mexico has not. In the first chapter I present a survey of the theoretical and empirical literature of capital controls and capital flows. In the second chapter I present the theoretical model that analyzes the effect of capital controls on market depth. The third chapter proposes a new measure on capital account restrictiveness. This measure is, {{to the best of my}} knowledge, the first index of capital controls that has <b>quarterly</b> <b>periodicity</b> and that is an intensive index. Finally, the last chapter analyzes two econometric models that explain the effect of capital controls on the levels and composition of capital flows, and on the probability of extreme events of flows. If policymakers choose to implement capital controls for their short-term effect on the exchange rate, my results show that there are permanent effects on price sensitivity that could outweigh their immediate benefits. Moreover, the new measure proposed in this work can be used to find new evidence on the effect of capital controls on capital flows...|$|R
