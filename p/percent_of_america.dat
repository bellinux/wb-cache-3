40|$|More than {{a quarter}} of a century ago, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders warned that 2 ̆ 2 [o]ur Nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white-separate and unequal. 2 ̆ 2 Today, despite decades of effort and some genuine progress, racial {{separation}} and inequality have grown, not diminished. Nearly fifteen <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s population, or more than thirty-seven million Americans, live in poverty-the highest level since 1965. The figures are even worse for young people, our country 2 ̆ 7 s future. More than one in five children is born into poverty-two in three Hispanic children and nearly one out of every two African-American children. More than seventy five percent of this growing poverty population is concentrated in central cities and inner ring suburbs-living, not coincidentally, in the oldest and most dilapidated housing. The increasing urban isolation of a majority of the poor and many minorities is made worse by other rising poverty-related problems such as declining health, inadequate schools, and violent crime...|$|E
40|$|Nearly 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s {{children}} will spend {{part of their}} childhood in a single parent family {{in one form or}} another. Past research has examined correlations between spirituality and mental as well as physical health. In addition, there is a marginal amount of study regarding the parental influence of faith on child outcomes in two-parent families. A quantitative study utilizing a cross-sectional design was employed. Data analysis was completed employing a series of multiple regressions to ascertain the correlations of the aforementioned constructs. The study revealed that parental religious commitment to faith was significantly correlated with the development of morality in their offspring for both single and two-parent families. It was also found that family structure significantly correlated with academic attainment, with two-parent offspring having a significantly higher GPA than single parent offspring. However, when the single and two-parent data was separated out and the same analyses ran, it was found that single parent participants faith scores were significantly correlated with both morality and resiliency and marginally with academic attainment. The most significant outcome {{of this study is that}} it provides new insights regarding the influence of spiritually (faith) as a mediating factor that could be instilled into current literature and research for the benefit and encouragement of single and two-parent families alike...|$|E

40|$|According to the U. S.

This study looked into the housing satisfaction among the Asian and Pacific Islander group {{in comparison to the}} non-Hispanic White group.;Since many Asian and Pacific Islanders in the U. S. are foreign-born, it is expected that their housing perception will be influenced by their experience with housing in their home countries. Using Morris and Winter 2 ̆ 7 s housing adjustment theory, the study investigated the effect of several demographic variables, housing deficits, and neighborhood satisfaction on housing satisfaction. The study also looked into two variables with cultural relevance, length of residence in the U. S. and extended family living arrangement and tested their effect on housing satisfaction.;The data used for the study was the 2002 American Housing Survey Metropolitan Sample (AHS-MS) collected from a sample of 13 metropolitan areas by U. S. Census Bureau for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.;Generally, demographic variables were not significant indicators of housing satisfaction. Two housing deficits (renter status and housing inadequacy) and neighborhood satisfaction were important mediating variables between housing satisfaction and household variables. Length of residence in the U. S. and extended family living arrangement were not significant predictors of housing satisfaction for Asian and Pacific Islanders.;It appears that Asian and Pacific Islander householders assimilate quickly into the American culture in terms of housing norms. There is little difference in the explanation of housing satisfaction for the Asian and Pacific Islanders and the non-Hispanic Whites. Although Asian and Pacific Islanders have different cultural referents in terms of past housing experience and importance of extended family living arrangements, than non-Hispanic Whites, these factors do not {{play a significant role in}} housing adjustment theory predicting housing satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the Great Plains represent a major transition zone in the distribution patterns of North American birds; field guides traditionally have treated the 100 ° W. longitude meridian as a convenient dividing line between eastern and western faunas. Furthermore, this line rather neatly bisects the political subdivisions of the Great Plains, namely the 2 ̆ 2 plains states 2 ̆ 2 extending from North Dakota southward through South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas. Of these, Texas is the least typical, its climate and fauna is strongly influenced by the Gulf Coast on {{the east and the}} Chihuahuan desert on the west. As a result of its size and ecological diversity Texas supports the largest array of breeding bird species of any state in the nation. Thus, in the present analysis it was decided to eliminate from consideration all but the northwestern 2 ̆ 2 panhandle 2 ̆ 2 of Texas, which consists of the grassland-dominated 2 ̆ 2 staked plains. 2 ̆ 2 Further, to facilitate the faunistic analysis, limiting lines of latitude and longitude were selected that not only encompassed all five other states mentioned, but also parts of several adjoining ones. After some deliberation, it was decided to define the coverage of the analysis as extending from the U. S. -Canadian border (49 ° N. latitude) southward to 34 ° N. latitude in Texas, following this line eastward until it intersects with the Texas-Oklahoma boundary, and continuing eastwardly along the boundary to the eastern limit of Oklahoma. The western limit was defined as the 104 ° W. longitude meridian, which essentially conforms with the western boundaries of the Dakotas and the Nebraska 2 ̆ 2 panhandle 2 ̆ 2, and continues southward through the eastern portion of Colorado and New Mexico. The eastern limit was selected as the 95 ° W. longitude meridian, which includes the prairie areas of western Minnesota, the western edge of Iowa, and a small part of extreme northwestern Missouri. Where this line intersects with the Missouri River along the Missouri-Kansas border, the coverage was continued eastwardly to include the extreme eastern portions of Kansas and Oklahoma (Fig. 1). A minimum of 324 species have recently bred or currently breed in the area under consideration. Five of these are introduced species, and were excluded from the analysis, and another seven species are either extinct or have been extirpated from the region. Of the 312 remaining species, about 260 are 2 ̆ 2 regular 2 ̆ 2 breeders. Thus well over 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> 2 ̆ 7 s continental breeding bird fauna is included within the region 2 ̆ 7 s geographic limits, {{in spite of the fact}} that it is less than a fifth of the total area of the U.
