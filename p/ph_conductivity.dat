40|$|Vermicomposting {{results in}} the {{production}} of two bio-fertilizers, vermicompost and vermiwash. The bio-fertilizers were applied to 4 kg of loam-clay soil over a period of 40 days. The effect of the vermicompost, vermiwash, application time and their combined effect on soil <b>pH,</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> and nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium content were analyzed. Increasing the vermicompost quantity decreased the soil <b>pH,</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> and nitrogen content, however, this resulted in a slight increase in the phosphorous content but the potassium content remained unaltered. Increasing the vermiwash quantity increased the soil <b>pH,</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> and potassium content but resulted in reduced nitrogen and phosphorous content. In addition, increasing the application period of either the vermicompost or the vermiwash resulted in increased soil <b>pH,</b> electrical <b>conductivity,</b> phosphorous and potassium content but resulted in reduced phosphorous content. The reduction of the soil nitrogen content is attributed to de-nitrification, whilst the increase in phosphorous content is attributed to increase in soluble phosphates and release of nutrients into the soil due to microbial activity in the bio-fertilizers. Furthermore, loam-clay soils have good absorbing properties for potassium. The soil properties and micro-organisms present in the bio-fertilizers play a critical role on the modification of the soil physicochemical properties...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pH</b> and {{electrical}} <b>conductivity</b> are important properties of nanofluids {{that have not}} been widely studied, especially with regard to temperature and ultrasonication energy. To study the factors that affect the <b>pH</b> {{and electrical}} <b>conductivity</b> of magnesium oxide–ethylene glycol (MgO–EG) nanofluid, the effects of temperature, volume fraction, particle size and ultrasonication energy were investigated. Two different sizes of MgO were dispersed in EG base fluid up to the volume fraction of 3 %, and the <b>pH</b> and electrical <b>conductivity</b> were monitored between the temperatures of 20 and 70 °C. Characterization by transmission electron microscopy and size analyses revealed the morphology and sizes of the nanoparticle samples. The pH values dropped consistently with the increase of temperature, while electrical conductivity value increased with the increase of temperature. The experimental result showed that the increase in the MgO volume fraction increased both the <b>pH</b> and electrical <b>conductivity</b> values of the MgO–EG nanofluid. There was no recognizable influence of ultrasonication energy density on the <b>pH</b> and electrical <b>conductivity</b> of the nanofluid; therefore, it was concluded that temperature, volume fraction and particle size are the predominant factors affecting both the <b>pH</b> and electrical <b>conductivity</b> of MgO–EG nanofluid within the present experimental conditions. am 201...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{chemical}} changes induced on the surface of a visible light-cured periodontal dressing material after storage in acidic and neutral buffer solutions, and to monitor the changes in the <b>pH</b> and <b>conductivity</b> of the solutions. The product tested was Barricaid. Twelve disk shaped specimens (8 mm in diameter and 1, 5 mm in thickness) were prepared by irradiating the specimens for 40 s with a visible light-cured unit emitting 560 mW/cm 2 light intensity. The specimens were divided into two groups of six and were immersed in an acidic (pH: 4, 4) and a neutral (pH: 6, 8) buffer solution respectively for 7 d at 37 ± 1 Æ C. The specimen surfaces before and after exposure to the solutions were studied by micro-MIR FTIR. Moreover, the changes in the <b>pH</b> and <b>conductivity</b> of the solutions were monitored before and after immersion. The statistical analysis of the <b>pH</b> and <b>conductivity</b> measurements was performed by t-test (· = 0, 05). The results showed a reduction in the amide absorption intensity after immersion in the acid solution. An increase in the solution <b>pH</b> and <b>conductivity</b> was observed after immersion, but the difference was not statistically significant. The results {{of the present study}} imply that Barricaid is a quite stable product under acidic pH. Nevertheless, This stability minimizes its therapeutic potential, because has no capacity in increasing the pH of the incubating solution as the products set by an acidbase reaction.
