When yarn enters a weaving mill, {{it is on}} {{different}} size cops and cheeses, and these had to be wound onto pirns to fit in the shuttles used by the looms installed. The equipment is here and used. For the weft, there are two remaining banks of <b>pirn</b> <b>winders</b> manned by one operative.|$|R

Bancroft Shed bought its weft [...] "shuttle ready" [...] on pirns in 1920; there was no winding on site. Pirning was started and, in 1970, the mill used Britoba <b>pirn</b> <b>winders.</b> The <b>pirns</b> were carried in two types of shuttles. The original kissing shuttles caused health scares and were replaced by self-threading shuttles.|$|R
