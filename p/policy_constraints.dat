Practical exploits had not been previously demonstrated for this vulnerability, which was originally discovered by Phillip Rogaway in 2002. The vulnerability of the attack had been fixed with TLS 1.1 in 2006, but TLS 1.1 had not seen wide adoption prior to this attack demonstration.|$|E

Dr Angus Armstrong of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research wrote that the implicit constraints on its economic policy would be more restrictive than the explicit ones it faces {{as a member of}} the UK. Salmond said in February 2014 that an independent Scotland in a currency union would retain tax and spending powers. Gavin McCrone, former chief economic adviser to the Scottish Office, stated that Scotland's retention of the pound would be pragmatic initially, but problematic thereafter if a Scottish government wished to implement independent policies, and he warned that keeping the pound could lead to the relocation of Scottish banks to London.|$|E
2500|$|For many elderly carers of a {{relative}} {{who has a}} learning or other disability, future planning is an issue. [...] The population of older parents who have children with a learning disability is growing {{and many of their}} children are likely to outlive them. [...] In many cases the caring role can span up to seven decades, ending only with their death. [...] Governments and other service providers cannot ignore the pressing needs of this population and their parent and sibling carers. [...] In most countries, family carers provide inexpensive care for a person with a learning disability and other disabilities. [...] This trend is set to continue in England. [...] Demographic changes and the health needs of these two growing populations must be considered against government <b>policy</b> <b>constraints</b> and limited in-home and external care options in order to avoid a crisis. [...] The consequences of not supporting these family carers will to lead to crisis management, increase in distress and care giving burdens, and increased spending on unsuitable crisis placements. [...] Housing and financial guidance are issues for caregivers.|$|E

40|$|System {{requirements}} often express some of {{the behavior}} of a domain model in the form of <b>policies,</b> <b>constraints,</b> invariants, and rules. Although an object-oriented approach helps with the design of this model, the implementation is often cluttered with details necessary to enforce the model's <b>policies</b> and <b>constraints.</b> As a result, the code is more prone to error and is more difficult to maintain since it tends to obscure the model's fundamental structure. R++, a rule-based extension to C++, allows developers to express <b>policies</b> and <b>constraints</b> more clearly in the form of path-based rules. Since the rule evaluation mechanism is automatic, R++ rules enable developers to focus on what to do when a rule evaluates to TRUE, rather than on how and when these evaluations should be carried out. It is the absence of this mechanism in the source code, and the use of these rules in an object-oriented implementation that makes the code easier to maintain and makes for a clearer reflection of the und [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{workflow}} is {{a collection}} of steps that must be executed in some specific order to achieve an objective. A computerised workflow management system may enforce authorisation <b>policies</b> and <b>constraints,</b> thereby restricting which users can perform particular steps in a workflow. The existence of <b>policies</b> and <b>constraints</b> may mean that a workflow is unsatisfiable, {{in the sense that it}} is impossible to find an authorised user for each step in the workflow and satisfy all constraints. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the "least bad" assignment of users to workflow steps by assigning a weight to each <b>policy</b> and <b>constraint</b> violation. To this end, we introduce a framework for associating costs with the violation of workflow <b>policies</b> and <b>constraints</b> and define the valued workflow satisfiability problem (Valued WSP), whose solution is an assignment of steps to users of minimum cost. We establish the computational complexity of Valued WSP with user-independent constraints and show that it is fixed-parameter tractable. We then describe an algorithm for solving Valued WSP with user-independent constraints and evaluate its performance, comparing it to that of an off-the-shelf mixed integer programming package...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Access control <b>policies</b> are <b>constraints</b> {{that protect}} {{computer-based}} information resources from unauthorized access. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) {{is used by}} many organizations to protect their information resources from unauthorized access. RBAC policies are {{defined in terms of}} permissions that are associated with roles assigned to users. A permission determines what operations a user assigned to a role can perform on information resources. Role-based access control (RBAC) is also a powerful means for laying out higher-level organizational policies such as separation of duty, and for simplifying the security management process. One of the important aspects of RBAC is authorization constraints that express such organizational policies.
