Note: The earth is tested during the earth continuity test. In the UK, as per BS7671, the phase ('Live' or 'Hot') cable should connect with right hand side terminal of the socket (if we face the socket outlet).|$|E

The FastPort became {{the only way to}} get external power to the phones. Chargers comes in several varieties, from 12/24 volt DC to use in cars, to 100-250 volt AC to use elsewhere. Some charger-models can only charge the phone (the cable is attached at the middle), in others all the connector pins through to the <b>plug</b> <b>end,</b> thus supporting data/signal transfer while the phone is being charged.|$|E

In general, the more power {{needed by the}} appliance, the thicker the cord needs be (meaning larger wires inside). Cords which will be used outdoors, in wet areas, around oils, or exposed to sunlight {{for long periods of}} time should be selected for such specific conditions.An extension reel is an extension lead that rolls up, usually into the socket end, which in some cases has more than one socket on it (often 2 or 4).

40|$|The {{vortex tube}} {{is a very}} simple device {{injected}} with pressurized air through tangential nozzle which splits in to two streams of low pressure air, one warmer leaves near the periphery at <b>plug</b> <b>end</b> known as free vortex and one colder leaves via an orifice {{at the opposite end}} known as forced vortex. The entry and exit of tube are key parameters affecting the performance of vortex tube. The nozzle at entry effects the formation of free vortex flow inside the tube and end region of hot pipe effects the converging of air and controls the forced vortex flow pattern. Providing an obstruction at the end of hot pipe boosts up the desired flow and enhances the energy separation. In the present work an attempt is made to revise the effect of inlet pressure, cold fraction, end obstruction of hot pipe end and also the nozzle on the performance of vortex tube. A series of tubes with different level of obstruction and different nozzle inlet diameters were tested. The results indicate that temperature drop increases with increase of nozzle diameter up to 5 mm and no significant improvement is observed beyond it and temperature drop is effective at moderate end obstruction area...|$|E
40|$|The figure {{depicts the}} main {{parts of a}} {{prototype}} miniature, lightweight, onetime- opening valve. Like some other miniature one-time-opening valves reported in previous issues of NASA Tech Briefs, this valve is opened by melting a material that blocks the flow path. This valve is designed to remain closed at some temperature between room temperature and cryogenic temperature until the time of opening. The prototype valve includes a 1 / 8 -in. (3 -mm) aluminum tube, one end of which is plugged with a solder comprising about 37 weight percent of lead and 63 weight percent of tin. The tube and the solder both have a {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of 23 micron/m-K at room temperature. Before plugging, the interior surface of the <b>plug</b> <b>end</b> of the tube is cleaned with a commercial flux paste developed specifically for preparing aluminum for bonding with lead/tin solder. The solder is then melted into the cleaned end of the tube, forming the plug. In a test, the plugged tube was pressurized to 1, 000 psi (6. 9 MPa) with helium and leak-tested. It was then cooled to a temperature of 77 K (about 196 C) and again leak-tested at the same pressure. Finally, at a lower pressure, the plugged end of the tube was heated to about 200 C (the melting temperature of the solder is 183 C), causing the solder plug to be ejected (see figure). It has been estimated that in a subsequent version of the valve, the plug could be melted by electrical heating, using a nichrome wire having a mass of only 10 g...|$|E
40|$|In Korea, R&D on a {{sodium-cooled}} {{fast reactor}} (SFR) was begun in 1997, {{as one of}} the national long-term nuclear R&D programs.

40|$|A new {{low-cost}} {{flow meter}} {{is being used}} to measure flows in the discharge pipelines from wells located on the Elephant Butte Irrigation District (EBID) near Las Cruces, New Mexico. The flow meter, called the Mag-tube, is a straightforward application of the Pitot tube concept. Two prototypes of the new flow meter were recently calibrated in the hydraulics laboratory of the Bureau of Reclamation. The meters are adaptable to a range of pipe sizes. Meter Description A prototype Mag-tube flow meter is shown in Figure 1. The meter consists of a hollow 1 / 2 -inch diameter tube, threaded on both ends so that it may be passed through the walls of a circular pipe and sealed against the pipe wall at each end by a hex nut and rubber bushing. The tube is <b>plugged</b> at one <b>end</b> and open at the other. At the mid-point of the tube and at 2 inches off center to each side, three 1 / 16 -inch diameter holes are drilled through the wall of the tube to allow water to enter the tube. The Mag-tube is installed so that these three pressure ports face directly upstream. Alignment marks on the <b>plugged</b> <b>end</b> of the tube ensure that the ports face upstream. A piece of clear vinyl tubing is connected to the open end of the Mag-tube and then to a manometer board or pressure transducer to allow measurement of the total pressure of the flo...|$|R

40|$|SummaryEscherichia coli RecE {{protein is}} part of the {{classical}} RecET recombination system that has recently been used in powerful new methods for genetic engineering. RecE binds to free double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) ends and processively digests the 5 ′-ended strand to form 5 ′-mononucleotides and a 3 ′-overhang that is a substrate for single strand annealing promoted by RecT. Here, we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal nuclease domain of RecE at 2. 8  Å resolution. RecE forms a toroidal tetramer with a central tapered channel that is wide enough to bind dsDNA at one end, but is partially plugged at the other end by the C-terminal segment of the protein. Four narrow tunnels, one within each subunit of the tetramer, lead from the central channel to the four active sites, which lie about 15 Å from the channel. The structure, combined with mutational studies, suggests a mechanism in which dsDNA enters through the open end of the central channel, the 5 ′-ended strand passes through a tunnel to access one of the four active sites, and the 3 ′-ended strand passes through the <b>plugged</b> <b>end</b> of the channel {{at the back of the}} tetramer...|$|R
