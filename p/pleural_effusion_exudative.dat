40|$|The {{first step}} in the {{evaluation}} of patients with <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate.

Compared with non-massive <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions,</b> massive <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} be malignant (53. 7 % vs. 38. 3 %, P= 0. 03) or secondary to cirrhosis (9. 9 % vs. 2. 6 %, P= 0. 0000). On the other hand, massive <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> were significantly less likely to be secondary to infection (10. 7 % vs. 19. 2 %, P= 0. 003) or congestive heart failure (0. 8 % vs. 6. 7 %, P= 0. 03). There was a significant increase in the yield of diagnostic studies in patients with massive malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> (56. 9 % for cytological studies and 36. 9 % for biopsies). On the other hand, there was no difference in the diagnostic yield of microbiological and histological studies in the group of tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions.</b> In our study population, patients with non-massive malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> had a significantly better survival than those with massive malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions,</b> with a median survival of 8 months (95 % confidence interval, 7 – 9) compared with 5 months (95 % confidence interval, 4 – 6) (P= 0. 0009).

Aim of the work: to assess the role of serum and pleural fluid VEGF levels to evaluate its value as a marker in diagnosis of <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> of different etiologies. Methods: Forty patients with <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion,</b> 19 males and 21 females, {{with a mean age of}} 55. 960  ±  6. 835  years, were classified into transudative and exudative groups.

This study aimed {{to identify the}} diagnosis based on clinical variables to differentiate pleural tuberculous exudates from other <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions.</b> We also investigated the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) in the pathogenesis of pleural exudates. Experimental design: The major components in RAS and extracellular matrix metabolism, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE 2, MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 activities, were measured and compared in the patients with transudative (n = 45) and exudative (n = 80) <b>effusions.</b> The <b>exudative</b> <b>effusions</b> were come from the patients with tuberculosis (n = 20), pneumonia (n = 32), and adenocarcinoma (n = 28). Results: Increased ACE and equivalent ACE 2 activities, resulting in a significantly increased ACE/ACE 2 ratio in exudates, were detected compared to these values in transudates. MMP- 9 activity in exudates {{was significantly higher than}} that in transudates. The significant correlation between ACE and ACE 2 activity that was found in transudates was not found in exudates. Advanced analyses showed significantly increased ACE and MMP- 9 activities, and decreased ACE 2 activity in tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> compared with those in pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions. The results indicate that increased ACE and MMP- 9 activities found in the exudates were mainly contributed from a higher level of both enzyme activities in the tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions.</b> Conclusion: Interplay between ACE and ACE 2, essential functions in the RAS, and abnormal regulation of MMP- 9 probably play a pivotal {{role in the development of}} <b>exudative</b> <b>effusions.</b> Moreover, the ACE/ACE 2 ratio combined with MMP- 9 activity in pleural fluid may be potential biomarkers for diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the presence of interleukin (IL) - 27 in <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> and to evaluate the diagnostic significance of pleural IL- 27. The concentrations of IL- 27 were determined in pleural fluids and sera from 68 patients with tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion,</b> 63 malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion,</b> 22 infectious <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion,</b> and 21 transudative <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion.</b> Flow cytometry was used to identify which pleural cell types expressed IL- 27. It was found that the concentrations of pleural IL- 27 in tuberculous group were significantly higher than those in malignant, infectious, and transudative groups, respectively. Pleural CD 4 (+) T cells, CD 8 (+) T cells, NK cells, NKT cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, and mesothelial cells might be the cell sources for IL- 27. IL- 27 levels could be used for diagnostic purpose for tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion,</b> with the cut off value of 1, 007 ng/L, IL- 27 had a sensitivity of 92. 7 % and specificity of 99. 1 % for differential diagnosing tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> from non-tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions.</b> Therefore, compared to non-tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions,</b> IL- 27 appeared to be increased in tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion.</b> IL- 27 in pleural fluid is a sensitive and specific biomarker for the differential diagnosing tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> from <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> with the other causes...|$|R

50|$|<b>Pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> are {{classified}} as exudative (high protein) or transudative (low protein). <b>Exudative</b> <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> are generally caused by infections such as pneumonia (parapneumonic <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion),</b> malignancy, granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis or coccidioidomycosis, collagen vascular diseases, and other inflammatory states. Transudative <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> occur in congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome.|$|R

The size of <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> might decrease spontaneously as healing of wound or adhesion of the lung to mediastinum progressed. The other possible etiology is infection. Resection of the infectious tissue might cause local pleurisy, which lead to <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion.</b> The culture of <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> could be false-negative due to the low culture positive rate of histoplasmosis.|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} {{this study}} to determine sensitivity and specificity of <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> antinuclear antibodies (ANA) at a titer of 1 : 160, and the ratio of <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> to serum ANA of 1, to distinguish between pleural fluid from lupus pleuritis and other causes. A prospective study of 54 patients with <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> (12 lupus pleuritis, seven parapneumonic <b>effusion,</b> 26 malignancy-associated <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions,</b> nine transudative effusions) was performed. ANA at a titer of 1 : 160 were found in 11 of 12 lupus pleuritis samples, and in four of 42 <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> from non-systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. The <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> ANA at a titer of 1 : 160 gave a sensitivity of 91. 67 % for lupus pleuritis, with a specificity of 83. 33 % when compared with all other <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions,</b> 90. 91 % when compared with <b>exudative</b> effu-sion (parapneumonic <b>effusion</b> and malignancy-associated effusion) and 55. 56 % when com-pared with the transudative <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> group. Using the ratio of <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> to serum ANA of 1, the sensitivity and the specificity decreased to 75. 00 % and 78. 57 %, respec-tively. This study provides further evidence that the <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> ANA at a titer of 1 : 160 is a sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarker for lupus pleuritis in patients with lupus.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is widely {{expressed in a}} variety of malignant tumors, including-lung cancer. Our previous study has shown that the serum level of soluble form of carbonic anhydrase IX (s-CAIX) was significantly higher in patients with lung cancer than that in the healthy group. The aim {{of this study is to}} detect the s-CAIX level in the <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> and its sediment, and to evaluate the significance of CAIX detection in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Methods The s-CAIX level in <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> of 29 lung cancer patients and 27 patients with tuberculosis was detected by ELISA. The expression of CAIX in the <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> sediment of 21 lung cancer patients with malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> and 6 patients with benign <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> was examined by immunohistochemistry. With pathological diagnosis as the gold standard, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> s-CAIX was established for the diagnosis of lung cancer with malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion.</b> Results The s-CAIX level in the malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> was significantly higher than that in the tuberculosis group (P< 0. 05). The AUC of <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> s-CAIX level was 0. 761. At a threshold level of 109. 135 pg/mL, sensitivity and specificity were 92. 3 % and 58. 3 %, respectively. The CAIX expression in all samples of the benign <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> sediment was negative. The positive rate of CAIX expression in malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> sediment was 66. 67 %. Conclusion Detection of CAIX in the <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> and its sediment exhibits high sensitivity and specificity, and is helpful in diagnosis of lung cancer with malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> are {{a common}} cause of {{morbidity}} in patients with advanced cancers. Common malignancies associated with malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> include lung, breast and lymphomas. Diagnostic methods include cytological analysis and pleural biopsy either closed or thoracoscopic guided. This study was taken up to analyse the cancers associated with malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> and the diagnostic modalities employed towards the diagnosis of malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of case records of patients diagnosed as malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> prior {{to the use of}} thoracoscopicguided pleural biopsy during a two year period was done and the results were analysed to assess the causes of malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> and the diagnostic methods employed to confirm the diagnosis of malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion.</b> RESULTS 48 cases of malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> were identified during the study period. The commonest malignancies associated with malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> were lung and breast cancer. Most of the patients were elderly, but some of the cases were identified in younger age groups especially in breast cancer. Cytological analysis and closed pleural biopsies were the diagnostic methods employed for diagnosing malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion.</b> CONCLUSION The study results were consistent with published data that malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> were commonly associated with lung and breast malignancies. Most of the malignancies were in patients aged more than 50 years, but some cases in younger age group especially associated with breast malignancy were noted. Cytology and closed pleural biopsy are adequate to diagnose malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> even in absence of thoracoscopy...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Neopterin {{is derived}} from guanosine-triphosphate, {{produced}} by stimulated macrophages {{under the influence of}} gamma interferon (IFN-γ) of CD 4 T lymphocyte origin. It has been reported that the pleural neopterin level is higher in tuberculous pleurisy (TP) than nontuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions.</b> In the presented study, the diagnostic value of pleural neopterin in tuberculous pleurisy was investigated. Material and Method: 70 patients with <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> (19 transudative <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion,</b> 19 malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> (MPE), 18 parapneumonic effusion (PPE) and 14 TP) were enrolled in the study. Results: The mean neopterin level was 32. 73 ± 26. 20 nmol/L in transudative effusion and 19. 34 ± 15. 32 nmol/L in <b>exudative</b> <b>effusion</b> and {{there was no significant difference}}. The mean neopterin level was 19. 84 ± 15. 94 nmol/L in TP, 26. 8 ± 20. 16 nmol/L in PPE and 12. 52 ± 4. 24 nmol/L in MPE. While the pleural neopterin level was significantly higher in transudative effusion and PPE than MPE, there was no significant difference between TP and other groups.

40|$|Background Due to {{variability}} of pleural fluid ADA measures in pleural tuberculosis, researchers have recommended {{the necessity of}} regional studies for determination of specific regional values. Objectives The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the values of pleural fluid ADA in diagnosis of Tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> in South Khorasan province. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients > 12 years old with <b>exudative</b> <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> in South Khorasan province (east of Iran). Light criteria were used to define <b>exudative</b> <b>effusion.</b> Total ADA was determined calorimetrically by Diazyme ADA assay. The data were analyzed using t test, ANOVA and χ 2 tests through Spss 16 version software. Results We studied 255 cases including 139 (54. 5 %) males and 116 (45. 5 %) females with mean age of 63. 8 ± 18 years. There were 36 (14. 1 %) cases with Tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> and 219 (85. 9 %) cases of non-Tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion.</b> Malignant and acute bacterial infection comprise 106 (41. 6 %) and 29 cases (11. 4 %), respectively. The mean levels and optimal cut off point of ADA in Tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> were 40. 2 ± 24. 7 and 30 IU/L respectively. ADA in Tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> showed negative correlation with age (r = - 0. 40, p = 0. 01), but weak positive correlation with fluid protein(r = 0. 44, P = 0. 007) and LDH (r = 0. 32, P = 05). Conclusions Mean and cut off point of ADA was relatively low in patients with Tuberculous <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> in South Khorasan province.
