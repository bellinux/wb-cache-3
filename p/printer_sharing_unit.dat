40|$|Abstract: Although {{file and}} <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> {{services}} {{have been deployed}} almost ubiquitously {{for a long time}} as part of Microsoft Windows, only recent peer-to-peer applications popularized file-sharing on a global scale. As the Windows CIFS protocol was designed for local area networks, its use has been confined to relatively small environments. We propose a mechanism to set up spontaneous virtual groups that allow to use legacy Windows file and <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> globally in virtual LANs. ...|$|R

5000|$|On Windows clients using {{built-in}} PPTP, it {{is recommended}} to disable IPv6, File and <b>Printer</b> <b>Sharing</b> for Microsoft Networks and Client for Microsoft Networks because these features may disclose information.

25|$|Windows 9x offers share-level {{access control}} {{security}} for file and <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> {{as well as}} user-level access control if a Windows NT based operating system {{is available on the}} network. In contrast, Windows NT-based operating systems offer only user-level access control but integrated with the operating system's own user account security mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Worth noting is {{the popular}} {{confusion}} between the names NetBIOS and NetBEUI. NetBEUI originated strictly as the moniker for IBM's enhanced 1985 NetBIOS emulator for token ring. The name NetBEUI should have died there, considering {{that at the}} time, the NetBIOS implementations by other companies were known simply as NetBIOS {{regardless of whether they}} incorporated the API extensions found in that emulator. For MS-Net, however, Microsoft elected to name its implementation of the NBF protocol [...] "NetBEUI" [...] - literally naming its implementation of the transport protocol after IBM's second version of the API. Consequently, even today, Microsoft file and <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> over Ethernet continues to be called NetBEUI, with the name NetBIOS commonly used only in reference to file and <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> over TCP/IP. In truth, the former is the NetBIOS Frames protocol (NBF), and the latter is NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT).|$|R

40|$|File and <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> {{have been}} popularized with Microsoft’s Windows Network Neighbourhood and the Unix Network File System (NFS). Cluster {{computing}} {{has become an}} attractive choice for high-performance computing as workstation and network technology continue to become faster and less expensive. Although computer networks can easily be organized into a computing cluster, {{there is still a}} need for a simple and easy-to-use programming interface that aids in the construction and deployment of parallel and concurrent applications. The Computational Neighbourhood TM (CN) addresses these needs by pushing past the current limitations of basic file and <b>printer</b> <b>sharing,</b> and allowing users to share the computing power of their desktop. CN takes advantage of Java’s heterogeneity and security features to provide a framework that is completely transparent with respect to computing resources. The CN model uses the concept of a job and contention-based scheduling for performing parallel and concurrent computations in a clustered environment. CN also provides a web based interface for submitting, monitoring, and editing parallel and concurrent applications. The current version addresses the issues of user friendliness, while future work will concentrate on security and tuning performance.

For example, a laptop computer may be used on a trusted intranet at a workplace where minimal protection is needed as a conventional firewall is already in place, and services that require open ports such as file and <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> are useful. The same laptop could be used at public Wi-Fi hotspots, where is time to decide the level of trust, and can set individual security policies for each network.|$|R
