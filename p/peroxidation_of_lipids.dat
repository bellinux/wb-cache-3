25|$|Carbohydrates make {{up about}} 50% of the dry weight of green coffee beans. The {{carbohydrate}} fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides, such as arabinogalactan, galactomannan, and cellulose, contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee. Arabinogalactan makes up to 17% of dry weight of green coffee beans, with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked galactan main chains, with frequent members of arabinose (pentose) and galactose (hexose) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides, making the green coffee bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants, improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000mg/100g of arabica green coffee bean, a lower amount in robustas, i.e. 4500mg/100g. In arabica green coffee beans, the content of free glucose was 30 to 38mg/100g, free fructose 23 to 30mg/100g; free galactose 35mg/100g and mannitol 50mg/100g dried coffee beans, respectively. Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, which are generated during the <b>peroxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>lipids</b> in biological membranes.|$|E

Our previous studies {{suggested that the}} process of LDL oxidation by activated human monocytes/macrophages required O 2 - and activity of intracellular lipoxygenase. Herein, we studied the mechanisms involved in this oxidative modification of LDL. In this study, we used the human monocytoid cell line U 937 to examine the role of Ca 2 + in U 937 cell-mediated <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxidation</b> <b>of</b> LDL. U 937 cells were activated by opsonized zymosan. Removal of Ca 2 + from cell culture medium by EGTA inhibited U 937 cell-mediated <b>peroxidation</b> <b>of</b> LDL <b>lipids.</b> Therefore, Ca 2 + influx and mobilization were examined for their influence on U 937 cell-mediated LDL lipid peroxidation. Ca 2 + channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil blocked both Ca 2 + influx and LDL lipid peroxidation by activated U 937 cells. The inhibitory effects of nifedipine and verapamil were dose dependent. TMB- 8 and ryanodine, agents known to prevent Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores, also caused a dose-dependent inhibition <b>of</b> LDL <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxidation</b> by activated U 937 cells while exhibiting no effect on Ca 2 + influx. Thus, both Ca 2 + influx through functional calcium channels and Ca 2 + mobilization from intracellular stores participate in the oxidative modification of LDL by activated U 937 cells. 45 Ca 2 + uptake experiments revealed profound Ca 2 + influx during the early stages of U 937 cell activation, however, the Ca 2 + ionophore 4 -bromo A 23187 was unable to induce activation of U 937 cells and <b>peroxidation</b> <b>of</b> LDL <b>lipids.</b> Release <b>of</b> intracellular Ca 2 + by thapsigargin only caused a suboptimal <b>peroxidation</b> <b>of</b> LDL <b>lipids.</b> Our results indicate that although increases in intracellular Ca 2 + levels provided by both influx and intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization are required, other intracellular signals may be involved for optimal <b>peroxidation</b> <b>of</b> LDL <b>lipids</b> by activated human monocytes...|$|R

Farm animals show different susceptibility to mycotoxins depending on various factors: genetic (species and breeds), physiological (age and obesity) and environmental (hygienic and climatic). One of {{the mechanisms of}} mycotoxin activities is <b>peroxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>lipids</b> brought about directly by the production of free radicals or by increased sensitivity of tissue to peroxidation. <b>Peroxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>lipids</b> provoked by mycotoxins is caused by low level of natural antioxidants, {{so they have a}} crucial role in the protection against mycotoxins.

Effects on dolichol, phospholipids-bound polyunsaturated fatty acids (PL PUFA) and known lipid soluble antioxidants [coenzyme Q (CoQ) and α-tocopherol] were studied. The increase in oxidative stress was detected by a probe sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS). <b>Peroxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>lipids</b> was assessed by measuring the release of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Dolichol, CoQ and α-tocopherol were assessed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), PL PUFA by gas-liquid chromatography (GC). UV-B radiation caused an immediate increase in ROS as well as lipid peroxidation and a simultaneous decrease in the levels of dolichol and lipid soluble antioxidants. Decrease in dolichol paralleled changes in CoQ levels and was smaller than that in α-tocopherol. The addition of mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoAR), magnified the loss of dolichol and was associated {{with an increase in}} TBARS production.

When this regulation is disrupted, for instance in hereditary hemochromatosis, abnormal intestinal absorption of iron leads to cellular toxicity, tissue injury, and organ fibrosis via the deposition of this iron in parenchymal cells {{of a number of}} different organs such as the heart, pancreas, and liver. Iron-generated oxyradicals contribute to the <b>peroxidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>lipid</b> membranes leading to organelle fragility and cellular toxicity.
