2500|$|Ruby {{was arrested}} {{immediately}} after the shooting, and he told several witnesses {{that he had been}} distraught over President Kennedy's death and had helped the city of Dallas [...] "redeem" [...] itself {{in the eyes of the}} public, and that Oswald's death would spare [...] "…Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial." [...] At the time of the shooting, Ruby said he was taking <b>phenmetrazine,</b> a central nervous system stimulant. Two months after Oswald's death, Ruby broke into tears at his bond hearing, as he talked to reporters regarding the assassination of President Kennedy. His voice breaking, Ruby said that he could not understand [...] "how a great man like that could be lost." [...] According to an unnamed Associated Press source, Ruby made a final statement from his hospital bed on December 19, 1966 that he alone had been responsible for the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald. [...] "There is nothing to hide… There was no one else," [...] Ruby said.|$|E
50|$|Phendimetrazine {{functions}} as a prodrug to <b>phenmetrazine,</b> and approximately 30% of any given oral dose is converted into it. Phendimetrazine can essentially {{be thought of as}} an extended release and less abusable version of <b>phenmetrazine.</b> <b>Phenmetrazine</b> (and therefore phendimetrazine as well) acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent (NDRA).|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenmetrazine</b> {{has been}} used recreationally in many countries, for example Sweden. When {{stimulant}} use first became prevalent in Sweden in the 1950s, <b>phenmetrazine</b> was preferred to amphetamine and methamphetamine by users. In the autobiographical novel Rush by Kim Wozencraft, intravenous <b>phenmetrazine</b> is described as the most euphoric and pro-sexual of the stimulants the author used.|$|E
40|$|Privately {{practicing}} physicians, mainly family practitioners, {{were found}} in 1966 to prescribe psychoactive drugs somewhat differently from various types of outpatient clinic. Differences could be accounted for in part by differences in clientele, which are described. At that time, psychiatric clinics were considerably more wary of barbiturates and amphetamines than the private physician, or the medical or other outpatient clinics. There are indications of a current trend in private prescribing away from sedatives and hypnotics, and toward the minor tranquilizers and antidepressants. Prescription of amphetamine-containing drugs has also decreased, though not of <b>phenmetrazines.</b> Private physicians (and even more so the outpatient clinics) prescribed barbiturates, antidepressants and meprobamate in quantities far beyond the massive dose. A cost-benefit analysis is suggested...|$|R
50|$|In {{clinical}} use, <b>phenmetrazine</b> produces less nervousness, hyperexcitability, euphoria and insomnia than drugs of the amphetamine family. It tends not {{to increase}} heart rate {{as much as}} other stimulants. Due to the relative lack of side effects, one study found it well tolerated in children. In {{a study of the}} effectiveness on weight loss between <b>phenmetrazine</b> and dextroamphetamine, <b>phenmetrazine</b> was found to be slightly more effective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenmetrazine</b> (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand name Preludin, {{and many}} others) is a {{stimulant}} drug that was previously {{used as an}} appetite suppressant, but has since been withdrawn from the market. It was initially replaced by its analogue phendimetrazine which functions as a prodrug to <b>phenmetrazine,</b> {{but now it is}} rarely prescribed, due to concerns of abuse and addiction. Chemically, <b>phenmetrazine</b> is a substituted amphetamine with a morpholine ring.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phenmetrazine</b> (3-methyl-2-phenylmorpholine) and any salt thereof ...|$|E
50|$|Its {{structure}} {{incorporates the}} backbone of amphetamine, the prototypical CNS stimulant which, like <b>phenmetrazine,</b> is a releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine. The molecule also loosely resembles ethcathinone, the active metabolite of popular anorectic amfepramone (diethylpropion). Unlike <b>phenmetrazine,</b> ethcathinone (and therefore amfepramone as well) are mostly selective as noradrenaline releasing agents.|$|E

50|$|<b>Phenmetrazine</b> was {{classified}} as a narcotic in Sweden in 1959, and was taken completely off the market in 1965. At first the illegal demand was satisfied by smuggling from Germany, and later Spain and Italy. At first, Preludin tablets were smuggled, but soon the smugglers started bringing in raw <b>phenmetrazine</b> powder. Eventually amphetamine became the dominant stimulant of abuse because of its greater availability.|$|E
50|$|Examples of NDRAs include phenethylamine, tyramine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, cathinone, methcathinone, propylhexedrine, <b>phenmetrazine,</b> pemoline, 4-methylaminorex, and benzylpiperazine.|$|E
50|$|Substituted phenylmorpholines, or {{substituted}} phenmetrazines alternatively, are chemical derivatives of phenylmorpholine {{or of the}} psychostimulant drug <b>phenmetrazine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 3-Benzhydrylmorpholine was {{developed}} by American Home Products in the 1950s, and is a drug with stimulant and anorectic effects, related to both pipradrol and <b>phenmetrazine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 3-Fluorophenmetrazine [...] (also {{known as}} 3-FPM, 3-FPH and PAL-593) is a phenylmorpholine-based {{stimulant}} and fluorinated analogue of <b>phenmetrazine</b> {{that has been}} sold online as a designer drug.|$|E

50|$|On 24 July 1996, it was {{confirmed}} Berry tested positive of <b>Phenmetrazine</b> after a league game on 7 July 1996 against Cartaginés and was subsequently banned for two months.|$|E
50|$|Pseudophenmetrazine is a {{psychostimulant}} {{compound of}} the morpholine class. It is the N-demethylated and cis-configured analogue of phendimetrazine {{as well as}} the cis-configured stereoisomer of <b>phenmetrazine.</b> In addition, along with <b>phenmetrazine,</b> it is believed {{to be one of the}} active metabolites of phendimetrazine, which itself is inactive and behaves merely as a prodrug. Relative to <b>phenmetrazine,</b> pseudophenmetrazine is of fairly low potency, acting as a modest releasing agent of norepinephrine (EC50 = 514 nM), while its (+)-enantiomer is a weak releaser of dopamine (EC50 = 1,457 nM) whereas its (−)-enantiomer is a weak reuptake inhibitor of dopamine (Ki = 2,691 nM); together as a racemic mixture with the two enantiomers combined, pseudophenmetrazine behaves overall more as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (Ki = 2,630 nM), possibly due to the (+)-enantiomer blocking the uptake of the (−)-enantiomer into dopaminergic neurons and thus preventing it from inducing dopamine release. Neither enantiomer has any significant effect on serotonin reuptake or release (both Ki = >10,000 nM and EC50 = >10,000 nM, respectively).|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Phenyl-3,5-dimethylmorpholine {{is a drug}} with {{stimulant}} and anorectic effects, {{related to}} <b>phenmetrazine.</b> Based on what is known from other phenylmorpholines with similar structure, it likely acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and may produce antidepressant-like effects.|$|E
50|$|Fenmetramide {{is a drug}} {{which was}} {{patented}} as an antidepressant by McNeil Laboratories in the 1960s. The drug was never marketed. It is the 5-ketone derivative of <b>phenmetrazine</b> and would similarly be expected to produce psychostimulant effects, though pharmacological data is lacking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenmetrazine</b> {{acts as a}} {{releasing}} agent of norepinephrine and dopamine with EC50 values of 50.4 ± 5.4 nM and 131 ± 11 nM, respectively. It has negligible efficacy as a releaser of serotonin, with an EC50 value of only 7,765 ± 610 nM.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenmetrazine</b> {{was first}} {{patented}} in Germany in 1952 by Boehringer-Ingelheim, with some pharmacological data published in 1954.It {{was the result}} of a search by Thomä and Wick for an anorectic drug without the side-effects of amphetamine.Phenmetrazine was introduced into clinical use in 1954 in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Morazone (Novartrina, Orsimon, Rosimon-Neu, Tarcuzate) is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID), {{originally developed}} by the German pharmaceutical company Ravensberg in the 1950s, which is used as an analgesic.It produces <b>phenmetrazine</b> as a major metabolite and {{has been reported to}} have been abused as a recreational drug in the past.|$|E
5000|$|Preludin {{was also}} used recreationally in the U.S.A. {{throughout}} the 1960s and early 1970s. It could be crushed up in water, heated and injected. The street name for the drug in Washington, D.C. was [...] "Bam". More recently <b>phenmetrazine</b> has continued to be abused around the world, {{in countries such as}} South Korea.|$|E
50|$|In trials {{performed}} on rats, {{it has been}} found that after subcutaneous administration of <b>phenmetrazine,</b> both optical isomers are equally effective in reducing food intake, but in oral administration the levo isomer is more effective. In terms of central stimulation however, the dextro isomer is about 4 times as effective in both methods of administration.|$|E
5000|$|Punding is a {{term that}} was coined {{originally}} to describe complex prolonged, purposeless, and stereotyped behaviour in <b>phenmetrazine</b> and chronic amphetamine users, by Swedish forensic psychiatrist G. Rylander, in 1968. [...] It was later described in Parkinson's disease, {{it has also been}} described in methamphetamine and cocaine users, as well as in some patients with gambling addictions, and hypersexuality.|$|E
50|$|Fenbutrazate (INN), {{also known}} as phenbutrazate (BAN), is a {{psychostimulant}} used as an appetite suppressant under the trade names Cafilon, Filon, and Sabacid in Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong. It is a derivative of <b>phenmetrazine</b> and may function as a prodrug to it similarly to phendimetrazine. It is not {{known to be a}} controlled substance anywhere in the world yet.|$|E
50|$|Etilamfetamine (Apetinil, Adiparthrol), {{also known}} as N-ethylamphetamine, is a {{stimulant}} drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. It was invented in the early 20th century and was subsequently used as an anorectic or appetite suppressant in the 1950s, but was not as commonly used as other amphetamines such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and benzphetamine, and was largely discontinued once newer drugs such as <b>phenmetrazine</b> were introduced.|$|E
5000|$|Dopamine {{releasing}} agents (DRAs) such as phenethylamine, amphetamine, lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), <b>phenmetrazine,</b> pemoline, 4-methylaminorex (4-MAR), and benzylpiperazine, {{among many}} others, which, like DRIs, {{are used in}} the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy as psychostimulants, obesity as anorectics, depression and anxiety as antidepressants and anxiolytics respectively, drug addiction as anticraving agents, and sexual dysfunction as aphrodisiacs. Many of these compounds are also illicit street drugs.|$|E

The cyclohexane, {{at where}} the oxygen leads to the phenyl (in-between the one and two positions on the cyclohexane itself, not {{the bridge of the}} phenyl) also have variants in this class being either a shaded or wedged bond at said oxygen. This class, however, possesses an ubiquitous propyl [...] "tail" [...] on the cyclohexane nitrogen compared to the DRA <b>phenmetrazine</b> analogue category proper.|$|E
5000|$|Parts III (enacted in 1961) and IV (enacted in 1969) {{provided}} for implementation of controls {{required by the}} Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Part III dealt with [...] "controlled" [...] drugs such as amphetamine, methaqualone, and <b>phenmetrazine,</b> which have legitimate medical uses. Part IV focused on Schedule H [...] "restricted drugs", those whose only legitimate use is for scientific research, such as the hallucinogens LSD, DMT, and MDMA. These parts established eight classes of regulated substances, ranging from Schedules A to H.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1963 the {{official}} restrictions imposed on Olmerová's career were eased. She began a collaboration with the Traditional Jazz Studio, worked occasionally with other music ensembles and was also allowed to perform regularly in the Theatre on the Balustrade, where she met and formed a friendship with Václav Havel, the later Czechoslovak and Czech president. In 1965 she married again. This marriage ended with her husband's emigration after less than a year. Olmerová began to use <b>phenmetrazine</b> in combination with alcohol - she sought psychiatric help but her use of alcohol and drugs would continue to dog her career.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phenmetrazine</b> {{was taken}} by the Beatles early in their career. Paul McCartney was one known user. McCartney's {{introduction}} to drugs started in Hamburg, Germany. The Beatles had to play for hours, and they were often given [...] "Prellies" [...] (Preludin) by the maid who cleaned their housing arrangements, German customers, or by Astrid Kirchherr (whose mother bought them). McCartney would usually take one, but John Lennon would often take four or five. Hunter Davies asserted, in his 1968 biography of the band, that their use of such stimulants then was in response to their need to stay awake and keep working, rather than a simple desire for kicks.|$|E
