25|$|The shield {{is based}} on the borough's ancient common seal, which is {{believed}} to date from {{the first half of the}} 16th century. The seal depicts a stylised <b>pomegranate</b> <b>tree.</b> When the arms were formally granted, the College of Arms expressed the opinion that the plant had been adopted by the town as a symbol of loyalty to the crown, as it was a royal badge used by Katherine of Aragon, Henry VIII and Mary Tudor.|$|E
2500|$|One {{indication}} of which plant was used {{comes from the}} 16th century, where {{the authors of the}} Rivayat epistles reprimand their Indian co-religionists for not using twigs of the tamarisk (R. 329).

This due to an abundance <b>pomegranate</b> <b>trees</b> in the original village.

He bowed to Wenzong, and the chancellors immediately led the other officials in congratulating the Emperor (as sweet dew was considered a sign of divine favor). Li Xun and Shu Yuanyu suggested that Wenzong go observe the sweet dews himself {{so that he could}} receive the blessings from heaven. Wenzong agreed, and the officials proceeded to Hanyuan Hall (...) , near the Left Jinwu headquarters. Wenzong himself took a litter to Hanyuan Hall.|$|E
2500|$|The famous late Gothic {{series of}} seven {{tapestry}} hangings The Hunt of the Unicorn are {{a high point}} in European tapestry manufacture, combining both secular and religious themes. The tapestries now hang in the Cloisters division of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In the series, richly dressed noblemen, accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against mille-fleur backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay {{with the help of}} a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, [...] "The Unicorn in Captivity", the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a <b>pomegranate</b> <b>tree</b> surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the Low Countries, probably Brussels or Liège, for an unknown patron. A set of six engravings on the same theme, treated rather differently, were engraved by the French artist Jean Duvet in the 1540s.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Campbell's tent was {{pitched in}} an orange-grove, occupying a {{flat on the}} west bank of the Teesta, close to a small {{enclosure}} of pine-apples, with a <b>pomegranate</b> <b>tree</b> in the middle. The valley is very narrow, and the vegetation wholly tropical, consisting of two species of oak, several palms, rattan-cane (screw-pine), Pandanus, tall grasses, and all the natives of dense hot jungles. The river is a grand feature, broad, rocky, deep, swift, and broken by enormous boulders of rock; its waters were of a pale opal green, probably from the materials of the soft micaceous rocks through which it flows.|$|E

60|$|And {{after that}} they had gone through many streets {{they came to a}} little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a <b>pomegranate</b> <b>tree.</b> And the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay. And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star-Child, and drave him in front of him. And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star-Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn.|$|E
60|$|He {{found himself}} {{alone in a}} gay and glorious garden. In the centre of it grew a <b>pomegranate</b> <b>tree</b> of prodigious size; its top {{was lost in the}} sky, and its innumerable {{branches}} sprang out in all directions, covered with large fruit of a rich golden hue. Beautiful birds were perched upon all parts of the tree, and chanted with perpetual melody the beauties of their bower. Tempted by the delicious sight, Popanilla stretched forward his ready hand to pluck; but no sooner had he grasped the fruit than the music immediately ceased, the birds rushed away, the sky darkened, the tree fell under the wind, the garden vanished, and Popanilla found himself {{in the midst of a}} raging sea, buffeting the waves.|$|E
60|$|Like {{a prince}} in a fairy tale, who has broken the mystic {{boundary}} of some enchanted pleasaunce, Tancred traversed the alleys which were {{formed by the}} lemon and <b>pomegranate</b> <b>tree,</b> and sometimes by the myrtle and the rose. His ear caught the sound of falling water, bubbling with a gentle noise; more distinct and more forcible every step that he advanced. The walk in which he now found himself ended in an open space covered with roses; beyond them a gentle acclivity, clothed so thickly with a small bright blue flower that it seemed a bank of turquoise, and on its top was a kiosk of white marble, gilt and painted; by its side, rising {{from a group of}} rich shrubs, was the palm, whose distant crest had charmed Tancred without the gate.|$|E

60|$|I wish I {{could give}} reality to {{every part of}} that most noble, that most lovably {{beautiful}} temple. We had only a poor half-hour for it, and we could not do more than flutter {{the pages of the}} epic it was and catch here and there a word, a phrase: a word writ in architecture or sculpture, a phrase richly expressed in gold and silver and precious marble, or painted in the dyes of the dawns and sunsets which used to lend themselves so much more willingly to the arts than they seem to do now. From our note-books I find that this cathedral of Toledo appeared more wonderful to one of us than the cathedral of Burgos; but who knows? It might have been that the day was warmer and brighter and had not yet shivered and saddened to the cold rain it ended in. At any rate the vast church filled itself more and more with the solemn glow in which we left it steeped when we went out and took our dreamway through the narrow, winding, wandering streets that seemed to lure us where they would. One of them climbed with us to the Alcazar, which is no longer any great thing to see in itself, but which opens a hospitable space within its court for a prospect of so much of the world around Toledo, the world of yellow river and red fields and blue mountains, and white-clouded azure sky, that we might well have mistaken it for the whole earth. In itself, as I say, the Alcazar is no great thing for where it is, but if we had here in New York an Alcazar that remembered historically back through French, English, Arabic, Gothic. Roman, and Carthaginian occupations to the inarticulate Iberian past we should come, I suppose, from far and near to visit it. Now, however, after gasping at its outlook, we left it hopelessly, and lost ourselves, except for our kindly guide, in the crooked little stony lanes, with the sun hot on our backs and the shade cool in our faces. There were Moorish bits and suggestions in the white walls and the low flat roofs of the houses, but these were not so jealous of their privacy as such houses were once meant to be. Through the gate of one we were led into a garden of simple flowers belted with a world-old parapet, over which we could look at a stretch of the Gothic wall of King Wamba's time, before the miserable Roderick won and lost his kingdom. A <b>pomegranate</b> <b>tree,</b> red with fruit, overhung us, and from the borders of marigolds and zinnias and German clover the gray garden-wife gathered a nosegay for us. She said she was three duros and a half old, as who should say three dollars and a half, and she had a grim amusement in so translating her seventy years.|$|E
