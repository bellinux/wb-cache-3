Increased use of oxygen mainly by contraction of the muscle, causes an increase of electron leakage from the mitochondria that will produce ROS. If the levels of free radicals is too high such as when doing strenuous {{physical activity}}, the ability of endogenous antioxidant to neutralize free radicals become inadequate resulting in an unbalanced state between free radicals and antioxidants called oxidative stress. One of the flavonoid components of the herbs that can act as antioxidants are natural pigments called anthocyanins. Purple sweet potatoes contain high anthocyanins levels at 110 mg- 210 mg / 100 g. The processing of purple sweet potatoes into into a tape (fermented sweet potatoes) {{is an effort to}} improve the usability of the raw material of purple sweet potatoes.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Several studies were conducted to assess the potential use of colored-flesh potato cultivars as a novel source of anthocyanins and phenolics. The accumulation of anthocyanins and phenolics during tuber development was dependent on several factors at a given planting location. Anthocyanins and phenolics were found in different concentrations in the potatoes and were distributed throughout the tuber. Peel samples had higher content than flesh. Environmental conditions seemed to affect more anthocyanin biosynthesis than that of phenolics. A decrease in phytochemical content was observed during tuber development due to increased tuber weight. This increase resulted in increased phytochemical yield when potatoes were harvested at late maturity stages. The low glycoalkaloid content of potatoes at this maturity stage did not present a toxicological concern for consumption. The use of post-harvest stresses shows a promising tool to trigger responses involved in the biosynthesis of specific anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, thus enhancing the commercial or nutritional value of food crops by inducing the accumulation of phytochemicals with added functional properties. In the case of colored potatoes, only wounding stress induced the accumulation of phenolic compounds and an increase in antioxidant activity. The color attributes and stability of aqueous anthocyanin <b>extracts</b> from <b>potatoes</b> were affected by pH, light and temperature, showing their highest stability at low pH, in dark conditions and at low temperatures. Tinctorial strength also influenced the color attributes of the extracts. Anthocyanin type had the greatest influence in the color retention and stability.

40|$|Existing {{data suggest}} an inverse {{correlation}} between {{breast cancer risk}} and vegetable consumption, and the anticancer effects of vegetables are attributed to the diversity and abundance of phytochemicals. Standard endocrine therapies for breast cancer are associated with significant side effects and not always effective. Undoubtedly, {{there is a need}} for improved treatment of breast cancer. In the quest for better breast cancer treatments with fewer side effects, food and nutrition represent a logical strategy to explore. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) was chosen for the present project as the target vegetable for investigation. Pigmented potato has recently attracted research attention because of its potential health benefits. Two <b>potato</b> <b>extracts</b> were prepared from a white and purple variety (‘Urenika’) and referred to as WPE and PPE respectively. Tamoxifen and estradiol exhibited paradoxical effects: each of them was inhibitory at high doses but stimulatory at low to moderate doses, on proliferation of two breast cancer cell lines, MCF- 7 and T- 47 D. In contrast, both PPE and WPE inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner without paradoxical effects. The <b>potato</b> <b>extracts</b> also blocked estradiol- or tamoxifeninduced cell proliferation of these two cell lines. These findings imply that both <b>potato</b> <b>extracts</b> may have a role to play in prevention of breast cancer, or complementing tamoxifen to achieve desirable treatment efficacy. Since both PPE and WPE were equivalent in efficacy, one (PPE) was selected for further study, given the intention of developing a nutraceutical or therapeutic product of New Zealand proprietary value. Phytochemical compositions of the <b>potato</b> <b>extracts</b> were identified and quantified using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, many of which were reported for the first time in variety ‘Urenika’. Several compounds were found at doses which have been reported individually to exert bioactive effects against cancer. It is possible the antiproliferative effects of <b>potato</b> <b>extracts</b> resulted from more than one of these bioactive compounds working together. Dose-dependent apoptotic effects of PPE were observed in T- 47 D culture, and a combined effect seems to exist between PPE and tamoxifen in modulating the S and G 2 /M phase. In summary, the key contributions and significance of current thesis are: (1) demonstration of the “risk” zone for tamoxifen (10 - 8 to 10 - 6 M) and estradiol (10 - 10 to 10 - 8 M) concentrations which may stimulate breast cancer cell growth. Note that these concentrations of tamoxifen or estradiol are physiologically achievable. Furthermore, one key novel finding is regarding the estradiol dependency of tamoxifen action. Specifically, at low to moderate doses (10 - 9 to 10 - 8 M) of tamoxifen, there is a threshold of estradiol (> 10 - 8 M) which allows a significant inhibitory action to occur. The stimulatory action of tamoxifen and complex interaction between tamoxifen and estradiol observed in vitro may partially explain the failure of tamoxifen treatment in some patients. Owing to the vast differences between cell culture experiments and the human body, a more systematic in vivo investigation of clinical effects of tamoxifen over a range of different doses under various estradiol concentrations is warranted; (2) pioneering data on the efficacy of ‘Urenika’ extract against breast cancer in vitro; (3) a metastatic breast cancer animal model which successfully generated metastasis to distant sites (lymph nodes, lungs, livers and spleens), mimicking advanced stage of breast cancer in humans. This model could be used in future testing of the effect of PPE and the combined treatments (PPE with tamoxifen) on establishment and metastasis; and (4) a ‘refined’ non-invasive feeding methodology, which is more ethical than oral gavages, for tamoxifen administration in mice was developed and results obtained were comparable to the method of intraperitoneal injection. Using this model and the non-invasive feeding method, a dose-dependent stimulatory effect of tamoxifen on growth of 4 T 1 tumours was observed in mice. The current thesis has derived a new hypothesis which may be worth clinical investigation: tamoxifen may induce excessive leukocytosis which contributes to tumour invasiveness and growth. This thesis also represents a significant contribution to the potential use of <b>potato</b> <b>extracts</b> in reducing the risk of tamoxifen in stimulating cancer growth...|$|R

40|$|A direct {{quantitative}} proton nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy method was developed for the measurement of saccharides, organic acids and amino acids in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber filaments, a complex gel-like food matrix. The method requires minimal sample preparation. It is thus a faster alternative compared to liquid sample matrices, {{as well as an}} extension to methods analyzing only selected metabolites in the sample. The samples in this study were either raw or steamed potato strips that were either measured as D 2 O extracts or directly without extraction or derivatization steps (in situ technique). A total of 22 compounds were identified in extracts and 18 in potato strips. Of these, 20 compounds were quantifiable in <b>potato</b> <b>extracts</b> and 13 compounds in potato strips. The effect of thermal processing was reflected in the profile of analyzed compounds. One example was fumaric acid, which was completely lost in steamed samples in both measurement techniques. Additionally, the content of γ-aminobutyric acid in steamed potato strips was lower. In <b>potato</b> <b>extracts,</b> the contents of additional 7 compounds were statistically different. The raw and steamed samples separated into two groups with multivariate models both in <b>extracts</b> and <b>potato</b> strips, and these groups were linked to changes in aforementioned compounds. These results demonstrated that the in situ quantitative 1 H NMR technique is a useful tool to analyze potato metabolites. This technique could be further applied to any gel-like complex matrix, meaning that lengthy sample pretreatment could be skipped...|$|R
40|$|Commercially {{available}} health {{supplements and}} herbal remedies containing sterols and sterolins, either from African potato (Hypoxis hemerocallidea) alone, or whether enriched with sterols and sterolins, are {{claimed to be}} efficacious {{in the treatment of}} a variety of ailments. Sterols and sterolins in African potato are purported to be the relevant constituents that are required for the therapeutic claims of such products. A patent describing the extraction of sterolins from African potato plant material has claimed that approximately 9 mg sterolins can be isolated from 100 g of an enriched aqueous African <b>potato</b> <b>extract.</b> Our analysis of African potato plant material and its sterol and sterolin content, when similarly prepared, shows that the measureable content of sterols and sterolins in African potato is far less than the amounts of these compounds that have been claimed to be necessary for therapeutic benefit. We conclude that therapeutic claims relating to sterol and sterolin content in African potato are unsubstantiated, in view of the extremely low content of such compounds that we have isolated from our plant material, and in products containing African <b>potato,</b> or <b>extracts</b> thereof...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} three common potato (Solanum tuberosum) cultivars in Iran Faride Hesam* 1, Gholam Reza Balali 2, Reza Taheri Tehrani 2 Objectives: Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), {{as a whole}} food, contains high levels of vitamins and important antioxidants including phenolic acids, carotenoids and flavonoids. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of three common potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) cultivars in Iran i. e., Savalan, Agria and Sante. Materials and Methods: Phenolic compound extraction of samples was done with methanol and total phenolic on the basis of folin-ciocalteu assay was estimated as 16. 58 to 36. 24 mg GAE/ 100 g dry sample. The antioxidant activities of <b>potato</b> <b>extracts</b> on the basis of inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation and DPPH assay were compared with a commercially available antioxidant, α-tocopherol. Results: Savalan had the highest phenolic content and the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity with EC 50 value of 41. 815 ±mg/ml (DB). Also Savalan had the best inhibitory action against linoleic acid oxidation at 94. 10 ± 1. 89 % at 50 mg/ml sample concentration. Methanolic <b>potato</b> <b>extracts</b> had better antioxidant activity than α-tocopherol. Significant (p< 0. 01) negative correlation was observed between total phenolic content and the EC 50 for DPPH radical scavenging activity(R=- 0. 877), but there was no correlation between total phenolic content and total antioxidant activity. Conclusion: Metanolic <b>extracts</b> of three <b>potato</b> cultivars are able to inhibit the oxidation process. The correlation between total phenolic content and DPPH radical scavenging activity indicates that phenolic compounds are responsible for antiradical activity...|$|R

40|$|Beet Armyworm, Spodoptera exigua is a herbivorous moth and {{a serious}} pest of many {{economically}} important plants, which are used as food sources. Because of rigorous standards of food quality, usage of synthetic insecticides in crop protection, against pests, is limited. Solanaceae plant extracts may be a relatively cheap source of efficient natural insecticides that can limit usage of synthetic substances. Their biological activity is not fully known. In particular, ultrastructural studies, using transmission electron microscopy, are not usual. In the present article we describe the effects of sublethal concentrations of tomato and <b>potato</b> leaf <b>extracts</b> against S. exigua. Acute lethal effects were not observed. Both extracts exerted similar effects within midgut and fat body cells. Midgut cells were not significantly altered while fat body cells showed prominent swelling of nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum, vacuolization of mitochondria and fusion of fat droplets. These changes were much more intensive within groups exposed to <b>potato</b> than tomato <b>extracts</b> at highest concentration at least. Light microscopy was used to observe and document developmental alterations of S. exigua exposed to potato and tomato leaf <b>extracts.</b> <b>Potato</b> leaf <b>extracts</b> significantly decreased hatching success and caused morphological malformations of imagoes. Among them, malformations of wings were the most prominent. Interestingly, these effects were not observed within populations exposed to tomato extracts at highest concentration at least...|$|R

No, there is no high-quality evidence that supports using complementary or alternative agents to lower hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) in patients with noninsulin dependent type 2 diabetes. Oral chromium in widely varying doses reduces HbA 1 c a small amount (strength of recommendation [SOR]: C, meta-analysis of low-quality randomized, controlled trials [RCTs] of disease-oriented outcomes, with inconsistent results). Oral cinnamon 1 to 3 g/d causes a small (< 0. 1 %) drop in HbA 1 c (SOR: C, meta-analysis of low-quality RCTs of disease-oriented outcomes).

In this paper, {{the effects of}} glycoalkaloids present in extracts of Solanaceae plants (potato, tomato and black nightshade) or pure commercial glycoalkaloids on the coleopteran Zophobas atratus F. were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo bioassays using heart experimental models. Each tested extract induced a dose-dependent cardioinhibitory effect. The perfusion of Zophobas atratus semi-isolated heart using the highest <b>potato</b> and tomato <b>extract</b> concentration (1 mmol/L) caused irreversible cardiac arrests, while extract from black nightshade produced fast but reversible arrests.
