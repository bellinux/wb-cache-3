25|$|The Diamant is a conventional, low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{and essentially}} an enlarged version of Piel's successful Emeraude {{designed to accommodate}} more passengers. This extra capacity is provided by a redesigned fuselage which is higher in the rear section and longer overall. While the Emeraude has only two seats, side-by-side, the Diamant has an extra bench seat {{at the rear of}} the cabin to seat one or two more people. The wingspan is also greater than that of the Emeraude, allowing for a greater maximum take-off weight.

500|$|Harry Carter (who with George Buday {{made the}} modern {{attribution}} to Kis) wrote that [...] "the letters of Monotype Ehrhardt are {{like those of}} the Janson, but the appearance of a <b>page</b> <b>set</b> in it is different.

He also suggested that some condensed typefaces made by Kis and sold to the Ducal printing establishment in Florence might have made for a more authentic model. Printing historian James Mosley's review of Morison's memoir, A Tally of Types, described the original metal type as [...] "crudely drawn" [...] compared with some earlier Monotype designs, and suggested that this was due to a change in works management at Monotype with the retirement of head engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont.|$|E
