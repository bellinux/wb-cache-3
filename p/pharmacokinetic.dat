5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that temazepam {{may be the most}} psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of the}} world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain <b>pharmacokinetic</b> properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacia & Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) {{started its}} own oxazolidinone {{research}} {{program in the}} 1990s. Studies of the compounds' structure–activity relationships {{led to the development}} of several subclasses of oxazolidinone derivatives, with varying safety profiles and antimicrobial activity. Two compounds were considered drug candidates: eperezolid (codenamed PNU-100592) and linezolid (PNU-100766). In the preclinical stages of development, they were similar in safety and antibacterial activity, so they were taken to Phase I clinical trials to identify any difference in pharmacokinetics. Linezolid was found to have a <b>pharmacokinetic</b> advantage—requiring only twice-daily dosage, while eperezolid needed to be given three times a day to achieve similar exposure—and therefore proceeded to further trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved linezolid on April 18, 2000. Approval followed in Brazil (June 2000), the United Kingdom (January 2001), Japan and Canada (April 2001), Europe (throughout 2001), and other countries in Latin America and Asia.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is a short-acting {{benzodiazepine}} {{in adults}} with an elimination half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours. In the elderly, {{as well as}} young children and adolescents, the elimination half-life is longer. Midazolam is metabolised into an active metabolite alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Age-related deficits, renal and liver status affect the <b>pharmacokinetic</b> factors of midazolam {{as well as its}} active metabolite. However, the active metabolite of midazolam is minor and contributes to only 10 percent of biological activity of midazolam. Midazolam is poorly absorbed orally, with only 50 percent of the drug reaching the bloodstream. Midazolam is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation. The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on the GABAA receptors; midazolam does not activate GABAA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptors (↑ frequency of Cl− channel opening) resulting in neural inhibition. Almost all of the properties {{can be explained by the}} actions of benzodiazepines on GABAA receptors. This results in the following pharmacological properties being produced: sedation, induction of sleep, reduction in anxiety, anterograde amnesia, muscle relaxation and anticonvulsant effects.|$|E
25|$|Pediatric: <b>Pharmacokinetic</b> data is not {{available}} for this population.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines: {{may cause}} CNS {{depression}} {{and there are}} possible <b>pharmacokinetic</b> interactions.|$|E
25|$|Also paeoniflorin {{seems to}} have a detoxifying effect on the acute {{toxicity}} of aconitine in test animals. This may result from alternations of <b>pharmacokinetic</b> behavior of aconitine in the animals due to the <b>pharmacokinetic</b> interaction between aconitine and paeoniflorin. In addition, in emergencies, one can wash the stomach using either tannic acid or powdered charcoal. Heart stimulants such as strong coffee or caffeine may also help until professional help is available.|$|E
25|$|Captopril {{also has}} a {{relatively}} poor <b>pharmacokinetic</b> profile. The short half-life necessitates {{two or three times}} per day dosing, which may reduce patient compliance.|$|E
25|$|Artemisinin and its endoperoxides {{derivatives}} {{have been}} used for the treatment of P. falciparum related infections but low bioavailability, poor <b>pharmacokinetic</b> properties and high cost of the drugs are a major drawback of their use.|$|E
25|$|Phase I {{results of}} the first two {{therapeutic}} RNAi trials (indicated for age-related macular degeneration, aka AMD) reported at the end of 2005 that siRNAs are well tolerated and have suitable <b>pharmacokinetic</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many benzodiazepines, <b>pharmacokinetic</b> {{interactions}} {{involving the}} P450 system {{have not been}} observed with temazepam. Temazepam shows no significant interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, erythromycin). Oral contraceptives may decrease the effectiveness of temazepam and speed up its elimination half-life.|$|E
25|$|LC-MS {{is widely}} used {{in the field of}} {{bioanalysis}} and is specially involved in <b>pharmacokinetic</b> studies of pharmaceuticals. <b>Pharmacokinetic</b> studies are needed to determine how quickly a drug will be cleared from the body organs and the hepatic blood flow. MS analyzers are useful in these studies because of their shorter analysis time, and higher sensitivity and specificity compared to UV detectors commonly attached to HPLC systems. One major advantage is the use of tandem MS-MS, where the detector may be programmed to select certain ions to fragment. The measured quantity is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. As long as there are no interferences or ion suppression, the LC separation can be quite quick.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine {{has fewer}} drug {{interactions}} than many anticonvulsant drugs, although <b>pharmacokinetic</b> interactions with carbamazepine, phenytoin and other hepatic enzyme inducing medications may shorten half-life. Dose adjustments {{should be made}} on clinical response, but monitoring may be of benefit in assessing compliance.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil and/or N-desmethylsildenafil, {{its major}} active metabolite, may be {{quantified}} in plasma, serum, or whole blood to assess <b>pharmacokinetic</b> status in those receiving the drug therapeutically, {{to confirm the}} diagnosis in potential poisoning victims, or {{to assist in the}} forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose.|$|E
25|$|Intramuscular {{injection}} can {{be complicated}} {{in that the}} depth of subcutaneous fat varies and may result in subcutaneous injection, or may be injected intravenously in error, or the wrong strength used. Intramuscular injection does give a faster and higher <b>pharmacokinetic</b> profile when compared to subcutaneous injection.|$|E
25|$|Four {{drugs in}} the class of NNRTIs have been {{approved}} by regulatory authorities. These are the first generation NNRTIs nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz and the next generation NNRTI etravirine. Several other NNRTIs underwent clinical development but were discontinued due to unfavourable <b>pharmacokinetic,</b> efficacy and/or safety factors.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{routes of}} administration {{do not have}} differential effects on {{the efficacy of the}} drug. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in <b>pharmacokinetic</b> principles such as first-pass metabolism. However, the orally available forms of AAS may cause liver damage in high doses.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} uses of carbon-11 choline in PET imaging was with Alzheimer's disease patients. Choline is the {{precursor}} to neurotransmitter acetylcholine whose cholinergic activity is impaired in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s. While there was uptake of the tracer in the brain, no <b>pharmacokinetic</b> pattern was found.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{significant}} hepatic dysfunction had an approximately 30% decrease in clearance of docetaxel and were also {{at a higher}} risk of toxicity poisoning from docetaxel treatment. Clearance has been shown from population <b>pharmacokinetic</b> studies to decrease significantly with age, increased alpha1 acid glycoprotein and albumin concentrations and decreased body surface area.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to the {{therapeutic}} uses of glucocorticoids can present difficulty; for instance, 25% {{of cases of}} severe asthma may be unresponsive to steroids. This {{may be the result}} of genetic predisposition, ongoing exposure to the cause of the inflammation (such as allergens), immunological phenomena that bypass glucocorticoids, and <b>pharmacokinetic</b> disturbances (incomplete absorption or accelerated excretion or metabolism).|$|E
25|$|The {{adverse effect}} and <b>pharmacokinetic</b> {{limitations}} of captopril stimulated {{the development of}} enalapril and subsequent ACE inhibitors. These were specifically designed to lack the sulfhydryl moiety believed {{to be responsible for}} rash and taste disturbance. Most subsequent ACE inhibitors are given as prodrugs, to improve oral bioavailability. All have longer half-lives and are given once or twice daily, which may improve patient compliance.|$|E
25|$|The concentration-time {{profile of}} {{docetaxel}} {{was consistent with}} a three-compartment <b>pharmacokinetic</b> model. An initial, relatively rapid decline, with an α half-life of mean 4.5 minutes is representative of distribution to peripheral compartments from the systemic circulation. A β half-life of mean 38.3 minutes and a relatively slow γ half-life of mean 12.2 hours represent the slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral compartment.|$|E
25|$|All of the ARBs {{have the}} same {{mechanism}} of action and differences in their potency {{can be related to}} their different <b>pharmacokinetic</b> profiles. A few clinical head-to-head comparisons have been made and candesartan, irbesartan and telmisartan appear to be slightly more effective than losartan in lowering blood pressure. This difference may be related to different strengths of activity at the receptor level, such as duration and strength of receptor binding.|$|E
25|$|Once absorbed, {{triclosan}} is metabolized {{by humans}} primarily through conjugation reactions into glucuronide and sulfate conjugates that are excreted in feces and urine. <b>Pharmacokinetic</b> studies demonstrate that triclosan sulfate and glucuronide may be {{formed in the}} liver at approximately equal rates at the environmentally relevant concentration of 1 to 5 microMolar. When concentrations of triclosan are below 1 microMolar, sulfonation {{is expected to be}} the major metabolic pathway for elimination.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} this <b>pharmacokinetic</b> {{variability}} among patients is that many patients do not receive the right dose to achieve optimal treatment effectiveness with minimized toxic side effects. Some patients are overdosed while others are underdosed. For example, in a randomized clinical trial, investigators found 85% of metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) did not receive the optimal therapeutic dose when dosed by the BSA standard—68% were underdosed and 17% were overdosed.|$|E
25|$|Sulbutiamine (brand name: Arcalion) is a {{synthetic}} derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1). As a dimer of two modified thiamine molecules, it is a lipophilic compound that crosses the blood–brain barrier {{more readily than}} thiamine and increases the levels of thiamine and thiamine phosphate esters in the brain. Sulbutiamine was discovered in Japan {{in an effort to}} develop more useful thiamine derivatives since it was hoped that increasing the lipophilicity of thiamine would result in better <b>pharmacokinetic</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s rapamycin was {{evaluated}} by the Developmental Therapeutic Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It was discovered that rapamycin had an anticancer activity and was a non-cytotoxic agent with cytostatic activity against several human cancer types. However, due to unfavorable <b>pharmacokinetic</b> properties, the development of mTOR inhibitors {{for the treatment of}} cancer was not successful at that time. Since then, rapamycin has also shown to be effective for preventing coronary artery re-stenosis and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.|$|E
25|$|Displacement {{chromatography}} {{has been}} used to identify and characterize these often unseen variants in quantities that are suitable for subsequent preclinical evaluation regimens such as animal <b>pharmacokinetic</b> studies. Knowledge gained during the preclinical development phase is critical for enhanced product quality understanding and provides a basis for risk management and increased regulatory flexibility. The recent Food and Drug Administration’s Quality by Design initiative attempts to provide guidance on development and to facilitate design of products and processes that maximizes efficacy and safety profile while enhancing product manufacturability.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam is not {{recommended}} during pregnancy as it is associated with causing a neonatal withdrawal syndrome and is not generally recommended in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals or people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The Dutch, British and French system called the System of Objectified Judgement Analysis for assessing whether drugs {{should be included in}} drug formularies based on clinical efficacy, adverse effects, <b>pharmacokinetic</b> properties, toxicity, and drug interactions was used to assess nitrazepam. A Dutch analysis using the system found nitrazepam to be unsuitable in drug-prescribing formularies.|$|E
25|$|Whilst all benzodiazepines have abuse potential, certain {{characteristics}} {{increase the}} potential of particular benzodiazepines for abuse. These characteristics are chiefly practical ones—most especially, availability (often based on popular perception of 'dangerous' versus 'non-dangerous' drugs) through prescribing physicians or illicit distributors. Pharmacological and <b>pharmacokinetic</b> factors are also crucial in determining abuse potentials. A short elimination half-life, high potency and a rapid onset of action are characteristics which increase the abuse potential of benzodiazepines. The following table provides the elimination half-life, relevant potency to other benzodiazepines, speed of onset of action and duration of behavioural effects.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{the safety}} and {{efficacy}} of general anesthesia was improved by the routine use of tracheal intubation and other advanced airway management techniques. Significant advances in monitoring and new anesthetic agents with improved <b>pharmacokinetic</b> and pharmacodynamic characteristics also contributed to this trend. Standardized training programs for anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists emerged during this period. The increased application of economic and business administration principles to {{health care in the}} late 20th and early 21st centuries led to the introduction of management practices such as transfer pricing to improve the efficiency of anesthetists.|$|E
25|$|Bioequivalence {{does not}} mean generic drugs must be {{exactly the same as}} the brand-name product ("pharmaceutical equivalent"). Chemical {{differences}} may exist; a different salt or estermay be used, for instance. However, the therapeutic effect of the drug must be the same ("pharmaceutical alternative"). Most small molecule drugs are accepted as bioequivalent if their <b>pharmacokinetic</b> parameters of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) are within a 90% confidence interval of 80–125%; most approved generics are well within this limit. For more complex products—such as inhalers, patch delivery systems, liposomal preparations, or biosimilar drugs—demonstrating pharmacodynamic or clinical equivalence is more challenging.|$|E
25|$|The first {{lipophilic}} thiamine derivative to {{be discovered}} was allithiamine, which was isolated from garlic (Allium sativum) in 1951. Allithiamine is an allyl disulfide derivative. After the discovery of allithiamine, several additional derivatives were synthesized {{with the hope that}} they would have better <b>pharmacokinetic</b> properties than thiamine. Thiamine is unable to diffuse across plasma membranes because it has a positively charged thiazole moiety. Instead, it must be transported across plasma membranes by high affinity carriers, and the rate of transport is low. Sulbutiamine overcomes the poor oral bioavailability of thiamine because it is highly lipophilic. The synthesis of sulbutiamine was reported by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} enables {{a variety of}} experimental sequences. Many commercial mass spectrometers are designed to expedite the execution of such routine sequences as selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and precursor ion scanning. In SRM, the first analyzer allows only a single mass through and the second analyzer monitors for multiple user-defined fragment ions. SRM is most often used with scanning instruments where the second mass analysis event is duty cycle limited. These experiments are used to increase specificity of detection of known molecules, notably in <b>pharmacokinetic</b> studies. Precursor ion scanning refers to monitoring for a specific loss from the precursor ion. The first and second mass analyzers scan across the spectrum as partitioned by a user-defined m/z value. This experiment is used to detect specific motifs within unknown molecules.|$|E
25|$|The {{absorption}} of sirolimus {{into the blood}} stream from the intestine varies widely between patients, with some patients having up to eight times more exposure than others for the same dose. Drug levels are, therefore, taken to make sure patients get the right dose for their condition. This is determined by taking a blood sample before the next dose, which gives the trough level. However, good correlation is noted between trough concentration levels and drug exposure, known as area under the concentration-time curve, for both sirolimus (SRL) and tacrolimus (TAC) (SRL: r2 = 0.83; TAC: r2 = 0.82), so only one level need be taken to know its <b>pharmacokinetic</b> (PK) profile. PK profiles of SRL and of TAC are unaltered by simultaneous administration. Dose-corrected drug exposure of TAC correlates with SRL (r2 = 0.8), so patients have similar bioavailability of both.|$|E
25|$|The on-off {{phenomenon}} {{is an almost}} invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both <b>pharmacokinetic</b> and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Redistribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction {{and the use of}} selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous apomorphine, controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intraduodenal administration of levodopa.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone is {{a highly}} {{selective}} progestogen, and due to its unique structure, unlike progesterone and many other progestins, binds almost exclusively to the progesterone receptor (PR). The affinity of dydrogesterone for the PR is relatively low at about 16% of that of progesterone. However, in vivo, dydrogesterone is much more potent in comparison, with an equivalent dose, in terms of endometrial proliferation, that is 10 to 20 times {{lower than that of}} progesterone. This is due to <b>pharmacokinetic</b> differences between the two drugs, namely improved bioavailability and metabolic stability with dydrogesterone as well as additional progestogenic activity of its metabolites. Although dydrogesterone binds to both isoforms of the PR and has similar activity as an agonist of the PRB as progesterone, its agonistic activity is weak {{in the case of the}} PRA. Hence, dydrogesterone shows selectivity for activation of the PRB. This could potentially confer a therapeutic advantage, as the two receptor isoforms induce different physiological responses in target tissues.|$|E
