I {{can remember the}} time when doctors no more dreamt of consumption and pneumonia being infectious than they now dream of sea-sickness being infectious, or than so great a clinical observer as Sydenham dreamt of smallpox being infectious. I have heard doctors deny {{that there is such}} a thing as infection. I have heard them deny the existence of hydrophobia as a specific disease differing from tetanus. I have heard them defend prophylactic measures and prophylactic legislation as the sole and certain salvation of mankind from zymotic disease; and I have heard them denounce both as malignant spreaders of cancer and lunacy. But the one objection I have never heard from a doctor is the objection that prophylaxis by the inoculatory methods most in vogue is an economic impossibility under our private practice system. They buy some stuff from somebody for a shilling, and inject a pennyworth of it under their patient's skin for half-a-crown, concluding that, since this primitive rite pays the somebody and pays them, the problem of prophylaxis has been satisfactorily solved. The results are sometimes no worse than the ordinary results of dirt getting into cuts; but neither the doctor nor the patient is quite satisfied unless the inoculation [...] "takes"; that is, unless it produces perceptible illness and disablement. Sometimes both doctor and patient get more value in this direction than they bargain for. The results of ordinary private-practice-inoculation at their worst are bad enough to be indistinguishable from those of the most discreditable and dreaded disease known; and doctors, to save the credit of the inoculation, have been driven to accuse their patient or their patient's parents of having contracted this disease independently of the inoculation, an excuse which naturally does not make the family any more resigned, and leads to public recriminations in which the doctors, forgetting everything but the immediate quarrel, naively excuse themselves by admitting, and even claiming as a point in their favor, that it is often impossible to distinguish the disease produced by their inoculation and the disease they have accused the patient of contracting. And both parties assume that what is at issue is the scientific soundness of the prophylaxis. It never occurs to them that the particular <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germ</b> which they intended to introduce into the patient's system may be quite innocent of the catastrophe, and that the casual dirt introduced with it may be at fault. When, as in the case of smallpox or cowpox, the germ has not yet been detected, what you inoculate is simply undefined matter that has been scraped off an anything but chemically clean calf suffering from the disease in question. You take your chance of the germ being in the scrapings, and, lest you should kill it, you take no precautions against other germs being in it as well. Anything may happen as the result of such an inoculation. Yet this is the only stuff of the kind which is prepared and supplied even in State establishments: that is, in the only establishments free from the commercial temptation to adulterate materials and scamp precautionary processes.|$|E

40|$|Arcobacter {{concerns}} a relatively unknown bacterium. The bacterium was isolated from cattle {{at the end}} of the 1970 ’s and since then, it has been classified as a potentially <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germ</b> in the food sector. Different food infections caused by Arcobacter spp. have been described, however the sources of contamination still remain not well-known, which may lie among other things in insufficient isolation procedures. In the international literature available, different research methods for the cultural detection of Arcobacter spp. have been suggested, without a standardized reference procedure developed in accordance with the official method following § 64 Lebensmittel-Futtermittel-Gesetzbuch (LFGB), former § 35 Lebensmittel- und Bedarfsgegenständegesetz (LMBG) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This circumstance makes a sufficient clarification and evaluation of Arcobacter spp. more difficult in regards to its occurrence, virulence and pathogenesis, and thus the risk to the consumer. The aim of the presented work was to determine the contamination rate of Arcobacter spp. for fresh turkey meat and pork from various retail and branch outlets in Berlin. The investigation was carried out in accordance to the micro- and molecular-biological methods (Method 1) described by HOUF et al. (2000, 2001 b). In a supplementary study, the aforementioned microbiological research method from HOUF et al. (2001 b), the recommended protocol from JOHNSON and MURANO (1999 a, b - Method 2) and the modified version of the JOHNSON-MURANO protocol from SCULLION et al. (2004 - Method 3), were compared and examined in regards to their efficiency. Sampling occurred during the period of August 2005 and June 2007 and resulted in a total of 244 meat samples: 151 samples originated from raw turkey meat/innards and 93 samples from raw pork/innards. The following isolation rates were observed: From the 151 turkey samples, 121 (80, 1 %) were contaminated with Arcobacter. From 72, 2 % of the samples A. butzleri was isolated, from 3, 3 % A. cryaerophilus, and from 4, 6 % A. butzleri and A. cryaerophilus simultaneously. With the pork samples, 45 of the 93 samples (48, 4 %) were observed to be contaminated with Arcobacter spp. In 39, 8 % of the cases, A. cryaerophilus was identified, whereas A. butzleri was detected in 8, 6 %. The microbiological investigation showed that the analysed raw turkey and pork samples were heavily contaminated with Arcobacter spp., whereby the number of contaminated turkey meat was observed to be higher. These results support previous studies and estimates, in that poultry remains a potential source of the main origin of infection of Arcobacter spp. Although pork was not observed to be as highly contaminated, this agent also inheres a great deal of importance in this foodstuff. Arcobacter spp. has been assigned to the group "emerging food pathogens" by the ICMSF (international Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods), in that a risk of infection for the consumer exists due to the consumption of Arcobacter contaminated pork and turkey and/or cross contamination in the preparation of other foodstuffs. Insufficient kitchen hygiene as well as insufficient heating of the meat thereby does not represent a source of danger which can be neglected. In order to interrupt this route of infection, the generally well-known measures of food and kitchen hygiene must be adhered to. In the comparative investigation of the productivity of the three isolation methods, the best yield was attained with the help of Method 1 : A total of 64, 7 % of positive samples could be classified, in contrast to the 47, 1 % observed with Method 2 and respectively, 49 % with the very similar Method 3. The selected substances suggested by HOUF et al. (2001 b) restrained and respectively suppressed almost completely the growth of the competitive concomitant flora. However, the selective agar developed by JOHNSON and MURANO (1999 a), partly demonstrated very strong contamination with nonarcobacter flora. In 88, 2 % of the 51 analysed samples, a accompanying flora was observed to have grown on the agar plates. Due to the characteristic growth of Arcobacter, 35, 3 % of cases of suspicious colonies could be well selected. With the remaining 52, 9 %, this was not possible; originally existing slight contaminations can in some cases be overgrown via the accompanying flora or can be inactivated by substrate influences, in that they evade detection. Furthermore, in comparison to the other two isolation methods, Method 1 was demonstrated to be easier and cheaper in the production of the medium as well as its application in the laboratory. Although in the present study the superiority of Method 1 could be demonstrated in comparison to the other two methods, analysis of the results of the three detection methods did not show a 100 % agreement in the distribution of the positive samples and detected species. In 39, 2 % (20 / 51) of the analysed samples, the positive results were identical for all of the three methods used, that is, the same samples were identified as positive, whereas with 33, 3 % (17 samples; comparison between Methods 1 and 2) and respectively 35, 3 % (18 samples, comparison between Methods 1 and 3) of the positively determined samples, it involved different samples. The findings make clear that with the employment of only one detection method, many samples will give false-negative results. Through the combinative application of various detection methods, a clear qualitative and quantitative improvement of the isolation results can thus be obtained. In agreement with these findings, the employment of different combinations of methods has been endorsed by different authors. As the modified protocol of JOHNSON-MURANO compared with the original JOHNSON-MURANO instruction did not increase the isolation rate substantially and proved itself to be more complex in its handling, this is the reason why it is recommended that the collected data comprise of a combination of the isolation protocols following HOUF et al. (2001 b) and JOHNSON-MURANO (1999 a, b). The present level of knowledge over epidemiology, pathogenesis and virulence of Arcobacter spp. remains quite insufficient, in that its relevance as a human-pathogenic agent and as a pathogen, which is transferred via food, can not be reliably assessed. Besides a standardised isolation method for the detection of Arcobacter spp., further studies are required in order to clarify its real influence on human infections. As long as the role of Arcobacter spp remains unclear, according to the precautionary principle, caution is required...|$|E

This study was conducted using the descriptive observational method by taking samples of bacterial culture from 19 laryngoscope blades before laryngoscopy procedures and 19 cleaned laryngoscope after laryngoscopy, as well as from the 14 water sources that were used for cleaning laryngoscope blades in the operating theaters of RSHS Bandung in December 2014 –January 2015. The results of this study revealed a commensal microbial pattern of Bacillus spp. on 10 of 19 laryngoscope blades before they were used in laryngoscopy precedures. It was revealed that among the laryngoscopes blade that had been cleaned after laryngoscopy in the operating room. 1 of 19 was found to have a non-Candida albicans pattern, 1 of 19 had Acinobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus haemolyticus pattern, and 1 of 19 had Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pattern. Hence, it can be concluded that <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs</b> are found in laryngoscope bplades that have been cleaded after laryngoscopy and water that is used to clean them in Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{agroforestry}} {{systems are}} known to be less conducive to the dispersion of plant <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs.</b> These systems, which combine many species components provide a means of improving environmental and regulatory mechanisms of disease. The spatial structure, which is a basic characteristic of these systems, has often been indicated as one of the ecological pest control tool. This study was conducted to identify the interaction between the spatial structure of citrus in cocoa agroforests and the severity of Phytophthora foot rot disease of citrus (PFRDC) in the humid zones of Cameroon. The spatial structure of 19 cocoa based agroforests selected in three sites was analysed by L(r) Ripley modified function. The three sites were selected in two forest zones and in a savannah-forest transition zone. Disease severity was characterized on 438 citrus trees, during three rainy seasons and leaf flare periods. The biodiversity of this system was thus proven and in general, the spatial structure of citrus in the plots was random tend to be regular or aggregate. Plots with aggregate and random spatial structure were significantly attacked by PFRDC compared to regular spatial structure. This allows not only to demonstrate the involvement of the spatial structure of citrus on developing PFRDC in this culture system, but already opens a way for improvement of cocoa agroforests in terms of its structure.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{introduce}} yam in the development of two new composite flours containing soy and cassava. Two composite flours were obtained after fermentation of yam, soybean, and cassava in respectively 60, 30, and 10 % proportions. Two varieties of yam were used: Dioscorea alata (variety "Bete bete") and Dioscorea cayenensis (variety "Lokpa"). Proximate composition, mineral content, some anti-nutritional factors (oxalates, phenols), microbiological quality, and &# 945;-amylase digestibility were determined for the fermented and unfermented composite flours. The results indicated that for the composite flours made of D. alata and D. cayenensis, fermentation increased ash and titrable acidity. Carbohydrates, pH, and energy decreased. Crude fat content was not affected by the fermentation process. Anti-nutritional factors such as oxalates and phenols were found to decrease significantly after the fermentation of the composite flours. Fermentation increased the mineral content (Mg, K, Fe, and Ca) of the composite flours. A decrease in P and Na was observed after fermentation. The microbiological study showed that safety flours contain no potential <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs.</b> The in vitro &# 945;-amylase digestibility of the composite flours was significantly improved after fermentation. The biochemical characteristics and good hygienic quality of the obtained flours suggest that these flours can be considered as a feeding alternative for children in poor areas where yam is produced...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} {{concerning the}} persistence of infective bio molecules in soil is vitally important, {{particularly with regard to}} the occurrence of transmissible spongiforme encephalopathies like BSE and Scrapie. Various studies offer clues that such <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs</b> are able to outlive several years in soil without losing their biological activity. The entry of the TSE pathogen into the environment can take place due to several sources. One possibility is that infective placenta or amniotic fluid of sheep leads to a contamination of the surrounding soil. Even the contamination caused by excrements or non-sterilised agricultural organic fertiliser is conceivable. The observation that sheep will be infected by Scrapie while grazing on pastures where infected sheep have been living before, gives reason for a sustainable contamination of the environment. The aim of the present literature study was the demonstration {{of the state of the}} art concerning the analytical methods in the diagnostic of TSE. The existing or the currently developed methods which might be suitable for the detection of the pathogenic prion protein in soil should be identified. The conducted literature study showed that in principle existing methods should be able to detect prions in soil. However, techniques have to be available enabling the extraction and enrichment of proteins from high amounts of soil. Different from the interaction of proteins in tissues, the distinct adhesion of proteins to soil seems to be very strong and therefore the proteins not available for common used extraction methods...|$|R

40|$|On the {{surfaces}} of fresh poultry meat bacteria such as salmonella or campylobacter, which can cause gastrointestinal diseases in humans, are regularly detected. The pathogens can {{be transferred to the}} meat, if they already populated the live animals. In addition, germs can be transferred through cross-contamination during slaughtering, when cutting the meat into pieces and during treatment of the carcasses. In order to avoid infections transferred through contaminated foods, an integrated hygiene concept must be applied throughout the entire meat production process, i. e. from rearing and slaughtering down to the point of sale. Since these measures are, especially for poultry, effective only to a limited extent, a discussion is currently taking place within the European Union on the use of antimicrobial substances such as chlorine dioxide and peroxy acid for the purpose of removing germs from poultry carcasses. So far the use of such chemical substances for the decontamination of poultry carcasses is banned in the EU, because questions of resistance formation and environmental impact have not been conclusively answered. In addition, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge of unwanted health effects which may result from the fact that apart from the <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs,</b> bacteria naturally occurring on the surface of poultry meat are killed as well. In the opinion of the Federal Institute of Risk Assessment (BfR), chemical procedures cannot replace the necessary integrated hygiene concepts. However, under certain circumstances they can supplement such concepts. The requirement for the use of chemical procedures is that their safety in terms of their health effects must first be established...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{colonization}} of aerobic and anaerobic microbial agents on cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) lesions, especially acute erosive ulcerative ones, {{has been mentioned}} in previous studies showing controversial results on the healing course of lesions {{with the use of}} antibiotics. Aims: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the prevalence of secondary bacterial infections in CL lesions and the effect of its elimination on the lesions′ improvement rate. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional clinical trial was performed on 84 acute CL patients. The required skin samples were taken. Cultivation for bacteria was conducted. Patients with positive culture results were divided into two groups. Both groups received standard anti-leishmania treatment, whereas only one group was treated with cephalexin 40 - 50 mg/kg/day for 10 days. The improvement rate was evaluated in the following visits based on changes in the lesions′ induration size. Results: Among the 84 studied patients, 22. 6 % had a negative culture result whereas the result was positive in 77. 4 %. The most common <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs</b> were Staphylococcus aureus (52. 3 %) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9. 5 %); 34 / 5 % of the positive lesions received antibiotic treatment. Finally, among the lesions with a 75 - 100 % improvement rate, no significant difference was observed between the antibiotic-treated and -untreated groups (36. 1 % vs. 63. 9 %, respectively, P = 0. 403). Conclusions: The most common pathogen was S. aureus and, as a primary outcome, the simultaneous treatment for microbial agents did not have any considerable effect on the improvement rate of CL lesions...|$|R

The genus Ferula has been {{extensively}} studied, due to the high occurrence of active ingredients in it, and which made many species of it be used in traditional medicine. Ferula hermonis Boiss. was not among the investigated species, {{even though it has}} a strong reputation as an aphrodisiac and as a general stimulant. This study focuses, first on the composition of the volatile oil and its active elements through the analysis by gas chromatography: the volatile oil of flowering tops, roots and seed was found to be very rich, but with a predominance of α-pinene, 38 %, 31 % and 51. 3 % respectively. The effectiveness of the Ferula hermonis extracts against some <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs</b> was also evaluated, and then compared to that of usual antibiotic discs. Results showed resin extract of Ferula hermonis to be highly effective against gram-negative bacteria while root’s oil extract to be highly effective against gram-positive bacteria. 50 µl/ml of roots oil extract would inhibit within 10 minutes 6000 germs of Staphylococcus aureus; and 10 µl/ml would inhibit within 1 hour 16000 germs of Streptococcus fecalis. 10 µl/ml of Resin extract would inhibit 2400 germs of Salmonella typhi within 1 hour, and within 24 hours 50 µl/ml and 10 µl/ml of resin extract would inhibit respectively 15300 germs of Escherichia coli and 3500 germs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Microbiological background of vegetable and milk basis {{is characterized by the}} presence of microorganisms differed by different resistance to the medium conditions – рН value, presence of oxygen and high temperatures impact. Enrichment of milk base by vegetable components necessitates to adjust the thermal effect regimes prescribed for milk treatment without additional ingredients. Introduction of vegetable ingredients into milk base is accompanied by polysemantic effect of high temperatures on microorganisms of polycomponent milk – vegetable base. On the one hand introduction of vegetable raw material into milk enhances inhibitory temperature effect on microbial cells due to transition of the medium рН into sour side; on the other hand presence of vegetable raw material particles protects microorganisms against sensitive effect of high temperature. Microflora of vegetable-milk compositions after heat treatment as well as ready-made desserts on their base was presented by spore-forming bacillus the number of which is correlated by their number in the initial raw material. In order to choose the optimal regime of heat treatment all processes running during heat treatment and particularly microbiological and physical-chemical degradation of polysaccharides of vegetables cell structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{and tissue}} penetration of cefotetan were studied after a single injection of 2 g given intravenously for antimicrobial prophylaxis to 16 consecutive patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Concentrations in tissue {{greater than or}} equal to the MIC for 90 % of the main pathogens tested were considered adequate. The elimination half-life at beta phase was 4. 6 +/- 1. 4 h, the total body clearance was 0. 75 +/- 0. 19 ml/kg/min, and the volume of distribution was 260 +/- 71 ml/kg. At the time of incision (33 +/- 16 min after the injection), cefotetan concentrations were 14. 2 +/- 7 micrograms/g in abdominal-wall fat, 16. 4 +/- 1 micrograms/g in epiploic fat, and 163 +/- 62 mg/liter in serum. At the time of surgical anastomosis (151 +/- 54 min), cefotetan concentrations were 33. 3 +/- 6 micrograms/g in the colonic wall and 73 +/- 34 mg/liter in serum. Upon closure of the abdomen (216 +/- 76 min), cefotetan concentrations were 6. 3 +/- 3 micrograms/g in abdominal-wall fat, 6. 1 +/- 4 micrograms/g in epiploic fat, and 64 +/- 38 mg/liter in serum. Cefotetan tissue penetration was 10 % into abdominal and epiploic fat and 46 % into the colonic wall. Levels in tissue were compared with the MIC for 90 % of the most frequently encountered <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs</b> (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli). Adequate concentrations in tissue were obtained up to anastomosis but not upon closure. The authors therefore recommend the injection of an additional dose of 1 g before closure in order to ensure optimal efficacy throughout the surgical procedure...|$|R

Materials and methods: {{the state of the}} sand pollution was evaluated on the next indicators: the salts of heavy metals, organic compounds, <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs,</b> helminthiasises harmful for humans. Laboratory investigations of sand were carried out before the beginning of the swimming season and also in the period of its most pollution (semination) during the season and after the end of it. Results. On the parasitologic indicators the sand pollution in the beach areas of Kharkov region is in average more than 7 % of the general number of assays during the last 5 years. On the sanitary-chemical indicators the sand pollution was absent and on microbiological ones – insignificant. An existing normative base that regulates the requirements for the conditions of recreation and sanitation on the water bodies doesn’t includes the full list of requirements for prevention of the parasitologic diseases, these requirements are presented in the large number of documents, it is imperfect and need changes. That’s why it is necessary to add into the new sanitary regulations the laboratory investigations of the sand (soil) of the beaches while realization of the sanitary-parasitologic oversight on the recreational water bodies.

60|$|The {{smattering of}} science that all--even doctors--pick {{up from the}} {{ordinary}} newspapers nowadays only makes the doctor more dangerous than he used to be. Wise men used to take care to consult doctors qualified before 1860, who were usually contemptuous of or indifferent to the germ theory and bacteriological therapeutics; but now that these veterans have mostly retired or died, we are left {{in the hands of}} the generations which, having heard of microbes much as St. Thomas Aquinas heard of angels, suddenly concluded that the whole art of healing could be summed up in the formula: Find the microbe and kill it. And even that they did not know how to do. The simplest way to kill most microbes is to throw them into an open street or river and let the sun shine on them, which explains the fact that when great cities have recklessly thrown all their sewage into the open river the water has sometimes been cleaner twenty miles below the city than thirty miles above it. But doctors instinctively avoid all facts that are reassuring, and eagerly swallow those that make it a marvel that anyone could possibly survive three days in an atmosphere consisting mainly of countless <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs.</b> They conceive microbes as immortal until slain by a germicide administered by a duly qualified medical man. All through Europe people are adjured, by public notices and even under legal penalties, not to throw their microbes into the sunshine, but to collect them carefully in a handkerchief; shield the handkerchief from the sun in the darkness and warmth of the pocket; and send it to a laundry to be mixed up with everybody else's handkerchiefs, with results only too familiar to local health authorities.|$|R
40|$|A {{correlation}} between crohn´s disease and periodontitis seems possible, {{because of the}} similarity concerning their clinical characterization. Previous studies which have dealt with this matter had different results. There {{are only a few}} studies that deal with patients who are only diseased with periodontis and crohns disease without other illnesses. Over the last years three genetic variations in the NOD 2 (Card 15) genotype was associated with the crohn´s disease. The mutated gene produces a modified NOD 2 protein which causes an unregulated inflammation. It has not been researched yet if there is an effection to the periodontal status. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out the effection of the NOD 2 (Card 15) genotype mutation regarding the periodonal status and the microbiology of patients with crohns´s disease. 150 patients with crohn´s disease were recruited. Among other things probing depth and changes in the oral mucosa were detected. Samples from the periodontal <b>pathogenic</b> <b>germs</b> were taken with paper points and detected with the Dot-blotting hybridisation method. To find the NOD 2 (Card 15) genetic mutation, blood samples were taken and were analysed by the TaqMan®-Assays. The connection between the clinical, microbiological and demographic parameters were figured out with a regression analysis. There were no statistically significant findings in the evaluation between the NOD 2 (Card 15) gene mutation and the probing depth or attachment level. Among the patients the frequency of periodontits was high, but the severity was low or moderate. The important result was a high germ number of all periodontal pathagenous germs especially fom campylobactrer rectus. Even a high number of periodontal germs was found in healthy pockets. The quality and quantity of these germs were not statistically significant with the NOD 2 (Card 15) genetic mutation. However the crohns disease seems to offer good living conditions for the germs. It is possible that the examined germs differ from the known species and that the crohns disease helps them to proliferate. The high number of germs could be important for the differential diagnosis between different bowel diseases and to estimate the genetic risk in families. Furthermore it is known that campylobacter rectus has got a s-layer protein on its surface which has a homology to heat shock proteins. These proteins are known for increasing a molecular mimikry. According to this the crohns disease could be an autoimmune disease caused by the heat schock proteins from campylobacter rectus...|$|R
