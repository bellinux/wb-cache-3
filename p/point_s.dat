5|$|In Fig. 1, a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed <b>point</b> <b>S.</b> The force depends {{only of the}} distance of the point from S. The aim of this proposition is to determine how the force varies with the radius, SP. The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.|$|E
5|$|In the {{historically}} very important case where MN in Fig. 1 {{was part of}} an ellipse and S was one of its foci, Newton showed in Proposition 11 that the limit QR / QT2 was constant at each point on the curve so that the force on the body directed towards the fixed <b>point</b> <b>S</b> varied inversely as the square of the distance SP.|$|E
5|$|Thoratic scutes on struthiosaurines are oval to {{teardrop}} shaped, and possess sharp ridges {{that rise}} distally. Some scutes {{were long and}} had small domes on them. The first primary osteoderms on the pelvis are large, compressed from the sides, and have a sharp, short <b>point.</b> <b>S.</b> sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from the pelvis. One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle, joining the two together, and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike. It is thought that the fragment was {{from the edge of}} the pelvic region. Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small ossicles fused between them. Pelvic shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} {{interval}} of time, an object is in motion from point A to point B. Undisturbed, it {{would continue to}} point c during the second interval. When the object arrives at B, it receives an impulse directed toward <b>point</b> <b>S.</b> The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward S, such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from B to V during the second interval. By the rules of velocity composition, these two velocities add, and point C is found by construction of parallelogram BcCV. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point C {{at the end of}} the second interval. Because the triangles SBc and SBC have the same base SB and the same height Bc or VC, they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle SBc also has the same area as triangle SAB, therefore the object has swept out equal areas SAB and SBC in equal times.|$|E

2500|$|Consider {{a smooth}} surface S in 3-dimensional Euclidean space R3.

The affine subspaces are model surfacesthey are the simplest surfaces in R3, and are homogeneous under the Euclidean group of the plane, hence they are Klein geometries {{in the sense of}} Felix Klein's Erlangen programme. Every smooth surface S has a unique affine plane tangent to it at each point. [...] The family of all such planes in R3, one attached to each point of S, is called the congruence of tangent planes. A tangent plane can be [...] "rolled" [...] along S, and as it does so the point of contact traces out a curve on S. Conversely, given a curve on S, the tangent plane can be rolled along that curve. This provides a way to identify the tangent planes at different points along the curve by affine (in fact Euclidean) transformations, and {{is an example of a}} Cartan connection called an affine connection.|$|E
