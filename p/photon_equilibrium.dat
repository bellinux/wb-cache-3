40|$|It is {{problematic}} {{to interpret the}} quantum jumps of an atom interacting with thermal light in terms of counts at detectors monitoring the atom's inputs and outputs. As an alternative, we develop an interpretation based on a self-consistency argument. We include one mode of the thermal field in the system Hamiltonian and describe its interaction with the atom by an entangled quantum state while assuming that the other modes induce quantum jumps in the usual fashion. In the weak-coupling limit, the photon number expectation of the selected mode is also seen to execute quantum jumps, although more generally, for stronger coupling, Rabi oscillations are observed; the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>photon</b> number distribution is a Bose-Einstein distribution. Each mode may be viewed in isolation in a similar fashion, and summing over their weak-coupling jump rates returns the net jump rates for the atom assumed at the outset...|$|R

As a particular example of superconducting quantum metamaterials an array of SQUIDs incorporated in a low-dissipative transmission line (resonant cavity) will be studied. This system will be modeled {{as a set of}} two-levels systems (qubits) strongly interacting with resonant cavity photons. We predict and analyze a second(first) -order phase transition between an incoherent (the high-temperature phase) and coherent (the low-temperatures phase) states of <b>photons.</b> In <b>equilibrium</b> state the partition function Z of the electromagnetic field (EF) in the cavity is determined by the effective action S_eff{P(τ) } that, in turn, depends on imaginary-time dependent momentum of photon field P(τ). We show that the order parameter of this phase transition is the P_ 0 (τ) minimizing the effective action of a whole system. In the incoherent state the order parameter P_ 0 (τ) = 0 but at low temperatures we obtain various coherent states characterized by non-zero values of P_ 0 (τ). This phase transition in many aspects resembles the Peierls metal-insulator and the metal-superconductor phase transitions. The critical temperature of such phase transition T^ is determined by the energy splitting of two-level systems Δ, a number of SQUIDs in the array N, and the strength of the interaction η between SQUIDs and photons in cavity.

A frequent question asked by researchers in microscale heat transfer is: What are the lowest limits of temperature measurement? The question is usually related to the limits of length and time scales. The answer to this question lies in the thermodynamic description of temperature. Temperature is a thermodynamic property that can only be de ned under equilibrium.

40|$|The Casimir {{effect is}} one of the most {{striking}} discoveries of the quantum physics [1]. It was first described and observed as a weak attractive force between two uncharged metallic plates. The origin of this force is the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field- the constant appearance and disappearance of <b>photons.</b> In thermal <b>equilibrium</b> these vacuum <b>photons</b> will uniformly populate all the available states (eigenmodes). However, the number of accessible modes in the space between the plates depends on the distance and becomes smaller if the plates are closer to each other, whereas the number of accessible modes outside the plates is slightly larger. Skimming over the infamous infinity problem that plagues the quantum field theory, the resulting difference in the energy is what pushes the plates towards each other. The Casimir effect, although weak, cannot be neglected on a submicrometer scale and may even be involved in such macroscopic phenomena as adhesion and sonoluminescence. Estimation of the Casimir force in the general case requires a numerical computation of the Local Density Of States (LDOS) as a function of position, which can be reduced to the numerical solution of a large but classical electromagnetic scattering problem [2]. As this well-studied problem is computationally very intensive there is plenty of room for improvement on th...|$|R
40|$|We examine, {{from both}} a {{qualitative}} and a numerical point of view, {{the evolution of}} Kantowski [...] Sachs cosmological models whose source {{is a mixture of}} a gas of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP's) and a radiative gas made up of a ``tightly coupled'' mixture of electrons, baryons and photons from the end of nucleosynthesis up to the duration of radiative interactions. In this cosmic era annihilation processes are negligible, while the WIMP's only interact gravitationally with the radiative gas and the latter behaves as a single dissipative fluid that can be studied within a hydrodynamical framework. Applying the full transport equations of Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics, coupled with the field and balance equations, we obtain a set of governing equations that becomes an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations once the shear viscosity relaxation time is specified; assuming the latter to be proportional to the Hubble time, the qualitative analysis indicates that models begin in the radiation dominated epoch close to an isotropic equilibrium point. We show how the relaxation time governs the relaxation of the models towards an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>photon</b> entropy, leading to ``near-Eckart'' and transient regimes associated with `abrupt' and `smooth' relaxation processes, respectively. Assuming the WIMP particle to be a super-symmetric neutralino of a 100 $ GeV, the numerical analysis reveals that a physically plausible evolution, compatible with a stable equilibrium state and with observed bounds on CMB anisotropies and neutralino abundance, is only possible for models characterized by initial conditions associated with nearly zero spatial curvature and total initial energy density very close to unity.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} photovoltaic efficiencies {{are usually}} determined {{with the use}} of the Shockley-Queisser detail balance theory. Discussed many times and generally accepted as the theoretical efficiency limit for single junction solar cells, the “detailed balance ” in question indicates that the electron (particle) current produced by the solar cell can be equated to the difference between the absorbed and emitted photon fluxes. In the original SQ paper [1], the emitted photon flux was equated to the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>photon</b> flux scaled by the factor (np/ni 2) where n,p and ni are the electron, hole and intrinsic carrier concentrations in the semiconductor converter (the solar cell), respectively. In a later modification, the theory was formulated in terms of the “generalised Planck distribution ” for photons with non-zero chemical potential. Unlike the theoretical treatment of chemical conversion devices such as fuel cell or battery, the voltage generated by the solar cell is almost incidental to this argument. We shall find it useful to obtain it directly, from an argument based on thermodynamics. Suppose that the solar cell is considered as a cavity or “box ” filled with photons which are to be converted into electricity. The box (of volume V, say) is maintained at temperature To, assumed to be equal to the temperature of the surroundings. If multiplied by the electron charge, the voltage generated by the cell is equivalent to the useful work (to be denoted by w) that can be produced for one photon of this radiation. As the process takes place at constant volume, this is equal to the Helmholtz free energy F per photon – in other words, the chemical potential: sTu...|$|R
