40|$|O desenvolvimento de alimentos funcionais tem aumentado mundialmente devido a seus compostos bioativos que diminuem o risco de doenças e promovem a saúde. Baseado nisso, a indústria e a comunidade científica estão, cada vez mais, buscando ingredientes que possam conferir tais características aos alimentos. A soja, além de ser importante fonte protéica, possui fibras, isoflavonas, oligossacarídeos com potencial prebiótico (rafinose e estaquinose), vitaminas e minerais. As raízes tuberosas de yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) possuem grande quantidade de frutooligossacarídeos do tipo inulina, um componente não digerível pelo nosso organismo, com função de auxiliar na seleção de determinadas bactérias da {{microbiota}} intestinal, principalmente as bifidobactérias, possuindo, portanto, efeito prebiótico. O objetivo do presente estudo foi o de verificar, através da metodologia da superfície de resposta, as melhores condições para a utilização simultânea de extratos aquosos de soja e de yacon no desenvolvimento de um novo produto fermentado por um cultivo probiótico constituído por Enterococcus faecium CRL 183 e Lactobacillus helveticus ssp jugurti 416. Para tanto, as variáveis independentes foram representadas pelo teor protéico fornecido pelo extrato hidrossolúvel de soja (g/L) e pelo extrato aquoso de yacon (%). As variáveis dependentes (respostas) foram obtidas através do teste de aceitação sensorial (“sabor” e “impressão global”). A otimização conjunta das variáveis apontou a formulação 7 (1, 74 g/L de teor protéico fornecido pelo extrato de soja e 25, 86 % de extrato de yacon) do planejamento experimental como sendo a mais adequada. No entanto, as formulações 9 e 10 (ambas contendo 1, 74 g/L de teor protéico fornecido pelo extrato de soja e 40 % de extrato de yacon) apresentaram valores de aceitação que não diferiram significativamente [...] . World-wide {{the development}} of functional food has been increased, due to its bioactive components which decrease the risk of getting some illnesses and promote health. Based on that, the industry and the scientific population {{are more and more}} searching for ingredients that may confer such characteristics to food. The soy, besides being an important proteic source, has fibers and isoflavones, oligosaccharides with potential prebiotic (raffinose and stachyose), vitamins and minerals. The yacon tuber (Smallanthus sonchifolius) is a source of fructooligosaccharides, type inulin, undigestible components by our organism that helps in the selection and development of some bacteria of intestinal microbiota, mainly the bifidobacteria, which means that yacon has prebiotic effect. The aim {{of this study was to}} check, through Response Surface Methodology, the optimum conditions to use, simultaneously, the soy and yacon watery extracts in {{the development of}} a new fermented product with the probiotic cultive constituted by Enterococcus faecium CRL 183 and Lactobacillus helveticus ssp jugurti 416. Therefore, the independent variables were represented by the protein of soymilk (g/L) and the yacon extract (%). The dependent variables (responses) were obtained through the acceptance test (“taste” and “overall acceptability”). The joint optimization of the variables pointed out the 7 th formulation (1. 74 g/L of soymilk protein and 25. 86 % of yacon extract) of the factorial design as the most adequate.

40|$|Detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos will {{be useful}} for {{unraveling}} {{the dynamics of the}} most violent sources in the cosmos and for revealing the neutrino cross-section at extreme energy. Above ~ 10 ^ 20 eV, neutrinos may well be the only cosmic primariies. Thus, {{it is important to know}} the acceptances (event rate/flux) of proposed air-shower experiments for detecting ``horizontal'' neutrino events initiated in our atmosphere, and ``Earth-skimming'' events initiated in the Earth's surface rock or ocean. We calculate these acceptances for fluorescence detectors, both space-based as with the EUSO and OWL proposals, and ground-based, as with Auger, HiRes and Telescope Array. The neutrino cross-section sigma_nuN is not measured at energies above 5. 2 x 10 ^ 13 eV. Although QCD extrapolations offer motivated guesses for sigma_nuN, new physics could intervene to provide a surprise. Therefore, we <b>present</b> the <b>acceptances</b> of horizontal (HAS) and upgoing (UAS) air showers as a function of sigma_nuN over the interesting range 10 ^(- 34) to 10 ^(- 30) cm^ 2. The dependences of acceptances on neutrino energy, shower-threshold energy, shower length and column density, and cloud layers are also studied. For UAS, we <b>present</b> <b>acceptances</b> for events over land (rock), and over the ocean (water). The latter are larger by about an order of magnitude, thus favoring space-based detectors. We revisit the idea of Kusenko and Weiler to infer sigma_nuN at E_nu ~ 10 ^ 20 eV from the ratio of HAS-to-UAS events, and find favorable results. Our calculation is mostly analytic. Included in the UAS calculation are realistic energy-losses for taus, and Earth-curvature effects. Comment: 40 pp, 10 fig...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Contact with {{patients}} {{has important implications}} for medical students' education. Previous studies have shown that patients in teaching hospitals have positive views about medical education. The aim here was to assess the acceptability of medical education among patients and their companions in a non-teaching private hospital that is planning to implement a medical teaching program in the near future. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study conducted in a 200 -bed tertiary-care private hospital in Brasília. METHODS: Between March and April 2005, patients and their companions in three different sections of the hospital (intensive care unit, ward and emergency waiting room) were surveyed using a questionnaire. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 209 volunteers. The majority of the volunteers (178; 85 %) said that they would allow a student to be present during consultations. Of these, 102 (57 %) said {{that they would like to}} have a student <b>present.</b> <b>Acceptance</b> of the presence of students was higher among males (males 93 %; females 81 %; P = 0. 026). Intensive care unit respondents said that they would like medical students to be present more frequently than the other two groups said this (ward 48 %; emergency room 49 %; intensive care unit 74 %; P = 0. 011). CONCLUSIONS: Not only were medical students well accepted but also their presence during consultations was desired by many patients and their companions.

40|$|Section A {{reviews the}} {{literature}} from two areas: it looks first at empirical studies exploring self-stigma in psychosis and secondly at psychological flexibility in psychosis. In doing so, the review aims {{to consider the}} question as to whether the psychological flexibility model, as <b>presented</b> by <b>Acceptance</b> and Commitment Therapy, can help us to understand how and why self-stigma can have a detrimental impact on some individuals experiencing symptoms of psychosis. Section B reports on a quantitative study of self-stigma, psychological flexibility, psychological well-being and quality of life in a First Episode Psychosis population. Research suggests that individuals experiencing psychosis may self-stigmatise, whereby negative beliefs and stereotypes about mental health difficulties are internalised. This in turn has been found to impact negatively on a number of areas. The psychological flexibility model <b>presented</b> by <b>Acceptance</b> and Commitment Therapy may help us to understand this. This study aimed to explore self-stigma using both an explicit and implicit measure of self-stigma to see how these were related to psychological flexibility, quality of life and well-being. Twenty-six participants experiencing first episode psychosis were recruited. They completed self-report questionnaires pertaining to quality of life, psychological well-being, psychological flexibility and explicit self-stigma. In addition, they completed a computer based reaction-time task designed to measure implicit self-stigma. Significant relationships were found between explicit self-stigma and well-being, and between psychological flexibility, explicit self-stigma, quality of life and well-being. Explicit self-stigma was found to statistically mediate the relationship between flexibility and well-being. Implicit self-stigma was not related to any investigated variable. The findings suggest psychological inflexibility may lead to greater self-stigma, which in turn decreases psychological well-being. This implied that interventions geared towards increasing flexibility may not only improve well-being, but may also help address issues of self-stigma...|$|R
