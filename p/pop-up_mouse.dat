It had two PCMCIA slots for additional memory, modem, network card or other peripheral. One of its outstanding features was [...] "Instant On". It was sold in three storage configurations: no mass storage (F1030A at $1515 USD), 10MB flash disc (F1031A at $2375 USD), or 40 MB hard drive (F1032A at $1950 USD). Compared to the hard drive, the flash memory disk reduced the weight and storage capacity but increased battery life. It came with reduced copies of MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1. Due to storage limitations, the OmniBook 300 included Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word pre-installed in ROM, which was and remains unusual to this day. The [...] "International English" [...] version of the OmniBook 300 used code page 850 (rather than the more common code page 437) as hardware code page.|$|E
