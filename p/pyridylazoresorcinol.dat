30|$|Concentration of {{endogenous}} {{hydrogen peroxide}} (H 2 O 2) was determined following the spectrophotometric method (Becana et al. 1986) that was modified by Mai et al. (2013). 0.50  g fresh material were homogenized at 4  °C with 3  mL of 5 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 0.10  g activated charcoal. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12, 000 ×g for 30  min at 4  °C to select supernatant using as extract. The reagent was prepared of 0.6  mM 4 -(- 2 <b>pyridylazo)resorcinol,</b> 0.6  mM of potassium-titanium oxalate in 1 : 1 proportion. Total 3  mL the reaction mixture contained extract, 100  mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.4) and reagent. The decrease of absorbance was measured at wavelength of 508  nm in the UV–Vis CARY 60 spectrophotometer (Agilent, USA) system. The spectral {{data were analyzed}} by using the UV-Win 5.0 application software. Amount of hydrogen peroxide in soybean leaves was expressed as M H 2 O 2  g− 1  FW.|$|E
