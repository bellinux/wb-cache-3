The resin types typically used include Phenol formaldehyde (PF), melamine fortified Urea Formaldehyde (MUF) or isocyanate (PMDI), {{all of which}} are moisture resistant binders. In Europe, it is common to use a combination of binders, typically PMDI would be used in the core and MUF in the face layers and this has the advantage of reducing <b>press</b> <b>cycles</b> whilst imparting a bright appearance {{to the surface of the}} panel.|$|E
50|$|The {{undesired}} {{outcome is}} taken as the root ('top event') of a tree of logic. For instance the undesired outcome of a metal stamping press operation is a human appendage being stamped. Working backward from this top event we might determine {{there are two ways}} this could happen: during normal operation or during maintenance operation. This condition is a logical OR. Considering the branch of occurring during normal operation perhaps we determine there are two ways this could happen: the <b>press</b> <b>cycles</b> and harms the operator or the <b>press</b> <b>cycles</b> and harms another person. This is another logical OR. We can make a design improvement by requiring the operator to press two buttons to cycle the machine—this is a safety feature {{in the form of a}} logical AND. The button may have an intrinsic failure rate—this becomes a fault stimulus we can analyze. When fault trees are labeled with actual numbers for failure probabilities, computer programs can calculate failure probabilities from fault trees. When a specific event is found to have more than one effect event, i.e. it has impact on several subsystems, it is called a common cause or common mode. Graphically speaking, it means this event will appear at several locations in the tree. Common causes introduce dependency relations between events. The probability computations of a tree which contains some common causes are much more complicated than regular trees where all events are considered as independent. Not all software tools available on the market provide such capability.|$|E
5000|$|Named for the {{movement}} of the transfer mechanism, tri-axis transfer mechanisms motion is defined by the three (3) axes of movement made by the part manipulators each press stroke. On the press downstroke the automation which will likely be holding the work piece will lower the work piece to the tool and retract to leave the part on the tool. At the bottom of the stroke the automation mechanism in the retracted state will cycle backward one pitch to position itself adjacent to the next workpiece. As the <b>press</b> <b>cycles</b> upward the part manipulators will index inward to pick up the next work piece, continuing upward following the press ram, then indexing forward to next station. As the press reaches the top of its stroke, the process repeats. The three axes of motion are up-down, in-out, and forward-back.|$|E

Therefore the difference of the temperature between the outer layer and the inner layer of board decrease after passing the minimum value of inner layer temperature of the board. (Fig. 3) 2) The longer the hot press cycle, the higher the value of modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture and Brinell hardness, but the lower the impact bending absorbed energy of the particles, and the feeding quantity of heat. There is not significant relation between the specific bending strength and the hot press cycle. (Fig 2 ̆ 7 s. 4 and 5) 3) The water absorptivity of board is remarkably high at 27 min. hot press cycle, but its value is low at longer than 32 min. cycle and it varys a little as shown in Fig. 6.

40|$|Emission {{control devices}} on dryers and presses have been legislated into the industry, {{and are now}} an {{integral}} part of the drying system. These devices consume large quantities of natural gas and electricity and down-sizing or eliminating them will provide major energy savings. The principal strategy taken here focuses on developing process changes that should minimize (and in some cases eliminate) the need for controls. A second approach is to develop lower-cost control options. It has been shown in laboratory and full-scale work that Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) emerge mainly at the end of the <b>press</b> <b>cycle</b> for particleboard, and, by extension, to other prod-ucts. Hence, only the air associated with this point of the cycle need be captured and treated. A model for estimating terpene emissions in the various zones of veneer dryers has been developed. This should allow the emissions to be concentrated in some zones and minimized in others, so that some of the air could be directly released without controls. Low-cost catalysts have been developed for controlling HAPs from dryers and presses. Catalysts conventionally used for regenerative catalytic oxidizers can be used at much lower temperatures for treating press emissions. Fluidized wood ash is an especially inexpensive mate-rial for efficiently reducing formaldehyde in dryer emissions. A heat transfer model for estimating pinene emissions from hot-pressing strand for the manufacture of flakeboard has been constructed from first principles and validated. The model shows that most of the emissions originate from the 1 -mm layer of wood adjoining the platen surface. Hence, a simple control option is to surface a softwood mat with a layer of hardwood prior to pressing. Fines release a disproportionate large quantity of HAPs, and it has been shown both theo-retically and in full-scale work that particles smaller than 400 ÃÂÃÂµm are principally responsible.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Dielectric {{quantification}} {{of material}} properties is a technology well established in many industries. The {{application of this}} concept to the forest products industry to measure adhesive cure, however, has been belated {{in part due to}} a lack of proven technology directed at industrial processes and products. It is of great interest to manufacturers to minimize production costs and maximize output. This means being able to identify the minimum time required to cure composite panel products during hot pressing. In the hot-pressing process, material is currently pressed based on a conservative schedule that is actually longer than necessary. The schedule provides what temperatures and pressures are to be used throughout the <b>press</b> <b>cycle</b> to ensure resin cure (cross-linking). In the case of urea-formaldehyde, the resin is subject to strength loss if heat remains applied too long. The objective of the schedule is to cure the resin to an acceptable level and remove the product before degradation can occur. It is difficult to exactly predict the optimum point given all the variables to consider such as panel thickness; moisture and time; press pressure and temperature; and particle geometry, etc. This is where dielectric monitoring can help. Since the critical variable is degree of resin cure, it is logical to design a monitoring system that measures and utilizes it in a feedback control system. As the resin is curing, the molecules and ions become interlaced in a lattice structure during polymerization, reducing rotational and migrational mobility. Rotational and migrational mobility can be quantified dielectrically by applying an oscillating electric field to the material. Included in any monitored dielectric quantity is the effect due to moisture and wood. Studies were conducted to determine their contribution to the readings. Particleboard panels were manufactured in a laboratory environment and monitored with a dielectric system developed by the author. Three different adhesives were used urea - formaldehyde (U F), phenol formaldehyde (PF), and polymeric diphenolmethane diisocyanate (isocyanate, MDI). Dielectric response curves were obtained for each of the resins, and internal bond strength (IB) measurements were taken throughout the curing process of the boards. IB data were charted with dielectric data to show characteristics in the dielectric response curves that could be used to indicate cure status. The dielectric response curves show very encouraging peaks, valleys, and inflection points that seem to correspond to respective cure data. These characteristics could be incorporated into a full-scale system and used in an industrial setting to control and optimize press operations...|$|R
