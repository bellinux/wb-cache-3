However, little attention has been given to the dose received by adjacent normal tissues during these imaging procedures. Though these doses are very small compared to the dose delivered during radiotherapy, the involvement of normal tissues and the concern that these could increase the probability of stochastic effect, mainly the induction of secondary malignancy, cannot be ignored.

After IR-based manual prepositioning to rough treatment position and fixation of the mechanical arm, a cone-beam CT(CBCT) is performed. A robotic 6 DoF treatment couch (HexaPOD™) then automatically corrects all remaining translations and rotations. This absolute position of infrared markers at the first fraction acts as reference for the following fractions where patients are manually prepositioned to within ± 2 mm and ± 2 ° of this IR reference position prior to final HexaPOD-based correction; consequently CBCT imaging is only required once at the first treatment fraction. The preclinical feasibility and attainable repositioning accuracy of this method was evaluated on a phantom and human volunteers as was the clinical efficacy on 7 pilot study patients. Results Phantom and volunteer manual IR-based prepositioning to within ± 2 mm and ± 2 ° in 6 DoF was possible within a mean(± SD) of 90 ± 31 and 56 ± 22 seconds respectively. Mean phantom translational and rotational precision after 6 DoF corrections by the HexaPOD was 0. 2 ± 0. 2 mm and 0. 7 ± 0. 8 ° respectively. For the actual patient collective, the mean 3 D vector for inter-treatment repositioning accuracy (n = 102) was 1. 6 ± 0. 8 mm while intra-fraction movement (n = 110) was 0. 6 ± 0. 4 mm. Conclusions This novel semi-automatic 6 DoF IR-based system {{has been shown to}} compare favourably with existing non-invasive intracranial repeat fixation systems with respect to handling, reproducibility and, more importantly, intra-fraction rigidity. Some advantages are full cranial positioning flexibility for single and fractionated IGRT treatments and possibly increased patient comfort. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeIn high <b>precision</b> photon <b>radiotherapy</b> and in hadrontherapy, it {{is crucial}} to {{minimize}} the occurrence of geometrical deviations with respect to the treatment plan in each treatment session. To this end, point-based infrared (IR) optical tracking for patient set-up quality assessment is performed. Such tracking depends on external fiducial points placement. The main purpose of our work is to propose a new algorithm based on simulated annealing and augmented Lagrangian pattern search (SAPS), which is able to take into account prior knowledge, such as spatial constraints, during the optimization process. Material and methodsThe SAPS algorithm was tested on data related to head and neck and pelvic cancer patients, and that were fitted with external surface markers for IR optical tracking applied for patient set-up preliminary correction. The integrated algorithm was tested considering optimality measures obtained with Computed Tomography (CT) images (i. e. the ratio between the so-called target registration error and fiducial registration error, TRE/FRE) and assessing the marker spatial distribution. Comparison has been performed with randomly selected marker configuration and with the GETS algorithm (Genetic Evolutionary Taboo Search), also taking into account the presence of organs at risk. ResultsThe results obtained with SAPS highlight improvements with respect to the other approaches: (i) TRE/FRE ratio decreases; (ii) marker distribution satisfies both marker visibility and spatial constraints. We have also investigated how the TRE/FRE ratio is influenced by the number of markers, obtaining significant TRE/FRE reduction with respect to the random configurations, when a high number of markers is used. ConclusionsThe SAPS algorithm is a valuable strategy for fiducial configuration optimization in IR optical tracking applied for patient set-up error detection and correction in radiation therapy, showing that taking into account prior knowledge is valuable in this optimization process. Further work will be focused on the computational optimization of the SAPS algorithm toward fast point-of-care applications...|$|R

This thesis {{describes}} {{the construction and}} use of the facemask at the National Accelerator Centre (NAC) as used to both immobilise and position patients for <b>precision</b> proton <b>radiotherapy.</b> The <b>precision</b> achieved using the stereophotogrammetric (SPG) positioning system is measured, and the shortcomings and errors in using the facemask by the SPG system are measured and analysed. The implementation of improvements made to the SPG system is reported upon, and alternative means of both supporting the fiducial markers and immobilising the patient are investigated and evaluated. The accuracy of positioning a facemask using the SPG system is 1. 4 mm and of positioning a newly designed frame is 1. 6 mm. These measurements were made without using a patient. It is estimated that the total uncertainty of positioning a patient's tumour at the isocentre is 1. 6 (1 SD) mm using the facemask and it is estimated that the precision using the frame will be less than this value. The largest component of this error (1. 39 mm) is due to the error in obtaining the CT scanner co-ordinates. These results are comparable to those obtained by other investigators. The movement of patient bony landmarks within the facemask was measured to be 1. 0 ± 0. 8 mm. Three main recommendations are that the CT scanner co-ordinating procedure be improved, the SPG computer program be rewritten in parts to achieve greater speed and accuracy, and that the new frame be used. The frame is easier to manufacture than the facemask and allows real time monitoring of the position of the patient's head by the SPG system thus allowing faster throughput of patients and better positioning quality control...|$|R

40|$|Image {{reconstruction}} and motion estimation {{are very important}} for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Three-dimensional reconstruction of patient anatomy using X-ray computed tomography (CT) allows identification of {{the location of a}} tumor prior to treatment. The locations of tumorsmay change during actual treatment due to movement such as respiratory motion. Motion estimation helps optimize the accuracy and <b>precision</b> of <b>radiotherapy</b> so that more of the normal surrounding tissue can be spared. This dissertation addresses several important issues related to these two core components of IGRT. Firstly, we developed two new separable footprint (SF) projector methods for X-ray conebeam CT. The SF projectors approximate the voxel footprint functions as 2 D separable functions. The SF-TR projector uses trapezoid functions in the transaxial direction and rectangular functions in the axial direction, whereas the SF-TT projector uses trapezoid functions in both directions. Both SF projector methods are more accurate than the distance-driven (DD) projector, which is a current state-of-the-art method in the field. The SF-TT projector is more accurate than the SF-TR projector for rays associated with large cone angles. In addition, the SF-TR projector has similar computation speed with the DD projector and the SF-TT projector is about two times slower. Secondly, we proposed a statistical penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) method with edge-preserving regularization to reconstruct two basis materials from a single-energy CT scan acquired with differential filtration, such as a split filter or a bow-tie filter. It requires only the use of suitable filters between the X-ray tube and the patient. For both filtration methods, the proposed PWLS method reconstructed soft tissue and bone images with lower RMS errors, reduced the beam-hardening artifacts much more effectively and produced lower noise, as compared with the traditional non-iterative Joseph and Spital method. Thirdly, we conducted an objective characterization of the influence of rotational arc length on accuracy of motion estimation for projection-to-volume targeting during rotational therapy. Simulations illustrate the potential accuracy of limited-angle projection-to-volume alignment. Registration accuracy can be sensitive to angular center, tends to be lower along direction of the projection set, and tends to decrease away from the rotation center...|$|R

Implementation of robust biophysical readouts is urgently needed to assess the efficacy of different radiation qualities. This is the first report on biophysical evaluation of Monte Carlo simulated predictive models of prescribed dose for four particle qualities i. e., proton, helium-, carbon- or oxygen ions using raster-scanning technology and clinical therapy settings at HIT. A high level of agreement {{was found between the}} in silico simulations, the physical dosimetry and the clonogenic tumor cell survival. The cell fluorescence ion track hybrid detector (Cell-Fit-HD) technology was employed to detect particle traverse per cell nucleus. Across a panel of radiobiological surrogates studied such as late ROS accumulation and apoptosis (caspase 3 / 7 activation), the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) chiefly correlated with the radiation species-specific spatio-temporal pattern of DNA double strand break (DSB) formation and repair kinetic. The size and the number of residual nuclear γ-H 2 AX foci increased as a function of linear energy transfer (LET) and RBE, reminiscent of enhanced DNA-damage complexity and accumulation of non-repairable DSB. These data confirm the high relevance of complex DSB formation as a central determinant of cell fate and reliable biological surrogates for cell survival/ RBE.

Manual creation and evaluation of treatment plans becomes difficult or even infeasible with {{an increasing number of}} degrees of freedom for dose delivery and available image data. The goal of this work is to develop an optimisation model that determines beam-on times for a given beam configuration, and to assess the feasibility and benefits of an automated treatment planning system for small animal radiotherapy. The developed model determines a Pareto optimal solution using operator-defined weights for a multiple-objective treatment planning problem. An interactive approach allows the planner to navigate towards, and to select the Pareto optimal treatment plan that yields the most preferred trade-off of the conflicting objectives. This model was evaluated using four small animal cases based on cone-beam computed tomography images. Resulting treatment plan quality was compared to the quality of manually optimised treatment plans using dose-volume histograms and metrics. Results show that the developed framework is well capable of optimising beam-on times for 3 D dose distributions and offers several advantages over manual treatment plan optimisation. For all cases but the simple flank tumour case, a similar amount of time was needed for manual and automated beam-on time optimisation. In this time frame, manual optimisation generates a single treatment plan, while the inverse planning system yields a set of Pareto optimal solutions which provides quantitative insight on the sensitivity of conflicting objectives. Treatment planning automation decreases the dependence on operator experience and allows for the use of class solutions for similar treatment scenarios. This can shorten the time required for treatment planning and therefore increase animal throughput. In addition, this can improve treatment standardisation and comparability of research data within studies and among different institutes...|$|R

In this work, we adapt the previous method {{and apply it to}} tackle the parotid segmentation problem in the MIC-CAI 2010 H&N Segmentation Challenge. The proposed method applies a hybrid deformable image registration to map parotid labels from an atlas image to the subject, the result of which is then refined using a deformable surface model approach. Segmentation fusion using multipleatlases is also employed to further improve the segmentation accuracy. Validation results on eight clinical datasets distributed by the MICCAI workshop showed that the proposed method gave accurate segmentation results, with a volume overlap above 85 % for most subjects. ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: To achieve high <b>precision</b> {{prostate}} <b>radiotherapy</b> requires accurate delineation of {{the prostate}} combined with accurate targeting of treatment with image-guided techniques. MRI scans {{have been shown to}} have lower inter-observer variability in prostate contouring than CT scans. If dose planning could also be performed on MRI scans then uncertainties due to registration to a CT scan would be reduced, as well as the resources required to use two imaging modalities. The feasibility of dose planning directly on MRI scans is investigated in this study. METHODS: Ten patients treated at the Newcastle Mater Hospital had three 0. 9 × 7 mm gold markers implanted by a urologist under trans-rectal guidance. Each patient then underwent a planning CT with urethral contrast. The prostate was delineated on the CT for field definition as per our normal protocol. Patients were treated with daily on-line corrections using electronic portal images of the implanted markers. The patients also received a MRI scan in the treatment position following their planning CT. Several MRI sequences were utilized; a T 2 whole pelvis scan, a T 2 small field-of-view scan to visualise prostate borders, and a T 2 * gradient echo scan to visualise implanted markers. All scans were transferred to the Pinnacle treatment planning system. The CT and MRI scans were registered using bony anatomy. Dose plans were produced on both sets of scans. For the CT scans, plans were produced with full electron density information, a bulk uniform density of 1, and bulk density plus a density of 1. 3 assigned to the bone regions. For the MRI plans, uniform and uniform+bone densities were assigned to the scans and dose plans using the same beam arrangements produced. The doses to the ICRU point for the dose plans were then compared. RESULTS: Dose plans for two patients have been analyzed to date. Assigning a bulk uniform density to the CT scan was found to give average dose errors of 2. 7 % to the ICRU point compared to the full density plan. When the bulk density of bony anatomy was added, this was reduced to within 1 %. Bulk density MRI plans gave average dose errors of 3. 7 %, which was reduced to 2. 3 % with bulk density of bone added. [Figure 1. Example of bulk density CT and MRI dose plans. ] DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: The CT results suggest that scans with bulk densities assigned produce reasonably accurate dose plans for prostate. By optimizing the densities used, further improvements may be achieved. However the errors when bulk densities were assigned to MRI scans were greater. This is due to differences in patient contour due to both MRI spatial uniformity and patient positioning differences. Futher work is required to quantify the errors due to spatial unformity differences with a rigid phantom...|$|R
40|$|Brain tissue deforms {{significantly}} {{after opening}} the dura and during tumor resection, invalidating pre-operative imaging data. Ultrasound {{is a popular}} imaging modality for providing the neurosurgeon with real-time updated images of brain tissue. Interpretation of post-resection ultrasound images is difficult due to large brain shift and tissue resection. Furthermore, several factors degrade the quality of post-resection ultrasound images such as strong reflection of waves at the interface of saline water and brain tissue in resection cavities, air bubbles {{and the application of}} blood-clotting agents around the edges of resection. Image registration allows comparison of post-resection ultrasound images with higher quality pre-resection images, assists in interpretation of post-resection images and may help identify residual tumor, and as such, is of significant clinical importance. Prostate motion is known to reduce the <b>precision</b> of prostate <b>radiotherapy.</b> This motion can be categorized into intrafraction and interfraction. Interfraction motion introduces large systematic errors into the treatment and is the largest contributor to prostate planning treatment volume (PTV) margins. Conventional solutions to interfraction motion all have respective drawbacks. Clarity Autoscan system provides continuous ultrasound imaging of the prostate for interfraction motion correction, however it is time-consuming and can have large interobserver errors. The intension of accurately targeting the prostate and reducing the side effects in treatment requests a faster and more accurate registration framework for interfraction motion correction. In this thesis, we first propose a registration framework called Nonrigid Symmetric Registration (NSR) for accurate alignment of pre- and post-resection volumetric ultrasound images in near real-time. An outlier detection algorithm is proposed and utilized in this framework to identify non-corresponding regions (outliers) and therefore improve the robustness and accuracy of registration. We use an Efficient Second-order Minimization (ESM) method for fast and robust optimization. A symmetric and inverse-consistent method is exploited to generate realistic deformation fields. The results show that NSR significantly improves the quality of alignment between pre- and post-resection ultrasound images. Then based on this framework, we develop a rigid registration framework called Prostate Registration Framework (PRF) for alignment of the prosate region in simulation and treatment volumes. PRF is trained using 2 3 D transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) images of an ultrasound prostate phantom and 20 3 D TPUS images from 11 patients receiving Clarity Autoscan. Algorithm performance is evaluated using further 21 TPUS images from a total of 8 patients by comparison of the PRF with manual matching of landmarks and Clarity-based estimation of interfraction motion performed by three observers. The results show that PRF outputs more accurate alignment of the prosate region in simulation and treatment volumes than Clarity, and further, provides the reposition of the prostate in treatment images efficiently and accurately...|$|R
40|$|Stereotactic {{radiotherapy}} {{is a novel}} {{approach to}} treat lung cancers with very large doses of radiation and high <b>precision.</b> Stereotactic lung <b>radiotherapy</b> is complicated by lung tumours moving during patient respiration. A motion compensation method for treatment planning is to use four-dimensional CT (4 DCT) imaging to generate a maximum intensity projection (MIP) internal target volume (ITV). Image-guided radiotherapy during treatment may then involve acquiring a volumetric cone-beam CT (CBCT) image of the tumour and visually aligning it to the 4 DCT MIP ITV contour. Imaging moving targets with CBCT results in blurry images and currently there are no studies reporting the effect that irregular breathing patterns have on CBCT volumes and their alignment to 4 DCT MIP ITV contours. The objective of this project was to image a phantom moving with irregular breathing patterns to determine whether any configurations resulted in clinically significant errors in volume contouring or patient alignment. This project used a Perspex thorax phantom to simulate a lung patient. Three wooden ‘lung’ inserts with Perspex ‘lesions’ were moved up to 4 cm with computer-generated, and patient-specific breathing patterns. The phantom was imaged on 4 DCT and CBCT with the same acquisition settings used for stereotactic patients in the clinic and volumes on all phantom images were contoured. This project assessed volumes for qualitative changes, and quantitative changes including volume, volume length, and alignment errors between CBCT volumes and 4 DCT MIP ITV contours. The results showed significant changes to 4 DCT MIP and CBCT volumes for large amplitudes and irregular motion patterns. Artefacts presented in 4 DCT MIP images, while CBCT volumes became significantly reduced in contrast. Both imaging modalities had reduced volumes up to 30 % as well as shortened ITV lengths up to 3. 7 mm indicating that volume was underrepresented at the extremes of motion. When phantom lesions were moved with variable amplitudes from patient traces there was a distinct trend in reduced ITV with increasing amplitude that was not seen for constant amplitudes. In most cases sinusoidal motion patterns resulted in the closest agreements to known values and resulted in the smallest misalignments. Since most patients do not breathe sinusoidally this may lead to misinterpretation of previous studies using only sinusoidal motion. Strategies are needed to compensate for volume underrepresentation at the extremes of motion for both 4 DCT MIP and CBCT for larger and varied amplitudes, and for patterns with rest periods following exhalation. Lesions moving greater than 2 cm had reduced 4 DCT MIP ITVs and shortened ITV lengths that would warrant larger treatment margins added to the ITV as volume is underrepresented at the extremes of motion. Lesions moved with a rest period following exhalation were better aligned using an edge-to-edge alignment technique. Sinusoidal patterns gave the best agreements with known values, reinforcing the importance of investigating clinically relevant motions and their effects on 4 DCT MIP and CBCT volumes. While the thesis confirms that using CBCT for stereotactic lung treatment verification is in most cases appropriate, limitations due to large and irregular motions were identified and methods for addressing these problems are suggested...|$|R

The most important difference between protons and heavier ions is the increased biological effectiveness of the latter, i. e., with heavy ions a lower physical dose is needed to obtain a given biological effect. Carbon ions are particularly attractive for hadrontherapy, {{due to the fact that}} their energy deposition is highly localized and their relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is high towards the end of the range, thus offering an additional advantage for slowly growing radioresistant tumors. However, when the carbon beam penetrates matter, the primary ions can be fragmented as a result of the collisions with the tissue atomic nuclei. The collisions along the carbon path lead to the attenuation of the primary beam intensity and the production of secondary fragments, such as neutrons and ions lighter than carbon (hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium and boron isotopes). These lighter fragments have longer ranges and wider energy distributions than the primary particles and give rise to a characteristic dose tail behind the Bragg peak (BP). The biological effect of a certain type of ion radiation is dependent also on these secondary products, therefore, a detailed knowledge of the fragmentation process is essential to guarantee the appropriate treatment accuracy. The determination of the RBE of the fragments by means of radiobiological experiments is difficult and, in the energy range of biomedical interest, limited cross section data are available for the production of heavy recoils after proton irradiation. The new experiment FOOT (FragmentatiOn Of Target) has therefore been proposed to measure the fragmentation cross sections of the target in proton therapy and of the projectile in ion therapy. To overcome the difficulties related to the short fragment range, the FOOT experiment adopts an inverse kinematic approach. The final FOOT apparatus will consist of a high precision tracking system in magnetic field (composed by silicon pixel trackers and silicon strip detectors), a time-of-flight dE/dx measurement system (hereafter called TOF dE/dx detector) and a calorimeter. The beam monitoring system of the FOOT experiment will include a plastic scintillator detector to measure the incoming rate of the ion beam and a drift chamber to measure the incident beam direction and position. The final TOF dE/dx detector will be composed by two orthogonal layers of 22 plastic scintillator bars each, and each bar will be readout at both ends by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). This detector will be used to measure the Time Of Flight of the fragments and the energy released in the scintillator (for the calculation of the mass number A). The requirements of the FOOT experiment are: enrgy resolution 2 % and TOF resolution 100 ps. In the development of the final TOF dE/dx detector, some critical parameters need to be taken into account. These are, for example, the thickness of the plastic scintillator bar, the efficiency of the light collection (i. e. the number of SiPMs at the ends of the bars and the type of connection among them) and the data acquisition parameters which are used to digitize the signal. Before developing the final detector, these parameters need to be studied and tuned. The aim of the present thesis is therefore the development and the characterization of a TOF dE/dx protoype that consists of a plastic scintillator bar coupled on both sides to SiPMs and to study how the time and energy resolution depend on factors such as the beam energy, the beam interaction position inside the scintillator bar, the SiPM applied voltage and the electronics sampling rate. In Chapter 1, the state of the art of hadrontherapy is introduced, followed by a description of the relevant radiobiological parameters adopted in Particle Terapy. Chapter 2 shows the measurements strategy and the experimental setup adopted in the FOOT experiment. In Chapter 3, the structure of the TOF dE/dx prototype detector and the calculation of the time and energy information is explained. The preliminary results obtained with a TOF dE/dx detector prototype at the Proton Therapy Centre (PTC) of the Trento Hospital with a 70 - 230 MeV proton beam are presented and discussed in Chapter 4. In the final Chapter, the conclusions of the work are drawn and the future perspectives are outlined. The results of the characterization of the detector prototype developed in this thesis have shown that a detector with time resolution lower than 100 ps and energy resolution lower than 2 %, can be developed for particle beams with energy and atomic number in the range of interest for the FOOT experiment. In addition, these results will allow to develop a final detector with time and energy performance compliant with the requirements of the FOOT experiment...|$|R
40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{the most}} common {{malignant}} brain tumor in adults. The current standard of care includes surgery followed by radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). Treatment often fails due to the radiation resistance and intrinsic or acquired TMZ resistance of a small percentage of cells with stem cell-like behavior (CSC). The NOTCH signaling pathway is expressed and active in human glioblastoma and NOTCH inhibitors attenuate tumor growth in vivo in xenograft models. Here we show using an image guided micro-CT and <b>precision</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> platform that a combination of the clinically approved NOTCH/γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) RO 4929097 with standard of care (TMZ + RT) reduces tumor growth and prolongs survival compared to dual combinations. We show that GSI in combination with RT and TMZ attenuates proliferation, decreases 3 D spheroid growth and results into a marked reduction in clonogenic survival in primary and established glioma cell lines. We found that the glioma stem cell marker CD 133, SOX 2 and Nestin were reduced following combination treatments and NOTCH inhibitors albeit in a different manner. These findings indicate that NOTCH inhibition combined with standard of care treatment has an anti-glioma stem cell effect which provides an improved survival benefit for GBM and encourages further translational and clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|Radiotherapy forms one of {{the major}} {{treatment}} modalities for head and neck cancers (HNC), and <b>precision</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy require accurate target delineation to ensure success of the treatment. Conventionally used imaging modalities, such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging are used to delineate the tumor. Imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET) -CT, which combines the functional and anatomic modalities, is increasingly being used in the management of HNC. Currently, 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose is the most commonly used radioisotope, which is accumulated in areas of high glucose uptake, such as the tumor tissue. Because most disease recurrences are within the high-dose radiotherapy volume, defining a biological target volume for radiotherapy boost is an attractive approach to improve the results. There are many challenges in employing the PET-CT for radiotherapy planning, such as patient positioning, target edge definition, and use of new PET tracers, which represent various functional properties, such as hypoxia, protein synthesis, and proliferation. The role of PET-CT for radiotherapy planning is ever expanding and more clinical data underlining the advantages and challenges in this approach are emerging. In this article, we review the current clinical evidence for the application of functional imaging to radiotherapy planning and discuss some of the current challenges and possible solutions that have been suggested to date...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Intrafractional motion {{can be a}} {{substantial}} uncertainty in <b>precision</b> <b>radiotherapy.</b> Conventionally, the target volume is expanded {{to account for the}} motion. Couch-tracking is an alternative, where the patient is moved to compensate for the tumor motion. However, the couch motion may influence the patient's stress and respiration behavior decreasing the couch-tracking effectiveness. METHODS In total, 100 volunteers were positioned supine on a robotic couch, which moved dynamically and respiration synchronized. During the measurement, the skin conductivity, the heartrate, and the gaze location were measured indicating the volunteer's stress. Volunteers rated the subjective motion sickness using a questionnaire. The measurement alternated between static and tracking segments (three cycles), each 1 min long. RESULTS The respiration amplitude showed no significant difference between tracking and static segments, but decreased significantly from the first to the last tracking segment (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). The respiration frequency differed significantly between tracking and static segments (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), but not between the first and the last tracking segment. The physiological parameters and the questionnaire showed mild signals of stress and motion sickness. CONCLUSION Generally, people tolerated the couch motions. The interaction between couch motion and the patient's breathing pattern should be considered for a clinical implementation.

40|$|In vitro dosimetric {{verification}} {{prior to}} patient treatment has {{a key role}} in accurate and <b>precision</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> treatment delivery. Most of commercially available dosimetric phantoms have almost homogeneous density throughout their volume, while real interior of patient body has variable and varying densities inside. In this study an attempt has been made to verify the physical dosimetry in actual human body scenario by using goat head as "head phantom" and goat meat as "tissue phantom". The mean percentage variation between planned and measured doses was found to be 2. 48 (standard deviation (SD) : 0. 74), 2. 36 (SD: 0. 77), 3. 62 (SD: 1. 05), and 3. 31 (SD: 0. 78) for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 DCRT) (head phantom), intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT; head phantom), 3 DCRT (tissue phantom), and IMRT (tissue phantom), respectively. Although percentage variations in case of head phantom were within tolerance limit (< ± 3 %), but still it is higher than the results obtained by using commercially available phantoms. And the percentage variations in most of cases of tissue phantom were out of tolerance limit. On the basis of these preliminary results it is logical and rational to develop radiation dosimetry methods based on real human body and also to develop an artificial phantom which should truly represent the interior of human body...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the clinical efficacy and treatment toxicity of volume-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). 205 VMAT-treated NPC patients from our cancer center were prospectively entrolled. All patients received 68 - 70 Gy irradiation {{based on the}} planning target volume of the primary gross tumor volume. Acute and late toxicities were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3. 0 and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria. The median follow-up period was 37. 3 months (range, 6. 3 - 45. 1 months). The 3 -year estimated local failure-free survival, regional failure-free survival, locoregional failure-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, disease-free survival and overall survival were 95. 5 %, 97. 0 %, 94. 0 %, 92. 1 %, 86. 8 % and 97. 0 %, respectively. Cox regression analysis showed primary gross tumor volume, N stage and EBV-DNA to be independent predictors of VMAT outcomes (P < 0. 05). The most common acute and late side effects were grade 2 - 3 mucositis (78 %) and xerostomia (83 %, 61 %, 34 %, and 9 % at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after VMAT), respectively. VMAT for the primary treatment of NPC achieved very high locoregional control with a favorable toxicity profile.

40|$|In this study, we {{compared}} the motion accuracy of a {{six degrees of freedom}} (6 D) couch for <b>precision</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> with or without weights attached to the couch. Two digital cameras were focused on the iso-center of a linear accelerator. Images of a needle which had been fixed to the 6 D couch were obtained using the cameras when the couch moved in translation and rotation around each axis. The three-dimensional (3 D) coordinates of the needle were calculated from coordinate values in the images. A coordinate error of the needle position relative to the theoretical position was calculated. The errors were obtained with or without a 60 kg weight attached to the 6 D couch, and these errors were compared with each other. The mean distance of the 3 D error vectors for the weighted test was 0. 21 ± 0. 11 mm, and > 0. 16 ± 0. 09 mm for the non-weighted test (p < 0. 05). However, the difference of two values was 0. 06 mm which is smaller than the minimum distance the 6 D couch system can correctly move. The variance of 0. 16 mm for the Y coordinate errors for the weighted test only was larger than that for the non-weighted test, which was 0. 06 mm (p < 0. 05). We found that a total weight of 60 kg did not affect the accuracy of the 6 D couch clinically. However, the variance of the Y coordinate errors was increased. This might suggest that the addition of this weight increased the uncertainty of the motion of the 6 D couch...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} current focal high <b>precision</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> (RT) {{techniques to}} spare hippocampi most optimally, {{in view of}} mounting clinical evidence to preserve neurocognition. Materials and Methods: Computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) datasets of 10 patients with benign/low-grade brain tumors, treated with focal conformal RT were replanned with helical tomotherapy (Tomo), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with high definition multileaf collimator (HD-MLC), and forward planning stereotactic conformal radiotherapy (SCRT). The primary planning objective was to encompass 99 % of planning target volume (PTV) by 95 % of prescribed dose (54 Gy/ 30 #). Assessments included target coverage (TC), homogeneity index (HI), and maximum (max) and minimum (min) dose. Hippocampal dose was assessed with mean, maximum, minimum, median dosem and various dose levels. Results: Mean V 95 for PTV coverage in Tomo, IMRT, and SCRT were 99. 7, 99. 4, and 98. 3 %, respectively. PTV coverage was significantly better in Tomo and IMRT compared to SCRT (P = 0. 03). Tomotherapy (HI ≤ 0. 06) and IMRT (HI ≤ 0. 06) plans were more homogenous than SCRT (HI > 0. 7) (P = 0. 00). Right hippocampus mean dose with Tomo (20 Gy) was 18. 5 % less than SCRT (30 Gy); but for left hippocampus, difference decreased to 3. 3 % (Tomo- 32. 2 Gy and SCRT- 34 Gy). At 30 % dose level, 9 % more volume of right hippocampus was treated in IMRT and 20 % in SCRT when compared to Tomo plan. At 80 % dose, 6 and 12 % more volumes were treated with IMRT and SCRT, respectively, in comparison to Tomo plan. For left hippocampus all three techniques were comparable. Conclusion: Tomotherapy and Linear accelerator (LINAC) -based IMRT achieved significantly better PTV coverage than forward planned SCRT. Tomo as compared to SCRT and IMRT plans showed trend towards significant sparing of the contralateral hippocampus, in eccentrically located tumors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background {{and purpose}} Stereotactic lung {{radiotherapy}} (SLRT) {{has emerged as}} a curative treatment for medically inoperable patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc treatments (VMAT) have been proposed as the best practical approaches for the delivery of SLRT. However, a large number of narrow field shapes are needed in the dose delivery of intensity-modulated techniques and the probability of underdosing the tumour periphery increases as the effective field size is decreased. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate small lung tumour doses irradiated by intensity-modulated techniques to understand the risk for dose calculation errors in <b>precision</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> such as SLRT. Materials and methods The study was executed with two heterogeneous phantoms with targets of Ø 1. 5 and Ø 4. 0 [*]cm. Dose distributions in the simulated tumours delivered by small sliding window apertures (SWAs), IMRT and RapidArc treatment plans were measured with radiochromic film. Calculation algorithms of pencil beam convolution (PBC) and anisotropic analytic algorithm (AAA) were used to calculate the corresponding dose distributions. Results Peripheral doses of the tumours were decreased as SWA decreased, which was not modelled by the calculation algorithms. The smallest SWA studied was 2 [*]mm, which reduced the 90 % isodose line width by 4. 2 [*]mm with the Ø 4. 0 [*]cm tumour as compared to open field irradiation. PBC was not able to predict the dose accurately as the gamma evaluation failed to meet the criteria of ± 3 %/± 1 [*]mm on average in 61 % of the defined volume with the smaller tumour. With AAA the corresponding value was 16 %. The dosimetric inaccuracy of AAA was within ± 3 % with the optimized treatment plans of IMRT and RapidArc. The exception was the clinical RapidArc plan with dose overestimation of 4 %. Conclusions Overall, the peripheral doses of the simulated lung tumours were decreased by decreasing the SWA. To achieve adequate surface dose coverage to small lung tumours with a difference less than 1 [*]mm in the isodose line radius between the open and modulated field, a larger than 6 [*]mm SWA should be used in the dose delivery of SLRT. </p...|$|E
