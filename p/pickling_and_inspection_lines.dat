40|$|The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) {{consists}} of visiting {{a subset of}} edges of the graph that describes the problem. CARP applications include urban waste collection <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> of power <b>lines.</b> The CARP is NP-hard, even in the single-vehicle case (called Rural Postman Problem). In this case, the use of metaheuristics is an efficient solution strategy. This paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm for the CARP, which is tested on available instances of the literature. The results obtained until now show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithm when it is compared with lower bounds described in the literature...|$|R
50|$|In the pull/tow system, the {{submarine}} pipeline is assembled onshore and then towed to location. Assembly is done either parallel or {{perpendicular to the}} shoreline - in the former case, the full line can be built prior to tow out and installation. A significant advantage with the pull/tow system is that pre-testing <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> of the <b>line</b> are done onshore, not at sea. It allows to handle lines of any size and complexity. As for the towing procedures, a number of configurations can be used, which may be categorized as follows: surface tow, near-surface tow, mid-depth tow and off-bottom tow.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} processes for producing ultra-smooth nanoscale programmed substrate defects that have applications {{in areas such}} as thin film growth, EUV lithography, <b>and</b> defect <b>inspection.</b> Particle, <b>line,</b> pit, <b>and</b> scratch defects on the substrates between 40 and 140 nm wide 50 to 90 nm high have been successfully produced using e-beam lithograpy and plasma etching in both Silicon and Hydrosilsequioxane films. These programmed defect substrates have several advantages over those produced previously using gold nanoparticles or polystyrene latex spheres [...] most notably, the ability to precisely locate features and produce recessed as well as bump type features in ultra-smooth films. These programmed defects were used to develop techniques for film defect mitigation and results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceThis {{research}} {{presented a}} novel method for transmission <b>and</b> distribution <b>lines</b> <b>inspection.</b> Power <b>lines</b> <b>inspection</b> can guarantee {{the performance of}} power system stability and increase the lifetime of power lines. An advanced power <b>lines</b> <b>inspection</b> can prevent massive power outages due to line failures, which {{is still one of}} the major challenges in modern power system. Traditiional method is using human squads to perform inspections. Due to the remoted locations of power lines, and various geographical conditions, it is not hte most efficient solution by dispatching human squads. Another popular method is using helicopters to inspect power lines, which is costly and there are limitations due to weather conditions. In this research, a combination of Scale Ivariant Feature Transform algorithm and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) power <b>lines</b> real-time <b>inspection</b> system is presented. SIFT algorithm is widely used in object recognition, and it can help USAVs to reduce the vibration problems due to wind or other weather issues, while videoing power lines. The advantage of SIFT method of being invariant to image translation, scaling and rotation has been fully implemented in the proposed work. The video is processing to ground station <b>and</b> the final <b>inspection</b> analysis is performed frame by frame to locate or to recognize potentioal unhealty power lines...|$|R
5000|$|Much of Gibson's work on {{perception}} {{derives from}} his {{time spent in}} the U.S Army Air Force. Here, he delved into thoughts on how imperative perception is on daily functions. His work may be the first to show a distinct difference between types of perception. Form perception, on one hand, is a display of two static displays, whereas object perception, involves one of the displays to be in motion. Gibson laid down the base for empirical perception research throughout his lifetime. He did work on adaptation <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> of curved <b>lines,</b> which became a precursor for perceptual research later. His basic work rejected the perspective that perception in and of itself is meaningless, he instead argued meaning is independent of the perceiver. He claimed that the environment decides perception, and that meaning is in what the environment [...] "affords" [...] the observer.|$|R

40|$|Progress in the {{application}} of ultrasonic techniques to nondestructive measurement of mechanical strength of engineering materials is reviewed. A dormant concept in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is invoked. The availability of ultrasonic methods that can be applied to actual parts to assess their potential susceptibility to failure under design conditions is discussed. It was shown that ultrasonic methods yield measurements of elastic moduli, microstructure, hardness, fracture toughness, tensile strength, yield strength, and shear strength {{for a wide range of}} materials (including many types of metals, ceramics, and fiber composites). It was also indicated that although most of these methods were shown feasible in laboratory studies, more work is needed before they can be used on actual parts in processing, assembly, <b>inspection,</b> <b>and</b> maintenance <b>lines...</b>|$|R
