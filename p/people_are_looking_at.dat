The world is tearing by you, real fast, and all these <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you.... People see me in my 'girl-singer' suit."

25|$|Locke's {{ideology}} and leadership even had impact in Europe. In France, <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{him like a}} figure that brought the black population together in the racist era that America was facing at the time. They compared that movement to how the Jewish population in Europe was staying tight together, especially after World War II.|$|R
50|$|Cell phones {{were used}} to call friends, take {{pictures}} and make videos of the phenomenon {{and send them to}} friends. Critics have suggested that the overexposed and blurry quality of the pictures and footage being sent around on cell phones, facilitated the illusory perception of a figure, when in fact all <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>were</b> low-quality images of the illuminated church tower behind the domes.|$|R
60|$|To {{make our}} {{difficulties}} plain, let us concentrate {{attention on the}} table. To the eye it is oblong, brown and shiny, to the touch it is smooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden sound. Any one else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this description, so that it might seem as if no difficulty would arise; {{but as soon as}} we try to be more precise our troubles begin. Although I believe that the table is 'really' of the same colour all over, the parts that reflect the light look much brighter than the other parts, and some parts look white because of reflected light. I know that, if I move, the parts that reflect the light will be different, so that the apparent distribution of colours on the table will change. It follows that if several <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the table at the same moment, no two of them will see exactly the same distribution of colours, because no two can see it from exactly the same point of view, and any change in the point of view makes some change in the way the light is reflected.|$|E
60|$|We left Jacob's Well and {{traveled}} till {{eight in the}} evening, but rather slowly, for we {{had been in the}} saddle nineteen hours, and the horses were cruelly tired. We got so far ahead of the tents that we had to camp in an Arab village, and sleep on the ground. We could have slept in the largest of the houses; but there were some little drawbacks: it was populous with vermin, it had a dirt floor, it was in no respect cleanly, and there was a family of goats in the only bedroom, and two donkeys in the parlor. Outside there were no inconveniences, except that the dusky, ragged, earnest-eyed villagers of both sexes and all ages grouped themselves on their haunches all around us, and discussed us and criticised us with noisy tongues till midnight. We did not mind the noise, being tired, but, doubtless, the reader is aware that it is almost an impossible thing to go to sleep when you know that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> you. We went to bed at ten, and got up again at two and started once more. Thus are people persecuted by dragomen, whose sole ambition in life is to get ahead of each other.|$|E

Whether it were disappointment at his own failure or some other cause, Lothair felt annoyed.

30|$|First of all, you shouldn’t over-emphasize the differences. At {{least in}} the early work, we really {{accepted}} the basic framework of classical economics. It was concerned with decision making and consequential decision making. <b>People</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the world, trying to make decisions to put them at a better place in the world. The differences were fairly important, but the similarities were also there. Over time, the differences have grown, I think.|$|R

40|$|People {{with social}} anxiety {{disorder}} are afraid of being scrutinized by others and often {{feel that they are}} the excessive focus of other people's attention. This study investigated whether, when compared to low socially anxious individuals, high socially anxious individuals overestimate the proportion of people in a crowd who are observing them. It was hypothesized that any potential overestimation would be modulated by self-focused attention. Forty-eight high and 48 low socially anxious participants performed a "faces in a crowd" computer task during which they briefly saw matrices of faces, which varied in terms of the proportion of <b>people</b> who <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them. Participants estimated the proportion of <b>people</b> who <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them. The task was performed once with mirrors present (to induce an enhanced self-focused state) and once without mirrors present (neutral state). Participants' subjective estimates and the objective proportion of faces <b>looking</b> towards them <b>were</b> strongly correlated in both the high and low socially anxious groups. However, high socially anxious participants estimated that more <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them than low socially anxious participants. In {{the first phase of the}} experiment, but not in the later phases, this effect was magnified in the mirror condition. This study provides preliminary evidence of a social anxiety related perceptual difference that may be amplified by self-focused attention. Clinical implications are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{designs that}} work well do {{not rely on}} being secret. It is not mandatory, but proper {{security}} usually means that everyone is allowed to know and understand the design because it is secure. This has the advantage that many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the code, and this improves the odds that any flaws will be found sooner (Linus' law). Of course, attackers can also obtain the code, which {{makes it easier for}} them to find vulnerabilities as well.|$|E

The story of the song talks about Sandé's first experiences in the music industry, mainly reflecting her search to get signed by a music company and the encounters with several music business people in the industry. Commenting on the song, Sandé said: “It’s about how I felt when I {{was trying to get}} signed, I was going for all these meetings and <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me like ‘What do we do with you’? It’s about not allowing yourself to be judged by others or to be taken for an idiot. I feel the video reflects that.” ...|$|R

I remembered that Giulia had not seemed so pleased to see me; at the time I chid myself, and called myself exacting, but was it true? I fancied she turned away her lips when I was imprinting my passionate kisses on them. I told myself I was a fool, but was it true?

5000|$|The {{algorithms}} do {{not simply}} trade on simple news stories but also interpret {{more difficult to}} understand news.

5000|$|In many of Burroughs' pieces, she depicts {{people with}} half black and half white faces. In The Faces of My People Burroughs carved five people {{staring at the}} viewer. One of the women is all black, three {{of the people are}} half black and half white and one is mostly white. While Burroughs is {{attempting}} to blend together the black and white communities, she also shows the barriers that stop the communities from uniting. None of the people in The Faces of My <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> each other, and this implies a sense of disconnect among them. On another level, The Faces of My People deals with diversity. An article from the Collector magazine website describes Burroughs' attempts to unify in the picture. The article says, [...] "Burroughs sees her art as a catalyst for bringing people together. This tableau of diverse individuals illustrates her commitment to mutual respect and understanding".|$|E
