40|$|By nature, {{government}} and private projects have different characteristics, which influence client performance. This research aims to compare performance of {{government and}} private clients in construction projects as perceived by contractors. Six client performance indicators were used, i. e. understanding of project requirements, financial, decision making, management skills, supports for contractor, and client’s attitude. Data were collected through questionnaire surveys filled in by 117 respondents. The results {{show that there is}} a significant difference between both types of client performance. Three variables related to financial indicators, i. e. timely payment, owner value estimate, and <b>payment</b> <b>approval,</b> rank in the bottom three of the government client performance, but in contrast rank in the top three of the private ones. These results suggest that the government clients’ performance is perceived inferior to the private ones. Establishing a clients’ forum for sharing knowledge and best practices would be a strategic solution to enhance clients’ capacities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The rapid {{transition}} to card payments has sparked {{a search for}} effective countermeasures to those who exploit card payment security vulnerabilities to commit payment fraud. A review of these vulnerabilities finds that they are tied together by an information-intensive <b>payment</b> <b>approval</b> system. Especially damaging are large data breaches, which are often the result of criminals gathering information useful to committing payment fraud. Criminals particularly target nonbank payment processors, retailers, and government entities. Although traditional forms of payment fraud remain important, a complex and developing chain from data breach to payment fraud is developing. Preliminary estimates of card payment fraud losses in the United States show that the fraud loss rate for the U. S. appears {{to be higher than}} that of Australia, France, Spain and the UK. Several industry initiatives may help to protect payment card information, but because lack of good data on the extent and characteristics of payments fraud makes it difficult to develop effective industry strategies and policy responses. Policymakers should monitor the card payment industry to see if it better coordinates security efforts, and if not, consider actions to help the industry overcome barriers to effective development of security...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry plays {{a very important}} role in nation development and in construction project delivery and timely provision of shelter and dwelling units for the masses. The aim of the study therefore is to study cost and time performance on building project in developing economy, with a view to finding ways of improving cost and time performance on building projects. Some of the developing in used in this context includes: Nigeria, Togo, Cameroun, and Ghana. A population size of 70 was selected, and a total sample size of 59 respondents was used in this study, with questionnaire distributed to construction professionals. Variables pertaining to the above listed targets were identified and incorporated into questionnaires as the primary source of data. The data was collated and analysed, using mean item score ranking, percentages and the use of descriptive statistics. It was discovered that variables like rising prices of building materials, inclusion of additional work as a result of clients’ request, deterioration in economic situation, were identified as the top causes of variation in construction project from developing countries. Also, cost, poor planning and scheduling, delay in <b>payment</b> <b>approval</b> for additional work, work suspension by client, were identified as top causes of time and cost variations. The study recommend among other things that: full consideration should be given to projects from inception to completion, adequate and effective consultancy services for clients, as well as strict follow up of programme of works by every contractor for a construction project.

40|$|Central to the {{sustainable}} and competitive {{growth of the}} South African construction industry is a predictable cash flow through on time payment by clients to contractors. However, chronic late payments, a recurring problem in the industry, especially in the public sector, is bringing untold hardship to contractors by derailing their competitiveness and also eroding the trust among the supply chain partners {{to the extent that}} some firms end up closing business in the industry. The situation is viewed from the lean construction perspective as an obstacle that is preventing the accrual of the required value to project parties in the construction industry. This research addresses the causes of late payments to contractors {{and the role of the}} quantity surveyor (QS) in terms of influencing early payment from a lean construction perspective. A mixed method approach was used for compiling the primary data for the study. Sequentially, one hundred and two (102) quantitative and twelve (12) interview questionnaires were administered to selected contractors and construction professionals working predominantly on public sector projects. The findings revealed that the approval process for evaluation and certification by the client- appointed agent and intermediary institutions is taking longer than contractually allowed, with parties independently undertaking their evaluation prior to the certification date. This is found to be adverse to achieving consensus on the values of the works for authorisation. Other significant barriers are the lack of funds to authorise payment, random auditor general’s documentation changes, lack of administrators’ system integration and capacity to handle cyclical payment processing. Also, contractors have been found to be in default of timeously submitting complete claim documents. It is therefore recommended that the client agents should partner with the contractor in regular design and documentation reviews, arranging the payment process and should also meet jointly to prepare monthly evaluations. In addition, contractors should be mentored from the onset of the project regarding all the necessary documentation and supporting documents that will be required by the client to ensure that <b>payment</b> <b>approvals</b> are not delayed. The payment authori-sation agent’s capacity should be enhanced through training and improved powers as a singular point of control to perform efficiently and their systems and processes should be integrated to ensure that all parties are implementing the same protocols...|$|R

Separate reviews at NTSB by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (PwC) and GAO found significant shortcomings {{in the design and}} operation of NTSB's internal controls during 1999 and 2000. These deficiencies indicated insufficient or ineffective management attention to establishing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial management operations. The resulting weaknesses exposed the agency to waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Some basic controls were not always clearly and consistently incorporated into NTSB policies and procedures, and, in some cases, the written policies were ambiguous and contributed to possible improper transactions. Furthermore, NTSB's <b>payment</b> review and <b>approval</b> process [...] the last and best opportunity to detect and address inadequate documentation and other policy violations prior to payment [...] was often ineffective. Separate reviews of different aspects of NTSB's 1999 and 2000 financial activities and related internal controls, done by PwC at NTSB's request, documented various internal control weaknesses, including problems with the completeness and clarity of policies, the recording and review of transactions, and the tracking and reporting its use of funds. ...|$|R

These project information are categorized in to technical and administrative information and managed through appropriate processes. There are many tools such as Document Management Systems, Building Information Modeling (BIM) available to manage and integrate the technical information. However, the administrative information and its related processes such as the <b>payment,</b> status, authorization, <b>approval</b> etc. are not effectively managed. The current study aims to explore the administrative information management process of a local housing delivery public agency.

The captured processes and information interfaces are analyzed and appropriate process integration is suggested to avoid the delay in their project delivery processes. Further, the resultant model can be used for effectively managing the housing delivery projects...|$|R
