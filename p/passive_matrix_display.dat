50|$|There was a slot for an expensive, optional, {{built-in}} 14.4 Express Modem and {{no provision}} for built-in Ethernet. This somewhat limited configuration meant {{the only way to}} move data in or out of the laptop in a stock configuration, without purchasing additional accessories, was via a relatively slow AppleTalk connection, which was not practical in the event of hard drive problems. Compensating for these limitations, the initial Duo offering provided for a considerably larger RAM limit of 24 MB (to the 100 series' 14 MB), and a standard 80 MB hard drive (to the 100's 40 MB). The debut year for the Duo only offered a <b>passive</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>display</b> on both the mid-level and high-end models.

The <b>passive</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>displays</b> based on Super Twisted Nematic (STN) Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) are popular due to their low cost. However, the response times of these displays are in the range of 200 ms. The improvement of response times of STN LCDs to about 50 ms results in poor contrast ratio, when conventional addressing technique is used. This is due to the frame response phenomenon in fast responding LCDs. Novel addressing techniques to suppress the frame response phenomenon are presented. These techniques lead to a high contrast ratio, good brightness uniformity and lower supply voltage as compared to the conventional technique. The basic principle of these addressing techniques and methods for displaying gray shades are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the {{international}} conference on liquid crystals and other soft materials held in 2002 at the Raman Research Institute, 2003. Quality of image in a display depends on the contrast, colour, resolution {{and the number of}} gray shades. A large number of gray shades is necessary to display images without any contour lines. These contours are due to limited number of gray shades in the display causing abrupt changes in grayness of the image, while the original image has a gradual change in brightness. Amplitude modulation has the capability to display a large number of gray shades with minimum number of time intervals [1, 2]. This paper will cover the underlying principle of amplitude modulation, some variants and its extension to multi-line addressing.

40|$|Fast {{response}} {{liquid crystal}} display can improve motion picture quality and power efficiency. One {{of the most important}} applications is field-sequential-color display. The maximum relaxation time of such liquid crystal device must be less than a few milliseconds (i. e. < 3 ms). In this thesis, three different approaches, which are liquid crystal configuration, alignment layer and driving method, are explored in order to enhance the optical response of the liquid crystal device. A liquid crystal configuration called Stressed Splay Twist (SST) mode is investigated. It exhibits strong and fast optical bounce due to back-flow effect. It is also found that such fast optical transient effect, i. e. < 1. 5 ms, can be controlled by the two voltages driving method effectively. A SST mode field-sequential-color display with QVGA resolution is fabricated. In order to further improve the electro-optical properties of the SST mode, a stacked alignment layer is proposed as well. It is composed of 2 alignment layers which have different preferred alignment directions. Such alignment configuration is capable of generating multiple pretilt angles or azimuth angles on the same substrate. By using such alignment layers, the relaxation path of the SST mode is modified so that two voltages driving method can be avoided. Finally, a modified <b>passive</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>display</b> driving scheme is proposed. The typical response time of the passive matrix liquid crystal device is about 50 ms to 200 ms. The Alt-Pleshko driving method is modified. The response time of the passive matrix displays is promoted to less than < 5 ms. Such effect is demonstrated by fabricating a passive matrix driven field-sequential-color device...|$|E

40|$|Field {{emission}} displays (FEDs) show {{great promise}} as high performance flat panel displays. The light emission process is efficient, long lifetimes are possible with high brightness, and bright <b>passive</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>displays</b> can be built. Because <b>passive</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>displays</b> don't need a transistor backplane, {{it was once}} thought that these displays would be cheaper to fabricate than their competitors. It {{is now clear that}} this is not the case. Fabricating a transistor backplane has turned out to be less expensive than micromachining an array of uniform field emitter tips with aligned gates. Competing technologies which use an active backplane (such as active matrix liquid crystal panels) have become ubiquitous, and FED technologies developed to date have been too expensive for the consumer market. This thesis presents a new strategy for creating a low-cost field emission display. This strategy begins by creating a field emitter out of organic conductors-a class of materials mostly neglected to date for this application. The organic emitter is made by copying a non-lithographic template. The process takes 5 minutes, occurs at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure, and does not damage the template. We show that organic conductors are easy to pattern into regular patterns and can form structures which exhibit field emission, with field enhancement factors of about 100 - 600 times. The field emission follows a Fowler-Nordheim characteristic. Also explored are some of the properties of organic conductors in vacuum such as conductivity over time, the interaction of the organic field emitter with background gases, and the conduction mechanism. In particular, we show that oxygen degrades the emission properties of organic field emission tips, and that organic materials retain sufficient conductivity in vacuum to serve as field emitters. (cont.) The second prong of the strategy is to combine the field emitter with an inexpensive transistor. A thin-film transistor made using an organic semiconductor is used to control the emission from the field emitter. We demonstrate a circuit architecture which allows the transistor to control the field emitter without creating a micromachined gate. This architecture uses only one high voltage supply for the panel to extract and accelerate electrons toward the phosphor screen. We show that the field emitter current can be controlled over a range of about 1000 : 1 using only 30 V. This is verified through measurements of spot brightness on a phosphor screen. We then show that using the transistor has additional advantages. The current noise is reduced by a factor of 20, and DC current degradation is eliminated for oxygen partial pressures up to 1 x 10 - 6 torr. A new linearized analysis is presented which explains the DC current control and noise reduction, and also estimates the work function fluctuation on the emitter tip. The experimental results are examined in the context of this analytical framework. The work in this thesis shows (1) that a field emitter can be made from an organic conductor using a simple process (2) a field emission display can be controlled without making an array of micromachined gates and (3) using a transistor has a number of advantages in addition to controlling the field emitter [...] . by Ioannis Kymissis.
