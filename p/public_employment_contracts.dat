40|$|With {{reform of}} the legal {{framework}} related to fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> fast approaching, I examine in concrete terms problems of creating such laws {{from the perspective of}} avoiding excessive regulation of fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> My analysis is based on a report created by the Fixed-term <b>Employment</b> <b>Contract</b> Study Group organized by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and I consider the fact that demand for workers with a fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> is mainly medium- and long-term, not temporary and special. The general principle of permanent <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> is asserted when strictly regulating the use of fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts.</b> However this is not a general principle embodied in the actual <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> but is a policy preference from the perspective of stable employment. The general principle of permanent <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> would dramatically restrict the use of employees with a fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contract</b> in current <b>employment</b> practices in Japan and force these changes. However, legal restrictions on fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> cannot be considered an appropriate legal policy since they do not take into consideration how companies will meet their medium- and long-term demand for labor. Assuming that employees with fixed-term employment contracts—for which there is a medium- and long-term demand—continue to be permitted, the current legal issue becomes providing an appropriate scope of protection. In particular, the law should clearly state the possibility of renewing fixed-term <b>employment</b> <b>contracts</b> when concluding or renewing the contract and demand that the reason for terminating employment in the case the contract is not renewed be objectively justifiable and socially appropriate. ...|$|R
