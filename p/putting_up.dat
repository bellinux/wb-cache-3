5|$|Despite {{penetrations}} inland, the key beach objectives had {{not been}} achieved. The draws necessary for the movement of vehicles off the beach {{had not been}} opened, and the strongpoints defending these were still <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> a spirited resistance. The failure to clear beach obstacles forced subsequent landings to concentrate on Easy Green and Easy Red.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Alamo (February 23 – March 6, 1836) was {{a crucial}} {{conflict}} of the Texas Revolution. In 1835, colonists from the United States joined with Tejanos (Mexicans born in Texas) in <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> armed resistance to the centralization of the Mexican government. President Antonio López de Santa Anna and the government in Mexico City believed the United States had instigated the insurrection with a goal of annexing Texas.|$|E
5|$|Eddie {{returns to}} {{challenge}} Fats again, <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> his entire $3,000 stake {{on a single}} game. He wins game after game, beating Fats so badly that Fats is forced to quit. Bert demands a share of Eddie's winnings and threatens that Eddie will be injured unless he pays. But Eddie says that {{if he is not}} killed he will kill Bert when he recovers; invoking the memory of Sarah, he shames Bert into giving up his claim. Instead, Bert orders Eddie never to walk into a big-time pool hall again. Eddie and Fats compliment each other as players, and Eddie walks out.|$|E

The first book has Narayan focusing on the plight of students, punishments of caning in the classroom, and the associated shame. The concept of horoscope-matching in Hindu marriages and the emotional toll it levies on {{the bride and groom}} is covered in the second book.

5|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was known}} as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he {{selected}} the statues and panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of. He preferred a non-frontal angle, which shows a better depth of the relief and the skills of the relief maker. To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the negative film instead of <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> a black curtain during photographing.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain of}} the castle, Major Hannibal Bonithon, was invited by Colonel John Arundell to retreat to the {{stronger}} fortress of Pendennis, but Bonithon and his men surrendered immediately without <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> resistance. This decision has been put down to a result of war-weariness, {{the large numbers of}} Parliamentary troops facing them and the generous surrender terms on offer, although the 19th-century historian Samuel Oliver also suspected that Bonithon might have had Parliamentarian sympathies. 160 small arms and 13 artillery pieces were captured: the castle's guns were removed and redeployed in the siege of Pendennis, which fell that August.|$|E
5|$|With Adrian Peterson still {{recovering}} from breaking his collar bone against Iowa State and Allen Patrick on the sidelines in an ankle brace after suffering a late-game sprain the week before, {{many aspects of the}} offense were in doubt coming into this game. Paul Thompson responded by <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> a career-high 309yards passing, completing 24 of 31attempts. True-freshman running back Chris Brown also stepped up to the challenge and ran for 84yards and two touchdowns, both in the fourth quarter; {{this was the first time}} in 16games that a Sooner back did not run for over 100yards.|$|E

5|$|After {{a company}} night {{out to the}} Springfield drag races, Smithers fails to protect Mr. Burns from being harassed by a drunken Lenny. Though he tries to make amends the next day, Smithers again bungles his duties and {{attempts}} to drown himself in the water cooler out of guilt, so Burns suggests he take a vacation. Seeking a replacement who will not outshine him, Smithers purposely selects Homer for the job. Burns soon proves to be ridiculously demanding {{for someone who has}} not devoted his life to him like Smithers. After <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> with Mr. Burns' constant abuse for several days, Homer finally snaps and punches Burns. Fearing he has killed the old man, Homer runs away in panic, and hides at home.|$|E
5|$|After much speculation, Manning {{announced}} in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL. In the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning's play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and one interception, but a pick-6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed the Broncos to win 19–13. The Broncos {{got off to a}} dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, the streak ended in a loss at Indianapolis, losing 24–27. During that winning streak, and the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played better, <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> over 250 yards in six of the seven games, and he scored nine touchdowns. However, he never had a game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13, and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories.|$|E

The acreage attached to the house Stowe purchased could produce an income of $2,000 a month ($ in 2009). Stowe wrote to author George Eliot to update her {{on the progress of}} improvements to the house in Mandarin, <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> wallpaper, improving plaster, and building a veranda that wrapped around the structure.

5|$|Huang Na {{went missing}} on 10 October 2004; she {{was last seen}} at a food court near the {{wholesale}} centre, barefoot and wearing a blue denim jacket and bermuda shorts. From 7 a.m. to past midnight every day for three weeks, Shuying looked across the island for her daughter. The police, including a Criminal Investigation Department team, conducted an intensive search for the girl, and police officers carried photographs of her while on their daily rounds. Volunteers formed search parties and Crime Library, a voluntary group dedicated to finding missing persons, distributed over 70,000 leaflets appealing for information. Two Singaporeans offered rewards of S$10,000 and S$5,000 for finding Huang Na, while the manager of an online design company set up a website to raise awareness and gather tip-offs. The search even extended to Malaysia, with volunteers <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> posters in the nearby cities of Johor Bahru and Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{attacked}} the castle in 1139, initially intending to besiege it, as {{the walls were}} considered impregnable to assault. Brien had brought in considerable supplies – contemporaries believed the castle could survive a siege for several years if need be – and Stephen changed his mind, <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> two counter-castles to contain Wallingford {{along the road to}} Bristol, before continuing west. The next year, Miles of Gloucester, possibly acting under orders from Robert of Gloucester, struck east, destroying one of the counter-castles outside Wallingford. The civil war between Stephen and Matilda rapidly descended into an attritional campaign, in which castles like Wallingford {{played a critical role in}} efforts by both sides to secure the Thames Valley. After the fall of Oxford to Stephen in 1141, Matilda fled to Wallingford, and the importance of the castle continued to grow.|$|E
5|$|Storm played {{football}} regularly {{and was a}} good skater and swimmer (once swimming the 12.5-mile length of Windermere). Liverpool F.C. used to train at Melwood {{and he went to}} watch them in training, later <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> a large photo of himself training with the team on his wall at home. He was the captain of Mersey Beat magazine's football team, called the Mersey Beat XI. Storm was born with a stutter (a speech impediment), which did not affect his singing. Because of Storm's bad stammer, his friends never allowed him to tell a joke or to order a round of drinks, as it took too long. He became a cotton salesman (as was Jim McCartney, Paul McCartney's father) before forming a skiffle group.|$|E

5|$|Tai Loong {{believed}} {{that the government had}} exceeded its statutory authority by confiscating the fins. It argued that before Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz, a federal district judge for the Southern District of California, who granted an injunction against NOAA prohibiting it from selling the fins itself. The company and the agency then agreed that, in return for the former <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> a $775,000 bond, that it would take possession of the shark fins, although they remained in cold storage pending the outcome of the case. Tai Loong presold the fins for an amount almost equal to the fine against it. NOAA then initiated a civil forfeiture action with the bond substituting for the fins.|$|E
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E
5|$|The usurpation, {{which began}} in late March or early April 272, ended by August. Aurelian spent the winter of 271–272 in Byzantium, and {{probably}} crossed the Bosporus to Asia Minor in April 272. Galatia fell easily; the Palmyrene garrisons were apparently withdrawn, and the provincial capital of Ancyra was regained without a struggle. All the cities in Asia Minor opened their doors to the Roman emperor, with only Tyana <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> some resistance before surrendering; this cleared the path for Aurelian to invade Syria, the Palmyrene heartland. A simultaneous expedition reached Egypt in May 272; by early June Alexandria was captured by the Romans, followed {{by the rest of}} Egypt by the third week of June. Zenobia seems to have withdrawn most of her armies from Egypt to focus on Syria—which, if lost, would have meant the end of Palmyra.|$|E
