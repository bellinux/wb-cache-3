50|$|Fully {{developed}} nictitating membranes {{are found}} in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, but are rare in primates. In humans, the <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> (also known as the semilunar fold) and its associated muscles are homologous to the nictitating membranes seen in some other mammals and other vertebrates. In most primate species, a <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> is present, although fully developed nictitating membranes {{can be found in}} lemurs and lorisoid primates. Some mammals, such as camels, polar bears, seals and aardvarks, have full nictitating membranes, and many mammals retain a small, vestigial portion of the membrane remains {{in the corner of the}} eye. A gland of the third eyelid (nictitans gland) or Harder's gland are attached to the nictating membranes of some animals and may produce up to 50% of the tear film.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> is {{the thin}} {{upper part of}} the fold of mucous {{membrane}} in the supratonsillar fossa that reaches across between the two arches. A separate fold is called the plica triangularis which runs inferoposteriorly from the posterior surface of the palatoglossal arch to cover the inferior portion of the tonsil.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> {{is a small}} fold {{of tissue}} on the inside corner of the eye.

50|$|Other {{structures}} that are vestigial include the <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> {{on the inside}} {{corner of the eye}} (a remnant of the nictitating membrane); and, as pictured, muscles in the ear {{and other parts of the}} body. Other organic structures (such as the occipitofrontalis muscle) have lost their original functions (keep the head from falling) but are still useful for other purposes (facial expression).|$|E
5000|$|The nictitating {{membrane}} is a transparent or translucent third eyelid present in some animals {{that can be}} drawn across the eye for protection and to moisten it while maintaining vision. The term comes from the Latin word , meaning [...] "to blink". It is often called a third eyelid or haw, and may be referred to in scientific terminology as the <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris,</b> membrana nictitans, or palpebra tertia. Unlike {{the upper and lower}} eyelids, the {{nictitating membrane}} moves horizontally across the eyeball.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> {{is a small}} fold of bulbar {{conjunctiva}} on {{the medial}} canthus of the eye. It functions during movement of the eye, to help maintain tear drainage via the lacrimal lake, and to permit greater rotation of the globe, for without the plica the conjunctiva would attach directly to the eyeball, restricting movement. It is the vestigial remnant of the nictitating membrane (the [...] "third eyelid") which is drawn across the eye for protection, and is present in other animals such as birds, reptiles, and fish, but is rare in mammals, mainly found in monotremes and marsupials. Its associated muscles are also vestigial. [...] It is loose, thus eye movements are not restricted by it. Only one species of primate, the Calabar angwantibo, {{is known to have}} a functioning nictitating membrane.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the correlations between}} clinical findings and histopathologic changes in eyes with pterygium. Methods: This prospective study included 70 eyes with primary pterygia undergoing surgical excision. Prior to surgery, clinical features of the pterygia including extension over the cornea, redness, fleshiness (based on obscuration of the underlying episcleral vessels), and obliteration of the <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> were determined. Postoperatively, pterygium specimens were examined by hematoxylin-eosin and trichrome staining to evaluate histopathologic characteristics including vascular density, leukocytic infiltration, stromal elastosis, stromal fibrosis and subepithelial fibrosis. Correlations between clinical findings and histopathologic changes were then investigated. Results: There was a marginally significant correlation between the redness and the fleshiness of pterygium (P = 0. 06). Both redness and fleshiness of the pterygium had significant positive correlation with dimensions of the lesion over the cornea. Moreover, larger pterygia were associated with obliteration of the <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris.</b> Pterygium redness showed a significant correlation with vascular density (P = 0. 04), and pterygium fleshiness had a significant correlation with stromal fibrosis (P = 0. 04). Pterygium dimensions over the cornea demonstrated a positive correlation with vascular density and a negative correlation with stromal elastosis. Conclusion: Redness and fleshiness of pterygium were only marginally correlated with each other, and each one showed a correlation with different histopathologic features. Larger pterygia were associated with more significant changes at the clinical and histopathologic levels...|$|E
40|$|Benign oncocytomas of the {{accessory}} lacrimal glands {{can be found}} in the lacrimal caruncle, <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> or conjunctival fornices, but are extremely rare. A series of 15 supposed oncocytomas of the ocular adnexa was reviewed retrospectively, and histological differences were noted with respect to the parotid gland counterpart, Lesions could be divided into three histological groups: (1) tumours composed of tubules lined by tall columnar epithelium with finely granular cytoplasm; the tubules often had dilated lumens containing mucinous secretion: (2) cystic tumours with prominent epithelial tufts projecting from much of the cyst wall: (3) tumours with solid areas composed of variably cuboidal or polygonal cells, largely in trabecular arrangement, and co-existing with the previously described tubular and cystic elements, A striking resemblance to Warthin's tumour without a lymphocytic component, such as may affect the parotid salivary gland, was noted in several tumours...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The ideal {{approach}} to orbital medial wall fractures remains controversial. Only the coronal approach exposes the medial wall completely. The transcaruncular approach enables {{a clear and}} wide view of the medial wall without any visible scar compared to usual transcutaneous techniques. This approach can be combined with a transconjunctival approach, thus providing an extended exposure of the whole medial wall and the orbital floor. TECHNICAL NOTE: The conjunctival incision is performed with a needle electrocautery in the groove between the <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> and the caruncle. It is extended laterally within the inferior conjunctival fornix for 20 mm to the lateral palpebral commissure. The sub-conjunctival dissection to the posterior lacrimal crest is performed with Stevens scissors through an avascular plane along the medial wall behind Horner's muscle. The periosteum is incised behind the posterior lacrimal crest. The sub-periosteal periorbital dissection is continued medially thus exposing the insertion of the inferior oblique muscle which is coagulated and cut over the inferior orbital rim. Reconstruction is performed after exposing the complete fracture after freeing the periorbital tissue. The periorbita is sutured with interrupted 5 - 0 Vicryl stitches. The inferior conjunctiva and the caruncle are closed with a continuous 6 - 0 Maxon suture...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} {{impression}} cytology features of conjunctival nevi reported as more noticeable. METHODS: 35 patients {{who reported that}} a conjunctival lesion had become more noticeable after color or size change were enrolled. On slit-lamp examination, a clinical diagnosis of nevus was made and lesions underwent impression cytology using acetate cellulose strips and a combined staining with PAS, H&E and Papanicolaou. At patient's or parents' request, excision of the lesion was performed and the tissue was submitted to histopathological study. RESULTS: Impression cytology examination revealed nests or cluster of nevus cells within the epithelium layer containing or not mucous-secreting goblet cells in 32 cases (91. 4 %). Ten patients (28. 5 %) had the tumor removed and histopathological diagnosis was compound nevus in 8 eyes (1 from caruncle, 1 from <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> and 6 from bulbar conjunctiva) and subepithelial nevus from bulbar conjunctiva (2 eyes). CONCLUSION: Optical microscopy analysis of the impression cytology specimens confirmed the clinical diagnosis by demonstrating typical histopathological features of the superficial layers from conjunctival nevi in 91. 4 % of the cases. For amelanotic nevi IC can also allow a differential diagnosis from other nonpigmented lesions. The technique does not replace histopathological examination, but additionally, may assist in evaluating nevus cells in children and adults...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To study whether <b>plica</b> <b>semilunaris</b> (PS) {{temporal}} ectopia {{is associated}} with primary nasal pterygia and whether such hypothetical ectopia is linked to with-the-rule astigmatism so that {{a discussion of the}} clinical and surgical implications of such possible findings might take place. METHODS: Cross-section observational study of 208 consecutive eyes of 152 cases and 169 eyes of 109 control subjects enrolled for 6 months. Four PS position grades were designed. Grade 1 features a grossly vertical PS position. Grades 2 and 3 involve temporal displacement and an abnormal PS tilt. Grade 4 involves PS obliteration with possible associated temporal caruncle dragging. Pterygium corneal encroachment, pterygium fleshiness, and manifest refraction were recorded. RESULTS: PS position was significantly displaced temporally in pterygium-affected eyes (P = 2 x 10 (- 4)). Corneal encroachment (P = 2. 1 x 10 (- 5)), pterygium fleshiness (P = 2. 7 x 10 (- 5)), and age (P = 1. 3 x 10 (- 2)) were positively correlated with PS position grades > 1. The presence of with-the-rule astigmatism was significantly linked to PS position grades > 1 (P = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Primary nasal pterygia result in PS temporal ectopia, and PS position grades (more than grade 1) are linked to the presence of with-the-rule astigmatism. These findings are consistent with the exertion of tractional forces at both pterygium ends. In eye abduction, medial canthus structures (PS, caruncule) may be dragged temporally. Thus, pterygium-related corneal traction may not always significantly increase in eye abduction. PS temporal ectopia may influence the decision to remove PS during pterygium surgical excision...|$|E
