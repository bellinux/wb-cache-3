40|$|In Australia, the {{assessment}} of acidity hazard in acid sulfate soils requires the estimation of operationally defined acidity fractions such as actual <b>acidity,</b> <b>potential</b> sulfidic <b>acidity,</b> and retained acidity. Acid–base accounting approaches in Australia use these acidity fractions to estimate the net acidity of acid sulfate soils materials. Retained acidity is the acidity stored in the secondary Fe/Al hydroxy sulfate minerals, such as jarosite, natrojarosite, schwertmannite, and basaluminite. Retained acidity is usually measured as either net acid-soluble sulfur (SNAS) or residual acid soluble sulfur (SRAS). In the present study, contributions of schwertmannite and jarosite to the retained acidity, actual <b>acidity,</b> and <b>potential</b> sulfidic <b>acidity</b> fractions were systematically evaluated using SNAS and SRAS techniques. The data show that schwertmannite contributed considerably to the actual acidity fraction {{and that it does}} not contribute solely to the retained acidity fraction as has been previously conceptualised. As a consequence, SNAS values greatly underestimated the schwertmannite content. For soil samples in which jarosite is the only mineral present, a better estimate of the added jarosite content can be obtained by using a correction factor of 2 to SNAS values to account for the observed 50 – 60 % recovery. Further work on a broader range of jarosite samples is needed to determine whether this correction factor has broad applicability. The SRAS was unable to reliably quantify either the schwertmannite or the jarosite content and, therefore, is not suitable for quantification of the retained <b>acidity</b> fraction. <b>Potential</b> sulfidic <b>acidity</b> in acid sulfate soils is conceptually derived from reduced inorganic sulfur minerals and has been estimated by the peroxide oxidation approach, which is used to derive the SRAS values. However, both schwertmannite and jarosite contributed to the peroxide-oxidisable sulfur fraction, implying a major potential interference by those two minerals to the determination of <b>potential</b> sulfidic <b>acidity</b> in acid sulfate soils through the peroxide oxidation approach...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify {{mechanisms}} of excited state interactions in hydrogen-bonded pairs, we {{have studied the}} kinetics of dynamic quenching of singlet and triplet fluorenone {{by a series of}} alcohols, phenols, and related compounds, in which hydrogen-bonding power, redox <b>potential,</b> and <b>acidity</b> are systematically varied. In addition, effects of solvent basicity or polarity and deuteration help identify the role of hydrogen-bonding in physical or chemical quenching processes. Alcohols and weak acids, with high oxidation potentials, do not quench the triplet, but quench the singlet at rates which parallel hydrogen-bonding power. This is attributed to a physical mechanism, involving vibronic coupling to the ground state via the hydrogen bond. This is much stronger in the excited state than in the ground state, and provides efficient energy dissipation in the radiationless transition. Phenols, with hydrogen-bonding power comparable to that of the alcohols but with much lower oxidation potentials, quench both singlet and triplet by electron or H-atom transfer, depending on <b>potentials,</b> <b>acidities,</b> and solvent polarity, as shown by formation of anion or neutral fluorenone radicals from the triplet.

Sikora method has been tested in some Brazilian soils of Rio Grande do Sul State (RS) and from Central Brazil (Cerrado), and did not present a good correlation.

Crystallographic studies show an unprecedented Mn_ 3 M(µ_ 4 -O) (µ_ 2 -O) core that remains intact on changing M or the manganese oxidation state. Electrochemical studies reveal that the reduction potentials span a window of 700 mV and are dependent on the Lewis acidity of the second metal. With the pK_a of the redox-inactive metal–aqua complex {{as a measure of}} Lewis acidity, these compounds demonstrate a linear dependence between reduction <b>potential</b> and <b>acidity</b> with a slope of ∼ 100 mV per pK_a unit. The Sr^(2 +) and Ca^(2 +) compounds show similar potentials, an observation that correlates with the behaviour of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, which is active only if one of these two metals is present...|$|R

The article {{presents the results of}} measurements of basic physicochemical parameters – pH and Eh in technogenic sediments and in surface and drainage water of a dump-field. Although the dump material shows a significant amount of mobility-able metals and thus also a <b>potential</b> to form <b>acidity,</b> a massive AMD formation in future is not probable. Abstrakt Acidita v okolí opusteného Cu-ložiska Ľubietová- Podlipa závisí predovšetkým od geochemického správania sa (zvetrávania) niektorých minerálov (hlavne pyritu).

40|$|The {{development}} of technologies to ameliorate acid mine drainage problems has had few successes. Most often, once acid mine drainage exists, the company responsible develops treatment programs {{to make sure that}} water resources and land are not contaminated by the acid mine drainage. These treatments usually result in significant costs and do not result in a cure to the problem. Much effort and money has been spent on the problems associated with acid mine drainage. However, it appears that most of the meaningful breakthroughs have come in the area of treatment {{of the results of the}} problem (i. e. water treatment). There have been few breakthroughs in the prevention of acid formation. Most of the work associated with the prevention of acid formation has dealt with the prevention of oxidation using grouting to seal mines, removing oxygen from the system or preventing water flow into the mines, using bactericides to eliminate the catalytic effect of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, and modifying the mining methods. The Maxi-Acid{trademark} technology takes a different approach to the problem. A site treated using Maxi-Acid won`t be expected to generate acid mine drainage for a number of years, if ever. The application of Maxi-Acid is expected to eliminate continuous treatment of acid waters discharged from applicable mine sites. The work accomplished to date includes characterization of overburden materials that contain large quantities of <b>potential</b> <b>acidity,</b> and preliminary evaluations of the acid-generating capabilities of materials containing high levels of <b>potential</b> <b>acidity</b> (pyritic materials) using humidity cells. This research effort is in the preliminary stages. To date, a number of interesting findings have been made that could be used to contribute to the elimination of acid mine drainage. However, the concepts that are expected to have the most significant impact on the formation of acid mine drainage have not yet been substantiated...|$|E
40|$|Quality and {{durability}} of fermented goat milk permeat The {{purpose of the}} tests was to evaluate the fermented permeat of goat milk cold stored for 3 weeks. The permeat's characteristics {{are based on the}} results determination of basic composition, Ca, Na, K and P content, measurement of selected physical and chemical properties and sensory profile. The permeat obtained as a result of goat milk ultrafiltration was cultured with thermophilous bacteria for milk fermentation. It has been noted that while storing the acidified permeat, its active and <b>potential</b> <b>acidity</b> increases significantly. The value of permeat’s color saturation (r= 0. 91) decreases proportionally to the storage period. It has been found {{that as a result of}} general desirability, the perception of sour taste is mostly affected by turbidity level and the ability of metal taste disappearance...|$|E
40|$|Acid sulfate soils (ASS) is {{a stress}} factor that is {{responsible}} for the failure of some mangrove restoration projects, including abandoned aquaculture ponds converted from mangrove ecosystems. Through experimental and field studies, this research provides {{a better understanding of the}} biogeochemistry of ASS disturbance and the response of mangrove seedlings (Rhizophoraceae) under high metal levels and acidic conditions. This study found that mangrove restorations under ASS disturbance can work but with lower numbers of survived seedlings. To prevent toxicity under high levels of metal, seedlings retained metals in their roots and sparingly distributed them into aerial parts with low mobility. The presence of high levels of <b>potential</b> <b>acidity</b> parameters would allow pyrite to oxidise, thus increasing metal levels and acidity, which in turn affected the survival and growth of the seedlings...|$|E

40|$|Figs are {{fruits of}} Ficus carica L., {{a member of}} the family Moraceae. Fig is known as a healthy fruit due to its high dietary fiber and mineral content. Figs are usually {{consumed}} as dried. This study evaluates the characterizations physicochemical and microbiological of 72 samples of dry figs, taken from markets of Rabat and Casablanca. The results showed that samples of the markets of Rabat have the highest contamination level with average high total coliform, fecal coliforms, yeasts and moulds and redox <b>potential</b> and <b>acidity</b> very low. The least contaminated samples were collected in the markets of Casablanca. The identification of germs pathogens, isolated for all samples, showed that the Enterobacter is the most common type (45 %). However, other types have a lower rate such as: Klebsiella (30 %), Buttiaux agrestis (5 %), Serratia marcescens (10 %) Escherichia Coli (10 %). Finally, the strains, tested for sensitivity to the twelve types of antibiotics, have shown some resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + Ac clavulanic, cefalotine, ticarcilline and co-trimoxazole...|$|R

The reference values of 189 honey samples of different botanical origin were determined using Association Official Analytical Chemists, (AOAC), 1990; Codex Alimentarius, 2001, International Honey Commission, 2002, methods. Multivariate calibration models were built using partial least squares (PLS) for the measurands studied. The developed models were validated using cross-validation and external validation; several statistical parameters were obtained to determine the robustness of the calibration models: (PCs) optimum number of components principal, (SECV) standard error of cross-validation, (R 2 cal) coefficient of determination of cross-validation, (SEP) standard error of validation, and (R 2 val) coefficient of determination for external validation and coefficient of variation (CV). The prediction accuracy for pH, redox potential, electrical conductivity, moisture, TSS, and ash was good, while for free acidity and HMF it was poor. The results demonstrate that attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry is a valuable, rapid, and nondestructive tool for the quantification of physicochemical properties of honey...|$|R
