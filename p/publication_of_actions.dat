Spheres that are likely to be vulnerable are thoroughly examined and ways of protecting the application in the area of access control, data transfer, user input, output and state keeping are suggested. Furthermore, with regard to the security, possible solutions of audit, backing up, web server security, database design and protection against spam robots are described. This project is also concerned with the analysis of requirements, detailed design and implementation of the club information system with demonstration of mentioned security solutions. The systems of members' evidence, evidence of breeding dogs and their pedigrees, <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> and results and the content management system of other sections of the web presentation are among others implemented within the scope of this IS.

5000|$|An American {{comic book}} is a thin periodical, {{typically}} 32-pages, containing primarily comics content. While the form originated in 1933, American comic books first gained popularity after the 1938 <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> Comics, which included the debut of the superhero Superman. This {{was followed by a}} superhero boom that lasted until the end of World War II. After the war, while superheroes were marginalized, the comic book industry rapidly expanded, and genres such as horror, crime, and romance became popular. The 1950s saw a gradual decline, due to a shift away from print media in the wake of television and the impact of the Comics Code Authority.

This commentary reviews the key findings reported in the recent BMC Medicine <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ACTION</b> study, which focuses on the health-related quality of life and psychological distress in 5249 cancer survivors in eight low- and middle-income countries in Southeast Asia. The study identified that more than one-third of survivors experience at least mild levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and that poorer outcomes in quality of life, anxiety, and depressive symptoms are linked to a number of clinical and demographic factors. Such data provides an important foundation to inform cancer policy and service planning in Asia. Future research efforts are required to further understand the needs of cancer survivors in this region and determine interventions to improve outcomes for this population.

40|$|Wild canids {{range in}} size from the tiny fennec fox to the mighty grey wolf, and occur in every {{continent}} except Antarctica. Canids are special because they have, as perceived friend or foe, preoccupied the imaginations of mankind for millennia; because the breadth of their adaptations makes them enthralling to science; and because the contradictory facets of their relations with people perplex the conservationist. Increasing human population, development, exploitation of previously little-disturbed wild lands, disease and direct persecution are threatening some of these canids with extinction.

40|$|The first {{encounter}} between social constructionism and systemic theories probably happened in 1980, with the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> Communication, <b>Action</b> and Meaning. Michel Foucault was considered then by many scholars and practitioners as an obscure French philosopher, totally unrelated to communication and clinical practice. Although {{he had studied}} madness, clinical discourse, sexuality and prisons, his ideas seemed too abstract {{to be applied to}} both social practice and the analysis of everyday life. This paper describes how the CMM theory provides imagination for everyday communication practices. These methodologies seem to mirror the micro-physics of power, and the hermeneutics of the Self as described by Foucault. I will also apply these considerations to a clinical case study. Summary in the original language Quando negli anni Ottanta l’approccio sistemico incontrò il costruzionismo sociale, Foucault era pressoché sconosciuto tra i terapeuti. Nel migliore dei casi era considerato un oscuro filosofo francese che non aveva gran che a che fare con la clinica, sebbene Foucault avesse studiato proprio la follia, la clinica, la sessualità e l’istituzione carceraria...|$|R

These types of networks {{consist of a}} number of autonomous or semi-autonomous wireless nodes/objects moving with diverse patterns and speeds while communicating via several radio interfaces simultaneously.

In this paper we review our previous studies on the ability of arsenicals to cause DNA damage, the relative inability of these arsenicals to induce point mutations, and the involvement of arsenicals in spindle disruption. We present new evidence that shows that reduced glutathione (GSH) can chemically reduce inactive pentavalent arsenicals to trivalent arsenicals which can disrupt tubulin polymerization, and show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are most likely not involved in tubulin disruption. A hypothesis is also presented on how arsenic may induce stable chromosome aberrations (CAs) that can lead to cancer, thus supporting a role for genetic damage in the MOA for arsenic. We then propose promising areas of research that might give insight into the MOA of arsenic. Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|R

The Conference, which rook place on 4 th June 1999 in the Royal Marine Hotel, Dun Laoghaire, marked the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> the Council's latest report - An Action Plan for Dementia. Officially opened by Dr Tom Moffatt TD, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for older people the conference attracted almost 300 delegates from across the statutory, voluntary and private sectors. The Action Plan, prepared by Dr Eamon O'Shea and Ms Siobhan O'Reilly, Department of Economics, National University of Ireland, Galway, {{is the result of}} extensive consultation with national organisations of older people, carers, and with health care professionals and policy makers working in the area of dementia. It builds on previous work undertaken by the National Council On Ageing and Older People which highlighted the need for significant progress in the care of older people with dementia in Ireland. In June 1993, the Council organised a seminar to consider the setting up of a Dementia Services Information and Development Centre. This was followed, in 1996, by the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> the report, Mental Disorders in Older Irish People; Incidence, Prevalence and Treatment and a conference which focused on priorities for mental health services for older people. The <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Action</b> Plan, and the conference on planning for dementia care, are the latest steps taken by the Council in seeking {{to bridge the gap between}} thc needs of dementia sufferers and their carers and the services actually proyided.

It outlines an approach to developing available, accessible and high quality services in the context of existing resources and public expenditure constraints. Irs aim is to describe a besr practice model of dementia care in Ireland - a model which may inform and guide policy makers and others involved in planning service provision, and which may give support and assistance to those who endeavour to provide flexible services at the local level...|$|R
