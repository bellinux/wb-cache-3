40|$|A {{review of}} {{evidence}} for deformation and terrane accretion on the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic margins of Pangea and the mid-Cretaceous margins of the palaeo-Pacific ocean shows that deformation was global and synchronous with probable superplume events. Late Triassic–Early Jurassic deformation appears to be concentrated in the period 202 – 197 Ma and was coeval with eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, onset of Pangaea break-up, a period of extended normal magnetic polarity and a major mass extinction event, all possible expressions of a superplume event. Mid-Cretaceous deformation occurred in two brief periods, the first from approximately 116 to 110 Ma in the west palaeo-Pacific and the second from roughly 105 to 99 Ma in the east palaeo-Pacific, with both events possibly represented in northeast Siberia. This deformation was coeval with eruption of major oceanic plateaus, core-complex formation and rifting of New Zealand from Gondwana, the Cretaceous normal <b>polarity</b> <b>epoch,</b> and a major radiation of flowering plants and several animal groups, all linked with the mid-Cretaceous superplume event. A simple unifying mechanism is presented suggesting that large continental or oceanic plates, when impacted by a superplume, tend to break-up/reorganize, associated with gravitational spreading away from a broad, thermally generated topographic high and with a resulting short-lived pulse of plate-marginal deformation and terrane accretion...|$|E

At both holes, a decreasing downcore trend both in natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and susceptibility probably indicates that maghemitization (from primary titanomagnetite) increases downcore.

40|$|Deep-sea sediments {{have been}} shown to possess a natural {{remanent}} magnetisation (NRM) that often {{can be attributed to the}} statistical alignment of detrital magnetic grains in the Earth's magnetic field at or shortly after the time of their deposition. In favourable circumstances this remanence can be interpreted as a record of palaeomagnetic field behaviour. In the study reported here we have attempted to describe relative variations in palaeomagnetic field intensity on a time scale of 104 - 105 yr, during the past 700, 000 yr, using the palaeomagnetic record of deep-sea sediment piston core RC 10 - 167 (33 ° 2 ′N, 150 ° 23 ′E), which has an exceptionally thick section of sediment deposited during the Brunhes normal <b>polarity</b> <b>epoch</b> (Fig. 1).

The computed mean value of G(sub theta) for a given qA epoch, changes sign with the change in the solar magnetic polairty in accordance with the predictions of some contemporary hypotheses. Also, we find that the magnitude of G(sub theta) undergoes a significant time variation during a given <b>polarity</b> <b>epoch.</b> It has the largest value near the solar polar field reversal epoch boundaries, when magnetic polarity in the solar northern hemisphere is positive (qA greater than O). For each of the three solar polar field reversals, the change in the magnitude of G(sub theta) is steeper across the epoch boundaries. There is a good correlation between G(sub theta) and the tilt angle of the helisopheric neutral current sheet (HNCS). Our results are in agreement with the reported piecemeal measurements of the latitudinal gradient made by spacecrafts, at different times, at lower primary energies, at far off distances from Earth's orbit.

We do not recognize any non-ordinary changes in the physical mechanism of modulation of the GCR intensity in the rigidity range of GCR particles to which neutron monitors respond. We compose 2 -D non stationary model of transport equation to describe variations of the GCR intensity for 1996 - 2012 including the Apos (1996 - 2001) and the Aneg (2002 - 2012) periods; diffusion coefficient of cosmic rays for rigidity 10 - 15 GV is increased by 30 percent in 2009 (Aneg) comparing with 1996 (Apos).

40|$|A {{method of}} {{combined}} least squares and non-linear optimisation for {{the interpretation of}} magnetic anomalies over dykes is here presented. The method seeks to minimise a non-linear objective function by iteratively varying the non-linear parameters of the dyke while obtaining optimum values of the linear parameters by least squares analysis until an acceptable fit is obtained between the observed and computed anomalies. A study {{of the effects of}} demagnetization in arbitrarily shaped bodies and methods for evaluating the demagnetization effects of such bodies are also presented. Sixteen profiles have been taken across a linear magnetic feature which intersects the North Minch on the North Scottish Shelf. These have been interpreted in terms of a dyke about 1 km wide using the non-linear optimization techniques developed. The dyke is reversely magnetized in a direction consistent with its Tertiary origin. An aeromagnetic study of the Lower and Middle Benue Trough of Nigeria has been carried out. Regions of high and low magnetic anomalies have been correlated in an effort to find trends. Two-dimensional interpretation of several aeromagnetic profiles across the trough has been carried out. Interpretation of the observed anomalies in terms of topographic variations of the basement led to rather unreasonable models. The anomalies were best interpreted in terms of basic intrusive bodies which could occur either predominantly within the Cretaceous sediments or within the metamorphic basement.

We analyze the 27 -day variation of the (1) two dimensional (2 D) GCR anisotropy in the ecliptic plane, and (2) north-south anisotropy normal to the ecliptic plane. Studying the time line of the 27 -day variation of the 2 D GCR anisotropy, we confirm that the average amplitude in the minimum epoch of solar activity is polarity dependent, as it is expected from the drift theory. The amplitude in the negative <b>polarity</b> <b>epochs</b> is less as we had shown before. The feeble 11 -year variation connected with solar cycle and strong 22 -year pattern connected with solar magnetic cycle is visible in the 27 -day variation of the 2 D anisotropy for 1965 - 2014. We show that the 27 -day variation of the GG index (being {{a measure of the}} north-south asymmetry) varies in accordance to solar cycle with a period of 11 -years, being in good agreement with the 27 -day variation of the At component of the GCR anisotropy calculated by the IZMIRAN group.

40|$|Summary. The {{magnetic}} viscosity of 334 Upper Tertiary and pre-Bruhnes Quaternary volcanic rocks from the Massif Central (France) and the Steens Mountain (Oregon), and of 40 basaltic cores from DSDP leg 37 has been investigated. Thellier’s viscosity index follows a {{log normal distribution}} with mean values equal to 6 and 3. 5 per cent for subaerial and submarine rocks respectively. For subaerial rocks, the average intensity of the viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) acquired in the Earth’s field since the be-ginning of the Bruhnes <b>polarity</b> <b>epoch</b> (t = 0. 7 Myr) {{is estimated to be}} equal to one-quarter of the average intensity of the primary remanence. Alternating field demagnetization of VRMs acquired in low fields for acquisition times t ranging from 2 day to 32 month indicates the resistance to alternating fields is quite different from sample to sample and increases linearly with log t. NBel’s diagnostic parameter of domain structure of the grains involved in {{magnetic viscosity}} shows that hard VRM is carried by single-domain grains and soft VRM carried by multidomain particles. Single domain particles carrying hard VRM in subaerial volcanic rocks are almost equant magnetite intergrowths with size near the superparamagnetism threshold, resulting from high temperature oxidation of titanomagnetite. Soft VRM is carried by low Curie point homogeneous titanomagnetite. Unlike his single domain theory, Nkel’s multidomain theory of magnetic viscosity does not account quantita-tively for the resistance of VRM to alternating fields. ...|$|E

After a prolonged period of eruptive repose of about 2 Ma, eruptive activity resumed in the island in the middle Matuyama reverse <b>polarity</b> <b>Epoch,</b> with basaltic magmas and fissure eruptions that continued until quite recently (1824), with an eruptive episode of an anomalously high magnitude between 1730 and 1736. The evolutive trends of the related magmas show the presence of a complete evolutive magmatic cycle in the old edifice of Los Ajaches, with magmas evolving by crystal fractionation from alkali basalts to trachytes. In Famara and Tías edifices, magmas are mainly primitive basanites generated by partial melting processes. In the Quaternary volcanism, partial melting-generated basanite-alkali basalt magmas are also predominant, with some superimposed components of crystal fractionation. A significant exception is the 1730 eruption, where the evolution of magmas is completely anomalous in the recent magmatic history of the Archipelago, from basanites to olivine tholeiites, probably in relation with the mixing of magmas from two different magmatic sources.

40|$|Bathymetry, seismic {{reflection}} profiles, magnetic data, and dredged basalt {{indicate that}} two centres of spreading have existed near {{the northern end}} of Juan de Fuca Ridge in the last 0. 7 m. y. (Brunhes Geomagnetic <b>Polarity</b> <b>Epoch).</b> A short-lived eastern branch functioned only {{in the early part of}} the Brunhes Epoch. More prolonged and recent activity has occurred on the western branch, and has involved extrusion of basalt, rifting, and uplift. The anomalous relief of {{the northern end of}} Juan de Fuca Ridge compared to the ridge further south is the result of a tectonic event which occurred 100, 000 - 350, 000 years ago. Prior to this, turbidites were deposited over most of the northern part of the ridge, which consisted of a series of basement ridges and valleys of subdued relief trending NNE parallel to the magnetic anomalies. During the event, the igneous basement together with the overlying turbidites was faulted, tilted, and uplifted along the primary structural trends. The basement relief was increased in places to more than 2 km. Subsequent turbidite deposition has been confined to valleys. The Sovanco Fracture Zone between Juan de Fuca and Explorer Ridges also suffered uplift. The tectonic disturbance may have resulted from an increase in spreading rate or the change in location of the axis of spreading on Juan de Fuca Ridge, or compressional interaction between Explorer sub-plate to the north and Sovanco Fracture Zone and the northern end of Juan de Fuca Ridge. Sovanco Fracture Zone, consisting of a WNW-trending basement ridge (Sovanco Ridge) with complex associated magnetic anomalies, may have originated as a strike-slip fault or fault-zone trending east-west about 5 m. y. ago. Location of present transform movement within the fracture zone is equivocal, but apparently trends NW. A specimen of basalt from the eastern end of Sovanco Ridge yielded a fission track age of < 309, 000 years. Basalts dredged from 13 locations on Juan de Fuca Ridge, Sovanco Ridge, and Heck and Heckle Seamount Chains on the western flank of Juan de Fuca Ridge are low-potassium tholeiites of the ocean ridge type. Twenty-seven representative specimens of fresh basalt, as well as 15 samples of glass selvages and altered basalt, were analyzed for 9 major elements by an atomic absorption technique set up by the author. The analyses are closely similar, showing no well-developed differentiation trend. They straddle the boundary between the olivine-normative and quartz-normative fields, and the basalts may have been derived by segregation from the mantle at a depth of about 15 km. A specimen from NE of the eastern spreading centre yielded a fission track age of 0. 95 ± 0. 53 m. y. which is in reasonable agreement with the age of 0. 7 - 0. 9 m. y. predicted by the magnetic anomaly time scale. Increasing thicknesses of Fe-Mn coatings on dredged basalts indicate that the two NW-trending seamount chains increase in age away from the crest of Juan de Fuca Ridge. The seamounts originated and grew to virtually their present sizes while still at or near the ridge crest. Reflection profiles across the continental slope indicate that it has formed by folding, reverse faulting, and uplift of strata of Cascadia Basin. Internal deformation has caused these sediments to behave as acoustical basement in the structures beneath the slope but their sedimentary nature has been confirmed by dredging. The presence of magnetic anomalies 5 - 8 m. y. old beneath the lower and middle continental slope indicates subduction. The magnetic basement dips below the slope at an angle of more than 10 °...|$|E

A remarkable succession of Pleistocene mammal sites {{is found in}} the Lower and Upper members of the Baza Formation in the Orce area. The Upper Member contains the Early Pleistocene paleontological and archeological sites of Barranco León- 5 and Fuente Nueva 3. Both sites belong to the early Pleistocene zone defined by Allophaiomys aff. lavocati and a small Mimomys savini. This zone can be correlated with that of central Europe containing Mimomys savini and Microtus praehintoni. These sites are located in the marginal lacustrine deposits of the Baza lake system and originated in expanded phases of the main lake when meteoric surface and shallow groundwater inputs were predominant. The Barranco León- 5 site is related to a sudden event of high-energy currents entering a lacustrine - palustrine domain. These currents transported gravels, bones and lithic industries from a short distance (maximum, hundreds of meters). In contrast, the diverse levels in Fuente Nueva 3 do not show evidence of noticeable transport by traction currents. The age of the mammal succession and sites is based on magnetostratigraphy. In the Middle and Upper members of the Baza Formation, only reversed polarities are found (Matuyama epoch). The location of the Olduvai chron is still unclear and could have not been recorded due to the common hiatuses observed in the sedimentary successions.

In the northern part of the Centre the north-westerly trending Kakaramea-Tihia Massif and Pihanga form a chain of volcanoes which last erupted more than 20, 000 years BP, but from which large mudflows have recurred up to as recently as 1910 A.

By contrast the other two multiple vent volcanoes - Ruapehu and the Tongariro Massif - include several vents (four and possibly five) that have been active during the last 100 years and, in particular, Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu Crater Lake. In the first part of the thesis the tephrostratigraphy of the Tongariro area is described. Thirteen rhyolitic tephras erupted from Okataina, Maroa and Taupo Volcanic Centres over the last 20, 000 years are interbedded with local andestitic tephras. The order of succession of the 13 tephras is established by stratigraphy, and is confirmed by their mineralogical composition and by chemical analysis of their titanomagnetites. Seven of the rhyolitic tephras have been previously dated by 14 C, four more (Rotorua Ash, Karapiti Lapilli, Papanetu Tephra and Poronui Tephra) are dated hare, and two others are not yet dated. Six further rhyolitic tephras are of less use as marker beds. Four of these are tentatively correlated with rhyolite tephras from the more northerly volcanic centres and all but one are older than, 20, 000 years BP. These rhyolitic tephra marker beds have provided valuable time control which, together with 12 further radiocarbon dated events has allowed a chronology of the andesitic tephras erupted from vents within the Tongariro Volcanic Centre. Two previously named tephras, Ngauruhoe Tephra and Magatawai Tephra, are given formation status, and a further four formations (Papakai Tephra, Mangamate Tephra, Okupata Tephra and Tetoaira Lapilli) are defined. Ngauruhoe Tephra (0 - 1819 years BP), Mangatawai Tephra (c. 1819 - 2, 500 years BP), and Papakai Tephra (c. 3, 400 - 9, 700 years BP) have all accumulated as a result of intermittent activity from several vents. Mangamate Tephra, with six named members, was erupted mainly from the Tama Lakes-Ngauruhoe area between c. 9, 700 - 9, 780 years BP. Four of the members were deposited eastwards from the Tongariro Massif. The oldest member, Te Rato Lapilli, was erupted c. 9, 780 years BP probably from North Crater. It was distributed in a single lobe to the NNE and is the best andesitic tephra marker bed in rhyolite tephra sequences further north. The youngest member, Poutu Lepilli, was erupted as three lobes (NW, NE, SE) from a source probably at Blue about 9, 700 years BP. Poutu Lapilli has a volume of 0. 9 km 3 and the tephra of the total formation is likely to have destroyed more than 1, 000 km 2 of the pre-Mangamate forest. Ruapehu was very active between c. 10 - 14, 000 years BP. Most of the lapilli and ash beds were deposited east of the volcano and most of the remainder were deposited to the north. The youngest of the units erupted northwards, Okupata Tephra, underlies Te Rato Lapilli and probably has an age between 10 - 12, 000 years BP. Rotoaira Lapilli is prominent north-east of the Tongariro Massif. It was probably erupted from lower Te Meri Crater c. 13, 800 years BP and has been used to define the base of the Tongariro Sub-group. This subgroup is of Aranuian (post-glacial) age and includes all tephras accordant with the present day topography and which have been erupted from the Tongariro Volcanio Centre. Much of the tephra record between 20, 000 and 14, 000 years BP was lost through contemporaneous erosion and andesitic tephras have been reworked in with Oruanui tephra to from loess beds of late Otiran age. A cool-climate origin for these loesses is consistent with the pollen record of the Tongariro area which shows that between 20, 000 and 14, 000 years BP there was a change from Nethofagus forest, grassland and shrubland to podocarp-broadleaf forest. This implies a change to a warmer climate during that period. The major erosional unconformities in the Tongariro area are also of this age. An unconformity at the top of the Mangamate Formation (9, 700 - 9, 780 years BP) resulted from erosion during the time taken fro vegetation to recolonise the surface of the thick tephra sequence following total devastation of the forest. Periods of widespread erosion followed deposition of the thick Oruanui Breccia and Taupo Pumice tephra flow units. Widespread present day erosion is probably due primarily to extensive pre-Eurpoean and early Erurpean fires. Late Otiran glacial moraines recognised in five valleys about the Tongariro Massif are older than 14, 700 years BP and moraine on eastern Ruapehu is probably older than 20, 000 years BP. The amount of soil development undergone by andesitic tephra is related to the net rate tephra accumulation. Mangatawai Tephra shows least soil development and had the fastest accumulation rate; Papakai Tephra shows most soil development and had the slowest accumulation rate. The degree of paleosol development also varies according to the distribution of the tephras from the source vents and their related particle sizes; soils around Tongariro were least well development ESE of the massif where the rate of tephra accumulation was highest, and were best developed in the west to south quadrant where the rate of tephra accumulation was lowest. Eruptions of Mangamate Tephra were violent and the tephras were generally very well sorted. These eruptions were from magma of a "new" chemical composition and their depositions was associated with the first tephras erupted for about 10, 000 years from the Taupo Volcanic Centre. It is likely that the upward movement of this andesite of "new" composition and its initial eruption about 10, 000 years ago provided the trigger for eruption of the oldest Taupo Sub-group tephras. Timing of subsequent eruptions of rhyolitic tephra of a "new" magma composition was probably controlled by increases of vapour pressure over confining pressure with subsequent healing of fractures and a new build up of pressure. The concurrent intermittent andesitic volcanism probably had no significant effect on the timing of the youngest rhyolitic eruptions. Ngauruhoe, a composite cone about 900 m high at {{the southern}} end of the Tongariro Massif is considered to have first erupted about 2, 500 years ago and to have completed most of its growth during deposition of Magatawai Tephra. Red Crater which lies within a small scoria cone on the central part of the Tongariro Massif is mainly younger than 3, 400 years BP although the oldest flew can only be dated as younger than 9, 700 years BP. The six lavas extruded before 1819 years BP are olivine andesites; the five lavas extruded since 1819 years BP are basalts. The Te Mari Craters on northern Tongariro have been active from at least 13, 800 years ago to 1896 A. D. Lava was extruded following the eruption of Rotoaira Lapilli (13, 800 years BP) and a large flank extrusion occurred between 9, 700 and 6, 000 years BP. Lava flows from the upper Te Mari Crater were probably extruded in the early 16 th century. North Crater, near the north-western end of the Tongariro Massif probably dated from abut 70, 000 years ago (Stipp 1968) and most of the cone is older than 10, 000 years. A nuee ardente was erupted about 10, 000 years BP and Te Rato Lapilli was erupted about 9, 780 years BP. The upper part of the cone probably dated from 4, 800 years BP and all major eruptions had ceased by 1819 years BP. Blue Lake was the site of the Poutu Lapilli eruption c. 9, 700 years BP and has probably been active more recently. The Upper and Lower Tama Lakes new occupy the sites of many of the Mangamate Tephra eruptions of 9, 700 - 9, 780 years BP. Some eruptions of Papakai Tephra were probably also from this area. Pukeenake Scoria Cone, west of the Tongariro Massif, and the two plugs to its north define a fissure from which extensive olivine andesites were extruded more than 20, 000 years ago. Pukekaikore dome west of Ngauruhoe is possibly an old cumuledome of labradorite andesite flows. Small olivine andesite flows and associated tephra were erupted from a vent near the summit of the dome about 14, 700 years BP. While most of the lahars from the Tongariro Massif are older than 20, 000 years BP at least five occurred on northern Tongariro during deposition of Papkai Tephra, and tree-ring dating provides an estimated age of 1895 A. D. for a historic mudflow from Ketetahi Springs, also on northern Tongariro. Eruptions from the Kakaramea-Tihia Massif are all older than 20, 000 years BP and the youngest may be represented by a nuee ardente deposit from a vent WSW of Tihia. This deposit cams to rest above its Curie point and was radiocarbon dated at > 40, 300 years BP. Eruptions from Rotopounamu Graben and Pihanga are also older than 20, 000 years BP. Lahars from these centres may date back to 0. 6 m. y. but there have been several Aranuian lahars and the most recent were in 1846 and 1910 A. D. Ruapehu erupted numerous tephra beds from 10 - 14, 000 years BP, probably from a northern crater. An extensive as flow from the north-western summit area has an age between 5 - 10, 000 years BP, similar to the age of lava flows from a parasitic vent lower on the northern side. Murimotu Lahars on the lower north-western slopes of Ruapehu span the final 3, 000 years of the tephra deposition. One of the largest lahars, that formed conical mounds, came to rest above its Curie point and is likely to have been initiated by displacement of a crater lake by lave or a growing lava dome. It is probably that this 'hot' lahar, aged between 9, 540 and 12, 450 years BP, occurred during the Gothenburg reverse polarity event. The vent presently occupied by the Crater Lake was initiated probably about 2, 500 years BP and most lahars since that time have been confined to the Whangaehu River. Since 1859 eruptions through Crater Lake have caused two large lahars in Whangaehu River and there have been four cold lahars. The most recent of the cold lahars, on 24 December, 1953 destroyed the railway bridge at Tangiwai about five minutes before an express reached the bridge and 151 lives were lost. Lavas of Hauhungatahi cone, 12 km north-west of Ruapehu, are older than 20, 000 years BP. The explesion craters at Ohakune, about 19 km south-west of the summit of Ruapehu, are also older than 20, 000 years BP. Tephrochronology provides minimum ages for several rhyolite and dacite domes within or near the northern and of the Tongariro Volcanic Centre: Papanetu Tephra was erupted from the site of Kuharua Dome c. 9, 785 years BP towards the end of dome formation; Puketarata Ash was erupted from the site of Puketarata Dome in the Maroa Volcanic Centre towards the end of dome formation approximately 13, 500 years BP; Manganamu Dome is younger than 1819 years BP and Koroi Dome is likely to be close to 1819 years BP; Pukekaikiore Dome is older than 9, 790 years BP; Horohoro Dome is older than 14, 000 years BP; and Motuepuhi Island, Lake Rotoaira, is older than 20, 000 years BP. Ages for several fault movements near the Tongariro Massif are given. At least one fault movement was associated with eruption of the Mangamate Formation. Fault movements at both ends of Lake Rotoaira occurred after eruption of Taupo Pumice and it is suggested that they were in response to eruption of some of the Taupo Pumice from within that lake. The reverse polarity of andesite lava in Tongariro River suggests its extrusion during the Matuyama reverse <b>polarity</b> <b>epoch.</b> The age of > 0. 69 m. y. is the oldest age for lava within Tongariro Volcanic Centre...|$|E
