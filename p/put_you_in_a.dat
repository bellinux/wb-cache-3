500|$|Abbott is the {{inventor}} of a style of maze called logic mazes. A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes". [...] The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction can <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If you return to that same square, the die {{may be in a}} different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.|$|E
500|$|Writing in his track-by-track review Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{rated the}} album an eighty-six out of 100, saying that [...] "Yours Truly carries the {{expectations}} of a young singer who has already proven herself on the pop charts, {{and even if the}} songs on her debut could not equal the quality of [...] "The Way," [...] Grande had the fan base and powerful pipes to survive a misfire." [...] At PopMatters, Scott Interrante rated the album eight discs out of ten, writing that [...] "Minor missteps aside, Yours Truly is ultimately an impressive debut for Grande." [...] Ryan Dennehy of AbsolutePunk rated the album a 70-percent, stating that [...] "Yours Truly is more tempered and less likely to <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> beaming state of catatonia" [...] that is [...] "a missive containing some of her most personal thoughts and her oft-regrettable youthful impulses." [...] At Pitchfork, Andrew Ryce rated the album a 6.5 out of ten, calling it [...] "a very safe record." [...] Lewis Conner of Digital Spy rated the album four stars out of five, writing how [...] "The production feels fresh, the lyrics are relatable and the melodies are as cool and sweet as a dollop of raspberry ripple", and where he also states that [...] "The tone and pace of the album rarely changes, but the songs feel accomplished, polished and vibrant". Corner concluded by calling [...] "Yours Truly" [...] a [...] "little less than a triumph." [...] At The Michigan Daily, Gregory Hicks graded the album a B, saying [...] "most tracks are of quality composition, lyrically and melodically, but beat usage becomes excessive at times." [...] Jim Farber of The New York Daily News rated the album three stars out of five, stating that because the [...] "armies of song doctors" [...] that the release is [...] "far more tuneful than Mariah's interchangeable hits." ...|$|E

500|$|NPR's Ken Tucker {{described}} the album as a [...] "glossy but heartfelt work" [...] and approvingly compared its contrasting philosophy to Nick Lowe's Quality Street: A Seasonal Selection for All the Family, {{both of which}} he described as [...] "will <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> holiday mood". Matt Casarino of PopMatters gave the album a generally favorable review, claiming that [...] "Clarkson plays it safe and spends too much time showing off her upper register, but Wrapped in Red is a warm and romantic addition to the Christmas pop Zeitgeist," [...] adding: [...] "Wrapped in Red doesn’t need edge; it’s just dynamic and varied enough to be satisfying, and it’s light-years {{better than any of}} the whitewashed Christmas crap Simon Cowell has inflicted on the world". [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe gave a favorable review, particularly lauding [...] "Underneath the Tree", and described Clarkson's rendering of the Christmas standards as [...] "fairly straight". She added: [...] "She starts gently on [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] before belting out the money notes. She ambles assuredly through the soulful favorite [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] and hangs by the piano for a torchy “White Christmas." [...] Newsdays music columnist Glenn Gamboa wrote that [...] "Clarkson handles it all expertly — hitting remarkably high notes on [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] and swinging jazzily on [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] with Dunn. The new songs make Wrapped in Red a real gift, as the title track and [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] channel the Phil Spector Christmas albums; and [...] "4 Carats" [...] somehow blends [...] "Stronger" [...] and [...] "Santa Baby". Reviewing for HitFix, Melinda Newman gave the album an [...] "A" [...] rating, praising Clarkson's vocal performances and noting that she and Greg Kurstin [...] "have clearly studied legendary Christmas albums of yore—most notably Spector's A Christmas Gift For You and Andy Williams' Merry Christmas—to lovingly recreate Christmas standards, as well as craft new ones in the image of those sets." [...] Chris Klimek of Slate declared Wrapped in Red as the best of 2013's new Christmas records, noting it for its vintage sound. He also observed that its five original tracks, most notably [...] "Wrapped in Red" [...] and [...] "Underneath the Tree", [...] "have reasonable odds of remaining in the yuletide rotation five years from now." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Jon [...] Caramanica wrote that [...] "Clarkson is very likely the only singer working in pop with a real possibility of creating a modern holiday classic along the lines of Carey's [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", and remarked that her takes on familiar songs, however accomplished, are [...] "also faithful in the way that someone mindful of pop history would be." ...|$|E

(The role eventually went to Shelley Winters.) She continued to lend her name to a line of retro women's swimwear. [...] "Women worldwide are fighting a thing called gravity," [...] said Williams.

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Out Magazine, Amos used the song [...] "Maybe California", a track from the album in which a mother ruminates on leaving her husband and child(ren) [...] "better off" [...] as she contemplates suicide, to explain just how personal writing and composing both the song and the record as a whole were for her: [...] "I wouldn’t have written this record if I hadn’t been pushed — {{for all kinds of}} reasons. I don’t want to go into all of it but “Maybe California” doesn’t come from nowhere. You’re not able to write that by having a drink with somebody who’s had the experience and you haven’t. You have to be pushed to that place." [...] She speaks of the mother figure in the song: [...] "there's nothing that she can give to stop this terrible emotional cancer that has taken over her family - her life - everything around her." [...] Adding credence to the notion that the song is deeply autobiographical, Amos chose to highlight the despair older, more mature women, such as herself, face: [...] "I began to realize how serious this quiet, tragic problem was and that it's not okay to talk about it, whereas teen suicide - it gets discussed and it's almost something where there are [...] for it. But mothers contemplating this - my God - they're just going to <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nuthouse." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} based on Bennington's dark past and his drug addiction.In an {{interview}} with LPAssociation, Mike Shinoda said, [...] "In a way, this album is personal because it's more specific. Maybe because each song started with concept and lyrics. Often on One More Light, the words paint <b>a</b> picture which <b>puts</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time and place.

2500|$|I am very {{sensible}} {{that you}} are let into {{the knowledge of the}} intrigues of the compter, particularly with relation to the securing of pocket books. But your experience is inferior to mine... I can <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> far better method than you are acquainted with... But I must first tell you that you'll spoil the trade of thief-taking in advancing greater rewards than are necessary. I give but half a crown a book... And when the thieves and pickpockets see us confederate they'll submit to our terms.Thus their partnership started taking Hitchen and his assistant first to Temple Bar, westernmost limit of his area of Jurisdiction. There marshal was revered with different [...] "fine" [...] drinks at different taverns, to which he only gave a brief sign asking for information on stolen goods. He was verbose, though, in his [...] "promises of protection" [...] to female visitors of those establishments:"I'll give you my word...you shall be detected, unless you deliver all the pocket books you from time to time meet with to me...If you at any time for the future, refuse to yield... either to me or my servant, you may be assured of being all sent to Bridewell... Wild gives an example of marshal's treatment of well-dressed women too. Once he seized a baillif's wife in the street in Ludgate Hill for talking to a man and accused her of being [...] "lewd". He took her to Cheapside and made her wait till he dined and pay for his meal. Pickpockets, or [...] "mathematicians" [...] as Hitchen called them affectionately", appear with a noteworthy incident in this period. On their regular night walks near St.Paul's, Hitchen and Wild saw the boys running away. Hitchen, having information on a stolen book, saw the reason of their hiding. He caught and arrested one, whose name was James Jones, the same juvenile who stole Lord Barnard's bills. The boy gave the address of his friends next morning before the justice and Hitchen took Wild to Barbican to attack their house during the night. The uninvited guests were welcomed with unfriendly 'damn ye', upon which the assistant Wild was left inside with the company while the marshal fled for bringing more constables. The gang of around 12 year-olds was taken and tried at Kingston assizes as their robbery was committed in Surrey. To the great disappointment and fury of marshal, court acquitted the boys upon their parents' complaint on marshal forcing their children to commit crime. He could not claim usual 40 pounds for their dead or alive heads. Moreover, was reprimanded by the court for the base interest. Wild gives very interesting account of the other side of Hitchen's relation to pickpockets we will mention below.|$|E
