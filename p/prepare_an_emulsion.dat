Sven Behrens holds a diploma in Physics from Goettingen University (Germany) and a Ph. D. in Environmental Sciences from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland. After {{two years of}} postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago and five years of industrial research in the polymer research division of BASF, Germany, he joined the Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering faculty at Georgia Tech in 2007. Research in the Behrens group addresses colloidal interactions in aqueous and nonpolar solutions, interfacial assembly processes, and protein stability. Runtime: 63 : 06 minutesIt {{has been known for}} more than a century that colloidal particles with the “right” wetting properties can stabilize emulsions, much like surfactants or amphiphilic polymers do. Today, particlestabilized emulsions (so-called Pickering emulsions) play an important role in many industrial applications, but our fundamental understanding of the connection between particle properties and emulsion characteristics is still surprisingly poor. We can, for example, <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> by mixing equal amounts of an oil phase and an aqueous particle dispersion; but even with complete knowledge of both liquids and all particle properties, current theory fails to predict reliably the stability and even the type (w/o or o/w) of the emulsion formed. This presentation will discuss the source of such difficulties and propose several steps toward an improved theoretical description and better practical control of emulsion properties. In particular, I will address the role of electrostatic interactions between a particle and a liquid interface before and after particle adsorption, and show that widely neglected “image forces” can prevent particle adsorption and emulsion stabilization altogether. For the case of successful particle adsorption, the particle’s contact angle with the interface is found to be influenced strongly by the particle charge and surface roughness in ways that are not usually accounted for, but have important consequences for the long term stability of Pickering emulsions...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} ten years since Yoshida {{discovered}} his ascites tumor (1943), many authors have intended to isolate a certain living agent immediately from the tumor ascites, but nobody succeeded. In 1950 Y. Hamazaki et al. have theoretically concluded that the tumor cell must contain a certain virus, because they have verified many fine granules of polymerized desoxyribonucleic acid in the cytoplasm which were demonstrated by Feulgen's reaction. And then, about a year later we and I fortunately succeeded in isolating and successive transmissions of a new virus (virus HST) from the tumor ascites and proofed sero-immunologically that the virus is nessesary to complete the transplantation of the ascites tumor successfully. Method of isolation. Mice which were transmitted intracranially with 0, 02 cc of the ascites, as a rule, died in a range of 5 - 6 days under serious brain symptoms with paralysis. The agonized animals were killed to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> <b>emulsion</b> of their brain which was diluted decimal with bouillon and centrifuged 2500 r. p. m. for 5 mins. By several successive intracraianlly transmissions of 0, 02 cc of supernatant from brain emulsion, the animals became very sensitive and paralysis disappeared. Transmitting it continuously (on the course of passage, filtration of the emulsion by Seitz's filter-plate was done once a time), we could obtain a fixed virus causes a certain meningoencephalitis in mice. The other case, we have immediately transmitted the ascites afresh into the abdominalcavities of normal mice. 4 - 6 days later, they suffered from the heavy ascites and gradually became very sensitive too. Their brains were made into emulsion {{in the same way as}} mentioned above and intracranial transnsmissions of it was done successively. Histological findings, 1) Mice inoculated with the ascites. Dissecting the cranial cavities you can find an unclean, yellow, thick foil on the pia mater. The tumor cells multiply limitlessly in and out of the brain. The meningitis takes place chiefly in the ventral surface of the brain and the dorsal surface of the midbrain. The glia cells, especially the subependymal fibrillary glia cells often multiply in enormous numbers and infiltrate near by. 2) Mice inoculated with the isolating virus. Similar histological changes, as above mentioned, could in miniature be seen. Especially, changes of the adjacent area of the lateral ventricle cavities and the edema of the brain parenchyma or the hydrocephalus interna often could be seen characteristically...|$|E

This was followed by a parametric study of the process parameters for CO 2 separation from natural gas in a rotating disk contactor (RDC) -based setup to evaluate the performance of a stable ELM. The results suggest that the retention time of the stable ELM in a rotating disc contactor increases with increasing amount of absorbed CO 2. The results support the fundamental development of the ELM process to achieve a high overall separation efficiency of CO 2 removal from natural gas with a relatively small contact time.
