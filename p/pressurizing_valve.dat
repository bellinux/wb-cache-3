5000|$|As {{development}} of Benson technology continued, boiler design soon {{moved away from}} the original concept introduced by Mark Benson. In 1929, a test boiler that had been built in 1927 began operating in the thermal power plant at Gartenfeld in Berlin {{for the first time in}} subcritical mode with a fully open throttle valve. The second Benson boiler began operation in 1930 without a <b>pressurizing</b> <b>valve</b> at pressures between [...] at the Berlin cable factory. This application represented the birth of the modern variable-pressure Benson boiler. After that development, the original patent was no longer used. The [...] "Benson boiler" [...] name, however, was retained.|$|E

5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} as she had {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a <b>pressurized</b> butterfly <b>valve</b> connecting them so that water could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.|$|R
5000|$|Part {{way down}} the stroke, the <b>pressurized</b> steam inlet <b>valve</b> is closed. The steam above the piston then expands {{through the rest of}} the stroke, while the {{low-pressure}} steam on the other side (bottom) of the piston continues to be drawn into the condenser, thereby maintaining the partial vacuum in that part of the cylinder.|$|R

Of the six valves tested, four operated within the prescribed operating pressure limitations.

5000|$|The <b>pressurized</b> {{steam inlet}} <b>valve</b> and {{low-pressure}} steam exhaust <b>valves</b> are opened. <b>Pressurized</b> steam from the boiler enters the top {{part of the}} cylinder above the piston, pushing it down, and the steam below the piston is drawn into the condenser, creating a vacuum below the piston. The pressure difference between the steam at boiler pressure above the piston and the vacuum below it drives the piston down.|$|R

Before engine is started it is purged with helium and fuel is <b>pressurized.</b> Then oxidizer <b>valve</b> is opened in a center of injector followed by fuel injectors arranged on a chamber wall. Hypergolic propellants spontaneously ignite on contact expanding to supersonic velocities and escaping through cooled nozzle extension.|$|R

That is why SGTR historically have been treated in a special way in the different Deterministic Safety Analysis (DSA), focusing on the radioactive release more than the possibility of core damage, as it {{is done in the}} other Loss of Coolant Accidents(LOCAs) ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present a}} {{technique}} for structural abstraction {{applicable to the}} domain of <b>pressurized</b> hydraulic systems. <b>Valves,</b> when closed, functionally isolate clusters of components; when opened, neighboring clusters are merged. A cluster can only be in the one of two qualitative states-stable, where pressures are equal throughout and no flow occurs, or unstable, where flow from high-pressure source(s) to low-pressure sink(s) occurs. Reasoning in terms of clusters is shown to facilitate the generation and explanation of plans for operating and troubleshooting hydraulic systems...|$|R
50|$|Air lift uses {{compressed}} air to lift water in operations such as dredging and underwater archeology. It {{is also found}} in aquariums to keep water circulating. These forms of lift were used as far back as 1797 in mines to lift water from mine shafts. These systems used single point injection of air into the liquid stream, normally through a foot valve {{at the bottom of the}} string. Gas lift was used as early as 1864 in Pennsylvania to lift oil wells, also using {{compressed air}}, via an air pipe bringing the air to the bottom of the well. Air was used in Texas for large-scale artificial lift. In 1920 natural gas replaced air, lowering the risk of explosion. From 1929 until 1945 about 25000 patents were issued on different types of gas lift valves that could be used for unloading in stages. Some of these systems involved moving the tubing, or using wireline sinker bars to change the lift point. Others were spring operated valves. Ultimately, in 1944 W.R. King patented the <b>pressurized</b> bellows <b>valve</b> that is used today. In 1951 the sidepocket mandrel was developed for selectively positioning and retrieving gas lift valves with wireline.|$|R
50|$|Most {{pressurized}} lubrication systems incorporate an overpressure {{relief valve}} to allow oil {{to bypass the}} filter if its flow restriction is excessive, to protect the engine from oil starvation. Filter bypass may occur if the filter is clogged or the oil is thickened by cold weather. The overpressure relief valve is frequently incorporated into the oil filter. Filters mounted such that oil tends to drain from them usually incorporate an anti-drainback valve to hold oil in the filter after the engine (or other lubrication system) is shut down. This is done to avoid a delay in oil pressure buildup once the system is restarted; without an anti-drainback <b>valve,</b> <b>pressurized</b> oil would have to fill the filter before travelling onward to the engine's working parts. This situation can cause premature wear of moving parts due to initial lack of oil.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} compact {{nanostructure}} based heat sink. The system has an inlet {{and an outlet}} valve similar to a conventional heat sink. From the inlet <b>valve,</b> <b>pressurized</b> deionized-water is propelled into a rectangular channel (of dimensions 24 mmx 59 mmx 8 mm). This rectangular channel houses a nanostructured plate, on which ~ 600 nm long copper nanorod arrays with an average nanorod diameter of 150 nm are integrated to copper thin film coated on silicon wafer surface. Forced convective heat transfer characteristics of the nanostructured plate are investigated using the experimental setup and compared to the results from a flat plate of copper thin film deposited on silicon substrate. Nanorod arrays act as fins over the plate which enhances the heat transfer from the plate. Excess heat generating small devices are mimicked through a small heat generator placed below the nanostructured plate. Constant heat flux is applied through the heat generator. Thermocouples placed on the heater surface are utilized to gather the surface temperature data. Flow rate and constant heat flux values are varied {{in order to obtain}} the correlation between heat removal rate and input power. In this study, it was proved that nanostructured surfaces have {{the potential to be a}} useful in cooling of small and excessive heat generating devices such as MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) and micro-processors...|$|R
40|$|Spacecraft surface {{charging}} {{can lead}} to arcing {{and a loss of}} electrical power generation capability of solar panel, or even loss of a satellite. The charging problem may be further aggravated by the atomic oxygen (AO) exposure in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which modifies the surface of materials like, Polyimide, Teflon, anti-reflective coating, cover glass, etc., used on satellite surface. These affect material properties, such as resistivity, secondary electron emissivity, photo emission, which govern the charging behaviour. These properties are crucial input parameters for spacecraft charging analysis. This research develops a new facility at KIT, based on a novel technique for generating atomic oxygen flux involving laser induced breakdown of molecular oxygen. High velocity AO in an evacuated nozzle is formed, where laser beam breakdowns molecular oxygen into AO injected through a <b>pressurized</b> pulse <b>valve</b> into the nozzle. The energy of AO is measured using Time of flight (TOF) technique. The generated AO flux is measured using Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). The Mass Flow Controller (MFC) inserted in oxygen gas supply line measures the net amount of gas being injected through pulse valve. The spectral analysis of AO production wavelength (777. 6 nm) is detected using a spectrometer. The relative abundance of generated species is observed using a Quadrupole Mass Analyzer System (QMAS). The developed facility produces AO of velocity 8 ～ 14 kms- 1 having the flux in the order of 1018 atoms/m 2 /shot. This flux is used to expose spacecraft surface materials for extended period of 10 years at 800 km, equivalent to exposure of satellite surface materials to atomic oxygen fluence for the normal lifetime of the satellite in orbit. This thesis develops a new method and facility for the measurement of resistivity of atomic oxygen exposed polyimide by using surface charge decay method. The resistivity measurement is performed in vacuum using the charge storage decay method at room temperature, which is considered most appropriate for measuring the resistivity for space application. The mathematical formulation and experimental facility are indigenously developed to measure resistivity as per space requirement. We introduce a new method to measure surface and volume resistivity together, which can be further improved to measure the secondary electron characteristics. The results show that the surface resistivity increases and the volume resistivity remains almost the same for the AO exposure fluence of 5. 4 x 1018 atoms cm- 2 on polyimide film. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 311 号 学位授与年月日:平成 23 年 3 月 25 日 1.

40|$|Some of {{the major}} space {{operational}} capabilities desired for modernizing and transforming our existing space infrastructure include: 1) in-space robotic assembly of modular structures, 2) routine spacecraft repositioning and rescue services, 3) use of formations of satellites that can perform functions not possible with traditional single large structures. All of these applications can make use {{of a new generation}} of highly capable micro-satellites. Advantages inherent with the use of small satellite formations include: - enhanced launch flexibility; on-orbit adaptability and reconfigurability; multi-mission capability; and mission longevity. These characteristics equate to greater responsiveness and increased performance requirements at lower costs. Specific applications well suited to small satellites include; space-based navigation and guidance for precision target tracking; high-bandwidth global communications for military forces utilizing space-to-space or space-to-ground laser communications; detection, and precise positional knowledge of enemy weapons of mass destruction (geolocation) using formation flying detector systems; formation satellite support of synthetic aperture radars; and precision proximity operations, to name but a few. Mobilizing these micro-satellites will require revolutionary propulsion systems designed for critical performance needs such as long-term maneuvers and precision control. The operational metrics to consider include reliability, safety, simplicity, and weight-constraints. The Hybrid Electric-Laser Propulsion (HELP) system responds to these needs. Modularity, compactness, use of a chemically-benign propellant, and the absence of <b>pressurized</b> tanks, <b>valves,</b> and high voltage supplies, make it an operationally preferable companion to small satellites for a wide range of on-orbit applications. The objective of our work is to demonstrate the feasibility of a HELP system combining features from current state-of-the-art electric and laser thruster technology with several new features developed by Design_Net Engineering. Short pulse-width Qswitched lasers have the ability to create super hot plasmas from a readily available, inexpensive, and environmentally benign propellant. The resulting plasma is contained and directed to provide uniquely high and scalable specific impulse and variable thrust. It also enables superior minimum impulse bit (MIB) and noise levels. The HELP system feeds propellant using a patent-pending system that ensures repeatability and efficient propellant usage. A simple “plug-in” interface to the host spacecraft bus can be easily integrated and robotically serviced onorbit. These features provide modularity, serviceability, and flexibility. The production of the HELP system will fill the current shortfall of cost effective enabling propulsion technologies for small satellite applications. Although some technological hurdles exist, they do not collectively appear to be “show stoppers”. This paper provides an overview of the status of current micro-propulsion systems, discusses associated problems and limitations of these systems in terms of key performance metrics and finally describes the HELP system, which is currently under development with support from DARPA...|$|R
40|$|Chronic pain afflicts an {{estimated}} 100 {{million people in}} the United States with annual costs exceeding $ 100 billion. Treatment modalities for severe chronic pain include implantation of an intrathecal drug delivery device (IDDD). Conventionally, these devices are of two types: passive, permitting the delivery of a single analgesic mixture at a fixed rate; or active, permitting variable delivery by virtue of a peristaltic pump. This thesis presents an implantable system for medication delivery from multiple reservoirs with micromachined components. These components permit the use of an architecture that can provide superior volume efficiency and permit complex multi-drug delivery protocols. The system comprises three main components: regulatory <b>valves,</b> <b>pressurized</b> reservoirs, and control electronics. Important design considerations for each of these components are emphasized. Piezoelectric microvalves were designed and tested for use with aqueous flows. Two types of spring pressurized reservoirs were also designed and tested for feasibility in an IDDD. Reservoirs were pressurized using springs fabricated from silicon and generated up to 80 kPa of pressure. Alternative reservoirs were pressurized using compressive metal springs and generated up to 18 kPa of pressure. A first-generation system was developed that demonstrated controlled diffusion into agar gel. Water flow was regulated from 0. 2 - 5 mL/day, and bolus delivery was demonstrated. A second-generation system utilizing a two-valve manifold with embedded sensors was used to independently regulate isopropyl alcohol flow at set rates between 0. 05 - 1 mL/hr. Both systems demonstrated liquid delivery at intrathecal flow rates using continuous and duty-cycle flow regulation. Outlet pressure sensors were used to detect acute catheter occlusions and disconnects. A smart refill port was developed to allow for power transfer rates necessary to recharge batteries during a reservoir refill session. Recharging at current rates up to 500 mA was demonstrated. The proposed valve-regulated architecture and two preliminary prototypes allowed evaluation of potential solutions to challenges for application of the architecture in an IDDD. Recommendations for future systems and plans for bench-top and in vitro testing are detailed. The proposed work may lead to a system that provides the functionality of commercially available implantable drug delivery devices with high volume efficiency, and the ability to independently regulate multiple medications...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{microfabrication}} {{methods and}} tools {{for analysis of}} heated cold-gas microthrusters are presented, {{with the aim of}} improving their reliability and performance. Cold-gas thrusters operate by accelerating pressurized gas through a nozzle. These thruster systems are very straightforward in both design and operation, relying on little more than a <b>pressurized</b> tank, a <b>valve,</b> and a nozzle. This makes them suitable for miniaturization, enabling their use on very small spacecraft. However, an inherent drawback with cold-gas thrusters is their low propellant efficiency – in thrusters known as specific impulse, or Isp.   This is {{compounded by the fact that}} when reducing length, the volume, e. g., that of the propellant tank, reduces with the cube of the length, meaning that the maximum amount of storable fuel reduces quickly. Hence, maximizing fuel efficiency is even more important in miniaturized systems. Still, because of their other advantages, they remain suitable for many missions. Schlieren imaging – a method of visualizing differences in refractive index – was used thrughout this thesis to visualize exhaust jets from microthrusters, and to find leaks in the components. It was found that effects of the processing of conventionally fabricated silicon nozzles, resulted in a misalignment of up to 3 °  from the intended thrust vector, increasing propellant consumption by up to 5 %, and potentially causing unintended off-axis acceleration of the spacecraft. Schlieren imaging was also used to verify that the exhaust from thrusters fabricated with close to circular cross-sections was well behaved. These nozzles did not suffer from the previous misalignment issue, and the shape of the cross-section decreased viscous losses. For applications requiring higher temperatures, a microthruster nozzle with an integrated flow sensor was fabricated from tape cast yttria stabilized zirconia. The ceramic substrate enabled heater temperatures of the nozzle exceeding 1000 °C, resulting in an increase in Isp  of 7. 5 %. Integration of a flow sensor allowed the elimination of couplings and reduced the number of interfaces, thereby reducing the overall risk of failure. Close integration of the sensor allowed moving the point of measurement closer to the nozzle, enabling improved reliability of the measurements of the propellant consumption. The temperature of the heater, in combination with the ion conductive properties of the substrate proved to be a limiting factor in this design. Two routes were explored to overcome these problems. One was to use the temperature dependence of the ion conductivity as a sensing principle, thereby demonstrating a completely new flow sensor principle, which results in better calibration, tighter integration, and 9 orders of magnitude stronger signal. The other was using hafnium oxide, or hafnia, as a structural material for high-temperature micro-electromechanical systems. This involved developing a recipe for casting hafnia ceramic powder, and determining the Young's modulus and thermal shock resistance of the cast samples, as well as studying the minimum feature size and maximum aspect ratio of cast microstructures...|$|R
