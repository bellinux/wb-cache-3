To access the final edited and published work see: [URL] printing onto laminates for use in high frequency applications (high frequency laminates) is challenging, due to the substrate surface roughness present after etching away the copper layer(s). This has a detrimental effect on interconnect losses as the frequency increases. In this paper, different surface treatments to reduce the surface roughness of a typical high frequency laminate (RO 3006) are investigated. In particular, the importance of matching the substrate surface energy to the ink to achieve a smooth coated layer for {{the case of a}} UV cured insulator is demonstrated. This is achievable within the parameters of heating the platen, which is a more flexible approach compared to modifying the ink to improve the ink-substrate interaction. In printing onto the surface modified substrates, the substrate roughness was observed to affect the <b>printed</b> line <b>width</b> significantly.

40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} of articular joints causing bone and cartilage destruction consequently leads to functional impairment {{or loss of}} mobility in affected joints from individuals affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Even successful treatment with complete resolution of synovial inflammatory processes {{does not lead to}} full reversal of joint functionality, pointing to the crucial contribution of irreversibly damaged structural components, such as bone and cartilage, to restricted joint mobility. In this context, we investigated the impact of the distinct components, including synovial inflammation, bone erosion or cartilage damage, as well as the effect of blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on functional impairment in human-TNF transgenic (hTNFtg) mice, a chronic inflammatory erosive animal model of RA. We determined CatWalk-assisted gait profiles as objective quantitative measurements of functional impairment. We first determined body-weight-independent gait parameters, including maximum intensity, <b>print</b> length, <b>print</b> <b>width</b> and <b>print</b> area in wild-type mice. We observed early changes in those gait parameters in hTNFtg mice at week 5 – the first clinical signs of arthritis. Moreover, we found further gait changes during chronic disease development, indicating progressive functional impairment in hTNFtg mice. By investigating the association of gait parameters with inflammation-mediated joint pathologies at different time points of the disease course, we found a relationship between gait parameters and the extent of cartilage damage and bone erosions, but not with the extent of synovitis in this chronic model. Next, we observed a significant improvement of functional impairment upon blocking TNF, even at progressed stages of disease. However, blocking TNF did not restore full functionality owing to remaining subclinical inflammation and structural microdamage. In conclusion, CatWalk gait analysis provides a useful tool for quantitative assessment of functional impairment in inflammatory destructive arthritis. Our findings indicate that cartilage damage and bone erosion, but not synovial inflammation, are the most important determinants for progressive functional impairment in this chronic erosive arthritis model...|$|R

The genetic program is an optimization method motivated by natural evolution, which generates a model that best predicts the effect of process inputs on outputs.

Simulation runs using the multivariable controller demonstrate its superiority over that of a conventional feedback approach involving single-loop control.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. With {{the emergence of the}} Internet of Things (IoT), wireless body area networks (WBANs) are becoming increasingly pervasive in everyday life. Most WBANs are currently working at the IEEE 802. 15. 4 Zigbee standard. However there are growing interests to investigate the performance of BANs operating at higher frequencies (e. g. millimetre-wave band), due to the advantages offered compared to those operating at lower microwave frequencies. This thesis aims to realise printed conductive traces on flexible substrates, targeted for high frequency wearable electronics applications. Specifically, investigations were performed in the areas pertaining to the surface modification of substrates and the electrical performance of printed interconnects. Firstly, a novel methodology was proposed to characterise the dielectric properties of a non-woven fabric (Tyvek) up to 20 GHz. This approach utilised electromagnetic (EM) simulation to improve the analytical equations based on transmission line structures, in order to improve the accuracy of the conductor loss values in the gigahertz range. To reduce the substrate roughness, an UV-curable insulator was used to form a planarisation layer on a non-porous substrate via inkjet printing. The results obtained demonstrated the importance of matching the surface energy of the substrate to the ink to minimise the ink de-wetting phenomenon, which was possible within the parameters of heating the platen. Furthermore, the substrate surface roughness was observed to affect the <b>printed</b> line <b>width</b> significantly, and a surface roughness factor was introduced in the equation of Smith et al. to predict the <b>printed</b> line <b>width</b> on a substrate with non-negligible surface roughness (Ra ≤ 1 µm). Silver ink de-wetting was observed when overprinting silver onto the UV-cured insulator, and studies were performed to investigate the conditions for achieving electrically conductive traces using commercial ink formulations, where the curing equipment may be non-optimal. In particular, different techniques were used to characterise the samples at different stages in order to evaluate the surface properties and printability, and to ascertain if measurable resistances could be predicted. Following the results obtained, it was demonstrated that measurable resistance could be obtained for samples cured under an ambient atmosphere, which was verified on Tyvek samples. Lastly, a methodology was proposed to model for the non-ideal characteristics of printed transmission lines to predict the high frequency electrical performance of those structures. The methodology was validated on transmission line structures of different lengths up to 30 GHz, where a good correlation was obtained between simulation and measurement results. Furthermore, the results obtained demonstrate the significance of the paste levelling effect on the extracted DC conductivity values, and the need for accurate DC conductivity values in the modelling of printed interconnects...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIndustrial silicon {{solar cells}} like Passivated Emitter and Rear Cells (PERC) {{typically}} apply a screen-printed (Ag) front {{contact with a}} single print process using a mesh screen. It {{has been shown that}} using stencils instead of screens improves the finger profile leading to slightly higher cell conversion efficiencies. However, so far stencil printing required an extra printing step for the busbars since conventional stencils do not support H-pattern designs. In this paper, we evaluate a novel “single print” stencil from ASM AE that allows to print busbars and fingers in a single print step. We apply the novel single print stencil to high-efficiency PERC solar cells and compare it to today's industrial screen printing processes (single print and dual print) as well as to a high performance dual-printed front side grid applying a stencil for the fingers and a screen for the busbars. The <b>printed</b> finger <b>width</b> ranges from 35. 8 ± 2. 3 μm for 30 μm stencil opening to 46. 7 ± 3. 4 μm for 40 μm screen opening which leads to an 0. 5 %abs increased metallized area on the front side of the screen printed fingers compared to the stencil printed fingers. The resulting average finger height is 22. 3 μm for the stencil groups and 11. 9 μm for the screen printed Ag finger which leads to a difference in the finger line resistance and an additional series resistance contribution for the screen-printed cells of 0. 05 Ωcm 2. We achieve almost identical PERC cell efficiencies with the single print stencil and the dual print stencil process obtaining best values up to 21. 1 % and average values of 21. 0 %. In contrast, both screen printed groups achieve 0. 2 %abs lower average conversion efficiencies mostly due to the lower Jsc and FF. The advantage of the dual print process compared to single print is shown in the increased Voc by 1 to 2 mV due to the used non-firing through Ag busbar paste. With these results we demonstrate that the single print stencil process saves two process steps compared to dual print using a stencil while obtaining the same PERC cell performance with an efficiency gain of 0. 2 %abs compared to today's industrial screen print processes...|$|R
40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} structures comprising both narrow line widths {{and high}} aspect ratios are indispensable components of many electronic devices. Producing them reliably on an industrial scale by inkjet printing of metal-based inks {{is a serious}} challenge. Firstly, due to spreading of the ink on the substrate, widths of 30 microns are currently the limit of any standard industrial inkjet technology. Secondly, the solid loads of conductive inkjet fluids are usually confined to a low volume fraction. Consequently, fine and high conductive structures are difficult to reach with single pass printing approaches. Here we report on a method which circumvents these limits by employing specific changes in the ink-substrate interactions during solvent evaporation. Freshly <b>printed</b> lines have <b>widths</b> {{in the order of}} 100 microns. Upon drying, these structures reproducibly shrink to very narrow (< 25 micron), though still continuous and highly conductive lines with heights of several microns. This results in aspect ratios of up to 0. 3, which are unprecedented for single pass inkjet printing. We propose a mechanism for this process which involves the sequential evaporation of the ink's solvents according to their vapour pressures. Since their volatilities correspond inversely with their respective polarities, the effective polarity of the material remaining on the substrate will continuously increase. A continuous movement out of the wetting envelope of the substrate is the logical consequence, resulting in ever poorer wetting, increasing contact angles and line shrinkage. cop. 2014 Society for Imaging Science and Technology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFlexographic {{printing}} is a high-throughput rotational {{relief printing}} method and represents a promising innovative approach {{for the front}} side metallization of silicon solar cells. The ability to realize narrow contact fingers with very low silver consumption makes this technology particularly interesting for busbarless solar cells with wire-interconnection like Meyer Burger's SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT). This study intends to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the general feasibility for this approach. Fundamental printing tests are carried out to investigate important influence parameters like the flexible printing plate and the correlation between printing pressure and contact finger width. We found out that contact finger elements on elastomer printing plates down to an actual width of wf = 7 ± 2 μm can be realized using a high-resolution laser-engraving process. Furthermore, we show that <b>printed</b> contact finger <b>width</b> increases by approx. Δwf ≈ 10 μm for each Δploc = 0. 05 MPa of pressure increase and thus has a strong impact on the contact grid. Busbarless Al BSF Cz-Si solar cells with flexo-printed front side metallization are fabricated and measured using Pasan GridTOUCH/SpotLIGHT-system. The best group of solar cells obtains a mean conversion efficiency of η = 19. 0 % and a maximum conversion efficiency of ηmax = 19. 4 %. A mini-module with the best two solar cells achieved a aperture conversion efficiency of η = 15. 8 %. Causes for cell-to-module losses are investigated and discussed in detail. In summary, we demonstrate the successful application of flexographic printing technology for the front side metallization of busbarless solar cells with multi-wire interconnection...|$|R
