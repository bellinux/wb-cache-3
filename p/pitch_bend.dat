A common wheel on {{contemporary}} keyboards is the <b>pitch</b> <b>bend,</b> adjusting the pitch of a note usually {{in the range of}} ±1 tone. The <b>pitch</b> <b>bend</b> wheel is usually on the left of the keyboard and is a spring-loaded potentiometer.|$|E

500|$|Before a Hammond organ {{can produce}} sound, the motor {{that drives the}} tonewheels must come up to speed. On most models, {{starting}} a Hammond organ involves two switches. The [...] "Start" [...] switch turns a dedicated starter motor, which must run for about 12 seconds. Then, the [...] "Run" [...] switch is turned on for about four seconds. The [...] "Start" [...] switch is then released, whereupon the organ is ready to generate sound. The H-100 and E-series consoles and L-100 and T-100 spinet organs, however, had a self-starting motor that required only a single [...] "On" [...] switch. A <b>pitch</b> <b>bend</b> effect can be created on the Hammond organ by turning the [...] "Run" [...] switch off and on again. This briefly cuts power to the generators, causing them to run {{at a slower pace}} and generate a lower pitch for a short time. Hammond's New B3 contains similar switches to emulate this effect, though it is a digital instrument.|$|E
5000|$|The size of {{the mouth}} (length, width and depth) is usually in {{proportion}} to the instrument's bore, depending on the model of instrument and specifically which original instrument is being copied (in the cases of recorders). Many mass-produced factory instruments feature a voicing of a rectangular or flat lozenge cross section. Such a flat and rectangular voicing however, produces a less-than-sweet tone and offers far less dynamic flexibility (<b>pitch</b> <b>bending)</b> than a flute embouchure. The recorder voicing was designed to limit <b>pitch</b> <b>bending</b> for a more stable tone with variations in breath pressure. Typically, a shallow ramp instrument, such as a tabor pipe, will allow faster register changes, <b>pitch</b> <b>bending</b> and [...] "flutey" [...] tone, while an instrument with a deeper ramp will limit fast register changes, <b>pitch</b> <b>bending</b> and produce a more [...] "reedy" [...] tone.|$|R

2500|$|DSP {{effects can}} also be {{controlled}} on the fly by physical controllers. Electronic keyboards often have two wheels on the left hand side, generally known as a <b>pitch</b> <b>bend</b> and a modulation wheel. The difference between these is that the <b>pitch</b> <b>bend</b> wheel always flicks back to its default position [...] the center [...] while the modulation wheel can be placed freely. By default, the <b>pitch</b> <b>bend</b> wheel controls the pitch of the note in small values, allowing the simulation of slides and other techniques which control the pitch more subtly. The modulation wheel is usually set to control a tremolo effect by default. However, on most electronic keyboards, the user {{will be able to}} map any MIDI control to these wheels. Professional MIDI controller keyboards often also have an array of knobs and sliders to modulate various MIDI controls, which are often used to control DSP effects.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{has many}} {{recurring}} musical elements, which unify and merge the parts into the collective whole. Common characteristics of most parts include ethereal background synthesizers, {{the use of}} echo and <b>pitch</b> <b>bend,</b> samples of nature and transport, and the punctuation of soft synthesizer loops by sudden flourishes of harmonious sound. The Deep South is variously represented using original pedal steel contributions from Graham Lee and emotionally charged samples of US radio broadcasts: an evangelist's sermon, a range of samples of a very intense salesman, and, in [...] "Madrugada Eterna", the detailed news report of a fatal road accident.|$|E

40|$|A {{physical}} modeling {{approach is}} used to investigate play-ing effects in woodwind instruments. This builds upon prior work concerning both empirical studies of the acoustics of the clarinet and extensive development of computer simulations of musical instrument systems. Specifically, explicit imple-mentations of two performance gestures for the clarinet are given and demonstrated: tonguing and <b>pitch</b> <b>bending.</b> Phys-ical modeling for the clarinet is briefly reviewed. Following this we show how both tonguing and <b>pitch</b> <b>bending</b> map {{to changes in the}} clarinet physical model itself and in the control parameter data. To our knowledge, tonguing in particular is one effect that has not been widely discussed in the literature, at least in the exact form we present.

50|$|Power {{invented the}} concept of 'Half-Valving' in 1980, and was a {{co-inventor}} with Will Scarlett of the 'extra-reed' concept for achieving greater <b>pitch</b> <b>bending</b> ability in harmonicas.

40|$|The aim of {{this piece}} was to explore {{differences}} between the natural overtone series and the even tempered scale. A further aim was to incorporate some melodic elements derived from music for the xiao, a Chinese flute that is able to inflect and shape melodic lines {{through the use of}} glissandi and <b>pitch</b> <b>bending</b> achieved through both fingering techniques and variation in breath pressure. I was introduced to the xiao when fulfilling a commission to write for an ensemble of Chinese instruments (Seeking Illustrious Virtue, 2000). In writing this piece, I constructed pitch sets and modes that imitate the proportions of the natural overtone series and use them both harmonically and melodically throughout. For much of the piece, a fundamental pitch is sustained as a drone allowing the pianist to undertake some exploration of natural harmonics of the same pitch (playing inside the piano). Through <b>pitch</b> <b>bending</b> and use of some quarter tone fingerings, the flute is also able to explore timbral variation between harmonic and natural fingerings...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} on the acoustical influence of the vocal tract in trombone performance. The experimental approach makes use of measurements at the interface between the player and instrument, allowing a relative comparison between upstream airways and the downstream air column impedances, {{as well as an}} estimation of the phase of the impedance of the upstream and downstream systems. Measurements were conducted over the full traditional range of playing, during sustained tones with varying dynamic, as well as in special effects such as <b>pitch</b> <b>bending.</b> Subjects able to play over the full range demonstrated significant upstream influence in the higher register of the instrument. These players were categorized in two groups according to their ability to control the phase of the upstream impedance and their ability to generate powerful downstream acoustic energy. Sustained tones played with varying dynamics showed a general tendency of a decrease in vocal-tract support with increase in loudness. Although <b>pitch</b> <b>bends</b> did not involve significant upstream influence at f 0, results suggest modification of the lip behavior during bending. Vocal-tract tuning at tone transitions was also investigated and found to potentially contribute to slur articulations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} that quantify {{the range of}} influence of vocal tract manipulations used in saxophone performance. The experiments utilized a measurement system that provides a relative comparison of the upstream windway and downstream air column impedances under normal playing conditions, allowing researchers and players to investigate the effect of vocal-tract manipulations in real time. Playing experiments explored vocal-tract influence over {{the full range of}} the saxophone, as well as when performing special effects such as <b>pitch</b> <b>bending,</b> multiphonics, and "bugling. " The results show that, under certain conditions, players can create an upstream windway resonance that is strong enough to override the downstream system in controlling reed vibrations. This can occur when the downstream air column provides only weak support of a given note or effect, especially for notes with fundamental frequencies an octave below the air column cutoff frequency and higher. Vocal-tract influence is clearly demonstrated when <b>pitch</b> <b>bending</b> notes high in the traditional range of the alto saxophone and when playing in the saxophone's extended register. Subtle timbre variations via tongue position changes are possible for most notes in the saxophone's traditional range and can affect spectral content from at least 800 - 2000 Hz...|$|R

50|$|Some controllers, such as <b>pitch</b> <b>bend,</b> are special. Whereas {{the data}} range of most {{continuous}} controllers (such as volume, for example) consists of 128 steps ranging in value from 0 to 127, <b>pitch</b> <b>bend</b> data may be encoded with over 16,000 data steps. This produces {{the illusion of}} a continuously sliding pitch, as in a violin's portamento, rather than a series of zippered steps such as a guitarist sliding their finger up the frets of their guitar's neck. Thus, the pitch wheel on a MIDI keyboard may generate large amounts of data which can lead to a slowdown of data throughput.|$|E
50|$|The You Rock Guitar, {{introduced}} in 2010 by You Rock Digital, combines a MIDI guitar controller/recorder with a patented touch-sensitive fingerboard and an on-board synthesizer. The instrument supports not only strumming and picking, but also tapping and sliding techniques, {{and provides a}} whammy bar for <b>pitch</b> <b>bending</b> and a modulation. Control panel software gives users control over 40 parameters, including velocity tables, string sensitivity, and synthesizer presets. The You Rock Guitar is used by guitarists such as George Pajon Jr. (Fergie, The Black Eyed Peas) and Josh Kelley.|$|R
50|$|Particularly {{notable for}} its unusual L-shaped construction, the stand {{runs from the}} halfway line on the south (Tannadice Street) side of the <b>pitch,</b> <b>bending</b> around the ground's south east corner, to end {{slightly}} along the east goal-line. The only seated accommodation at the ground prior to the post-Taylor Report redevelopment, it was known simply as the Main Stand until 2003, when it was renamed in honour of Jerry Kerr, the manager who had overseen its construction. The development of other parts of Tannadice has meant that this stand is now normally reserved for away supporters.|$|R
