500|$|As railroads {{became more}} developed, Billboard {{set up a}} mail {{forwarding}} system for traveling entertainers. The location of an entertainer was tracked in the <b>paper's</b> <b>Routes</b> Ahead column, then Billboard would receive mail on the star's behalf and publish a notice in its [...] "Letter-Box" [...] column that it has mail for them.

It was also used as the official address of traveling entertainers for draft letters during World War I. In the 1960s, when it was discontinued, Billboard was still processing 1,500 letters per week.|$|R

Barry and a couple of the other black paperboys reached the quota of 15 new customers yet were not allowed to go on the trip to New Orleans, a segregated city. The paper said it could not afford to hire two buses to satisfy Mississippi's segregation rules. Barry decided to boycott his <b>paper</b> <b>route</b> until they agreed to send the black paperboys on a trip. After the paper offered the black paperboys a chance to go to St. Louis, Missouri on a trip, because it was not a segregated city, Barry resumed his <b>paper</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

40|$|An IEEE 802. 15. 4 -based Wireless Sensor Network is considered, and the {{relationship}} between the IEEE 802. 15. 4 topology formation mechanism and possible routing strategies at the network layer is studied. Two alternative routing schemes proposed in the framework of the ZigBee Alliance are analyzed. The first is the well-known Ad-hoe On demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, which was designed for highly dynamic application scenarios in wireless ad-hoc networks. The second is a tree-based routing scheme based on a hierarchical structure established among nodes during the network formation phase. This latter approach, referred to as HERA (HiErarchical Routing Algorithm) in the <b>paper,</b> <b>routes</b> packets from sensors to sink based on the parent-child relationships established by the IEEE 802. 15. 4 topology formation procedure. An extensive simulation analysis is carried out to compare HERA and AODV. It is shown that a hierarchical routing scheme based on the MAC association procedures offers several benefits with respect to reactive routing in typical sensor network applications. Moreover, it is to be noted that most sensor network scenarios are concerned with delivery of packets from a series of static sensors to a single, static, sink...|$|R
