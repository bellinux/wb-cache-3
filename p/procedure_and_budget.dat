The present paper intends to investigate theoretically the negotiation process between interest groups and the fiscal authority in terms of dynamic optimization. The first half of the paper considers how <b>budget</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> institutions do influence budget outcomes. In particular we critically review theoretical contributions in the topics of sustainability problems, balanced budget policy, the ceiling constraint, and the transparency of the budget. The second half of the paper investigates dynamic properties of fiscal reconstruction by the infinite duration dynamic game among various interest groups with the framework of voluntary acceptance of tax burden. By comparing the first best solution, the open-loop solution under enforceable commitments, and the closed-loop solution without commitment, we explore the normative role of consumption taxes to internalize the free riding problem. We also derive explicitly the adjustment speeds of fiscal reconstruction under alternative solutions and examine the impact of consumption taxes on the adjustment speed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract There {{currently}} {{exists a}} {{demand in the}} United States {{for information about the}} environmental impacts of consumer products, but there is no consistent system for providing this information. This project proposes guidelines {{for the creation of a}} Type III environmental declaration program which will provide objective information about the environmental impacts of products based on life cycle assessment (LCA) methods. To more easily convey complicated information to consumers, the use of an original data presentation format, the “radar area graph”, was selected based on the results of a consumer survey. Because printed labels do not allow convenient product comparisons, a model internet website was created to demonstrate the potential of interactive product data. One original recommendation is an interactive personal database that allows consumers to track the impacts of their activities, thus making data more interesting and useful to consumers. Because evaluating products using LCA can be time consuming, we created a method of efficiently and consistently calculating environmental impacts. It includes guidelines for defining system boundaries and functional units, and for characterizing environmental impacts. Ten environmental impact category indicators were selected, and original methods were developed for characterizing land use and water depletion using spatial data. A spreadsheet calculator was created for determining human and ecological toxicity indicators. Finally, original software was developed to demonstrate the proposal for a common database of process and material parameters. To guide an administrator during the creation of a new Type III program, recommendations are provided for organizational structure, product registration <b>procedures,</b> <b>and</b> <b>budget</b> management for continued operation and growth...|$|R

The survey instrument focused upon 11 distinct areas of inquiry which indicate the manner in which chief student personnel officers perceive staff development programs in divisions of student affairs. Distinct areas of the questionnaire were demographic data, staff development defined, current active staff development programs, staff development policy, structure, focus of staff development, budget for staff development, frequency of staff development programs, factors motivating staff participation, program communication, and program and activity evaluation;The 2 x 3 factorial analysis of variance format was used to analyze continuous data and the crosstabs (Chi Square) format was used to analyze discrete data;A total of 402 questionnaires were disseminated to chief student personnel officers of comparable officials.

The efficiency of the element cycling process in wetlands is closely related to the proportional biomass allocation to above- and belowground organs. Therefore, the framework of most macrophyte productivity models is usually similar, with a mass-balance approach consisting of gross production, respiration and mortality losses, and the translocation between organs. The paper delineates how these growth models are linked with decomposition models to evaluate the annual cycle of elements. The model formulating <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> the material <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> translocation processes of two perennial emergent species, Typha angustifolia and Zizania latifolia, and the coupling of the validated partitioned growth model with the modules for decomposition based on a modified decomposition coefficient, are further discussed.
