25|$|A common {{application}} of a trie is storing a <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> or autocomplete dictionary, such as found on a mobile telephone. Such applications {{take advantage of a}} trie's ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries; however, if storing dictionary words is all that is required (i.e., storage of information auxiliary to each word is not required), a minimal deterministic acyclic finite state automaton (DAFSA) would use less space than a trie. This is because a DAFSA can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes (or parts) of different words being stored.|$|E

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the MSc in Computer ScienceAbstract T 9 Text Input is an input technology used in mobile devices. It lets words be formed by a single key press for each letter, {{as opposed to the}} multiple key press approach used in the older generation of mobile phones. It works via active reference to a dictionary of commonly used words. T 9 databases are currently available in 15 different character scripts in 62 languages including specialized language engines for Alphabetic, Chinese and Japanese languages. However it is not available for Sinhala. Development of T 9 is more valuable for Sinhala than English as the number of letters assigned to a key in the Sinhala keypad is more than that of the English keypad. / We developed a system for <b>predictive</b> keypad <b>text</b> entry in Sinhala. <b>Predictive</b> keypad <b>text</b> entry allows the user to type words efficiently just pressing a key one time for each letter. / The major objectives achieved in this project are the building of a Sinhala word database, identification of common words and development of the algorithm for <b>predictive</b> keypad <b>text</b> entry and an application for the T 9 PC simulator. We used the Sinhala keypad layout used in the Nokia mobile phones for our project. / A large number of Sinhala words were collected, several tools to process the words were developed and a database, mapping key sequences to prioritized lists of Sinhala words, was built. A PC application to simulate keypad text entry, update the database with new words and to change word priorities was developed. / Finally we compared the required number of key presses for Sinhala text input using T 9 and using multi-tap text entry, and showed that our system enables users to enter Sinhala text easily, quickly and efficiently...|$|R

40|$|Throughout the Late Babylonian Period, Mesopotamian astronomers made nightly {{observations}} of the planets, Moon and stars. Based on these observations, they developed several different techniques for predicting future astronomical events. The present study aims to improve our understanding of a particular empirical method of prediction, which made use of planetary periods – {{a period of time}} over which a planet‘s motion recurs very closely – to predict that planet‘s future motion. Various planetary periods are referred to in many Late Babylonian astronomical texts. By collecting together these periods and analysing their effectiveness, it was found that, generally, the most effective of the planetary periods were those which were used in the production of a particular type of text known as a Goal-Year Text. The Goal-Year Texts contain excerpts of astronomical observational records, with the planetary records having been taken from particular observation years with these planetary periods in mind – such that each planet‘s motion will recur during the same, specific, future year. It has been suggested that they form an intermediate step towards the compilation of the non-mathematical <b>predictive</b> <b>texts</b> known as Almanacs and Normal Star Almanacs. An analysis of theoretically calculated dates of planetary events showed that, if the Goal-Year Texts were {{to be used as a}} source for making empirical predictions, particular corrections (specific to each planet) would need to be applied to the dates of the planetary records found in the Goal-Year Texts. These corrections take the form of regular corrections to the day of an event (a ―date correction‖), and more irregular corrections of ± 1 month (a ―month shift‖). An extensive investigation of the Babylonian non-mathematical texts demonstrated that the observed differences in the dates of events, when comparing equivalent records in all known extant Almanacs and Normal Star Almanacs with those in the Goal-Year Texts, were extremely consistent with theoretical expectations. This lends considerable support to the theory that the Goal-Year Texts‘ records formed the ―raw data‖ used in the compilation of the Almanacs and Normal Star Almanacs. It was also possible to analyse several other aspects of Late Babylonian non-mathematical astronomy during the course of this study. These topics include the usage of particular stars in the <b>predictive</b> <b>texts,</b> the meaning of certain terminology found in records of the Babylonian zodiacal signs, and the specific issues related to the planet Mercury‘s periods of visibility and invisibility. Therefore, this investigation enhances many aspects of our knowledge of Late Babylonian astronomical practices. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
