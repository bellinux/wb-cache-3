40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{the effects of}} a bundle of workplace practices on business profitability in New Zealand, analysing data from the Business Operations Survey 2006. Results suggest that workplace practices explain 4. 8 %- 24. 4 % of variance in business profitability. Employer-employee collaborative workplace practices increase business profitability. Flexible job arrangements based on employer-employee collaboration have positive effect on business profitability but the effect is negative when decisions regarding work arrangements are made unilaterally. Workplace training has positive effect on business profitability in some industries, but this decreases when more than 50 % of employees participate. Non-performance based pay is the preferreable pay arrangement to increase business <b>profitability.</b> <b>Union</b> and collective bargaining coverage do not affect business profitability.

50|$|The Brilliance BS6 had a {{starting}} purchase price of 18,000 EUR, similar in price to established competitors like the Ford Mondeo and Volkswagen Passat. Brilliance {{was planning to}} market the car in America, but its price {{would have been at}} least $25,000, slightly higher than the already established Toyota Camry. Efforts to sell the car in Europe stalled after importer HSO Motors filed for bankruptcy in November 2009, in part due to the high price of the cars. According to automotive data provider JATO Dynamics, combined European <b>Union</b> <b>sales</b> of the BS4 and BS6 were only 502 units from 2007 to 2009, with only 46 BS6's sold in the EU in 2009. Sales ended in early 2010, but nonetheless, Brilliance appears to be back again, this time as Shenhua Motors GmbH.|$|R

5000|$|The first [...] "Art Union" [...] was {{conducted}} in New Zealand by the Otago Art Society in December 1877, Both individuals and organizations subsequently used them {{as a way of}} raising funds.The first national lotteries were established in 1933. They were known as [...] "Art Unions". Prizes were relatively small, and in the early Art Unions the prizes were quantities of alluvial gold. As an example, the [...] "Golden Treasure" [...] Art Union of 1935 had 200,000 tickets with a top prize of £2000 ranging down to an 11th prize of £20 plus 400 prizes of £2. The low returns tempted many people to (illegally) purchase tickets in overseas lotteries such as the Australian Tattersall's lottery. With Art <b>Union</b> <b>sales</b> declining, a review of lotteries was undertaken by the Second Labour Government in the late 1950s, and in 1961 the National Government introduced the Golden Kiwi lottery.|$|R

The empirical findings on the effectiveness of unions are remarkable: the presence of unions in the workplace is positively related to average wage and benefit levels, productivity, research and development investment and human capital investment, but negatively related to enterprise <b>profitability.</b> The <b>unions</b> in China do have “real” effects...|$|R

5000|$|Specialized bumpers, {{known as}} [...] "bull bars" [...] or [...] "roo bars", protect {{vehicles}} in rural environments from collisions with large animals. However, {{studies have shown}} that such bars increase the threat of death and serious injury to pedestrians in urban environments, because the bull bar is rigid and transmits all force of a collision to the pedestrian, unlike a bumper which absorbs some force and crumples. In the European <b>Union,</b> the <b>sale</b> of rigid metal bull bars which do not comply with the relevant pedestrian-protection safety standards has been banned.|$|R
