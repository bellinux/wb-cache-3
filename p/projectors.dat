50|$|Apart {{from the}} TV lift systems, {{there are also}} the related <b>projector</b> lift systems. These <b>projector</b> lift systems may be {{distinguished}} into two equipment groups. On the one hand there is the <b>projector</b> ceiling light, which vertically lowers the <b>projector</b> downwards from a suspended ceiling, and there are <b>projector</b> lifts for integration into tables or furniture. The latter moves the <b>projector</b> vertically upwards, out of the furniture or table. Both systems are mostly made from ultra light aluminium. Stable equipment guiding is achieved in most cases using scissors or special guides. A <b>projector</b> lift system is often driven by a tubular motor, or another electromotor, which moves a shaft accordingly. Then the lower platform which the <b>projector</b> stands on, can be lowered via special belts or chains. <b>Projector</b> ceiling lift systems are available as ultra flat versions right up to stage <b>projector</b> lift devices with a lift of 5m and more, and a load bearing capacity of several 100 kg.|$|R
5|$|On May 19, 2011, Islands of Adventure {{announced}} a major refurbishment of the attraction, {{with plans to}} re-master the entire ride film in high definition {{as well as to}} update the ride's mechanics and to replace the film <b>projectors</b> with Infitec digital <b>projectors.</b> The refurbished version of the attraction debuted on March 8, 2012. The ride was refurbished in time for the release of 2012 film, The Amazing Spider-Man. In 2013, the attraction at Universal Studios Japan underwent a similar refurbishment with 4KHD projections being deployed. The refurbished attraction opened on July 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The second version, with blue-green filters {{over the}} <b>projectors,</b> was trialled {{on board the}} {{corvette}} HMCS Chambly in May 1941. This gave better results as the filters removed the reddish bias to the lamps when at low intensity (lower colour temperature). The supports too were retractable, so the delicate <b>projectors</b> could be stowed away for protection when not in use. This second version reduced Chambly's visibility by 50% in most conditions, and sometimes {{by as much as}} 75%. This was enough to justify development of a more robust version.|$|E

5|$|The four-minute ride uses 85-foot IMAX Dome {{screens and}} Sony <b>Projectors.</b> There are 24 ride cars, each seating eight people, and {{approximately}} 2000 people can ride it per hour. The projection system uses four overlapping Sony SXRD 4K resolution <b>projectors</b> on each dome, using custom-made semi-circular fisheye lenses to project undistorted images {{at a rate}} of 60 frames per second (in comparison, most feature films project at 24 frames per second). The video is projected onto two dome screens which are made of 416 panels (each 4feet by two feet) and are approximately 80feet tall and 85feet wide. The animation in the ride uses computer generated 3D animation rendered by Blur Studio and Reel FX, rather than the traditional 2-D animation seen on The Simpsons and the queue and pre-show of the ride. The animation reference was provided by Film Roman, the animation studio that animates the series. Each car contains 12 speakers and a Dolby 6.1 surround sound, while the domes contain an additional 90 speakers.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{proposed}} a method for geometric calibration of a <b>projector.</b> This method makes use of a calibrated camera to calibrate the <b>projector.</b> Since the <b>projector</b> works inversely with a camera i. e., it projects the image instead of capturing it, {{so it can be}} considered as a reverse camera. The <b>projector</b> is calibrated {{with the help of a}} calibrated camera using two types of chessboard, a printed chessboard and a projected chessboard by the <b>projector.</b> The object points of the projected chessboard pattern are measured with the help of calibrated camera and the image points are directly acquired from the chessboard pattern to be projected. Then using these object points and image points the <b>projector</b> is calibrated. Once the <b>projector</b> calibration is done, the transformation matrices (from <b>projector</b> to screen, from camera to screen and from camera to <b>projector)</b> are determined which are used for the reconstruction of the 3 D geometry...|$|R

5|$|The use of Yehudi {{lights to}} {{camouflage}} aircraft by matching their luminance with the background sky was developed, in part, by the US Navy's Project Yehudi from 1943 onwards, following pioneering {{experiments in the}} Canadian diffused lighting camouflage project for ships early in the Second World War. A Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, had serendipitously stumbled upon the principle when he saw an aircraft coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish; {{he realized that the}} reflected light had increased its brightness just enough to match the background sky. The ships were fitted with ordinary <b>projectors</b> mounted on small platforms fixed to their sides, with the <b>projectors</b> pointing inwards at the ship's side. The brightness was adjusted to match the brightness of the sky. The Canadian experiment showed that such counter-illumination camouflage was possible, arousing interest in both Britain and America, but the equipment was cumbersome and fragile, and neither the Royal Canadian Navy nor their allies brought it into production.|$|E

5|$|In the {{diffused}} lighting camouflage project, the Royal Canadian Navy experimented with variable counter-illumination camouflage to match horizon light levels and minimize ships' silhouettes during prolonged arctic twilight. During the experiments, {{one side of}} the test ship was faintly illuminated by <b>projectors</b> mounted outboard. Results were improved with the use of blue-green filters, and then with a photocell to measure the brightness of the night sky. The ship's visibility was reduced, but the technology was inconvenient and never adopted in practice.|$|E

The original Zeiss-Jena projector was bought as a museum piece by York University for the sum of $1, subsequently dismantled, and placed into storage. More recently, the University has offered the mothballed projector to other planetaria seeking parts to repair their existing electro-mechanical planetarium <b>projectors.</b>|$|E
5|$|The concept behind {{diffused}} lighting camouflage was to project light {{on to the}} sides of a ship so as to make its brightness match its background. For this purpose, <b>projectors</b> were mounted on temporary supports attached to the hull. The prototype was developed to include automatic control of brightness using a photocell. The prototyped concept was never put into production, though the Canadian prototypes did briefly see active service. The Canadian ideas were, however, adapted by the US Air Force in its Yehudi lights project.|$|E

5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability.
