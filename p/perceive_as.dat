5|$|Foreign {{domestic}} {{workers and}} their supporters, including activists and employers, have periodically staged rallies protesting what they <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> discriminatory treatment {{on the part of}} the Hong Kong government. Grievances include discrimination, the minimum wage and the two-week stay limit at the end of a domestic worker's employment contract. According to the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor (HKHRM), foreign domestic helpers face discrimination from the Hong Kong government and their employers.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 American film {{directors}} Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order, {{a critically}} acclaimed documentary film which explores {{the world of}} conspiracy theorists - such as American radio host Alex Jones - who consistently expose and vigorously oppose what they <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> an emerging New World Order. The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) and hip hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E

5000|$|The {{literature}} {{has noted that}} [...] "inositol" [...] is sometimes <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> sweet and/or salty. In general, the inositols will be <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> sweet due to their equat-trans-hydroxyl pairs. The muco-inositol isomer is <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> both sweet and salty. It is <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> salty due to its pair of diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pairs. This pair of hydroxyl groups can form a dimer with the diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pair of the hydrated sodium-ion receptor.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that words like {{unpleasant}} and grating are often used to explain the sound of dissonance, all music with a harmonic or tonal basiseven music perceived as generally harmoniousincorporates some degree of dissonance. The buildup and release of tension (dissonance and resolution), which can occur on every level from the subtle to the crass, is partially responsible for what listeners <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> beauty, emotion, and expressiveness in music.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{equivalence}} principle guided {{the development of}} general relativity, {{it is not a}} founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the geometrical nature of the theory. In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow geodesics of spacetime, and what we <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> the force of gravity is instead a result of our being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of matter prevents us from doing so.|$|E

40|$|How {{are people}} who {{generally}} see others positively evaluated themselves? We propose {{that the answer to}} this question crucially hinges on the content domain: We hypothesize that Agency follows a “zero-sum principle” and therefore people who see others as high in Agency are <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> low in Agency themselves. In contrast, we hypothesize that Communion follows a “non-zero-sum principle” and therefore people who see others as high in Communion are <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> high in Communion themselves. We tested these hypotheses in a round-robin and a half-block study. <b>Perceiving</b> others <b>as</b> agentic was indeed linked to being <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> low in Agency. To the contrary, <b>perceiving</b> others <b>as</b> communal was linked to being <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> high in Communion, but only when people directly interacted with each other. These results help to clarify the nature of Agency and Communion and offer explanations for divergent findings in the literature...|$|R

However, {{this is not always}} the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.|$|E

Among the critics of Tismăneanu's early activities was philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu, who stated that they were incompatible with the moral status required from {{a leader of the}} Commission. However, Liiceanu endorsed the incrimination of communist regime and eventually the report itself.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{values of}} {{acoustical}} correlates of pretonic syllables {{adjacent to the}} one(s) <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> bearing secondary stress could predict such perception in Brazilian Portuguese (BP) data. In order to pursue this goal, a comparison is made between pretonic syllables <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> bearing secondary stress and those <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> not bearing it. According to the results, obtained by application of statistical analyses, {{it is possible to}} claim that variation in intensity and in F 0 in syllables <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> bearing secondary stress, as well as in adjacent syllables, can be taken as a robust correlate for data perception regarding secondary stress placement in BP. Variation in intensity and in F 0 in syllables <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> bearing secondary stress and variation in intensity and in F 0 in the other adjacent pretonic syllables seem to be complementary information for the perception of secondary stresses by BP speakers. The results point to relevant questions for further work concerning the rhythmic and intonational organization of Brazilian Portuguese. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

There is also a sizable tract of Basque natives in this group who have moved due to a Basque nationalist political environment (including ETA's killings) which they <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> overtly hostile.

25|$|For flat mirrors, {{the law of}} {{reflection}} implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance behind the mirror as the objects are {{in front of the}} mirror. The image size {{is the same as the}} object size. The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which we <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> a left-right inversion. Images formed from reflection in two (or any even number of) mirrors are not parity inverted. Corner reflectors retroreflect light, producing reflected rays that travel back in the direction from which the incident rays came.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} having Tajikistan {{in this article}} is {{primarily}} because the government of the country itself, is - or is seen to be - the source of claimed persecution of Muslims. (As opposed to coming from outside forces or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences. In actual fact, the government - with the apparent approval of the people - is attempting to keep the government completely secular (full separation of Church and State) to avoid what they <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> problems in other surrounding countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{perceived}} usefulness {{and perceived}} {{ease of use}} constructs have received widespread recent attention as predictors of the user acceptance of information tech-nologies. In this study, the perceived usefulness and per-ceived ease of use of user interfaces are modeled as pre-dictors of task accuracy, task latency and user confi-dence in decision quality. Results indicate that interfaces <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> easy to use enhance user productivity, in terms of more accurate decisions and reduced decision times. Inter&x <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> easy to use also contribute signQicantly to user confidence in decision quality. However, interfaces that are <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> more useful result in users taking longer to make decisions that are no more accurate. Furthermore, user confidence in de-cision quality is not promoted by interfaces that are <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> useful. ...|$|R

25|$|Such {{a stance}} of {{dividing}} blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components {{to be poured}} out onto the ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid per se is not the real issue. They say the real issue is respect and obedience regarding blood, which they <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.|$|E
