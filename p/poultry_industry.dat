5|$|Argon {{is used in}} the <b>poultry</b> <b>industry</b> to asphyxiate birds, {{either for}} mass culling {{following}} disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the agricultural, hunting/fishing, forestry, {{and mining}} {{industries}} made up 5.46% {{of the industry}} in Juniata County. Livestock farming was more popular in the county than crop cultivation. In 2002, the egg and <b>poultry</b> <b>industry</b> in the county generated $32 million in sales (the 7th highest of the Pennsylvania counties) and the dairy industry generated $17 million in sales (the 23rd highest of the Pennsylvania counties). The hog and pig industry generated $7 million and the cattle industry generated $4 million in sales (the 10th and 27th highest of Pennsylvania counties, respectively). The county's grain industry generated $1 million (the 35th highest of Pennsylvania counties). The county is the fourth most prolific poultry-producing county in Pennsylvania. In addition to the aforementioned industries, there are also small-scale clothing manufacturing businesses in the county.|$|E
25|$|The <b>poultry</b> <b>industry</b> {{produces}} {{a large amount}} of feathers as waste, which, like other forms of keratin, are slow to decompose. Feather waste has been used in a number of industrial applications as a medium for culturing microbes, biodegradeable polymers, and production of enzymes. Feather proteins have been tried as an adhesive for wood board.|$|E

25|$|Beak {{trimming}} in the <b>poultry</b> <b>industry</b> usually occurs without anaesthetic at 1-day {{of age or}} {{when the}} chicks are very young, but can occur at a later age if an outbreak of feather pecking occurs, and in some cases, birds may be beak trimmed on repeated occasions. Beak trimming is not permitted in the UK on meat chickens that are aged over 10 days.|$|E
25|$|Although Joseph {{fought a}} losing battle in the kosher meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>industry,</b> he managed to achieve some notable accomplishments, {{including}} the hiring of qualified shochtim, introducing irremovable seals ("plumba") to identify kosher birds, and setting up Mashgichim to oversee slaughter houses. He also took {{an active role in}} establishing the Etz Chaim Yeshiva—the first yeshiva on the Lower East Side, which was founded in 1886. (It was the forerunner of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary).|$|E
25|$|Farming of {{chickens}} on an industrial scale relies largely on high protein feeds derived from soyabeans; in the European Union the soybean dominates the protein supply for animal feed, and the <b>poultry</b> <b>industry</b> {{is the largest}} consumer of such feed. Two kilograms of grain must be fed to poultry to produce 1kg of weight gain, much less than that required for pork or beef. However, for every gram of protein consumed, chickens yield only 0.33 g of edible protein.|$|E
50|$|High-value {{agricultural}} crops {{grown in}} Isabela include monggo, tobacco, coffee, banana, and mango. Its livestock and <b>poultry</b> <b>industries</b> {{are also on}} the rise, especially dairy processing, hog production, cattle breeding, and commercial poultry raising.|$|R
50|$|Arthrospira is {{cultivated}} worldwide; {{used as a}} {{dietary supplement}} {{as well as a}} whole food; and is also available in tablet, flake and powder form. It is also used as a feed supplement in the aquaculture, aquarium and <b>poultry</b> <b>industries.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{economy of}} Canóvanas has {{traditionally}} relied on agriculture, primarily sugarcane and coffee. There {{was an important}} sugar mill located in the PR-951 from Canóvanas to Loíza. It belonged to Loíza Sugar Company, and then to Fajardo Sugar Company. However, the mill closed in 1965. In 1999, the structure was declared of historical importance by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico. There's also growth of minor vegetables and fruits, {{as well as a}} minor cattle and <b>poultry</b> <b>industry.</b> Most of Canóvanas flat areas are subject to occasional flooding and are used as pastures for cattle.|$|E
25|$|A major use of {{formic acid}} is as a {{preservative}} and antibacterial agent in livestock feed. In Europe, it is applied on silage (including fresh hay) {{to promote the}} fermentation of lactic acid and to suppress the formation of butyric acid; it also allows fermentation to occur quickly, and at a lower temperature, reducing the loss of nutritional value. Formic acid arrests certain decay processes and causes the feed to retain its nutritive value longer, {{and so it is}} widely used to preserve winter feed for cattle. In the <b>poultry</b> <b>industry,</b> it is sometimes added to feed to kill E. coli bacteria. Use as preservative for silage and (other) animal feed constituted 30% of the global consumption in 2009.|$|E
25|$|On August 30, 2007, {{a report}} by the United States Census Bureau {{indicated}} that Mississippi was the poorest state in the country. Major cotton farmers in the Delta have large, mechanized plantations, and they receive the majority of extensive federal subsidies going to the state, yet many other residents still live as poor, rural, landless laborers. The state's sizable <b>poultry</b> <b>industry</b> has faced similar challenges in its transition from family-run farms to large mechanized operations. Of $1.2 billion from 2002–2005 in federal subsidies to farmers in the Bolivar County area of the Delta, only 5% went to small farmers. There has been little money apportioned for rural development. Small towns are struggling. More than 100,000 people have left the region in search of work elsewhere. The state had a median household income of $34,473.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, Safeway {{formed a}} joint venture with Holly Farms <b>Poultry</b> <b>Industries</b> (now part of Tyson Foods) to open Holly Farms Fried Chicken in an effort to diversify into fast food {{restaurants}} and compete with KFC.

500|$|McClymont and Professor R. B. Cumming {{established}} the Poultry Research Fund Group at the Tamworth Adult Education Centre {{to facilitate the}} exchange of ideas between the university's rural science and agricultural economics departments and the <b>poultry</b> <b>industry.</b> [...] The group first met on 1 July 1963. [...] In 1967 McClymont was awarded the Australian Poultry Award {{for his work in}} poultry nutrition and with the <b>poultry</b> <b>industry,</b> particularly in the Namoi River region.|$|E
500|$|While at the university, McClymont championed his {{approach}} to farm and livestock production and sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. [...] Under his direction, the University of New England became a leader in ruminant research. [...] The Australian <b>poultry</b> <b>industry</b> recognized McClymont's contributions to poultry production with a special award in 1967. [...] After his retirement in 1980, McClymont continued {{to work with the}} agricultural industry in Australia and consulted with the United Nations and the World Bank on farm issues.

500|$|On April 13, 1934, the President had {{approved}} the [...] "Code of Fair Competition for the Live <b>Poultry</b> <b>Industry</b> of the Metropolitan Area in {{and about the}} City of New York." [...] The goal of the code was to ensure that live poultry (provided to kosher slaughterhouses for butchering and sale to observant Jews) were fit for human consumption and to prevent the submission of false sales and price reports. The industry was almost entirely centered on New York City. Under the new poultry code, the Schechter brothers were indicted on 60 counts (of which 27 were dismissed by the trial court), acquitted on 14, and convicted in 19. One of the counts on which they were convicted was for selling a diseased bird, leading Hugh Johnson to jokingly call the suit the [...] "sick chicken case".|$|E

40|$|The U. S. meat {{products}} industries have experienced increasing consolidation. It {{has been speculated}} that this has resulted from cost economies, perhaps associated with technical change or trade factors. It has also been asserted that increased concentration in these industries may be allowing the exploitation of market power in the input (livestock) and output (meat product) industries. These issues are addressed for the four digit SIC meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>industries.</b> Findings show that the beef and pork products industries tend to have similar structures, which differ from the <b>poultry</b> <b>industries.</b> None of the industries, however appear to have exhibited excessive market power, particularly when scale economies (diseconomies), and resulting reductions (increases) in marginal cost from output expansion, are taken into account. Also, technical change and trade (especially export market) trend impacts seem overall to have contributed to cost efficiency. Production Economics,...|$|R
500|$|Cooper's economy {{relied heavily}} on {{agricultural}} farming from its founding until the 1950s, especially on the growing of cash crops. In 1880, cotton, corn, sorghum and other crops were grown on over [...] of farmland. The county also produced large quantities of livestock, with almost 3,000 cows and 10,000 hogs grazing on land near Cooper. The logging industry began {{to grow in the}} region, and several mills were constructed, producing furniture and lumber. In 1886, the Santa Fe Railway built a line through the county, and the shipping of crops and lumber became a major business in Cooper. During the early 1890s, the livestock industry in Delta County struggled, with the number of hogs being raised dropping to half of what it had been the previous decade. However, the agricultural business boomed, with the number of farms in the area around Cooper increasing to 1,188, and the value of the farms doubled to $1,400 (equivalent to $ respectively in [...] ) each. The production of cotton tripled, and the <b>poultry</b> <b>industry</b> began to boom. Within the city limits, Cooper housed a hotel, a shoemaker, a grocery store, a wagon maker, feed stores, general stores, drug stores, and several cotton and oat gins. Delta County contained 18 manufacturing establishments, but they only employed 33 people. The average income for someone working in the region was $208 (equivalent to $ respectively in [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|Animal welfare {{groups have}} {{frequently}} criticized the <b>poultry</b> <b>industry</b> {{for engaging in}} practices which {{they believe to be}} inhumane. Many animal rights advocates object to killing chickens for food, the [...] "factory farm conditions" [...] under which they are raised, methods of transport, and slaughter. Compassion Over Killing and other groups have repeatedly conducted undercover investigations at chicken farms and slaughterhouses which they allege confirm their claims of cruelty.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>poultry</b> <b>industry</b> {{also plays}} a large part in the United States economy, both in {{domestic}} purchasing and through international demand.
