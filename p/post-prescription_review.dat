40|$|<b>Post-prescription</b> <b>review</b> of {{hospital}} antibiotic therapy {{may contribute to}} more appropriate use. We estimated {{the impact of a}} standardised review of intravenous antibiotic therapy three days after prescription in two internal medicine wards of a university hospital. In one ward, we assessed the charts of patients under intravenous antibiotic therapy using a standardised review process and provided feedback to the prescriber. There was no intervention in the other ward. After six months we crossed the allocation between the two wards. In all, 204 courses of antibiotic therapy were included in the intervention periods and 226 in the control periods. <b>Post-prescription</b> <b>review</b> led to proposals for modification in 46 % of antibiotic courses. Time to treatment modification was 22 % shorter in the intervention periods compared with the control periods (3. 9 +/- 5. 2 days vs 5. 0 +/- 6. 0 days, P= 0. 007). Patients included in the intervention group had lower antibiotic consumption than patients in the control group, but the intervention had no significant impact on the overall antibiotic consumption of the two wards...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the clinical course of patients {{and the quality of}} antibiotic use using a systematic and unsolicited postprescription antibiotic review. Seven hundred and fifty-three adult patients receiving antibiotic therapy for 3 – 5 days were randomized to receive either a <b>post-prescription</b> <b>review</b> by the infectious disease physician (IDP), followed by a recommendation to the attending physician to modify the prescription when appropriate, or no systematic review of the prescription. In the intervention group, 63. 3 % of prescriptions prompted IDP recommendations, which were mostly followed by ward physicians (90. 3 %). Early antibiotic modifications were more frequent in the intervention group (57. 1 % vs. 25. 7 %, p < 0. 0001), including stopping therapy, shortening duration and de-escalating broad-spectrum antibiotics. IDP intervention led to a significant reduction of the median [IQR] duration of antibiotic therapy (6 [4 – 9] vs. 7 days [5 – 9], p < 0. 0001). In-hospital mortality, ICU admission and new course of antibiotic therapy rates did not differ between the two groups. Fewer patients in the intervention group were readmitted for relapsing infection (3. 4 % vs. 7. 9 %, p 0. 01). There was a trend for a shorter length of hospital stay in patients suffering from community-acquired infections in the intervention group (5 days [3 – 10] vs. 6 days [3 – 14], p 0. 06). This study provides clinical evidence that a post-prescription antibiotic review followed by unsolicited IDP advice is effective in reducing antibiotic exposure of patients and increasing the quality of antibiotic use, and may reduce hospital stay and relapsing infection rates, with no adverse effects on other patient outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{antibiotic}} resistance in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) is a worldwide problem. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of an antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) by carbapenems restriction on gram-negative antimicrobial resistance in ICU. The study was designed in a 21 bedded general ICU of a teaching hospital with two wings (one and two) in Tehran, Iran. Carbapenem prescription in ICU 1 was restricted to only the culture proven multi-drug-resistant bacteria with the absence of sensitivity to other antimicrobial agents. Carbapenem had to be prescribed by a trained ICU physician with close consultation with infectious disease specialist and the clinical pharmacist posted in ICU. <b>Post-prescription</b> <b>reviews</b> and de-escalations were carried out by the same team on regular basis. Restriction policy was commenced in January 2011 in ICU 1. All documented infections and resistance patterns of isolated pathogens were recorded in both ICUs during two periods of 6 months before and 9 months after restriction policy implementation. During this study bacterial growth was detected in 51. 5 % of 1601 samples. Carbapenem administration was decreased from 6. 86 to 2. 75 DDD/ 100 patients day (60 % decreases) pre-restriction and post-restriction respectively...|$|R
