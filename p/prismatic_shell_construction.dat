Vekua considered very important to carry out investigations of boundary value and initial boundary value problems for such bodies, since they are connected with degenerate partial differential equations and, therefore, are not classical, in general. The present paper is devoted to cusped <b>prismatic</b> <b>shells</b> on the basis of the theory of micropolar elasticity.

Three-dimensional dynamical problem for <b>prismatic</b> <b>shell</b> with surface forces given along the upper and the lower faces of the shell is reduced to hierarchy of two-dimensional problems. The obtained problems are investigated in suitable function spaces, the convergence of the sequence of vector-functions of three space variables, restored from the solutions of two-dimensional problems to {{the solution of the}} original three-dimensional problem, is proved and the rate of approximation is estimated. © 2008 Bull. Georg. Natl. Acad. Sci. Key words: dynamical problems for thermoelastic <b>prismatic</b> <b>shells,</b> Fourier-Legendre series. Two-dimensional and one-dimensional approximations of three-dimensional boundary and initial-boundary value problems are often used when constructing mathematical models of complicated building and various engineering structures. One of the methods of constructing two-dimensional models for linearly elastic <b>prismatic</b> <b>shells</b> was suggested by I. Vekua in the paper [1]. In this paper Vekua considered a three-dimensional linear model of an elastic <b>prismatic</b> <b>shell</b> and expanding components of the displacement vector-function into orthogonal Fourier-Legendre series with respect to the variable of shell thickness the hierarchy of differential two-dimensional models was ob-tained. Various two-dimensional models constructed by Vekua were collected in his monograph [2]. The estimates of accuracy for the two-dimensional hierarchical models constructed in [1] first were obtained in the spaces of classica...|$|R

40|$|The present lecture {{is devoted}} to an updated survey of results {{concerning}} boundary value problems (BVPs) for systems of degenerate second order partial differential equations of hierarchcal models [1] of cusped <b>prismatic</b> <b>shells</b> [2]. A <b>prismatic</b> <b>shell</b> is called cusped one if its thickness vanishes on some subsets of the shell projection, e. g., {{on a part of}} the boundary. In Section 1 the uniqueness (in weighted Cκ classes) and existence (in L 2 classes) the-orems for Dirichlet and Keldysh [3] type BVPs when ∂h ∂n ∈ [0,+∞] (in the N = 0 approxi-mation) and ∂h ∂n ∈ [0,+∞ [(in the N ≥ 1 approximation) on the cusped edge is proved [4], [5]. Here n is the inward normal to the plate projection boundary. In Section 2 we construct hierarchical models which reduce the original three-dimensional BVPs for cusped prismatic shell-like elastic bodies to twodimensional problems [6], [7]. In the ”regular ” case (i. e., when the plate thickness does not vanish anywhere), the Fourier-Legendre coefficients of the displacement vector u, which solves the original three-dimensional problem in the spaceH 1 (Ω), automatically belong to the spaceH 1 (ω).

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Thin <b>shell</b> <b>construction,</b> an important and intriguing concept in contemporary architecture, has been used in many structures around the world. Famous architects such as Nervi, Toroja, Candela, Saarinen and Yamasaki have molded concrete into long spans of thin shell roofs. Domes, barrel vaults, conoids and free forms along with the newest form of <b>shell</b> roof <b>construction,</b> the hyperbolic paraboloid, constitute architectural concepts which have rapidly gained acceptance among architects and building owners. Thin <b>shell</b> <b>construction</b> began first in Italy and Spain, later spreading to the western hemisphere, notably Mexico. In the United States widespread application of thin <b>shell</b> roof <b>construction</b> has been hampered by the high cost of labor and materials required for the elaborate formwork. Building codes are also in need of revision to include provisions for thin <b>shell</b> <b>construction.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the possible potential use of portland cement mortar modified with latex and fiber glass as a covering material for thin shell structures.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper {{dynamical}} three-dimensional model for linearly elastic shells in curvilinear coordinates is considered and a hierarchy of two-dimensional models of the corresponding initial-boundary value problem is constructed. The well-posedness of the two-dimensional problems is investigated in suitable spaces and the accuracy of approximation of {{the solution to the}} original problem by the vector functions restored from the solutions of the reduced problems is estimated. Key words and phrases: Initial boundary value problems for elastic shells, model-ling error estimation. AMS subject classification: 42 C 10, 65 M 15, 74 K 25. The two-dimensional models of elastic shells are widely used for con-structing various engineering structures and hence investigation of dimen-sional reduction algorithms and justification of mathematical models of elastic shells is important both from practical and from theoretical point of view. In the paper [1] I. Vekua suggested a new method of constructing the two-dimensional models for <b>prismatic</b> <b>shells</b> in the theory of elastic-ity. In order to reduce the three-dimensional boundary or initial boundary value problems to two-dimensional ones, I. Vekua expands the components of displacement vector function, stress and strain tensors into orthogonal Fourier-Legendre series with respect to the plate thickness variable x 3 and multiplying the constitutive equations by Legendre polynomials and inte-grating them with respect to x 3 an infinite system with unknown vector function defined on two-dimensional domain is constructed. Then, consid-ering only the first N + 1 terms of the expansions and the corresponding N + 1 equations, a sequence of two-dimensional models of linearly elastic <b>prismatic</b> <b>shells</b> was obtained. Note that I. Vekua considered the three-dimensional problems and reduction algorithms only in the spaces of clas-sical smooth enough functions and did not investigate the relation of the constructed two-dimensional models to the original problem.

40|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of mechanics the box span of trestle bridges is non-diaphragm <b>prismatic</b> <b>shell</b> of multiple cross section of average length. Though many problems of static analysis of such structures have been solved, the development of analytical methods of calculating non-diaphragm box type structures on the vibration is an urgent task. The presented method for analysis of free vibration of non-diaphragm spans of box trestle bridges of multiple cross sections {{is based on the}} variation theory of <b>prismatic</b> <b>shells</b> of average length by V. Z. Vlasov. In this method the discrete-continuum design scheme, in which the mass of the structure is reduced to its nodal lines, is used. Equations of free vibration are variation equations and represent the work of internal and external forces in the possible displacements. The possible displacements are determined by the static approximation. The order frequency equation, obtained by solving the equation system of free vibration, coincides with the number of the vertical walls of the box span. For a split design scheme span the frequency equation is algebraic, and its components are calculated in analytical formulas. The method is illustrated by free vibrations of non-diaphragm box spans with four cross sections. As a result, the solution frequency spectrum and modes of vibration were defined. The advantage of the presented method of calculation is that the components of the frequency equation are calculated in analytical formulas. This method helps to study free vibration non-diaphragm box spans of multiple cross sections depending on changes in the design parameters. Application of this method will reduce the time and improve the design quality, and also monitor the results of structures analysis prepared with the help of computer complex...|$|R
