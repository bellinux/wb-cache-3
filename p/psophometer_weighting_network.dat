40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} Doppler {{frequency}} sidelobes control is addressed with reference to a WiFi-based Passive Bistatic Radar (PBR). In particular we show that the Ambiguity Function of typical WiFi transmissions usually yield a high sidelobes level which might strongly limit the detection capability of the PBR. Conventional <b>weighting</b> <b>networks</b> are shown to be ineffective against such Doppler sidelobes structures. Thus an innovative method is introduced to design effective <b>weighting</b> <b>networks</b> based on the solution of a constrained optimization problem. The performed analysis against both simulated and real data demonstrates that the proposed technique allows a significant improvement in terms of Peak to Sidelobes Ratio thus making the considered waveform more attractive for passive local area surveillance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focused on}} PSL (peak {{sidelobe}} level) reduction for subarrayed beam scanning in phased array radars. The desired GSP (Gaussian Subarray Patterns) are achieved {{by creating a}} subarray <b>weighting</b> <b>network.</b> The GSP-based method could reduce PSL of array pattern; compared with the method based on the desired subarray pattern which is defined by ideal space-domain filter, the PSL reduction performance is improved remarkably. Further, based on the concept adopting superelement patterns to approximately express original subarray patterns, the simplified GSP-based method is proposed. So the dimension of each matrix required for creating the <b>weighting</b> <b>network,</b> which was originally {{the same as the}} element number, could be reduced to the same as the subarray number. Consequently, we achieve remarkable reduction of the computation burden; simultaneously, the PSL mitigation performance is degraded slightly.

Experiments show the network trained with the available backpropagationbased algorithms can provide superior results to some other widely-used calibration techniques. ...|$|R
