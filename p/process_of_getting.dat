Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce {{on the grounds of}} desertion and non-support, and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Northrup, let alone that he had married her. The arrival of Hubbard and Northrup three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard's family, who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly. Northrup had no idea of Hubbard's first marriage or why people were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her that his parents were still married. She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard caught up with her and convinced her to stay, saying {{that he was in the}} <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> a divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Northrup was legal. The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947, where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines.|$|E
5|$|The detainees at Omarska had {{one meal}} a day. The food was usually spoiled and the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> the food, eating and {{returning}} the plate usually lasted around three minutes. Meals were {{often accompanied by}} beatings. The toilets were blocked and there was human waste everywhere. British journalist Ed Vulliamy testified that when he visited the camp, the detainees were in very poor physical condition. He witnessed them eating a bowl of soup and some bread {{and said that he}} had the impression they had not eaten in a long time; they appeared terrified. According to Vulliamy, the detainees drank water from a river that was polluted with industrial waste and many suffered from constipation or dysentery. No criminal report was ever filed against persons detained in the Omarska camp, nor were the detainees apprised of any concrete charges against them. Apparently, there was no legitimate reason justifying these people’s detention.|$|E

25|$|The mode of {{inheritance}} for A-T is autosomal recessive. Each {{parent is}} a carrier, {{meaning that they}} have one normal copy of the A-T gene (ATM) and one copy which is mutated.

25|$|ENIAC {{could be}} {{programmed}} to perform complex sequences of operations, including loops, branches, and subroutines. However, instead of the stored program computers that exist today, ENIAC was just a large collection of arithmetic machines, which had programs hard coded into the machines with function tables that each contained 1200 ten way switches. The task of taking a problem and mapping it onto the machine was complex, and usually took weeks. Due {{to the complexity of}} mapping programs onto the machine, programs were only changed after huge numbers of tests of the current program. After the program was figured out on paper, the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> the program into ENIAC by manipulating its switches and cables could take days. This was followed by a period of verification and debugging, aided by the ability to execute the program step by step.

40|$|Abstract — Several {{successful}} rational {{agents have}} been developed based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model. In these agents, output actions are usually limited to be primitive. The whole calculation <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> the actions must be represented in the plans. Thus, for complex cases, plan library {{may be hard to}} create and maintain. This will prevent further applications of the model. In this paper, we will introduce a Belief-Desire-Intention-Experience (BDIE) model, which incorporates experience functions into the basic BDI model. By this model, some successful algorithms can be involved into the plans of the agents. This provides a way to enrich the agent’s abilities without increasing designing difficulty. As an example, a vessel agent is created using this model. Reinforcement learning and global path planning algorithms are involved in the agent’s decision of navigation. The experiment results show that the agent is able to work well with the experience functions. 1...|$|R

S. {{political}} decision-makers {{decide to}} wage a moral war, {{it is not as}} easy a merely saying “go do it. ” To ensure moral targeting decisions, American national political leaders must suffer the costs of monitoring in terms of time and money, and provide not only detailed direction, but also constant oversight to ensure objectives are clear and subordinates carry out directions. Military officers must ensure that their motivations align with those of their principals, and they must ensure that constraining doctrine for planning and executing combat operations is followed. Having satisfied these variables, moral targeting decisions, wherein proportionality of non-combatant casualties is weighed against target necessity, should then be easily attainable. The <b>process</b> <b>of</b> aligning motivations with respect to desired outcomes, and the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> planning strategies according to doctrine together lead to moral targeting decisions.

25|$|There are {{currently}} three CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system) available. The first is Medtronic's Minimed Paradigm RTS with a sub-cutaneous probe {{attached to a}} small transmitter (roughly {{the size of a}} quarter) that sends interstitial glucose levels to a small pager sized receiver every five minutes. The Dexcom System is another system, available in two different generations in the US, the G4 and the G5. (1Q 2016). It is a hypodermic probe with a small transmitter. The receiver {{is about the size of}} a cell phone and can operate up to twenty feet from the transmitter. The Dexcom G4 transmits via radio frequency and requires a dedicated receiver. The G5 version utilizes Bluetooth low energy for data transmission, and can transmit data directly to a compatible cellular telephone.

25|$|Information Assurance (IA) is the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> {{the right}} {{information}} to the right people at the right time. IA adds business benefit {{through the use of}} Information Risk Management, Trust Management, Resilience, appropriate Architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized. It is strongly related to the field of information security, and also with business continuity. IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious hackers and code (e.g., viruses), IA practitioners consider corporate governance issues such as privacy, regulatory and standards compliance, auditing, business continuity, and disaster recovery as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in business, accounting, user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, security engineering, and criminology, in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of Information Risk Management.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases {{who are in the}} <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|E
