40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} new energy model that predicts the energy {{infrastructure}} required to maintain the oil production in the Oil Sands operation at minimum cost. Previous studies in this area have focused on the energy infrastructure for fixed energy demands, i. e., the <b>production</b> <b>schemes</b> that produce synthetic crude oil (SCO) and commercial diluted bitumen remained fixed in the optimal infrastructure calculation. The key novelty of this work is that the model searches simultaneously for the most suitable set of oil <b>production</b> <b>schemes</b> and the corresponding energy infrastructures that satisfy the total production demands under environmental constraints, i. e., CO 2 emissions targets. The proposed modeling tool was validated using historical data and previous simulations studies for the Oil Sands operation in 2003. Likewise, the proposed model was used to study the 2020 Oil Sands operations under three different production scenarios. Also, the 2020 case study was used to show the effect of CO 2 capture constraints on the oil <b>production</b> <b>schemes</b> and the energy producers. The results show that the proposed model is a practical tool to determine the production costs for the Oil Sands operations, evaluate future <b>production</b> <b>schemes</b> and energy demands scenarios, and identify the key parameters that affect the Oil Sands operatio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSingle Wagonload (SWL) {{is still}} a major {{component}} of the Swiss freight transportation system. To hold the market share of the SWL system a reduction of production costs and an increasing quality is needed. To evaluate alternative <b>production</b> <b>schemes</b> and the effects of technological innovations a simulation tool is necessary. Since there are no suitable tools available which cover all needs for a SWL simulation, the IVT developed a new agent-based tool called GüterSim {{on the basis of the}} existing software MATSim. GüterSim models the routing of the freight wagons, as agents, according to the routes in the real SWL network and the <b>production</b> <b>schemes.</b> It is a scalable model with two network levels and an integrated approach. This paper presents the following achievements: Modeling existing timetables and routing of freight trains; opportunity for improvements of train routings and schedules to optimize the existing productions scheme; integrating the capacity restrictions of the infrastructure to check the realizability of the improvements; automatic timetable generation on the existing network; and automatic generation of new production systems. A case study is presented to prove model's application. The work is based on real data from the SWL Swiss network which includes infrastructure data, schedules, rolling stock and locomotive data. Therefore the conclusions are based on real freight demand within the Swiss freight network. GüterSim is proved as a tool to improve SWL <b>production</b> <b>schemes</b> and scalable to other freight networks with fixed schedules...|$|R
50|$|The Megacorpstate {{has been}} {{successful}} in manipulating the oil prices around the world due to the relationship between the OPEC and the multinational giant corporations. Nevertheless, due to existing laws of member countries and market structures, it does not disclose itself as a separate and unique market. OPEC is already deeply involved with Megacorpstate. It is predicted that the organization along with other multinational organizations will unify and define the structures within the market with time. A parallel and opposing prediction exists that speaks about the disintegration of Megacorpstate due to the breakdown of OPEC. One way to diminish the chance of this prediction is to have a flexible oil <b>production</b> <b>scheme</b> of Saudi Arabia. If the country's petroleum production is adjustable, it can save OPEC from failing. Megacorpstate is undoubtedly a usual market structure. Nevertheless, it can include other sectors of energy in future besides oil and petroleum. A possible sector would be uranium industry. However, the possibility of formation of another Megacorpstate is highly unlikely as the market involves many complications and risks.|$|E
50|$|The preaching {{efforts were}} {{dependent}} on having {{translation of the}} books written by {{the leader of the}} ISKCON movement, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, and under the direction of Harikesa a new branch of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust publishing house in Sweden, and collected around him new members of the ISKCON movement who could translate the collected books to their respective languages. This was the time before desktop publishing, and just in the beginning of photo typesetting. Harikesa lead a group of his group of his followers to develop their own computerised desktop publishing computer equipment, to be able to produce all the different languages, which also included developing own phototypesetting fonts. With his idea, every new language got their own customised personal computer, which were transported or smuggled into the respective country, and the ready translated books were sent on diskettes to the publishing house central, where all the final steps of book production were performed. By this streamline <b>production</b> <b>scheme,</b> it was possible to produce a lot of titles of the ISKCON books, in a very short time, and with only a very lightweight core crew to do the actual book publishing work.
