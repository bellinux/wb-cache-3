25|$|The {{energy payback time}} {{is defined}} as the {{recovery}} time required for generating the energy spent for manufacturing a modern <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>module.</b> In 2008 it was estimated to be from 1 to 4years depending on the module type and location. With a typical lifetime of 20 to 30 years, this means that, modern solar cells would be net energy producers, i.e. they would generate more energy over their lifetime than the energy expended in producing them. Generally, thin-film technologies—despite having comparatively low conversion efficiencies—achieve significantly shorter energy payback times than conventional systems (often < 1nbsp&year).|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{solar cells}} in an {{integrated}} group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>module.</b> Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers. Solar cells are usually connected in series and parallel circuits or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual power boxes are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs (maximum power point trackers) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt diodes can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{proposes to}} study {{applications}} of frequencies studies {{to the case}} of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>modules</b> and <b>photovoltaic</b> plants. Such studies are little used in the photovoltaic field, so this project was aimed to determining if such studies could provide satisfactory results or not. The theoretical and experimental works presented here were performed within group E 16, department ENERBAT (Energy in buildings and areas) at EDF Research & Development between July and December 2010. The first part of this report presents the application of time domain reflectometry to <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>modules</b> strings. This method is commonly used to diagnose problems in transmission lines, but never in the case of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>modules</b> strings, therefore it was necessary to identify specific models of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>modules</b> to the application of this method. This method is aimed to ensuring the maintenance of a system, offering the possibility, when a fault occurs on a transmission chain, to quickly locate the fault, determine the type of fault and its magnitude. The second part of this report presents a harmonic study of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>modules</b> using Bode plots. Using this method, {{it will be possible to}} determine the evolution of characteristic constants of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>modules</b> (series resistance, parallel resistance, etc.) as a function of various parameters, especially illumination. This method will also lead to models of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>modules</b> more comprehensive than those commonly used, and will thus offer a solution to perform simulations taking into account more parameters...|$|R

2500|$|Several {{industrial}} and medical applications exist for silane and functionalized silanes. For instance, silanes {{are used as}} coupling agents to adhere fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers to certain polymer matrices, stabilizing the composite material. In other words, silane coats the glass fibers to create better adhesion to the polymer matrix. They {{can also be used}} to couple a bio-inert layer on a titanium implant. Other applications include water repellents, masonry protection, control of graffiti, applying polycrystalline silicon layers on silicon wafers when manufacturing semiconductors, and sealants. The semiconductor industry used about 300 metric tons per year of silane in the late 1990s. More recently, a growth in low-cost solar <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>module</b> manufacturing has led to substantial consumption of silane for depositing hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on glass and other substrates like metal and plastic. The PECVD process is relatively inefficient at materials utilization with approximately 85% of the silane being wasted. To reduce that waste and the ecological footprint of a-Si:H-based solar cells further several recycling efforts have been developed.)". , [...]|$|E
