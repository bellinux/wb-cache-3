40|$|Rules {{of origin}} {{form part of}} the {{traditional}} trade policy landscape. They are necessary for any government that seeks to distinguish between different foreign sources of supply of a product. This paper provides a basic introduction to the conceptual issues that arise in this area. It discusses both origin rules for products and producers, the latter being crucial {{in the context of}} trade in services, and summarizes the results of the economic literature with respect to rules of origin. The intention is to provide a `primer' to this increasingly complex area. The increasing attention being given to rules of origin by policy-makers and analysts is in large part a reflection of the spread of regional trade arrangements. Much of the analysis therefore focuses on <b>preferential</b> <b>origin</b> <b>rules.</b> Free Trade Areas; Rules of Origin; Trade in Services...|$|E

The aim of this Master´s thesis is to {{summarize}} information {{on the origin of}} goods, with focus on <b>preferential</b> <b>origin</b> of goods. Furthermore, the thesis aims to describe the Generalised system of preferences, compare its periods of development and analyze the future changes, including their evaluation. In the first part there are explained important customs terms. The next part describes non-preferential <b>origin,</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>origin,</b> with focus on the preferential system of the European Union, proofs of origin and cumulation of origin. The next part of the thesis focuses on {{an important part of the}} preferential system of the European Union, which is Generalised system of preferences.

5000|$|The {{definition}} of [...] "country of origin" [...] and [...] "preferential origin" [...] are different. The European Union for example generally determines the (non-preferential) origin country by {{the location of}} which the last major manufacturing stage {{took place in the}} products production (in legal terms: [...] "last substantial transformation").Whether a product has <b>preferential</b> <b>origin</b> depends on the rules of any particular FTA being applied, these rules can be value based or tariff shift based.|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} {{services}} is often {{one of the}} issues that regulators have to address to determine whether there is trade in services. It is also indispensable for the application of preferential trade commitments including national and most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment, among others. This article examines the relevant provisions to ascertain whether there are any defects in <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> for services of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and, if so, how they could possibly be handled. It concludes, first, that there is the twofold typology for the origin rules: general <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> and special <b>origin</b> <b>rules.</b> Second, four defects exist in general <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> for commercial presence, particularly the ownership or control requirement. They are insufficient to determine the origin for juridical persons of equal or scattered shareholding structure or services co-supplied by providers of different nationality. Neither are they always capable of identifying the economic service suppliers and the ultimate owner or controller of suppliers. Third, the application of the general interpretation rule leaves the meaning ambiguous. A substantial input test based on the value added criteria could be adopted as the supplementary means of interpretation...|$|R

The main objective of the thesis is to provide a complex summary of principles and rules for determination of origin of goods. A secondary objective of the thesis is to either confirm or rebut the assumption that origin frauds occur mostly in connection with non-preferential origin. The first part explains basic customs terms. The second part analyses non-preferential and <b>preferential</b> <b>origin</b> of goods. Last two parts focus on theoretical and practical aspects of origin frauds...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} authors have argued, quite convincingly, {{that the current}} country of <b>origin</b> <b>rules</b> are antiquated and should be change (Lloyd, 1993; Falvey and Reed, 1998; Ho, 1998). The main {{argument}} is that a single country of origin does not fit the reality of global production in the modern world. The logical conclusion is therefore the replacement of a single country of <b>origin</b> (SCO) <b>rule</b> by a multiple country of origin (MCO) description. Whereas a SCO rule is unavoidably arbitrary because of the global nature of production, a MCO description is only a factual, objective statement about the country of origin of the values added {{in proportion to the}} contributions by various countries (Ho, 1998; Lloyd, 1993). Lloyd and Ho have separately proposed tariff and quota regimes that accommodate the multiple country of origin reality and thus are free from the trade and investment diversion consequences that characterize single country of <b>origin</b> <b>rule</b> regimes...|$|R

40|$|This study surveys <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> {{applied by}} 192 {{regional}} trade agreements (RTAs) covering {{trade in goods}} notified to the GATT/WTO up to 1 November 2010. It {{takes into account the}} <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> that were notified to the WTO; whenever known and available, modifications to the original <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> have been updated. This study contains two basic features: a description of some key elements of <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> in RTAs, followed by an attempt to provide a reality-check of how these rules affect actual trade. That is done by an ex-post examination of data on the use of RTAs' preferences and, in their absence, of their margins of preference (MOPs). While the raison d' of <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> is the avoidance of trade deflection, the practice in RTAs has diluted this objective and it would seem that <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> are increasingly becoming an economic, political and trade instrument. In its descriptive part, the study identifies {{what seems to be a}} tendency to design stricter <b>rules</b> of <b>origin,</b> while detecting concomitantly the inclusion in modern <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> of flexibilities that provide, through the <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> themselves, a preference beyond the lower tariff rate resulting from the preferential treatment and mechanisms that allow the integration of third-parties into <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> regimes. The reality-check part of the study points to the fact that much beyond the coverage of RTAs, it is their effective implementation that poses a challenge to economic operators. Though data on the use of preferences is either not disclosed or inexistent, they are nevertheless available for some economies. On the basis of existing data of preference utilization, the analysis of the effects of <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> on <b>preferential</b> trade flows appears to give rise to a dual reality - namely a relatively high use of preferences in certain instances coexisting with preferences failing to attain their potential in other cases. As regards RTAs for which utilization rate is not available, the paper analysis <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> from a MOPS perspective, assuming that MOPs of at least 5 percentage points would offset compliance costs and thus provide a stimulus to comply with <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> in order to benefit from preferences. The analysis, made for 68 out of 192 RTAs, do not allow any conclusion regarding that generally presented hypothesis. Finally, the paper briefly outlines some suggestions for further action, including the launching in the WTO of exploratory work on <b>preferential</b> <b>rules</b> of <b>origin</b> within an open regionalism scenario...|$|R

Expansion of temporal and spatial scales reveals evolutionary patterns and processes that are virtually inaccessible to, and unpredictable from, short-term, localized observations. These larger-scale phe-nomena range from evolutionary stasis at the species level and the mosaic assembly of complex morphologies in ances-tral forms to the non-random distribution in time and space of the origin of major evolutionary novelties, as exemplified by the Cambrian explosion and post-extinction recoveries of metazoans, and the <b>preferential</b> <b>origin</b> of major marine groups in onshore environments and tropical waters. Virtu-ally all of these phenomena probably involve both ecological and developmental factors, but the integration of these com...|$|R
