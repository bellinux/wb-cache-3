Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the lower note of E3 to the higher note of D5. The lyrics begin with Kesha singing [...] "Stephen, Stephen, why won't you call me?." [...] The song's lyrics depict {{the tale of the}} singer stalking her then crush, Stephen, who ultimately would not call the singer. [...] "Stephen" [...] opens with layered a cappella and vocoder harmonies, later transitioning into a dominantly driven pop song. According to the singer, [...] "Stephen" [...] showcases her more vulnerable side and encompasses humor throughout its lyrics: [...] "'Stephen' shows the vulnerable side of me but it's still a funny pop song.

Club felt that Greer's vocals were {{the highlight of the}} episode, and affirmed that she effectively portrayed the unstable characteristics of Cheryl. [...] "Greer is mostly just asked to say crazy things as Cheryl, and that’s fun, but she steps it up here, playing both Cheryl’s insanity and the part of her that’s a spoiled trust-fund kid who’s found a day job and has to ride the subway with a dwarf that freaks her out." [...] Likewise, Ian MacDonald of TV Overmind proclaimed that the writers [...] "found a great way to expand on ISIS' most emotionally unstable employees"; [...] "Cheryl, whose crazy has been escalated to an almost extreme," [...] MacDonald stated, [...] "seems almost justified in her maladjusted-ness. She's a billionaire heiress who owns an ocelot and drinks glue [...] Humor involving insane rich people just no getting it is usually <b>pretty</b> <b>funny,</b> and if anyone can pull it off, it's Adam Reed and [...] Greer."

[...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people I know who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes.

[...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things or they have to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a <b>pretty</b> <b>funny</b> guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and I can give them to you and {{all you have to do}} is give me your soul".|$|E
500|$|Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post scored Deadpool three-and-a-half stars out of four, {{calling it}} a [...] "voraciously self-aware comedy" [...] and the first R-rated Marvel film [...] "with real teeth". O'Sullivan praised the film's {{attitude}} and tone, along with Reynolds for making Deadpool a likeable character, and the film's action scenes. TheWrap's Alonso Duralde said Deadpool [...] "shouldn’t work, but it absolutely does", feeling that it successfully balanced the comedy with superhero action, and that the chemistry between Reynolds and Baccarin gave enough weight to the plot to support the tone and violence. Calvin Wilson at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch also gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, and {{said that it was}} [...] "smart, sexy, and outrageous", but that it would not work without Reynolds. Peter Bradshaw gave the film four stars out of five for The Guardian, calling it [...] "neurotic and needy—and very entertaining", and comparing it to Kick-Ass and Kill Bill. He did feel that the film's villains were underused though. Writing for Uproxx, Drew McWeeny described it as [...] "the world’s most violent and vulgar Bugs Bunny cartoon", and praised the film's unconventional plot structure, its personal stakes, the difference in tone and storytelling from other superhero films, and the cast. Varietys Justin Chang said the film is [...] "terribly arch and juvenile [...] also startlingly effective", praising Reynolds' performance (and the film's willingness to hide his looks under prosthetics), the script, and director Miller for staying [...] "out of the way of his script and his star".

Like {{many of the other}} shorts, the climax isn't quite as funny as the buildup, but watching B&B get fat and lurch around a fast food restaurant proves rather amusing. Now, I can't help but wonder how they end up losing the weight. Perhaps they just popped in the music video for 'It's So Cold in the D' (from last week's ep.) and danced the fat away".|$|R

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse {{to see the show}} waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All <b>pretty</b> <b>funny</b> stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is {{based on the fact that}} you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isn’t a movie meant to scare or make you think but {{it is one of the}} most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that I’ve seen in years." [...] Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote that [...] "aside from some very clunky editorial missteps in the film's second half, there's a good deal of wit, enthusiasm, energy, and amusing attitude to be found in the dumb-yet-self-aware Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," [...] all while noting that he is [...] "not the type to act snobbish around a ridiculous film that obviously knows it's ridiculous." [...] According to Ryan Larson of Shock Till You Drop, the film [...] "is a mixed bag" [...] but [...] "fortunately, the lows don’t appear as often as you would think," [...] and, [...] "if taken at face value, Hansel & Gretel is well worth the view." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline, who criticized the film's inadequately [...] "limp" [...] marketing campaign, found the movie itself [...] "inherently stupid" [...] but in a good way, [...] "played with humor, ultraviolence and anachronistic fetish." [...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, <b>pretty</b> <b>funny</b> flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters a good movie? Probably not.
