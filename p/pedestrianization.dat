2500|$|Since May 2009, the {{portions}} of Broadway through Duffy Square, Times Square, and Herald Square {{have been closed}} entirely to automobile traffic, except for cross traffic on the Streets and Avenues, {{as part of a}} traffic and <b>pedestrianization</b> experiment, with the pavement reserved exclusively for walkers, cyclists, and those lounging in temporary seating placed by the city. The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010. Though the anticipated benefits to traffic flow were not as large as hoped, pedestrian injuries dropped dramatically and foot traffic increased in the designated areas; the project was popular with both residents and businesses. The current portions converted into pedestrian plazas are between West 47th Street and West 42nd Street within Times and Duffy Squares, and between West 35th Street and West 33rd Street in the Herald Square area. Additionally, portions of Broadway in the Madison Square and Union Square have been dramatically narrowed, allowing ample pedestrian plazas to exist {{along the side of the}} road.|$|E
2500|$|Under Bhadra Plaza Development Project, an {{initiative}} of the AMC and the ASI, Bhadra Fort was renovated and the open space between the fort and Teen Darwaza, earlier known as Maidan-Shah was restored.

The cost of the project is estimated Rs 115 crore. [...] A stretch between the fort and Teen Darwaza earlier known as Maidan-Shah was declared a pedestrian zone.

50|$|Urban {{villages are}} widely seen {{to provide a}} {{solution}} to the demise of community that is often associated with modernism and sprawl. The concept uses the social and physical morphology of the traditional rural village as an inspiration for creating better functioning communities. The urban village movement has been influenced by Ebenezer Howard’s Garden City ideals which also emphasize environmental determinism in relation to community. Urban design techniques such as public space and <b>pedestrianization</b> are employed to facilitate the development of community by encouraging human interaction. This philosophy shares many attributes with the new urbanism school of thought.|$|E

One of Lim's first decisions was to reopen the pedestrian-only section of Rizal Avenue, which has elicited complaints from shopkeepers due to decreased traffic of people, and from commuters which caused traffic jams on secondary streets.

50|$|Transit malls are instituted by {{communities}} {{who feel}} that it is desirable to have areas not dominated by the automobile, or as a way to speed travel time through an area - usually the city center - for transit vehicles and as a transport hub for interchanges, making them more efficient and thereby more attractive as an alternative to car use. Converting a street or an area to a transit mall can be a form of <b>pedestrianization,</b> allowing pedestrians and cyclists as well as transit vehicles to move more freely, unimpeded by private motor traffic, if autos are banned completely. However, some transit malls are not auto-free, but rather restrict cars and other private traffic to only short segments or only one lane, with other lanes being limited to buses or trams (streetcars).|$|E
