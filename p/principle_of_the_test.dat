40|$|We develop {{tests for}} the {{presence}} of common value components in bidders' valuations at symmetric first-price sealed bid auctions. These tests are fully nonparametric and require observations only of the bids submitted at each auction. The main <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> relies on the observation that the winner's curse is only present in common value auctions. In previous work, Guerre, Perrigne, and Vuong (1999) have devised a method for recovering particular functionals of bidders' latent signals in nonparametric fashion from data on bids. We build on this by noting that, under the common value hypothesis, the distribution of these functionals in strictly increasing (in a first-order stochastic dominance sense) in the number of bidders, whereas under the private value hypothesis these distributions should be identical across all numbers of bidders. This forms the basis of the tests that we propose. We develop the asymptotic distribution theory for our tests, and evaluate their performance in a variety of Monte Carlo experiments. We illustrate their use in a case study of the United States Forest Service (USFS) timber auctions. ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{an overview of}} using accelerated life testing (ALT) models for reliability estimation on mechanical components. The reliability is estimated by considering two test plans: a classical one testing a sample system under accelerated conditions only and a second plan with previous accelerated damage. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> plan with previous accelerated damage is testing the sample under step-stress. In the beginning (until time N 1), the sample is tested under stress s 1 (accelerated testing: s 1 >s 0); when the tested units have used many of their “resources,” the stress s 1 is replaced by the operating conditions s 0 (until the time N 2). Therefore, failure times under the accelerated conditions {{can be used to}} estimate reliability function in operating conditions. The time transformation function is considered as log-linear and four types of estimation are studied: parametric, Extended Hazard Regression (GPH), semi-parametric, and nonparametric models. The chapter is illustrated by a simulation example of ball bearings testing. The results are used to analyze and compare these estimation methods. The simulations have been performed both with censored data and without censoring, in order to examine the asymptotic behavior of the different estimates...|$|E

The new mark mingling and mark differentiation functions were then applied to Poisson point processes with independent and dependent marking and also to marked point pattern data from two forests. The analyses clearly highlighted that the new second-order characteristics, which are based on <b>the</b> same <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> comparing tree attributes as the traditional indices, significantly add to <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simple mark distributions.
