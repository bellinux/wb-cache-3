25|$|Instead of yeast, {{bacteria}} play {{a fundamental}} role in malolactic fermentation {{which is essentially}} the conversion of malic acid into lactic acid. This has the benefit of reducing some of the tartness and making the resulting wine taste softer. Depending on the style of wine that the winemaker is trying to produce, malolactic fermentation may take place at the very same time as the yeast fermentation. Alternatively, some strains of yeast may be developed that can convert L-malate to L-lactate during alcohol fermentation. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ML01 (S. cerevisiae strain ML01), which carries a gene encoding malolactic enzyme from Oenococcus oeni and a gene encoding malate <b>permease</b> from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. cerevisiae strain ML01 has received regulatory approval in both Canada and the United States.|$|E

50|$|The SgaTBA <b>permease</b> {{consists}} of three proteins: SgaT, SgaB, and SgaA. SgaT is a 12 TMS protein, possibly very distantly related to the MFS hexuronate <b>permease</b> of Escherichia coli (TC# 2.A.1.14.2), which presumably functions as a PTS IIC protein.

40|$|The {{filamentous}} fungus Neurospora crassa possesses two nonhomologous high-affinity phosphate <b>permeases,</b> PHO- 4 and PHO- 5. We have isolated separate null mutants of these <b>permeases,</b> {{allowing us to}} study the remaining active transporter in vivo in terms of phosphate uptake and sensitivity to inhibitors. The specificity for the cotransported cation differs for PHO- 4 and PHO- 5, suggesting that these <b>permeases</b> employ different mechanisms for phosphate translocation. Phosphate uptake by PHO- 4 is stimulated 85 -fold {{by the addition of}} Na+, which supports the idea that PHO- 4 is a Na(+) -phosphate symporter. PHO- 5 is unaffected by Na+ concentration but is much more sensitive to elevated pH than is PHO- 4. Presumably, PHO- 5 is a H(+) -phosphate symporter. Na(+) -coupled symport is usually associated with animal cells. The finding of such a system in a {{filamentous fungus}} is in harmony with the idea that the fungal and animal kingdoms are more closely related to each other than either is to the plant kingdom...|$|R
40|$|Metabolic {{diversity}} {{is an important}} factor during microbial adaptation to different environ-ments. Among metabolic processes, amino acid biosynthesis has been demonstrated to be relevant for survival for many microbial pathogens, whereas the association between patho-genesis and amino acid uptake and recycling are less well-established. Cryptococcus neo-formans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen with many habitats. As a result, it faces frequent metabolic shifts and challenges during its life cycle. Here we studied the C. neofor-mans tryptophan biosynthetic pathway and found that the pathway is essential. RNAi indi-cated that interruptions in the biosynthetic pathway render strains inviable. However, auxotroph complementation can be partially achieved by tryptophan uptake when a non preferred nitrogen source and lower growth temperature are applied, suggesting that amino acid <b>permeases</b> may be the target of nitrogen catabolism repression (NCR). We used bioin-formatics to search for amino acid <b>permeases</b> in the C. neoformans and found eight poten-tial global <b>permeases</b> (AAP 1 to AAP 8). The transcriptional profile of them revealed that they are subjected to regulatory mechanisms which are known to respond to nutritional status i...|$|R
40|$|The <b>permeases</b> of the Escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar {{phosphotransferase}} system (PTS), the sugar-specific enzymes II, are {{energized by}} sequential phosphoryl transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate to (i) enzyme I, (ii) the phosphocarrier protein HPr, (iii) the enzyme IIA domains of the <b>permeases,</b> and (iv) the enzyme IIBC domains of the <b>permeases</b> which transport and phosphorylate their sugar substrates. A number of site-specific mutants of HPr were examined by using kinetic approaches. Most of the mutations exerted minimal {{effects on the}} kinetic parameters characterizing reactions involving phosphoryl transfer from phospho-HPr to various sugars. However, when the well-conserved aspartyl 69 residue in HPr was changed to a glutamyl residue, the affinities for phospho-HPr of the enzymes II specific for mannitol, N-acetylglucosamine, and beta-glucosides decreased markedly without changing the maximal reaction rates. The same mutation reduced the spontaneous rate of phosphohistidyl HPr hydrolysis but {{did not appear to}} alter the rate of phosphoryl transfer from phospho-enzyme I to HPr. When the adjacent glutamyl residue 70 in HPr was changed to a lysyl residue, the Vmax values of the reactions catalyzed by the enzymes II were reduced, but the Km values remained unaltered. Changing this residue to alanine exerted little effect. Site-specific alterations in the C terminus of the beta-glucoside enzyme II which reduced the maximal reaction rate of phosphoryl transfer about 20 -fold did not alter the relative kinetic parameters because of the aforementioned mutations in HPr. Published three-dimensional structural analyses of HPr and the complex of HPr with the glucose-specific enzyme IIA (IIAGlc) (homologous to the beta-glucoside and N-acetylglucosamine enzyme IIA domains) have revealed that residues 69 and 70 in HPr are distant from the active phosphorylation site and the IIAGlc binding interface in HPr. The results reported therefore suggest that residues D- 69 and E- 70 in HPr play important roles in controlling conformational aspects of HPr that influence (i) autophosphohydrolysis, (ii) the interaction of this protein with the sugar <b>permeases</b> of the bacterial phosphotransferase system, and (iii) catalysis of phosphoryl transfer to the IIA domains in these <b>permeases...</b>|$|R
