The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the ability of the methods currently used by IDOT, to assess other methods for estimating pile capacity, to improve the methods if possible, and to determine resistance factors appropriate for the methods. This study reports pile load test data along with pile driving information and subsurface information, and uses this information to investigate and quantify the accuracy and precision with which five different static methods and five different dynamic formulae predict capacity. These static methods are the IDOT Static method, the Kinematic IDOT (K-IDOT) method, the Imperial College Pile (ICP) method, Olson???s method and Driven. The dynamic formulae are the EN-IDOT formula, the FHWA-Gates Formula, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) formula, the FHWA-UI formula, and WEAP. Three databases were assembled and used to quantify the ability of these methods to predict capacity. Results suggest that the three dynamic formulae: WS-DOT, the FHWA-Gates, and the UI-Gates provide similar accuracy. However, the WS-DOT formula is simple to implement and predicts capacity most consistently for the databases reviewed in this study. A value of 0. 55 is recommended for the resistance factor for redundant piling. ICT-R 27 - 24 published or submitted for publicationis peer reviewe...|$|E

Behavioral impacts of sound generated from these activities on fish typically have a greater area of influence than physical injury, and may therefore adversely affect a greater portion of the local population.

With ambitious renewable energy targets, <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> associated with offshore wind farm construction will become widespread in the marine environment. Many proposed wind farms overlap with the distribution of seals, and sound from <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> has the potential to cause auditory damage. 2. We report on a behavioural study during the construction of a wind farm using data from GPS/GSM tags on 24 harbour seals Phoca vitulina L. <b>Pile</b> <b>driving</b> data and acoustic propagation models, together with seal movement and dive data, allowed the prediction of auditory damage in each seal. 3. Growth and recovery functions for auditory damage were combined to predict temporary auditory threshold shifts in each seal. Further, M-weighted cumulative sound exposure levels [cSELs(Mpw) ] were calculated and compared to permanent auditory threshold shift exposure criteria for pinnipeds in water exposed to pulsed sounds. 4. The closest distance of each seal to <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> varied from 47 to 405 km, and predicted maximum cSELs(Mpw) ranged from 170. 7 to 195. 3 dB re 1 μPa 2 -s for individual seals. Comparison to exposure criteria suggests that half of the seals exceeded estimated permanent auditory damage thresholds. 5. Prediction of auditory damage in marine mammals is a rapidly evolving field and has number of key uncertainties associated with it. These include how sound propagates in shallow water environments and the effects of pulsed sounds on seal hearing; as such, our predictions should be viewed in this context. 6. Policy implications. We predicted that half of the tagged seals received sound levels from <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> that exceeded auditory damage thresholds for pinnipeds. These results have implications for offshore industry and will be important for policymakers developing guidance for <b>pile</b> <b>driving.</b> Developing engineering solutions to reduce sound levels at source or methods to deter animals from damage risk zones, or changing temporal patterns of piling could potentially reduce auditory damage risk. Future work should focus on validating these predictions by collecting auditory threshold information pre- and post-exposure to <b>pile</b> <b>driving.</b> Ultimately, information on population-level impacts of exposure to <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> is required to ensure that offshore industry is developed in an environmentally sustainable manner.

40|$|In this study, {{possible}} {{effects on}} sensitive seabirds are considered. Bird species {{most likely to}} be vulnerable to underwater sound are those that forage by diving after fish of shellfish. Diving birds that may occur in relatively high densities at the OWEZ location include auks, and possibly divers and seaduck. Terns, that feed by shallow dives are considered less vulnerable and mostly occur closer to the mainland coast. Several gull species may occur in the area in high densities, but they feed at the surface only, and are considered the least vulnerable. <b>Pile</b> <b>driving</b> took place from 17 April to 28 July 2007. The potentially vulnerable divers, seaduck and auks had largely left the area by the time the <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> started. Migration commenced early in 2006 and any birds still left in the area by mid-April would have been scared away by the shipping activities long before actual <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> started. Further mitigation of possible effects on sensitive seabirds included a ramp-up procedure that ensured that full hamming power was only administered after a period of low-energy blows that were unlikely to cause lethal effects on any birds still present. Furthermore, an underwater pinger, aimed at scaring off marine mammals, was put into operation 3 - 4 hours before <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> started. Visual observations before and during three <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> sessions failed to detect any of the seabirds deemed sensitive to <b>pile</b> <b>driving</b> noise {{in the vicinity of the}} construction work. Birds that did fly by the construction site (mainly gulls and terns) did not show a noticeable reaction to the activities. It is therefore concluded that effects of underwater noise on seabirds, though potentially detrimental, were negligible during construction of OWEZ. This was due to fortunate timing of the work and to appropriate mitigation measures...|$|R
