40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the parameterization {{of the structure}} of a miniaturized exponential UWB TEM horn antenna and its effect on the matching impedance and directivity. In addition, a microstrip balun that feeds the antenna was proposed in order to improve the <b>balance,</b> and the <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> for low frequencies. Both the antenna and the microstrip balun were simulated to obtain a final high performance model to be manufactured at a later time. The proposed antenna operates in a frequency range from 3. 2 GHz to 7. 5 GHz, meeting the standards established by the FCC and the ETSI for ultra-wideband technology. Moreover, based on these characteristics, the antenna have many UWB radar applications such as monitoring of structures (buildings, bridges, etc.), anti-collision radar, vital signs detection, and long-distance communications, {{as a result of its}} high gain around 15 dB...|$|R

5000|$|Balancing can {{be active}} or passive. [...] The term battery {{regulator}} typically refers only to devices that perform <b>passive</b> <b>balancing.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Return</b> <b>loss</b> {{is related}} to both {{standing}} wave ratio (SWR) and reflection coefficient (Γ). Increasing <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> corresponds to lower SWR. <b>Return</b> <b>loss</b> {{is a measure of}} how well devices or lines are matched. A match is good if the <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> is high. A high <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> is desirable and results in a lower insertion loss.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Return</b> <b>loss</b> with a {{positive}} sign {{is identical to the}} magnitude of Γ when expressed in decibels but of opposite sign. That is, <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> with a negative sign is more properly called reflection coefficient.

40|$|The use of {{high power}} high {{efficiency}} battery systems is increasing as {{the fields of}} personal electric vehicles and other fields requiring DC energy storage elements are growing. A typical battery pack consists of series connected cells {{that need to be}} monitored and controlled to achieve optimal performance. In this article the author previous work regarding <b>passive</b> <b>balancing</b> circuit is described and the performance of a <b>passive</b> <b>balancing</b> circuit is given and drawbacks are discussed. Another method of active balancing is proposed. The new method combines an active balancing method and a charger topology to develop an integrated charger-balancer solution.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of voltage unbalancing in series-connected {{multiple}} electric double-layer capacitors(EDLCs) is studied. Good understanding of this problem is {{required in order to}} increase reliability and stability of an energy storage system comprising EDLCs. Existing methods to settle voltage unbalancing cannot mitigate the problem enough for each cell, since most method have been applied to each module. For equalizing between cells, Zener diode which is one of passive method have been well examined in literature. However, Zener have well not used in balancing due to heating problem. In addition, It is difficult to choose Zener diode fitted rating voltage of EDLC, because of its internal resistance. Thus, we proposed <b>passive</b> <b>balancing</b> using Zener diode by analyzing parasitic element of Zener and EDLC. To experimentally confirm the balancing effect, we compared in two occasions which are with and without passive. As a result, proposed <b>passive</b> <b>balancing</b> circuit mitigated unbalanced voltage gap between EDLCs...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} {{as the first}} part of a two paper series that evaluate the efficiency of a battery pack with charger that has an integrated cell balancing method. For the first paper a simple <b>passive</b> <b>balancing</b> method is used while for the second an active shared transformer balancing method will be used. The paper first discusses the existing works on the subject of cell balancing efficiency. Further the results of experimental testing of cell capacity are provided. A previously designed modular <b>passive</b> <b>balancing</b> system is briefly introduced as it is used for the battery efficiency evaluation. Testing results reveal the battery pack efficiency with balancing as the difference between the energy that is required to charge the pack and the energy that can be obtained when the battery the battery is discharged. While the first efficiency test uses a laboratory power supply to charge the battery pack, the second efficiency test uses a prototype charger circuit. The same charger circuit with different secondary side is to be used for the second article. The prototype charger is required so that the efficiencies of both <b>passive</b> and active <b>balancing</b> methods can be reliably compared...|$|R

The fluorescent tube with different length and size is designed using Computer Simulation Technology (CST) software and the characteristics of antenna parameter are simulated throughout the software. CST was used to simulate antenna parameters such as <b>return</b> <b>loss,</b> resonant frequency, gain and directivity. Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) was used to measure the <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of plasma antenna in order to validate the simulation results.

30|$|The bench {{tests were}} {{conducted}} at the INPEs’ Aerospace Engineering Division (DEA) laboratory with an Agilent E 8362 B network analyzer, adjusted with a calibration offset to remove {{the effect of the}} cables and their connectors. The measurements of S parameters (basically insertion <b>loss</b> and <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of the ports) were conducted in two steps. First, we measured the impedance match of the 3 -step circular-to-square waveguide transition using a circular waveguide-to coax adapter with a SMA probe in the place of the Multiple Injector Noise Source Assembly (MINSA) assembly shown in Fig.  2. A <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of about − 40  dB was found within 200  MHz of the proposed center frequency of 5  GHz. This <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> was accounted for as an additional calibration offset during the measurement of the overall <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> of the OMT. Second, using the above measurement as a calibration offset, we obtained a <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> below − 30  dB for the entire OMT. The measurements for port 1 at 4.9, 5.0, and 5.1  GHz are plotted in Fig.  5 together with simulated profiles for the two possible polarization modes (labelled as S 11 and S 22). Similar <b>return</b> <b>losses</b> were obtained at the SMA probes of the rectangular waveguide-to-coax adapters labelled 10 in Fig.  2. During the tests, all open ports were filled with microwave absorbers. The experimental points became indistinguishable from the simulation curves for these two polarization modes once the tuning back-short was properly adjusted through several iterative steps.|$|R
50|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). Unfortunately, there is no easy, non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, <b>return</b> <b>loss.</b> <b>Return</b> <b>loss</b> by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> with frequency. The minimum <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> so measured is called the structural <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> (SRL). SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. The measurement must also be carried out at all in-band frequencies to be significant. The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to quarter wave impedance transformer action.|$|R
