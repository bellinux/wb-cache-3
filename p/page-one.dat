2500|$|There {{has been}} several {{reviews of the}} Encyclopedia. One of the harshest criticisms came from the American Library Association in 1987: [...] "The board {{considers}} the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential a problematic monument to idiosyncrasy, confusion, and obfuscation that certainly is not worth purchasing at any price."

The work itself is keen on presenting, in various places, disclaimers, reservations or warning texts that anticipate criticisms and explain the strengths and weaknesses of its approaches, including the failure to advocate a position, or the sometimes excessive complexity in its methods or language. Most reviews are laudatory, however. Richard Slaughter emphasized that the significance of the work is not its size or the scope of its references, impressive though these are. It is rather in the nature of what has been attempted.

5000|$|From the Sundance Program Description:"With the Internet surpassing print as {{our main}} news source, and {{newspapers}} going bankrupt, ...

The film deftly makes {{a beeline for}} {{the eye of the storm}} or, depending on how you look at it, the inner sanctum of the media, gaining unprecedented access to the New York Times newsroom for a year. At the media desk, a dialectical play-within-a-play transpires as writers like salty David Carr track print journalism’s metamorphosis even as their own paper struggles to stay vital and solvent, publishing material from WikiLeaks and encouraging writers to connect more directly with their audience. Meanwhile, rigorous journalism—including vibrant cross-cubicle debate and collaboration, tenacious jockeying for on-record quotes, and skillful <b>page-one</b> pitching—is alive and well. The resources, intellectual capital, stamina, and self-awareness mobilized when it counts attest there are no shortcuts when analyzing and reporting complex truths." ...|$|E

Back in Los Angeles, he did a <b>page-one</b> rewrite of William Wisher’s script for a prequel to The Exorcist for Morgan Creek Productions, producing a screenplay that attracted the legendary John Frankenheimer to direct, Liam Neeson to star, and the famed cinematographer Vittorio Storaro to shoot.
