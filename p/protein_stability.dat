40|$|Eugene Shakhnovich, professor, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, {{presented}} {{a lecture on}} Tuesday, February 15, 2011 from 11 : 00 am to 12 : 00 pm in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building, Room 1116 E. Runtime: 77 : 12 minutes. Modern Biology is deeply rooted in Darwinian principles of mutations and selection. Population Genetics aims to address the effects of mutations and selection on populations in a quantitative way within the basic paradigm of ‘’fitness landscape’’, which postulates how genotypicchanges affect phenotype (e. g., fitness or growth rate of an organism or a tissue). No clear connection between the fitness effects of mutations and their effect on molecular properties of proteins has been systematically established – proteins are still treated as ‘’black boxes’’ in most population and organism level studies of evolution. In this talk I will present a systematic theoretical and experimental effort in our lab to go beyond this paradigm by developing multiscale models which relate molecular properties of proteins (their folding, function and interactions) to fitness of carrier organisms. By analyzing such models (both in simulations and analytically) we derived distribution of <b>proteins</b> <b>stabilities</b> which {{is very close to}} experimentally observed ones and predict its dependence of mutation rates and population size, linking ecology and molecular biophysics. Further we predicted and found correlation between <b>protein</b> <b>stabilities</b> and their abundances in cells as well as between protein abundances and strength of their interactions with other proteins. We discovered a universal physics-based speed limit on mutation rates in all organisms – ~ 6 missense mutations per essential part of the genome per replication. Further, we systematically experimentally probe fitness landscape by making controllable biophysical changes in <b>proteins</b> (varying <b>stability</b> and folding rates by mutations and abundances by manipulating upstream regions) with subsequent incorporation of mutant genes into E. coli chromosome and evaluating fitness of mutant strains in competition with wild-type. Our experiments confirm basic features of physics-based fitness landscape and add important new insights on how to make them more comprehensive and accurate...|$|R

Composed primarily of mannose and proteins, with some glucose, mannoproteins are often bound in the cell wall of yeast with hydrophobic aroma compounds that become volatilized as the cell wall breaks down. Not only does the release of mannoproteins impart sensory changes in the wine but they can contribute to tartrate and <b>protein</b> <b>stability,</b> help enhance the body and mouthfeel of the wine as well as decrease the perception of bitterness and astringency of tannins.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{inference}} is {{the method}} that many have argued {{is the most}} accurate. In general, Bayesian statistical methods allow investigators to combine pre-existing information with new hypothesis. In the case of evolution, it combines {{the likelihood of the}} data observed with the likelihood that the events happened in the order they did, while recognizing the potential for error and uncertainty. Overall, it is the most accurate method for reconstructing ancestral genetic sequences, as well as <b>protein</b> <b>stability.</b> Unlike the other two methods, Bayesian inference yields a distribution of possible trees, allowing for more accurate and easily interpretable estimates of the variance of possible outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Physics-based energy {{calculations}} aim {{to capture}} the interatomic interactions that are physically responsible for <b>protein</b> <b>stability</b> in solution, especially van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. These calculations are performed using a molecular mechanics force field; proteins are normally too large even for semi-empirical quantum mechanics-based calculations. The use of these methods {{is based on the}} energy landscape hypothesis of protein folding, which predicts that a protein's native state is also its energy minimum. Such methods usually employ implicit solvation, which provides a continuous approximation of a solvent bath for a single protein molecule without necessitating the explicit representation of individual solvent molecules. A force field specifically constructed for model assessment is known as the Effective Force Field (EFF) and is based on atomic parameters from CHARMM.|$|E

The pyridine nucleotide NADP (one of the substrates in the enzyme reaction) already protected glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity at concentrations below 0. 2 mM, whereas NAD was not effective. An excellent stabilization of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase was achieved by the simultaneous addition of NADP and inorganic phosphate. Interactions of various ligands with different binding sites of the same enzyme can affect the susceptibility to proteolysis in a complex manner.

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{there have}} been several {{experimental}} reports of <b>proteins</b> displaying appreciable <b>stability</b> gains through mutation of one or two amino acid residues. Here, we employ a simple theoretical model to quickly screen mutant structures for increased thermostability through optimization of the protein's electrostatic surface. Our results are able to reproduce the experimental observation that elimination of like-charge repulsions and creation of opposite-charge attractions on the protein surface is an efficient method to confer thermostability to a mesophilic protein. Using Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics, we calculate relative <b>protein</b> <b>stabilities</b> for the exhaustive surface mutagenesis of the cold shock, RNase T 1, and CheY proteins. Comparison with 25 experimentally characterized cold shock protein mutants reveals an average correlation of 0. 86. The model is also quantitatively accurate when reproducing the experimental D 49 A and D 49 H mutant stabilities of RNase T 1. This work represents the first comprehensive in silico screening of mutant candidates likely to confer thermostability to mesophilic proteins through optimization of surface electrostatics. Systematic single mutant, followed by double mutant, screening yields a limited number of mutant structures displaying significant stability gains suitable for subsequent experimental characterization...|$|R
25|$|SUMO {{modification}} of proteins has many functions. Among {{the most frequent}} and best studied are <b>protein</b> <b>stability,</b> nuclear-cytosolic transport, and transcriptional regulation. Typically, {{only a small fraction}} of a given protein is SUMOylated and this modification is rapidly reversed by the action of deSUMOylating enzymes. SUMOylation of target proteins has been shown to cause a number of different outcomes including altered localization and binding partners. The SUMO-1 {{modification of}} RanGAP1 (the first identified SUMO substrate) leads to its trafficking from cytosol to nuclear pore complex. The SUMO modification of hNinein leads to its movement from the centrosome to the nucleus. In many cases, SUMO modification of transcriptional regulators correlates with inhibition of transcription. One can refer to the GeneRIFs of the SUMO proteins, e.g. human SUMO-1, to find out more.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} retinal {{molecular}} pathway defects have been matched to multiple known RP gene mutations. Mutations in the rhodopsin gene, {{which is responsible}} for the majority of autosomal-dominantly inherited RP cases, disrupts the rod-opsin protein essential for translating light into decipherable electrical signals within the phototransduction cascade of the central nervous system. Defects in the activity of this G-protein-coupled receptor are classified into distinct classes that depend on the specific folding abnormality and the resulting molecular pathway defects. The Class I mutant protein's activity is compromised as specific point mutations in the protein-coding amino acid sequence affect the pigment protein's transportation into the outer segment of the eye, where the phototransduction cascade is localized. Additionally, the misfolding of Class II rhodopsin gene mutations disrupts the protein's conjunction with 11-cis-retinal to induce proper chromophore formation. Additional mutants in this pigment-encoding gene affect <b>protein</b> <b>stability,</b> disrupt mRNA integrity post-translationally, and affect the activation rates of transducin and opsin optical proteins.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{are held}} in their {{tertiary}} structure by a distributed, internal network of cooperative interactions (hydrophobic, polar and covalent). Epistatic interactions occur whenever one mutation alters the local environment of another residue (either by directly contacting it, or by inducing changes in the protein structure). For example, in a disulphide bridge, a single cysteine {{has no effect on}} <b>protein</b> <b>stability</b> until a second is present at the correct location at which point the two cysteines form a chemical bond which enhances the stability of the protein. This would be observed as positive epistasis where the double-cysteine variant had a much higher stability than either of the single-cysteine variants. Conversely, when deleterious mutations are introduced, proteins often exhibit mutational robustness whereby as stabilising interactions are destroyed the protein still functions until it reaches some stability threshold at which point further destabilising mutations have large, detrimental effects as the protein can no longer fold. This leads to negative epistasis whereby mutations that have little effect alone have a large, deleterious effect together.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{high-throughput}} screening (HTS) assays, {{the use of}} ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy (UA) is commonly limited to concentration and turbidity measure-ments. Our aim was to evaluate microplate-based UA and its second-derivative [(2 d) UA] for measuring the conforma-tional stability of two recombinant antigenic proteins {{in the presence of}} 44 excipients. <b>Protein</b> conformational <b>stability</b> was assessed by (2 d) UA upon titration with guanidine hydrochloride. (2 d) UA was compared with tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy (TF) and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), both commonly used techniques for measuring <b>protein</b> conformational <b>stability.</b> The HTS data were corrected for plate, row and column effects by applying a median polish procedure. Irrespective of the unfolding method applied, similar stabilizing excipients were identi-fied by all analytical methods for a given antigen. The native forms of both antigens were destabilized by arginine, hydro-xypropyl-b-cyclodextrin, and sodium docusate, and were protected by polyols. The median polish correction im-proved the quality of the prediction models and the screen-ing resolution. The higher sensitivities of TF and DSF compared with (2 d) UA allowed the identification of a larger number of stabilizing excipients. However, similar screening resolutions (z’-factor> 0. 8) were observed for 2 dUA, TF, and DSF in a HTS of excipients applied to one of the antigens. Therefore, (2 d) UA deserves more attention in HTS studies focused on <b>protein</b> conformational <b>stability...</b>|$|R

25|$|In animal {{models of}} cardiac disease, {{functions}} of beta-catenin have been unveiled. In a guinea pig model of aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy, beta-catenin {{was shown to}} change subcellular localization from intercalated discs to the cytosol, despite {{no change in the}} overall cellular abundance of beta-catenin. vinculin showed a similar profile of change. N-cadherin showed no change, and there was no compensatory upregulation of plakoglobin at intercalated discs in the absence of beta-catenin. In a hamster model of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, cell-cell adhesions were irregular and disorganized, and expression levels of adherens junction/intercalated disc and nuclear pools of beta-catenin were decreased. These data suggest that a loss of beta-catenin {{may play a role in}} the diseased intercalated discs that have been associated with cardiac muscle hypertrophy and heart failure. In a rat model of myocardial infarction, adenoviral gene transfer of nonphosphorylatable, constitutively-active beta-catenin decreased MI size, activated the cell cycle, and reduced the amount of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and cardiac myofibroblasts. This finding was coordinate with enhanced expression of pro-survival proteins, survivin and Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor while promoting the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These findings suggest that beta-catenin can promote the regeneration and healing process following myocardial infarction. In a spontaneously-hypertensive heart failure rat model, investigators detected a shuttling of beta-catenin from the intercalated disc/sarcolemma to the nucleus, evidenced by a reduction of beta-catenin expression in the membrane protein fraction and an increase in the nuclear fraction. Additionally, they found a weakening in the association between glycogen synthase kinase-3β and beta-catenin, which may indicate altered <b>protein</b> <b>stability.</b> Overall, results suggest that an enhanced nuclear localization of beta-catenin may be important in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.|$|E
2500|$|Gene {{silencing}} {{may occur}} either via mRNA degradation or preventing mRNA from being translated.

This patient carries a proline to arginine substitution in the fifth transmembrane-spanning segment of the gene SLC1A3. This gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) protein, which is responsible for glutamate uptake. In cell culture assays, this mutation results in drastically decreased glutamate uptake in a dominant-negative manner. This is likely due to decreased synthesis or <b>protein</b> <b>stability.</b> As this protein is expressed heavily in the brainstem and cerebellum, it is likely that this mutation results in excitotoxicity and/or hyperexcitability leading to ataxia and seizures.

Many structural characteristics related to <b>protein</b> thermal <b>stability</b> have been elucidated, and increasing salt bridges is considered {{as one of the most}} efficient strategies to increase <b>protein</b> thermal <b>stability.</b> However, the accurate simulation of salt bridges remains difficult. In this study, a novel method for salt-bridge design was proposed based on the statistical analysis of 10, 556 surface salt bridges on 6, 493 X-ray protein structures. These salt bridges were first categorized based on pairing residues, secondary structure locations, and Ca–Ca distances. Pairing preferences generalized from statistical analysis were used to construct a salt-bridge pair index and utilized in a weighted electrostatic attraction model to find the effective pairings for designing salt bridges. The model was also coupled with B-factor, weighted contact number, relative solvent accessibility, and conservation prescreening to determine the residues appropriate for the thermal adaptive design of salt bridges. According to our method, eight putative salt-bridges were designed on a mesophilic b-glucosidase and 24 variants were constructed to verify the predictions. Six putative salt-bridges leaded to the increase of the enzyme thermal stability.
