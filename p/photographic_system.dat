The high-resolution mode used a 610 mm F 5.6 Panoramic lens manufactured by the Pacific Optical Company.|$|E

50|$|The two {{fundamental}} parameters of an optical lens are the focal length and the maximum aperture. The lens' focal length determines the magnification {{of the image}} projected onto the image plane, and the aperture the light intensity of that image. For a given <b>photographic</b> <b>system</b> the focal length determines the angle of view, short focal lengths giving a wider field of view than longer focal length lenses. A wider aperture, identified by a smaller f-number, allows using a faster shutter speed for the same exposure.|$|E

50|$|The Squadron {{returned}} to Coltishall in August 1995 for a well-earned rest. Despite the vital work they had performed in Iraq and Bosnia, however, the Squadron found their <b>photographic</b> <b>systems</b> were inhibited {{by the use}} of photographic film, which required special handling and processing before any results could be viewed and analysed. This drawback was compounded by the inherent difficulties of moving hardcopy prints around the battlefield, particularly with the distances involved in modern warfare. To overcome these issues, the Jaguar Replacement Reconnaissance Pod (JRRP) was introduced in August 2000.|$|R

After addressing the arcing, further experiments demonstrated temperatures around 1 million degrees. The system worked as expected, producing clear images of the kink instabilities using high-speed photography and argon gas so as to produce a bright image.|$|E
5000|$|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), {{like other}} American motion picture studios, briefly experimented {{with a variety}} of {{widescreen}} formats in the late 1920s. In 1929, the Fox Film Corporation introduced the Fox Grandeur widescreen <b>photographic</b> <b>system</b> which used a film 70 mm wide and had an aspect ratio of 2.13:1. MGM licensed the Grandeur lens and camera system which they called [...] "Realife" [...] but abandoned the format after just two films, 1930's Billy the Kid and 1931's The Great Meadow. Grandeur used non-standard perforations, but another format developed at around this time by Paramount used 65 mm film with standard perforations, the frame being 5 perforations high. Although these formats failed commercially at the time, the 65 mm film size and cameras built to use it were to form the basis, some two decades later, of the camera format for the new 70 mm formats introduced in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Edwin Land's {{original}} idea behind instant photography {{was to create}} a <b>photographic</b> <b>system</b> that was seamless and easy for anyone to use. The first roll film cameras required the photographer to use a light meter to take a reading of the light level, then to set the exposure setting on the lens. Then the lens was focused and the subject framed and the picture was taken. The photographer flipped a switch and pulled the large tab {{in the back of the}} camera to pull the negative over the positive, through some rollers to spread the developing agent. After the picture developed inside the camera for the required time, the photographer opened the small door in the camera back and peeled the positive from the negative. To prevent fading, the black and white positive had to be coated with a fixing agent, a potentially messy procedure which led to the development of coaterless instant pack film.|$|E
