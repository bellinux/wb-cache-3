50|$|While the {{existing}} Finnish icebreaker fleet was {{owned and operated}} solely by Arctia, the new icebreaker was initially intended to be owned by the Finnish Transport Agency and the operator would be selected through <b>public</b> <b>tendering</b> process. The new model was adopted from Sweden where the operation of state-owned icebreakers has been open for competition for years. Arctia, which practically has a monopoly in the icebreaker business in Finland, {{has been criticized for}} higher prices when compared to Swedish icebreakers as well as potentially subsidizing unprofitable offshore operations by charging premium charter from the Finnish Transport Agency for the multipurpose vessels. In October 2014, the newly appointed Finnish Minister of Transport Paula Risikko (National Coalition Party) questioned her predecessors' decision to order the icebreaker for an expert organization operating {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Ministry of Transport and Communications instead of the state-owned shipping company which was established to own and manage the Finnish state-owned icebreaker fleet. In November 2014, the Ministry of Transport and Communications proposed the Finnish Transport Agency that the new icebreaker should be sold to Arctia. On 5 March 2015, it was officially announced that the Finnish Government had agreed to sell the new icebreaker to Arctia Icebreaking, a subsidiary of Arctia, for 128 million euro. Although the contract was officially signed on 20 April 2015, the ownership will be transferred when the vessel has been delivered in 2016. According to the contract, the shipping company is obliged to have the new icebreaker available for tendering procedures for Baltic Sea icebreaking services until the end of 2020.|$|E

Generally, there is high competition in <b>public</b> <b>tendering,</b> both concerning the number of bidders (constantly increasing), {{as well as the}} profit margin (constantly decreasing). On the other side, handling the procurement process, there is a contracting authority that spends public money while trying to fulfill a particular socio-economic objective. This paper will take the contracting authority’s (auctioneer’s) point of view which is in charge of devising and implementing the awarding criteria, as well as choosing the best bidder. Particularly, this paper will focus on some aspects of the Economic Scoring Formula (ESF) design. The ESF constitutes a set of mathematical expressions that transform the economic bids submitted by the bidders into scores, so that, eventually, the bidders can be ranked and the best one selected. We will conclude that, despite apparently simple, how ESF are configured eventually have profound consequences on bidding behavior and some bidding results, like a higher or lower bid dispersion...|$|E
