50|$|Different {{manufacturers}} have produced machines {{with one of}} three types of <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> shank in mind. These are the low shank, high shank, and the slant shank <b>presser</b> <b>foot.</b> A low shank <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> has a 0.5 in distance {{from the bottom of}} the foot to the center of the thumbscrew; a high shank foot has a 1 in distance; a slant shank foot is distinctly slanted. The kind of foot a given machine requires is not interchangeable: a low-shank machine will only accept a low shank <b>presser</b> <b>foot,</b> and a high shank machine only a high-shank <b>presser</b> <b>foot,</b> though within these categories any low shank or high shank foot will fit any corresponding low shank or high shank machine; exceptionally, a slant shank foot can only be used with a Singer slant needle machine and no other (likewise, such a machine can accept no other kind of foot).|$|E

5000|$|Most <b>presser</b> <b>feet</b> {{are made}} of steel or clear plastic, however <b>presser</b> <b>feet</b> made of teflon or other non stick {{material}} are used for sewing with leather, plastic, vinyl and oilcloth ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Presser</b> <b>feet</b> are {{typically}} spring-hinged {{to provide some}} flexibility as the workpiece moves beneath it. <b>Presser</b> <b>feet</b> have two toes, one to hold the fabric down {{on either side of}} the needle.|$|R
50|$|Complete garment {{knitting}} requires two needle {{beds for}} three-dimensional structures (such as clothing). As {{is the case}} with all fully fashioned knitting, machines require individual single needle selection (through electronic control) and <b>presser</b> <b>feet</b> (to hold down formed loops).|$|R
50|$|A <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> is an {{attachment}} used with sewing machines to hold fabric flat {{as it is}} fed through the machine and stitched. Sewing machines have feed dogs {{in the bed of}} the machine to provide traction and move the fabric as it is fed through the machine, while the sewer provides extra support for the fabric by guiding it with one hand. A <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> keeps the fabric flat so that it does not rise and fall with the needle and pucker as it is stitched. When especially thick workpieces are to be sewn, such as quilts, a specialized attachment called a walking foot is often used rather than a <b>presser</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Tajima {{released}} the TMAR-KC Series Multi-Head Emrboidery Machine, {{equipped with a}} digitally controlled <b>presser</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> {{attachments}} are available for many sewing machines—feet exist to help with hemming, pintucks, attaching cording, assembling patchwork, quilting, {{and a variety of}} other functions.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used <b>presser</b> <b>feet</b> are the all-purpose foot and the zipper foot which come standard with most household machines. However, an array of specialized feet have also been designed {{for a number of}} uses. Among these are the following: ...|$|R
50|$|A {{sewing machine}} can also create a blind hem. In this case, a {{specialty}} <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> is needed. A zigzag stitch technique {{may be used}} with a sewing machine to create a blind stitch.|$|E

50|$|Durometer, {{like many}} other {{hardness}} tests, measures the depth of an indentation in the material created by a given force on a standardized <b>presser</b> <b>foot.</b> This depth {{is dependent on the}} hardness of the material, its viscoelastic properties, the shape of the <b>presser</b> <b>foot,</b> and the duration of the test. ASTM D2240 durometers allows for a measurement of the initial hardness, or the indentation hardness after a given period of time. The basic test requires applying the force in a consistent manner, without shock, and measuring the hardness (depth of the indentation). If a timed hardness is desired, force is applied for the required time and then read. The material under test should be a minimum of 6.4 mm (0.25 inches) thick.|$|E
5000|$|Davis sewing {{machines}} had conventional four motion feed (invented by Allen B. Wilson {{and used in}} most other machines). The machines also had the needle bar and <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> that moves the cloth forward; they were {{often referred to as}} walking foot or vertical feed machines.|$|E
50|$|The plaid matcher's {{downward}} pressure is more helpful {{than that of}} the <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> because the plaid matcher's foot can slide freely forward and back in order to move with the feed dogs. Consequently {{it appears to be a}} walking foot, even though the only force it generates is downward.|$|E
50|$|The Bernina Textile Group is a {{globally}} {{active group}} of 15 companies {{doing business in}} 80 countries. The company operates in the product categories such as household sewing and embroidery machines, household overlocker machines, longarm quilting machines, multi-needle embroidery machines, accessories (<b>presser</b> <b>foot,</b> embroidery hoops and other accessories for sewing, quilting and overlocking) and computer software for embroidery design.|$|E
5000|$|Zigzag stitch {{geometry}} {{is produced}} when the needle moves rhythmically {{side to side}} while stitching, while the feed dogs are following only in the normal forward [...] "four motion" [...] movement. Most lockstitch machines made after the 1960s {{are capable of doing}} this; older machines achieve the same stitch with a specialist <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> which moves the fabric beneath the stationary needle.|$|E
50|$|Older sewing {{machines}} which only sew a straight stitch {{can be adapted}} to sew a zigzag by means of an attachment. The attachment replaces the machine's <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> with its own, and draws mechanical power from the machine's needle clamp (which requires the needle clamp to have a side-facing thumbscrew). It creates a zigzag by mechanically moving the fabric side to side as the machine runs.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{a common}} sewing machine {{attachment}} for household use other than for quilting, but this type of feed is common in industrial heavy duty machines. Some household machines are marketed as having a walking foot, but actually have a puller feed. However, almost all household sewing machines use a standard connector for their <b>presser</b> <b>foot,</b> and so add-on walking foot attachments are available.|$|E
5000|$|Clothing {{factories}} and professional tailors use a [...] "blind hemmer", or hemming machine, which sews an invisible stitch quickly and accurately. A blind hemmer sews a chain stitch, using a bent needle, {{which can be}} set precisely enough to actually sew through {{one and a half}} thicknesses of the hemmed fabric. A rolled hem <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> on a sewing machine enables quick and easy hemming even by home sewers.|$|E
50|$|On 9 October 1902 {{the sons}} of John Morton put in a patent (No.21933) for the second Lion machine which could be made as a hand or treadle machine. The lion (sculpted {{to look like the}} work of J. Vasteugh Gyorgy) stands on rocks that are hinged to allow the needle bar, <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> and shuttle race to be seen whilst the head of the lion is also hinged to allow the user to insert the top reel and alter tension.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "plaid matcher" [...] {{is similar}} to a walking foot, but unlike a walking foot it does not {{actually}} contribute any forward or backward feeding force. Rather, it applies cyclic downward pressure onto the material onto the feed dogs, in time with the feed dogs, so as to increase the friction between layers of the material. The increased friction reduces the slipping of lower layers (which contact the feed dogs) versus the upper layers (which tend to be held in place by the <b>presser</b> <b>foot).</b>|$|E
50|$|To begin any machine quilting, {{the three}} {{layers of the}} quilt, the quilt top, batting and backing fabric, are {{temporarily}} basted with safety pins. Stitching {{in a straight line}} is normally accomplished by replacing the normal <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> with an even feed walking foot attachment. This gadget was designed to avoid puckering by advancing multiple layers {{at the same rate as}} the feed dogs of the machine. With the feed dogs up, the length of the stitch is controlled by the stitch length setting of the machine.|$|E
50|$|A walking foot {{replaces the}} {{stationary}} <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> with one that moves along with whatever other feed mechanisms the machine already has. As the walking foot moves, it shifts the workpiece along with it. It is most useful for sewing heavy materials where needle feed is mechanically inadequate, for spongy or cushioned materials where lifting the foot {{out of contact}} with the material helps in the feeding action, and for sewing many layers together where a drop feed will cause the lower layers to shift out of position with the upper layers.|$|E
50|$|Since 1959, Odette Ueltschi, Fritz Gegauf's daughter, tool {{the lead}} role at Bernina. She took over the {{management}} {{after the death of}} her brother in 1965. In 1963, the first Bernina sewing machine with a patented knee-activated <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> lifter, the 730, appeared on the market. From 1963 onwards, the subsequent model, the 730, was produced, and in the same year, the millionth Bernina sewing machine was manufactured. The top-seller of all the models was the 830 class, which came into production in 1971 and continued until 1981.|$|E
5000|$|Note: Type R is a {{designation}}, {{rather than}} a true [...] "type". The R designation specifies a <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> diameter (hence the R, for radius; obviously D could not be used) of 18 ± 0.5 mm (0.71 ± 0.02 in) in diameter, while the spring forces and indenter configurations remain unchanged. The R designation is applicable to any D2240 Type, {{with the exception of}} Type M; the R designation is expressed as Type xR, where x is the D2240 type, e.g., aR, dR, etc.; the R designation also mandates the employment of an operating stand.|$|E
50|$|In 1854, Wilson {{patented}} his four-motion feed, {{in combination}} with a spring <b>presser</b> <b>foot.</b> The feed bar, as its name indicates, had four distinct motions, two vertical and two horizontal. It was first raised {{by the action of}} an eccentric on the driving shaft, then carried forward by a cam formed {{on the side of the}} eccentric (by which operation the work was shifted the desired distance), then it dropped, and finally it was drawn back by a spring to its original position. This machine used the curved needle and embodies the rotary hook and the four-motion feed. The latest type of this machine used a vertical needle bar and a straight needle.|$|E
50|$|When woven from {{polyester}} {{it can be}} {{a challenging}} fabric to sew; it tends to be slippery and may be difficult to control through the <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> of a sewing machine. Seams have a tendency to pucker and pull; a smaller stitch length and properly balanced tensions can minimize this, though the experience of the sewer will affect the finished result as well. Pins can make holes and marks in polyester charmeuse so it's very important to use proper sharp dressmakers pins with a smooth, not abrupt, taper to the point. For greater ease of sewing, a sizing product can be sprayed on before cutting and washed out after the garment is completed.|$|E
50|$|The buttonholer's adaptor {{attaches}} to the machine's presser bar, replacing the <b>presser</b> <b>foot.</b> In its place the buttonholer employs a cloth clamp with teeth on the underside to hold the material firmly whilst manipulating the cloth side to side and forwards and backwards. Driven by {{the up and down}} stitching motion of the needle bar via the fork arm straddling the needle clamp, it executes the series of movements to complete a buttonhole by moving the material rather than by moving the needle position. Buttonholers usually include a metal feed cover plate to cover the machine's feed dogs, so that they do not interfere with that of the buttonholer, though some machines allow the feed dogs to be disengaged or ‘dropped’.|$|E
50|$|Kimball and Morton {{are most}} {{famous for their}} unusual ‘Lion’ {{machines}} and {{the first of these}} was manufactured in 1868. The design uses a transverse shuttle lockstitch mechanism with the upper mechanism and the needle bar secreted beneath a bronzed cast iron lion. A pair of matching legs could be attached to hide the lower needle bar and <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> when the machine was not in use. The treadle was equally ornate with depictions of a lion and eagle as well as the motto ‘Strength and Speed’. The Lion sewing machine was the only British-made sewing machine to win a medal at the American Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876. A rare example of both the Lion treadle machine of 1868 and hand crank model of 1902 can be seen at Glasgow Museums Resource Centre.|$|E
50|$|In 1851 Wilson {{patented}} {{his famous}} rotating hook, which performed {{the functions of}} a shuttle by seizing the upper thread and throwing its loop over a circular bobbin containing the under thread. 'This simplified {{the construction of the}} machine by getting rid of the reciprocation motion of the ordinary shuttle, and contributed to make a light tool silent running machine, eminently adapted to domestic use.In 1852 Mr. Wilson patented his four-motion feed, which, in combination with a spring <b>presser</b> <b>foot.</b> The feed bar, as its name indicates, had four distinct motions, two vertical and two horizontal. It was first raised by the action of an eccentric on the driving shaft, then carried forward by a cam formed {{on the side of the}} eccentric (by which operation the work was shifted the desired distance), then it dropped, and finally it was drawn back by a spring to its original position. This machine used the curved needle and embodies the rotating hook and the four-motion feed. The latest type of this machine used a vertical needle bar and a straight needle.|$|E
5000|$|Singer {{had seen}} a rotary sewing machine being {{repaired}} in a Boston shop. As an engineer, {{he thought it was}} clumsy and decided to design a better one. The machine he devised used a falling shuttle instead of a rotary one; the needle was mounted vertically and included a <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> to hold the cloth in place. It had a fixed arm to hold the needle and included a basic tension system. This machine combined elements of Thimonnier, Hunt and Howe's machines. Singer was granted an American patent in 1851, and it was suggested [...] he patent the foot pedal or treadle, used to power some of his machines; unfortunately, the foot pedal had been in use too long for a patent to be issued. When Howe learned of Singer's machine he took him to court, where Howe won and Singer was forced to pay a lump sum for all machines already produced. Singer then took out a license under Howe's patent and paid him $1.15 per machine before entering into a joint partnership with a lawyer named Edward Clark. They created the first hire-purchase arrangement to allow people to buy their machines through payments over time.|$|E
40|$|This paper briefly {{reviews the}} study to {{evaluate}} the standard <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> performance and a new actuation set-up to avoid the bouncing {{and the lack of}} fabric control. The compression force and displacement waveforms are also presented and widely discussed, as well as the seam’s quality analysis. A spectral (Fast Fourier Transform and Harmonic Distortion) analysis on the obtained waveforms, as well as an Admissible Displacement Limits (ADL) analysis are also described as important techniques to be used to supervise the <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> force and to monitor the feeding efficiency. ADL have proved to be a better method.

40|$|Sewing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes in the apparel industry for the production of high-quality garments. Although some research and improvements have been carried out in this area, the sewing process has remained almost unchanged throughout the years, staying largely dependent on the operator skills to set up sewing parameters and to handle the fabrics being sewn. Slight changes in sewing machine settings can influence the quality of seams, as well as sewing operation time. To avoid these empirical settings, reduce set-up times and improve machine performance, flexibility and sewing quality, an electromagnetic actuated <b>presser</b> <b>foot,</b> based on the use of a proportional force solenoid, was developed and implemented on an industrial overlock sewing machine. The compression force and displacement waveforms from the <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> bar will be studied in this paper, as well as the admiss ible displacement limits used to monitor (on- and offline) fabrics’ feeding efficiency. Following this analysis, a new research programme was established to enable a PC-based open- and closed-loop control of the <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> system. This paper also highlights these recent developments, presenting and discussing, in detail, a PID closed-loop control strategy. The obtained results show that the <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> closed-loop control has improved performance for a wide speed variation range...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the study of}} the research program being carried out on the feeding system of an industrial overlock sewing machine. The results obtained from the <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> bar displacement and compression force, together with the graphic kinematic analysis, which includes the velocity and acceleration taken from the displacement-time curves of the presser bar, led to further understanding of the feeding system dynamics. This study is providing the basis {{for the development of a}} redesigned and optimized fabric feeding system. The new actuation system, based on a proportional force solenoid integrated in the <b>presser</b> <b>foot</b> bar, will be also discussed as an important contribution to achieving a desired dynamic behaviour at high sewing speeds...|$|E
