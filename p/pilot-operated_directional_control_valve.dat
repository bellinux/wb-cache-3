40|$|A sound {{operated}} <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> (SODC-Valve) {{is proposed}} which opens and closes {{in response to}} the sound of a specific frequency propagated inside the gas supply tube and therefore needs no electric wiring to convey the control signals. By using multi-frequency sound, several <b>valves</b> can be <b>controlled</b> simultaneously and resultantly the pneumatic multi-degree wearable system can be constructed compactly. Firstly, the sound-gas pressure converter is proposed and improved so that self-excited vibration can be suppressed. Secondly, the basic characteristic of the sound-gas pressure converter is investigated to show that the back pressure is different depending on whether the sound of specific frequency is added or not. Furthermore, a pilot valve is developed. Because the pilot pressure change of the pilot valve developed is only 20 kPa, a main valve is proposed and developed. Finally, a pneumatic multi-degree-of-freedom wearable power-assist system is constructed by using a Dry Ice Power Cell as the portable gas supply, wearable actuators developed in the previous study, and two sound operated <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> developed. Experimental results show that the sound operated <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is feasible and practical in the pneumatic multi-degree-of-freedom wearable system...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies local <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> of the {{electro-hydraulic}} system. The sluggish {{response of}} hydraulic <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> usually becomes the bottleneck of whole system performance. Although fast valves (e. g. high-bandwidth servovalves) are available, {{they are far}} more expensive than slow valves (e. g. proportional <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves).</b> To improve the performance of proportional <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> three different types of controllers are synthesized. Firstly, based on the pole zero cancellation technique, an open loop compensator is designed which requires the accurate valve dynamic model information; Secondly, a full state feedback adaptive robust controller (ARC) is synthesized, which effectively {{takes into account the}} effect of parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities such as friction force and flow force. Finally, an output feedback ARC controller is synthesized {{to address the problem of}} unmeasurable states. Theoretically, the proposed ARC controllers gua [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The paper investigates, {{by means}} of a 3 D, steady-state, {{incompressible}} and isothermal CFD analysis, the influence of the notch shape and number on proportional <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> metering edge characteristics. The numerical activity is firstly performed for a sharp metering edge, considered as reference case. Then, different configurations of notched metering edges are considered, coming from the adoption of two notch geometrical shapes largely used in proportional <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> actual design, and from a symmetrical displacement of two, three and four notches on the spool periphery. For all the cases considered, the qualitative analysis of the internal flow field is performed in order to highlight the fluid efflux main characteristics. After, a quantitative analysis of the metering characteristics is introduced, with the aim of determining the influence of the metering configuration, of the spool position and of the operating conditions on the efflux characteristics (the discharge coefficient and the jet angle) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{numerical}} flow calculations {{with respect to}} the annular gaps with added radial grooves normaly used on the spools of <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> were carried out. The impact of various annular gap geometries and radial grooves during variable pressure conditions, and while using different hydraulic fluids, on the flows through annular gaps were investigated for different flow regimes. Samples with different geometries and numbers of radial groves on the spool of the <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> were also made for the purpose of carrying out flow measurements. The two different hydraulic fluids that were used in the numerical simulations and for the flow measurements were a hydraulic mineral oil and tap water. The results of the numerical calculations for the different models of the radial grooves with axially symmetric geometries show their impact on the internal leakage with respect to three different regimes of flow. The results of the numerical calculations based on the use of a hydraulic oil show a trend that was established by the experimental investigation...|$|R
40|$|The binlifts of refuse {{collectors}} have {{a problem}} with binlift oscillations when the binlift is lowered slowly. The problem escalates with hot oil that has lower viscosity. Most problematic the oscillations are with an accessory scale on the binlift as it does not tolerate oscillations in the position where it takes measurements. These oscillations are caused by load <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and wrong <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> spools make these oscillations worse. To figure out possible solutions for the oscillations the thesis has comprehensive load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> theory part which summarizes all the traditional and latest inventions related to load <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> This information is used in selecting valves for measurements. In this thesis there are measurements with different load <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> spools, restrictors, hoses and sequence valves. Measurements are done with a rear loader and they include flow and pressure measuring. These measurements are done to figure out which combination is the best compromise between energy consumption, oscillations and cost. This compromise should also fill all standardization requirements. Several solutions are found that are not ideal, one solution which is recommended and a couple of which are recommended in case oscillations are still needed to be degreased. Future solutions are also discussed but they require many changes to the hydraulic fundamentals of the refuse collectors. These solutions are likely to be possible for the coming generations of refuse collectors...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the flow through a <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for load –sensing application {{by means of}} a multi-phase and multi-component CFD approach. Numerical modeling includes both cavitation and aeration; in particular, the Rayleigh-Plesset equation and the inertia controlled growth model for bubble formation are adopted. The effects of gas release and vapor formation as well as turbulence on the main valve metering characteristics are investigated. The results show a remarkable influence of the aeration phenomena on the recirculating zones downstream of the metering area and thus on the cavitation onset region...|$|R
50|$|The spool (sliding type) {{consists}} of lands and grooves.The lands block oil {{flow through the}} valve body. The grooves allow oil or gas to flow around the spool and through the valve body. There are two fundamental positions of <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> namely normal position where valve returns on removal of actuating force and other is working position which is position of a valve when actuating force is applied. There is another class of valves with 3 or more position that can be spring centered with 2 working position and a normal position.|$|R
40|$|A {{control system}} with a <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> servo <b>valve</b> or a {{proportional}} <b>directional</b> throttling <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> <b>controlling</b> a linear hydraulic motor (cylinder) {{is used in the}} ship steering gear drive, in the controllable pitch propeller control, in the variable capacity pump control system for hydraulic deck equipment motors or fi xed pitch propellers in small ships (e. g. ferries). The most popular solution is a system where a throttling <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is fed by a constant capacity pump cooperating with an overfl ow valve. This system, working with a constant pressure, achieves a high energy effi ciency value η only at the point of maximum motor load coeffi cient MM and maximum motor speed coeffi cient ωM. Energy savings in a constant capacity pump operation may be achieved by means of an overfl ow <b>valve</b> <b>controlled</b> by the oil outlet point pressure between the <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> and the cylinder. Although structural volumetric losses cannot be eliminated in such a system, it is possible to reduce considerably structural pressure losses, mechanical losses and volumetric losses in the pump, and also mechanical losses in the cylinder. The paper discusses these energy savings using an earlier developed mathematical model of los-ses in elements, the energy effi ciency of the system and the operating range of the cylinder [9].

A viscous fluid leakage between the spool (piston of which the surfaces being machined parallel to each other) and the valve body has been obtained.

It was concluded that for reduced leakage (as far as possible) the misalignment, piston length {{and the value of}} surface coning should be selected properly.

40|$|<b>Directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> play a {{large role}} in most {{hydraulic}} systems. When modeling the hydraulic systems, it is important that both the steady state and dynamic characteristics of the valves are modeled correctly to reproduce the dynamic characteristics of the entire system. In this paper, a proportional valve (Brevini HPV 41) is investigated to identify its dynamic and steady state characteristics. The steady state characteristics are identified by experimental flow curves. The dynamics are determined through frequency response analysis and identified using several transfer functions. The paper also presents a simulation model of the valve describing both steady state and dynamic characteristics. The simulation results are verified through several experiments...|$|R

The piston can move in forward or reverse direction.The cylinders {{can be classified}} as double acting or single acting. In single acting cylinder work will be performed only in the forward stroke. The fluid will be supplied to the cylinder only during the forward stroke. The return stroke is achieved by the spring mounted in the cylinder. In double acting cylinder {{there will be two}} ports for the supply of fluid. Work can be obtained both at forward and reverse strokes. <b>Directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> required for the easy operation of double acting cylinder.|$|R
40|$|A {{passive control}} scheme for the {{bilateral}} teleoperation of a one {{degree of freedom}} electrohydraulic actuator is proposed. The overall system enables a human operating a motorized joystick {{to feel as if}} he is manipulating a rigid mechanical tool with which the work environment is also in contact. By ensuring that the closed loop system behaves like a passive two port device, safety and stability when coupled to other systems are improved. The control scheme is developed by first using active feedback to passify a four way <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> and then by the design of a passive teleoperation controller. The coordination error between the joystick and the hydraulic actuator converges to 0 for sufficiently low manipulation bandwidth. Experimental results verify the characteristics of the control scheme...|$|R

A formal approach for solving this problem relies on several practical metrics, which is introduced herein. Their choice is important, as the comparison results between controllers can vary significantly, depending on the selected criterion. Apart from the quantitative assessment, we also raise aspects which are difficult to quantify, but which must stay in attention when considering the position control problem for this class of hydraulic servo systems. ...|$|R

In the analysis, an open source fluid-dynamics code is used and both cavitation and turbulence are accounted for in the modeling. A cavitation model based on a barotropic equation of state and homogeneous equilibrium assumption, including gas absorption and dissolution in the liquid medium, is adopted and coupled to a two equation turbulence approach.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of the present paper is a numerical analysis of the transient flow through a 4 / 3 hydraulic closed center direction <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> The real-time discharge coefficients corresponding to supply flow difference have been considered. In order to develop an intelligent control system for an electro-hydraulic system (EHS), a new controller has recently been proposed to control those parameters in a complex system. However, a mathematical model of the EHS including the transient parameters has not been clarified. The main {{objective of}} this paper is to numerically analyze the dynamic characteristics of the <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> and also the flow behaviors in the electro-hydraulic system control. Both the steady state and transient flow though the valve which affect to flow-pressure coefficient were numerically considered.

40|$|Cavitation {{has been}} {{investigated}} in <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> {{in order to identify}} damage mechanisms characteristic of components of aircraft hydraulic systems. Tests have been conducted in a representative metal spool valve and in a model three times larger. Data taken under non-cavitating conditions with both valves showed that the position of the high-velocity annular jet shifts orientation depending upon valve opening and Reynolds number. By means of high-frequency response pressure transducers strategically placed in the valve chamber cavitation could be sensed by the correlation of noise with a cavitation index. The onset of cavitation can be detected by comparing energy spectra for a fixed valve opening and a constant discharge. Another sensitive indicator of cavitation inception is the ratio of cavitating to non-cavitating spectral densities. The incipient cavitation number as defined in this investigation is correlated with the Reynolds number for both valves...|$|R

40|$|Currently used jet {{vacuum ejector}} has a defect of high air {{consumption}} {{due to its}} requirement of continuous air supply. Focusing on this problem, {{a new type of}} piston vacuum generator (PVG for short) has been researched. The PVG has two pairs of pistons. One is for driving and another is for vacuum generating. Besides the maximum vacuum value, the vacuum response time and air consumption are the most concerning performances. Special structural design is made so as to meet all the requirements, in which the unequal diameters of pistons, using <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> instead of the check valves and stepped flow rate control scheme are proposed and realized. Experimental results have shown that for the prototype of piston vacuum generator its maximum vacuum is about 93 kPa, the response time is about 3. 7 s and the air consumption is reduced by about 71. 3 % in time interval of 60 s compared to the same level of vacuum ejector...|$|R
