40|$|In {{an effort}} to further refine {{potential}} point of departure nuclear thermal rocket engine designs, four proposed engine designs representing two thrust classes and utilizing two different fuel matrix types are designed and analyzed from both a neutronics and thermodynamic cycle perspective. Two of these nuclear rocket engine designs employ a tungsten and uranium dioxide cermet (ceramic-metal) fuel with a prismatic geometry based on the ANL- 200 and the GE- 710, while the other two designs utilize uranium-zirconium-carbide in a graphite composite fuel and a <b>prismatic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> geometry developed during the Rover/NERVA Programs.

Gas-cooled hightemperaturereactors (HTR) feature the remarkable property of being inherently safe against power excursions even under adverse conditions. With a combination of low power density, high thermal mass and high surface-to-power ratio, the core of an HTR can withstand certain accident scenarios without significant mechanical failure and release of fission products. The spherical or <b>prismatic</b> HTR <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> are a major component which influences the reactor performance in such accident conditions.
