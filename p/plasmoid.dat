5|$|The {{reconnection}} {{events are}} analogues to the magnetic substorms in the Earth's magnetosphere. The difference {{seems to be}} their respective energy sources: terrestrial substorms involve storage of the solar wind's energy in the magnetotail followed by its release through a reconnection event in the tail's neutral current sheet. The latter also creates a <b>plasmoid</b> which moves down the tail. Conversely, in Jupiter's magnetosphere the rotational energy is stored in the magnetodisk and released when a <b>plasmoid</b> separates from it.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 paper {{demonstrated}} that a dense plasma focus had achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion degrees Celsius, sufficient for boron fusion, and that fusion reactions were occurring primarily within the contained <b>plasmoid,</b> {{a necessary condition}} for net power. The focus consists of two coaxial cylindrical electrodes made from copper or beryllium and housed in a vacuum chamber containing a low-pressure fusible gas. An electrical pulse is applied across the electrodes, heating the gas into a plasma. The current forms into a minuscule vortex along the axis of the machine, which then kinks into a cage of current with an associated magnetic field. The cage of current and magnetic-field-entrapped plasma is called a <b>plasmoid.</b> The acceleration of the electrons about the magnetic field lines heats the nuclei within the <b>plasmoid</b> to fusion temperatures.|$|E

KDE 4.3 fixed over 10,000 bugs and implemented almost 2,000 feature requests. Integration with other technologies, such as PolicyKit, NetworkManager & Geolocation services, was another focus of this release. KRunner’s interface has been overhauled. A much more flexible system tray has been developed. Many new Plasmoids have been added, including the openDesktop.org <b>Plasmoid</b> – an initial take on the Social Desktop.

40|$|We {{investigate}} localized magnetosheath {{and solar}} wind density enhancements, associated with clear magnetic field changes, and therefore {{referred to as}} magnetosheath/solar wind <b>plasmoids,</b> respectively. Using Cluster data, we show {{that there are two}} distinct populations of magnetosheath <b>plasmoids,</b> one associated with a decrease of magnetic field strength (diamagnetic <b>plasmoids),</b> and one with an increased magnetic field strength (paramagnetic <b>plasmoids).</b> The diamagnetic magnetosheath <b>plasmoids</b> have scale sizes of the order of 1 - 10 RE, while the paramagnetic ones are an order of magnitude smaller. The diamagnetic <b>plasmoids</b> are not associated with any change in the magnetosheath plasma flow velocity, and they are classified as embedded <b>plasmoids</b> in the terminology of Karlsson et al. (2012). The paramagnetic <b>plasmoids</b> may either be embedded or associated with increases in flow velocity (fast <b>plasmoids).</b> A search for <b>plasmoids</b> in the pristine solar wind resulted in identification of 62 diamagnetic <b>plasmoids</b> with very similar properties to the magnetosheath diamagnetic <b>plasmoids,</b> making it probable that the solar wind is the source of these structures. No paramagnetic <b>plasmoids</b> are found in the pristine solar wind, indicating that these are instead created at the bow shock or in the magnetosheath. We discuss the relation of the <b>plasmoids</b> to the phenomenon of magnetosheath jets, with which they have many properties in common, and suggest that the paramagnetic <b>plasmoids</b> can be regarded as a subset of these or a closely related phenomenon. We also discuss how the results from this study relate to theories addressing the formation of magnetosheath jets...|$|R
50|$|<b>Plasmoids</b> {{appear to}} be plasma {{cylinders}} elongated {{in the direction of}} the magnetic field. <b>Plasmoids</b> possess a measurable magnetic moment, a measurable translational speed, a transverse electric field, and a measurable size. <b>Plasmoids</b> can interact with each other, seemingly by reflecting off one another. Their orbits can also be made to curve toward one another. <b>Plasmoids</b> can be made to spiral to a stop if projected into a gas at about 10−3 mm Hg pressure. <b>Plasmoids</b> can also be made to smash each other into fragments. There is some scant evidence to support the hypothesis that they undergo fission and possess spin.|$|R
40|$|Recently, a super-elastic {{collision}} of large-scale <b>plasmoids</b> i. e. solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) {{has been observed}} and further supported by numerical simulations. However, the energy gain by the system in the collision process is not clear. In-fact during <b>plasmoids</b> collision process, the energy exchange mechanism is still a chronic issue. Here, we present conclusive in situ evidence of sunward torsional Alfven waves in the magnetic cloud after the super-elastic {{collision of}} the largest <b>plasmoids</b> in the heliosphere.

25|$|In megatesla {{magnetic}} fields a quantum mechanical effect may suppress energy transfer from the ions to the electrons. According to one calculation, bremsstrahlung losses {{could be reduced}} to half the fusion power or less. In a strong magnetic field cyclotron radiation is even larger than the bremsstrahlung. In a megatesla field, an electron would lose its energy to cyclotron radiation in a few picoseconds if the radiation could escape. However, in a sufficiently dense plasma (ne > 2.5×1030 m−3, a density {{greater than that of}} a solid), the cyclotron frequency is less than twice the plasma frequency. In this well-known case, the cyclotron radiation is trapped inside the <b>plasmoid</b> and cannot escape, except from a very thin surface layer.|$|E
25|$|Panspermia {{can be said}} to {{be either}} {{interstellar}} (between star systems) or interplanetary (between planets in the same star system); its transport mechanisms may include comets, radiation pressure and lithopanspermia (microorganisms embedded in rocks). Interplanetary transfer of nonliving material is well documented, as evidenced by meteorites of Martian origin found on Earth. Space probes may also be a viable transport mechanism for interplanetary cross-pollination in the Solar System or even beyond. However, space agencies have implemented planetary protection procedures {{to reduce the risk of}} planetary contamination, although, as recently discovered, some microorganisms, such as Tersicoccus phoenicis, may be resistant to procedures used in spacecraft assembly clean room facilities. In 2012, mathematician Edward Belbruno and astronomers Amaya Moro-Martín and Renu Malhotra proposed that gravitational low energy transfer of rocks among the young planets of stars in their birth cluster is commonplace, and not rare in the general galactic stellar population. Deliberate directed panspermia from space to seed Earth or sent from Earth to seed other planetary systems have also been proposed. One twist to the hypothesis by engineer Thomas Dehel (2006), proposes that <b>plasmoid</b> magnetic fields ejected from the magnetosphere may move the few spores lifted from the Earth's atmosphere with sufficient speed to cross interstellar space to other systems before the spores can be destroyed.|$|E

Sakharov later suggested replacing the copper coil in MK generators with a large superconductor solenoid to magnetically compress and focus underground nuclear explosions into a shaped charge effect. He theorized this could focus 1023 protons per second on a 1mm2 surface.|$|E
40|$|The {{circulation}} of plasma and {{magnetic flux within}} planetary magnetospheres is governed by the solar wind-driven Dungey and planetary rotation-driven cycles. The Dungey cycle is responsible for all circulation at Mercury and Earth. Jupiter and Saturn's magnetospheres are dominated by the Vasyliunas cycle, but there is evidence for a small Dungey cycle contribution driven by the solar wind. Despite these fundamental differences, all well-observed magnetospheres eject relatively large parcels of the hot plasma, termed <b>plasmoids,</b> down their tails at high speeds. <b>Plasmoids</b> escape from the restraining force of the planetary magnetic field through reconnection in the equatorial current sheet separating {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres of the magnetosphere. The reconnection process gives the magnetic field threading <b>plasmoids</b> a helical or flux rope-type topology. In the Dungey cycle reconnection also provides the primary tailward force that accelerates <b>plasmoids</b> to high speeds as they move down the tail. We compare the available observations of <b>plasmoids</b> at Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn for the purpose of determining the relative role of <b>plasmoids</b> and the reconnection process in the dynamics these planetary magnetic tails...|$|R
40|$|Using first-principles fully kinetic {{simulations}} with a Fokker-Planck collision operator, it {{is demonstrated}} that Sweet-Parker reconnection layers are unstable to {{a chain of}} <b>plasmoids</b> (secondary islands) for Lundquist numbers beyond S >{approx} 1000. The instability is increasingly violent at higher Lundquist number, {{both in terms of}} the number of <b>plasmoids</b> produced and the super-Alfvenic growth rate. A dramatic enhancement in the reconnection rate is observed when the half-thickness of the current sheet between two <b>plasmoids</b> approaches the ion inertial length. During this transition, the reconnection electric field rapidly exceeds the runaway limit, resulting in the formation of electron-scale current layers that are unstable to the continual formation of new <b>plasmoids...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Plasmoids,</b> defined here as plasma {{entities}} with {{a higher}} anti-sunward velocity component than the surrounding plasma, have been observed in the magnetosheath in recent years. During the month of March 2007 the Cluster spacecraft crossed the magnetopause near the subsolar point 13 times. <b>Plasmoids</b> with larger velocities than the surrounding magnetosheath were found on seven of these 13 occasions. The <b>plasmoids</b> approach the magnetopause and interact with it. Both whistler mode waves and waves in the lower hybrid frequency range appear in these <b>plasmoids,</b> and the energy density of the waves inside the <b>plasmoids</b> {{is higher than the}} average wave energy density in the magnetosheath. When the spacecraft are in the magnetosphere, Alfvénic waves are observed. Cold ions of ionospheric origin are seen in connection with these waves, when the wave electric and magnetic fields combine with the Earth's dc magnetic field to yield an E × B /B 2 drift speed that is large enough to give the ions energies above the detection threshold...|$|R
50|$|A <b>plasmoid</b> has an {{internal}} pressure stemming {{from both the}} gas pressure of the plasma and the magnetic pressure of the field.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the IMF penetrates <b>plasmoids</b> causing them to be three- rather than two-dimensional is tested by comparing observations of By within <b>plasmoids</b> and related tail structures to upstream IMF By data. The magnetic topologies that result from the mergings of closed plasma sheet flux tubes and open tail lobe flux tubes at a near-earth neutral line, and merging near the tail flanks are described and studied. The particle signals and isotropic electron distributions are examined. It is observed that the IMF By penetrates <b>plasmoids</b> and that their structure is three-dimensional. In the three-dimensional model of <b>plasmoids</b> the reconnected plasma sheet field lines form a magnetic flux-ropelike structure.

40|$|This grant funded {{several studies}} of magnetospheric substorms and {{their effect on}} the {{dynamics}} of the earth's geomagnetic tail. We completed an extensive study of <b>plasmoids,</b> plasma/magnetic field structures that travel rapidly down the tail, using data from the ISEE 3 and IMP 8 spacecraft. This study formed the PhD thesis of Mark Moldwin. We found that magnetically <b>plasmoids</b> are better described as flux-ropes (twisted magnetic flux tubes) rather than plasma bubbles, as had been generally regarded up to that point (Moldwin and Hughes, 1990; 1991). We published several examples of <b>plasmoids</b> observed first in the near tail by IMP 8 and later in the distant tail by ISEE 3, confirming their velocities down tail. We showed how the passage of <b>plasmoids</b> distorts the plasma sheet. We completed the first extensive statistical survey of <b>plasmoids</b> that showed how <b>plasmoids</b> evolve as they move down tail from their formation around 30 RE to ISEE 3 apogee at 240 RE. We established a one-to-one correspondence between the observation of <b>plasmoids</b> in the distant tail and substorm onsets at earth or in the near tail. And we showed that there is a class of plasmoid-like structures that move slowly earthward, especially following weak substorms during northward IMF. Collectively this work constituted the most extensive study of <b>plasmoids</b> prior to the work that has now been done with the GEOTAIL spacecraft. Following our work on <b>plasmoids,</b> we turned our attention to signatures of substorm onset observed in the inner magnetosphere near geosynchronous orbit, especially signatures observed by the CRRES satellite. Using data from the magnetometer, electric field probe, plasma wave instrument, and low energy plasma instrument on CRRES we were able to better document substorm onsets in the inner magnetosphere than had been possible previously. Detailed calculation of the Poynting flux showed energy exchange between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and a short burst of tailward convective flow just prior to onset, suggesting the active role of the ionosphere in the onset process, and adding credibility to the ballooning instability theory of substorm onset. This grant also supported a number of other substorm studies and reviews. These are represented by the list of publications and meeting presentations resulting out of this grant...|$|R
40|$|Super-elastic {{collision}} is {{an abnormal}} collisional process, {{in which some}} particular mechanisms cause the kinetic energy of the system increasing. Most studies in this aspect focus on solid-like objects, but they rarely consider gases or liquids, as the collision of the latter is primarily a mixing process. With cross-field diffusion being effectively prohibited, magnetized <b>plasmoids</b> are different from ordinary gases. But it remains unclear how they act during a collision. Here we present the global picture of a unique collision between two coronal mass ejections in the heliosphere, which are the largest magnetized <b>plasmoids</b> erupting from the Sun. Our analysis {{for the first time}} reveals that these two magnetized <b>plasmoids</b> collided like solid-like objects with a 73 % likelihood of being super-elastic.

40|$|We {{present a}} multiwavelength {{study of the}} X-class flare, which {{occurred}} in active region (AR) NOAA 11339 on 3 November 2011. The EUV images recorded by SDO/AIA show the activation of a remote filament (located north of the AR) with footpoint brightenings about 50 min prior to the flare occurrence. The kinked filament rises-up slowly and after reaching a projected height of 49 Mm, it bends and falls freely near the AR, where the X-class flare was triggered. Dynamic radio spectrum from the Green Bank Solar Radio Burst Spectrometer (GBSRBS) shows simultaneous detection of {{both positive and negative}} drifting pulsating structures (DPSs) in the decimetric radio frequencies (500 - 1200 MHz) during the impulsive phase of the flare. The global negative DPSs in solar flares are generally interpreted as a signature of electron acceleration related to the upward moving <b>plasmoids</b> in the solar corona. The EUV images from AIA 94 Å reveal the ejection of multiple <b>plasmoids,</b> which move simultaneously upward and downward in the corona during the magnetic reconnection. The estimated speeds of the upward and downward moving <b>plasmoids</b> are 152 - 362 and 83 - 254 km/s, respectively. These observations strongly support the recent numerical simulations of the formation and interaction of multiple <b>plasmoids</b> due to tearing of the current-sheet structure. On the basis of our analysis, we suggest that the simultaneous detection of both the negative and positive DPSs is most likely generated by the interaction/coalescence of the multiple <b>plasmoids</b> moving upward and downward along the current-sheet structure during the magnetic reconnection process. Moreover, the differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of the active region reveals presence of a hot flux-rope structure (visible in AIA 131 and 94 Å) prior to the flare initiation and ejection of the multi-temperature <b>plasmoids</b> during the flare impulsive phase.
