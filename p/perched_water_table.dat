40|$|Onsite {{wastewater}} treatment systems (OWTSs) are a commonly used means of {{wastewater treatment}} in the Dickinson Bayou watershed which is located between Houston and Galveston. The Dickinson Bayou is classified as "impaired" by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality due {{to high levels of}} bacteria, specifically E. coli. Failing OWTSs within the bayou's watershed are possible sources for the impairment of the bayou. Conventional OWTSs, comprised of a septic tank and a soil absorption field, rely heavily on soil treatment of effluent. The type of soils is a significant factor in treatment capabilities. In the Dickinson Bayou watershed, soils are primarily composed of clays, which are known to be problematic for conventional systems as they restrict water flow and create <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> <b>tables.</b> These <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> may contribute to surface runoff during rainfall events. The HYDRUS modeling software for water and solute flow through variably saturated media was used to simulate OWTSs in the Dickinson Bayou watershed.

Results found that the simulated conventional systems fail due to high <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> and clay soils.

50|$|Aeration on a sand-based {{system is}} used more {{to control the}} {{thickness}} of the thatch layer than to relieve compaction. Thatch layers are the accumulation of decomposed vegetative parts of grass plants like stolons and rhizomes at the surface level. A thick thatch layer on a sand-based athletic field may prevent nutrients and water from reaching the soil. Further, fertilizers, fungicides, and insecticides can not penetrate the surface and reach the soil. This can obviously be devastating if a field is consumed by a soil borne disease or insect. Water penetration can also be deterred by a thick thatch layer. When there is a thick mat of organic matter near the surface of a field a second <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> will form.

50|$|Shallow {{landslides}} {{can often}} happen {{in areas that}} have slopes with high permeable soils on top of low permeable bottom soils. The low permeable, bottom soils trap {{the water in the}} shallower, high permeable soils creating high water pressure in the top soils. As the top soils are filled with water and become heavy, slopes can become very unstable and slide over the low permeable bottom soils. Say there is a slope with silt and sand as its top soil and bedrock as its bottom soil. During an intense rainstorm, the bedrock will keep the rain trapped in the top soils of silt and sand. As the topsoil becomes saturated and heavy, it can start to slide over the bedrock and become a shallow landslide.R. H. Campbell did a study on shallow landslides on Santa Cruz Island, California.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Surface and {{subsurface}} hydrological parameters affecting {{overland flow}} from cultivated land were studied in three small sub-watersheds {{located in the}} western foothills of the Willamette Valley. The sub-watersheds, which ranged in size from 0. 46 to 6. 0 -ha, were fall-planted to grass or small grain. The parameters studied were infiltration, rainfall, runoff and subsurface water measurements. Infiltration measurements were obtained monthly using a portable infiltrometer. Rainfall was measured with recording and non-recording rain gages. Runoff was monitored from the sub-watershed outlets and within the watersheds using H-flumes and erosion plots, respectively. Subsurface moisture conditions were monitored with wells, piezometers and tensiometers. Seasonal changes in soil surface and moisture conditions caused seasonal variations in steady state infiltration rates. Low antecedent moisture and fail cropping practices produced rough, highly permeable surfaces {{which resulted in a}} high steady state infiltration rate (6. 8 cm/hr). Winter rains caused increased antecedent moisture and surface sealing, and the final infiltration rate was found to decreased to a low of 4. 0 cm/hr. Decreased storm events in the spring caused cracks to develop in the crust producing infiltration rates {{similar to those of the}} fall. Saturated hydraulic conductivities, measured with core samples from different horizons indicated decreased hydraulic conductivities in lower horizons. In some cases the hydraulic conductivities were virtually zero in the Cr horizon. Bimodal pore desaturations were noted in unsaturated hydraulic conductivities measured by a continuous drainage method.

The {{purpose of this}} dissertation was to evaluate the physical and chemical changes in a soil due to periodic saturation, {{and the addition of}} soil conditioners and herbicide glyphosate. Three experiments were performed to evaluate: (1) physical changes in a saturated soil due to different application methods of polyacrylamide and gypsum; (2) chemical changes in a waterlogged soil due to the addition of gypsum and herbicide glyphosate; and (3) the effects of a <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> the addition of gypsum and herbicide glyphosate in nutrient uptake by corn. The first experiment was a simulated rainfall experiment. It was found that surface application of PAM and gypsum increased infiltration, decreased soil loss, and reduced soil erosion. The second experiment was held under constant temperature, and oxygen-free conditions using a biogeochemical reactor. Waterlogged soil samples were incubated for 1, 3, 7 and 14 days to determine changes in soil chemistry. No significant differences were found among treatments for Eh and pH values. Statistical differences in nutrient and redox sensitive species correlated to gypsum application. Gypsum application decreased phosphate in solution; chemical equilibrium models suggested precipitation of hydroxyapatite. Greater amounts of soil exchangeable K+ and NH 4 + were observed during extended incubation periods. K+ was thought to come from the clay lattice and NH 4 + due to mineralization of organic matter. The third experiment was conducted in a greenhouse. No measured or visual effects were observed due to glyphosate. Soil below the water table presented anoxic conditions. Denitrification of the soil and low N content in plant tissue were measured for soils with <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> <b>table.</b> Gypsum application enhanced root development, there were roots which survived and remained active below the water table. Increases in soil exchangeable K+ were observed under <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> conditions; increases were less than those measured in the biogeochemical reactor possibly due to plant uptake and difference in moisture content.

The modified model was parameterized and independently evaluated against observations from an ombrotrophic raised-dome bog in northern Minnesota (S 1 -Bog), the site for the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change experiment (SPRUCE). Simulated <b>water</b> <b>table</b> levels compared well with site-level observations. The new model predicts hydrologic changes in response to planned warming at the SPRUCE site. At present, standing water is commonly observed in bog hollows after large rainfall events during the growing season, but simulations suggest a sharp decrease in <b>water</b> <b>table</b> levels due to increased evapotranspiration under the most extreme warming level, nearly eliminating the occurrence of standing water in the growing season. Simulated soil energy balance was strongly influenced by reduced winter snowpack under warming simulations, with the warming influence on soil temperature partly offset by the loss of insulating snowpack in early and late winter. The new model provides improved predictive capacity for seasonal hydrological dynamics in northern peatlands, and provides a useful foundation for investigation of northern peatland carbon exchange...|$|R
