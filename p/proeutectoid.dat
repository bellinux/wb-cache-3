However, the transformation from austenite to pearlite is a time-dependent reconstructive reaction which requires the large scale movement of the iron and carbon atoms. While the interstitial carbon diffuses readily even at moderate temperatures the self-diffusion of iron becomes extremely slow at temperatures below 600 °C until, for all practical purposes, it stops. As a consequence a rapidly cooled steel may reach a temperature where pearlite can no longer form despite the reaction being incomplete and the remaining austenite being thermodynamically unstable.|$|E

Pearlitic microstructures exhibit prior austenite grain sizes and pearlite colony sizes which increase and interlamellar spacings which decrease as the austenitizing temperature increases above 850 °C. A <b>proeutectoid</b> carbide size distribution that remains basically constant with austenitizing temperature is also observed in these microstructures.

40|$|A comprehensive, critical, {{and up to}} date {{review is}} {{presented}} for the <b>proeutectoid</b> cementite transformation in steels. It is believed {{that many of the}} new findings, features, and concepts presented here for this classic phase transformation in steels serve as a model which may be more broadly applicable to test against many other phase transformations systems as well. There were a number of early investigations of cementite morphology, and this review considers those early results in light of many newer studies that provide critical new insight into cementite morphologies in both two and three dimensions. A number of different orientation relationships (ORs) between <b>proeutectoid</b> cementite and the austenite matrix from which it forms {{have been reported in the}} literature, in some cases leading to confusion, and they are critically evaluated here, as are the habit plane, growth direction, and interfacial structure of various morphologies of <b>proeutectoid</b> cementite. Quantitative experimental and theoretical investigations of the growth kinetics of the <b>proeutectoid</b> cementite transformation are considered next, and the nucleation site of <b>proeutectoid</b> cementite in austenite is also discussed in some detail. This review considers all of these issues in a critical way in which differences, commonalities, important features, and redundancies are sorted out, in order to present a unified picture that will add some clarity to this subject. The different features and issues of this transformation that are considered in detail throughout this review are finally brought together in a comprehensive way in the last major section of this paper on ‘Formation mechanism(s) of <b>proeutectoid</b> cementite’, in order to provide a complete, modern view of the formation of <b>proeutectoid</b> cementite from austenite. To the best knowledge of the present authors, before this review a thorough assessment of this classic phase transformation in steels had not been undertaken since 1962, when Professor Hubert I.

The <b>proeutectoid</b> ferrite grains are elongated along the magnetic field direction, which can be explained as follows: the <b>proeutectoid</b> ferrite becomes the magnetic dipolar under high magnetic field, and then the polarized austenite atoms are much easier to diffuse into ferrite grains along the magnetic field direction. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{morphological}} features of pearlite were revealed through {{scanning electron microscopy}} using deeply etched specimens. These include cementite branching, bridging, gaps, holes and curvature. The presence of cementite thin films or networks along the austenite grain boundaries in eutectoid steel and at the interface between pearlite and <b>proeutectoid</b> ferrite in hypoeutectoid steel is another characteristic of pearlite. Further-more, ferrite thin films surrounding the <b>proeutectoid</b> cementite in hypereutectoid steels are also observed. Hence, it is considered that in hypoeutectoid steels the nucleus for pearlite is a film of cementite rather than the expected <b>proeutectoid</b> ferrite and, similarly, in hypereutectoid steels pearlite forms from a ferrite film rather than from <b>proeutectoid</b> cementite. Convergent beam Kikuchi line diffraction was used to accurately determine the orientation relationships between pearlitic constituents and parent austenite in a Hadfields steel. The results show that neither the pearlitic ferrite nor the cementite is crystallographically related to the austenite grain into which the pearlite was growing and to that into which it was not growing. in addition, a new orientation relationship between pearlitic cementite and ferrite in the Hadfield steel was also observed.

Compact tension and cylindrical tensile test samples were prepared as per ASTM standards, subjected to various heat treatments and the mechanical tests including the tensile tests, plane strain fracture toughness tests, hardness tests were performed as per ASTM standards. Microstructures were characterized by optical metallography, X-ray diffraction, SEM and TEM. Nanostructured ADI was achieved by a unique heat treatment consisting of austenitization at a high temperature and subsequent plastic deformation at the same austenitizing temperature followed by austempering. The investigation also examined the effect of cryogenic treatment, effect of intercritical austenitizing followed by single and two step austempering, effect of high temperature plastic deformation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the low alloyed ductile cast iron. The mechanical and thermal stability of the austenite was also investigated. An analytical model has been developed to understand the crack growth process associated with the stress induced transformation of retained austenite to martensite...|$|E

The data consisted of dilatometer curves obtained on continuous cooling of a 0 ? 13 %C high strength low alloy steel. The KM equation takes the form, ln(1 - y) = ?(Ms - T). Plots of -ln (1 - y) against temperature for what are thought to be grain boundary ferrite, intragranular ferrite, <b>proeutectoid</b> ferrite, and pearlite give a series of straight lines of increasing slope ?. Intersections of these lines give the temperature of transformation points in good agreement with those on the dilatometry curves. Values of ? obtained for each transformation are compared with those previously obtained for martensite in plain carbon and alloy steels and ferrite in Fe? 9 %Ni.

40|$|Abstract：The {{rolling process}} of the {{three-roll}} cross wedge rolling with non-uniform temperature field was simulated with the finite element method (FEM). The distribution of the temperature and equivalent strain in radial section of rolled pieces was analyzed. The microstructures and properties of different positions in radial section were investigated. The {{results indicate that the}} temperature field and equivalent strain are ring-likely distributing in the radial section of rolled pieces. There are high temperature and small strain in the center. The temperature decreases and the strain increase gradually from the center to surface. The microstructures and properties of rolled pieces are different in different positions. The microstructure in the center consists of pearlite and <b>proeutectoid</b> ferrite, while the surface consists of cementite particles and fine ferrite...|$|E
