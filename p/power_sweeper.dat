50|$|Push lawn sweepers, which {{resemble}} a simple wheeled manual lawn mower, are maneuvered and powered by hand. A forward pushing action transfers {{power from the}} wheels to the brush mechanism via a gearing system, causing it to rotate, and the debris is picked up and transferred to a bag or hopper mounted on the machine. <b>Powered</b> lawn <b>sweepers</b> resemble push lawn sweepers, but the brush mechanism {{is powered by a}} gasoline or electric motor. Tow lawn sweepers are towed behind a vehicle, such as a garden tractor or ATV and are designed for use in larger areas. They are generally wider and have greater hopper capacities than push and <b>powered</b> lawn <b>sweepers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Atco was {{the first}} ride-on lawn tractor to have a <b>powered</b> grass <b>sweeper,</b> driven from a power {{take-off}} (PTO) {{at the rear of}} the machine. The PTO worked independently of the blades, so the user could cut the lawn without collecting the clippings or vice versa.|$|R
40|$|Safe {{tips for}} snow removal using snow shovels, {{snowblowers}} and <b>powered</b> blades or <b>sweepers</b> {{are covered in}} this NebGuide. As the temperature drops and the grounds maintenance equipment is stored for the winter, position the snow removal equipment for quick access, and start thinking about snow removal safety. About half the accidents involving snow removal equipment happen to first-time users or those using the equipment {{for the first time}} each winter. Snow removal equipment falls in one of three groups: 1) the snow shovel, 2) the snow thrower or blower, and 3) the <b>powered</b> blade or <b>sweeper...</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, <b>power</b> <b>sweepers,</b> and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R
30|$|The {{impact of}} {{microwave}} <b>sweeper</b> <b>power</b> fluctuation in the BOTDA {{system has been}} theoretically analyzed and experimentally tested. And a novel method comparing real-time acquisition of probe wave power with a new algorithm to realize probe wave power normalization for eliminating this impact was proposed. The principle of the proposed method was described theoretically. And the contrast test between our new method and conventional one was carried out. The experiment {{results indicated that the}} temperature accuracy was effectively improved from ± 5 °C to ± 2 °C.|$|R
