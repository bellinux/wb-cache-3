5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a <b>protective</b> <b>ring</b> of bone {{created by}} a {{connection}} between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of trackways, Bakker argued that sauropod dinosaurs moved in {{structured}} herds, with the adults surrounding the juveniles in a <b>protective</b> <b>ring.</b> However, shortly afterwards this particular interpretation was challenged by Ostrom among others, although the venerable dinosaur track expert Roland T.

25|$|Both guns {{have their}} own handles which are a mix between a pistol grip and a more usual shovel-handle type used in Maxim machine guns. Each handle has a trigger {{operated}} with a forefinger. Support bars protruded {{from the rear of}} the weapon that the gunner leaned on to bear the weapon on target. The weapon was used on a 135cm high cone mount M/31 which, while it worked, was heavy and cumbersome to move. The sight was typical ring sight of the era, with an oval-shaped front sight with two consentric rings while the rear sight was a small peg surrounded by a <b>protective</b> <b>ring.</b> In action the anti-aircraft machine gun had an intended crew of six: commander, gunner, two loaders and two ammunition handlers. Equipment included a transport case for the weapon, spare barrels, locks and springs, toolkit and a wooden transport case for ten spare belt boxes.|$|E

5000|$|Askeptosaurus {{probably}} hunted in deep waters, {{because it}} had large eyes suited to conditions of low light. However, similar to ichthyosaurs it also had a <b>protective</b> bony <b>ring</b> around the eyes, which would have prevented them from collapsing under the immense water pressure of great depths.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} February 1863, the 36th Arkansas was encamped at Des Ark {{with the}} {{remainder}} of its brigade. The brigade’s task organization remained {{the same for the}} rest of the war: The 32nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Lucien C. Gause; the 36th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, commended by Colonel James M. Davie; the 30th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel J. W. Rogan; and Marshall's Arkansas Battery, commanded by Captain John G. Marshall. In early March 1863, the brigade marched to Camp Bowen, near Little Rock, and took up defensive positions in a portion of the capital's <b>protective</b> <b>ring.</b> Their days were occupied with more drill and working on the earthworks of the defenses. The regiment remained near Little Rock until April 23, 1863, when the regiment crossed the Arkansas River and began a march to Jacksonport, in preparation for the Battle of Helena.|$|E
25|$|In August 1709 Eugene's chief {{political}} opponent and critic in Vienna, Prince Salm, retired as court chamberlain. Eugene and Wratislaw were now the undisputed {{leaders of the}} Austrian government: all major departments of state were in their hands or those of their political allies. However, another attempt at a negotiated settlement at Geertruidenberg in April 1710 failed, largely because the English Whigs still felt strong enough to refuse concessions, while Louis XIV saw little reason to accept what he had refused the previous year. Eugene and Marlborough could not be accused of wrecking the negotiations, but neither showed regret at {{the breakdown of the}} talks. There was no alternative but to continue the war, and in June the Allied commanders captured Douai. This success was followed by a series of minor sieges, and by the close of 1710 the Allies had cleared much of France's <b>protective</b> <b>ring</b> of fortresses. Yet there had been no final, decisive breakthrough, and this was to be the last year that Eugene and Marlborough would work together.|$|E
25|$|The PLA Navy {{was ranked}} in 1987 {{as the third}} largest navy in the world, {{although}} naval personnel had comprised only 12 percent of PLA strength. In 1987 the Navy consisted (as it does now) of the naval headquarters in Beijing; three fleet commands – the North Sea Fleet, based at Qingdao, Shandong; the East Sea Fleet, based at Ningbo; and the South Sea Fleet, based at Zhanjiang, Guangdong – and about 2,000 ships. The 350,000-person Navy included Naval Air Force units of 34,000 men, the Coastal Defense Forces of 38,000, and the Marine Corps of 56,500. Navy Headquarters, which controlled the three fleet commands, was subordinate to the PLA General Staff Department. In 1987, China's 1,500km coastline was protected by more than 100 diesel-powered Romeo- and Whiskey-class submarines, which could remain at sea only a limited time. Inside this <b>protective</b> <b>ring</b> and within range of shore-based aircraft were destroyers and frigates mounting Styx anti-ship missiles, depth-charge projectors, and guns up to 130mm. Any invader penetrating the destroyer and frigate protection would have been swarmed by almost 900 fast-attack craft. Stormy weather limited the range of these small boats, however, and curtailed air support. Behind the inner ring were Coastal Defense Force personnel operating naval shore batteries of Styx missiles and guns, backed by ground force units deployed in depth.|$|E
50|$|A {{medium to}} large-sized mosasaur, with the skull length {{reaching}} 1.5 meters {{and the total}} body length up to around 10 meters; the skull was massive and proportionately large.It had <b>protective</b> bony <b>rings</b> surrounding its eye sockets, indicating it lived in deep water. Its teeth {{are similar to those}} of some Triassic placodonts, so it may have lived a similar lifestyle, feeding on shellfish, large fish, and sea turtles.|$|R
50|$|Corns and calluses {{are easier}} to prevent than to treat. When it is usually not {{desirable}} to form a callus, minimizing rubbing and pressure will prevent callus formation. Footwear should be properly fitted, gloves may be worn, and <b>protective</b> pads, <b>rings</b> or skin dressings may be used. People with poor circulation or sensation should check their skin often for signs of rubbing and irritation so they can minimize any damage.|$|R
2500|$|The basic IU {{structure}} {{is a short}} cylinder, 36inches high and [...] in diameter, fabricated of an aluminum alloy honeycomb sandwich material [...] thick. The cylinder is manufactured in three 120-degree segments, which are joined by splice plates into an integral structure. The top and bottom edges are made from extruded aluminum channels bonded to the honeycomb sandwich. This type of construction was selected for its high strength to weight ratio, acoustical insulation, and thermal conductivity properties. The IU supported the components mounted on its inner wall {{and the weight of}} the Apollo spacecraft above (the Lunar Module, the Command Module, the Service Module, and the Launch Escape Tower). To facilitate handling the IU before it was assembled into the Saturn, the fore and aft <b>protective</b> <b>rings,</b> 6inches tall and painted blue, were bolted to the top and bottom channels. These were removed in the course of stacking the IU into the Saturn vehicle. The structure was manufactured by North American Rockwell in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Edward A. Beasley was the I.U. Program Manager.|$|R
2500|$|Retiring {{from the}} area on 23 June, the carrier force {{proceeded}} to Pagan Island, against which strikes were launched on 24 June, and then made for Eniwetok. Thence, on 30 June, they departed for further strikes on the Bonin and Volcano Islands on 4 July, before turning south once again to continue coverage of the Marianas campaign. Commencing daily strikes on Guam and Rota 6 July, the force remained in the area until after the landings on Guam. On 23 July, TG 58.1, with Mobile [...] in the inner <b>protective</b> <b>ring,</b> steamed southwest for raids in the Western Carolines. Three days later they pounded Yap, Ulithi, and Fais, while TGs 58.2 and 58.3 hit the Palaus. On 30 July, TF 58 retired to Saipan, arrivingon 2 August.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of June 18, the Chinese {{returned}} at around midnight, moving through their own and UNC artillery and mortar fire to attack Outpost Harry from the northeast and northwest. The PVA were repelled and forced to withdraw, but they stayed in the area. At 02:40 the CPV attacked from the north under intense artillery and mortar fire. The PVA got in to the trenches of the outpost on the northern slope at 03:13. Bitter hand-to-hand fighting ensued with the PVA making numerous attempts to reinforce through the <b>protective</b> artillery <b>ring.</b> Company [...] "N", Sparta Battalion was committed to reinforce. One platoon of tanks from Heavy Tank Company, 15th Infantry Regiment, and one platoon of Greek Infantry were dispatched to the valley east of Outpost Harry as a diversionary force.

50|$|Drought {{conditions}} {{throughout the}} state of Washington resulted in many devastating wildfires throughout 2015. On June 29th, 2015, lightning sparked a fire in Wolverine Creek, which expanded toward Lucerne and {{became part of the}} Chelan Complex fire, resulting in the evacuation of the Village (residents, guests, and mine remediation workers) on August 1st and 2nd, just before the fire cut off road access. A small crew of 4-5 Villagers remained behind to tend the fire defense sprinklers (which operated 24 hours a day using river water), serve meals to the hotshot firefighter crews working in the nearby mountains, protect the wooden structures from falling embers, and assist with cutting and clearing a <b>protective</b> burn <b>ring</b> around the Village and mine remediation site. The Chelan Complex Fire continued to spread downlake, resulting in the evacuation of the Holden Bed & Breakfast and Lake House on August 15th and threatening the cities of Chelan and Manson. By August 28th the fire had moved on enough to allow some staff members to return, and on September 7th all Villagers were cleared to return.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{exposure}} to ambient air of MoS 2 -based, -Al 2 O 3 -supported, hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts has been studied using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Analysis of unpromoted as well as Ni- and Co-promoted MoS 2 samples showed {{that the number of}} MoS 2 slabs and the average slab length decreased as a function of air exposure time. A parallel X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study showed this effect to be due to oxidation. During the first 24 h of exposure to air, all 1 bar sulfided (Ni/Co) MoS 2 samples showed an initial slab length decrease of around 20 %. After an additional month in air, the slabs had deteriorated significantly further. A sample of CoMoS 2 sulfided at 30 bar showed a slightly enhanced effect of oxidation, particularly after the first 5 minutes in air. The combined HRTEM and XPS results lead to the proposal of the formation of a <b>protective</b> oxide <b>ring</b> around the remaining sulfidic species inside the MoS 2 slabs to explain the mechanism of this oxidation process. The data obtained in this study emphasize the general necessity of shielding vulnerable catalyst samples from air during preparation and characterization, a message relevant in all fields of research related to catalysis...|$|R

5000|$|The Minor Arcana {{consist of}} highly skilled magicians {{such as the}} Alchemist seeking the philosopher's stone and the potion of immortality, the Jewelsmith Artificer, which {{manufactures}} <b>protective</b> amulets and <b>rings</b> Powers (similar the Elves of Eregion who were manipulated by Sauron {{in the work of}} Tolkien), the Mechanician Artificer that makes the statues come alive, mechanisms and magical traps, the Weaponsmith Artificer that manufactures weapons and armor magic (a class in which Dwarves particularly excel), the Astrologer who reads the future in the stars and Diviner which reads the future in Tarot cards. The last category is the Minor Arcana's Stone (Hex Masters) which itself comprises several types of magicians. There are Witches and Warlocks who live in convents, specialize in black magic and demonology, and are able not only do magic but to ask miracles of Lucifer and his angels.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{examine whether}} Lapprotector™, a <b>protective</b> film and <b>ring</b> device for protectingwounds, can prevent wound {{infection}} after open appendectomy. MethodsWe performed open appendectomy on 64 patients between 2004 and 2006. In September 2005, we started using Lapprotector™ {{to protect the}} site of incision (McBurney's point). Patients were dividedinto two groups as follows: Lapp(−), n = 32; Lapp(+), n = 32. Patient demographics were not statisticallydifferent and antibiotic protocols were identical. ResultsIn the Lapp(−) group, the appendix was perforated in seven patients (21. 9 %) and not perfo-rated in 25 patients (78. 1 %). In the Lapp(+) group, the appendix was perforated in nine patients (28. 1 %) and not perforated in 23 patients (71. 9 %). For perforated cases, incisional wound infection was seen in three out of seven patients (42. 9 %) in the Lapp(−) group and in no patient (0 %) in the Lapp(+) group, a significant difference (p < 0. 05, χ 2 test). For nonperforated cases, wound infection was seen in {{only one out of}} 25 patients (4. 0 %) in the Lapp(−) group. ConclusionWe recommend using Lapprotector™ to prevent incisional wound infection in patientsrequiring open appendectomy, especially in cases where the appendix is perforated...|$|R

50|$|In Hungary the Ottomans were {{primarily}} concerned with ensuring the security of Buda and the Danube River, which served as a critical transport route for munitions and provisions. For this purpose they constructed several fortresses along {{the route of the}} river and surrounded Buda with a ring of protective fortresses, the most significant of which was Esztergom (Estergon), which was significantly enlarged and fortified subsequent to its capture in 1543. Buda's <b>protective</b> <b>ring</b> was completed in 1596 with the conquest of Eger (Eğri) to the northeast. Subsequent to the Peace of Zsitvatorok in 1606 the pace of Ottoman fortress construction slowed as the military threat of the Habsburgs receded.|$|E
50|$|The Fort de Bruissin {{is located}} about 8.5 km to the {{southeast}} {{of the center of}} Lyon.

With the introduction of rifled artillery, the range increased, placing the city once again into jeopardy. In the 1870s a second ring of forts was built father out to deal with the extended range of artillery. Work on the second ring of eighteen forts was complete by 1893. The Fort du Bruissin was number 13 in the Army's numerical designation of the forts of Lyon.|$|E
