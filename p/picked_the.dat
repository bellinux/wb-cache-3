Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations.

40|$|Traveltime tomographic inversions of seismic data usually require <b>picking</b> <b>the</b> arrival {{times of}} certain events {{recorded}} by receivers. We {{have developed an}} algorithm that <b>picks</b> <b>the</b> traveltime of an event according to the phase properties of the wavelet of the event. If the event has a minimum phase wavelet, <b>the</b> algorithm <b>picks</b> <b>the</b> first break of the wavelet. If the wavelet of the event has a zero phase spectrum, the central point of <b>the</b> wavelet is <b>picked.</b> For any mixed phase wavelet, <b>the</b> algorithm <b>picks</b> <b>the</b> first break of the causal, minimum phase part of the wavelet. Numerical experiments show that, for isolated, noise-free events, the algorithm performs well.

5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or <b>picked</b> <b>the</b> top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because {{the driving force behind the}} name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E

5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but <b>picked</b> <b>the</b> latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play The Night is Young. After the play opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date.|$|E

Despite this, other media critics have said unless the series receives a rating above a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, it will be considered a failure, and only two other NBC series ranked above a 3.0 rating at the time; Fear Factor and The Office. The series has also been put on Monday nights against CBS, with Monday featuring Two and a Half Men, one of the highest-rated shows of the season.
