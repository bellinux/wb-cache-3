25|$|Ryti's mandate as {{president}} {{was intended to}} extend only {{through the rest of}} Kallio's term, i.e., to 1943, but as the government could not organize elections during the Continuation War, the electors from 1937 gathered to re-elect him. This exceptional procedure was mandated by a constitutional amendment passed by the <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> Ryti was elected by an overwhelming majority. Ryti was willing to continue {{as president}} because he was among those who led Finland into the war, even though during the winter of 1942, both Ryti and Mannerheim had their doubts about German victory.|$|E

25|$|The {{autonomous}} {{status of}} the islands was affirmed by a decision made by the League of Nations in 1921 following the Åland crisis. It was reaffirmed within the treaty admitting Finland to the European Union. By law, Åland is politically neutral and entirely demilitarised, and residents are exempt from conscription to the Finnish Defence Forces. The islands were granted extensive autonomy by the <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> in the Act on the Autonomy of Åland of 1920, which was later replaced by new legislation by the same name in 1951 and 1991. Åland remains exclusively Swedish-speaking by this act.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{prompted}} the Government of Finland, <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> representatives and the President of Finland Sauli Niinistö to discuss fast-tracking the intelligence bill. The bill {{was intended to}} enhance national security against serious threats, such as terrorism, with both civilian and military intelligence. New powers granted with the bill would include network traffic intelligence and intelligence gathering abroad. Prime Minister of Finland Juha Sipilä said {{on the need for}} intelligence gathering reform that it should be “obvious from a constitutional standpoint that the right to life is a more precious fundamental right than the right to privacy in light of the Turku events".|$|E
25|$|In June 1935, a small expert {{committee}} led by Captain Ilmari Jokinen, {{the director}} of the Finnish Board of Navigation, began investigating the feasibility of a dual-use vessel that could be used as an icebreaker during the winter and as a submarine tender for the Finnish Navy during the summer months. The committee found the idea feasible and, in addition, recommended replacing traditional reciprocating steam engines with a diesel-electric power plant pioneered by the Swedish icebreaker Ymer in 1933. While a second expert committee, formed from experienced Finnish naval architects and icebreaker captains in March 1936, proposed purchasing two new icebreakers, the <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> allocated FIM 36 million for ordering one medium-sized icebreaker.|$|E
50|$|When the new House <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> for <b>Finland</b> was built, {{architect}} Johan Sigfrid Sirén {{wished he}} could buy sculptures directly from Aaltonen.

The series of gilded plaster sculptures that Aaltonen completed in 1932 were cast in bronze after his death.|$|R
50|$|Sirén {{was born}} in 1889 in Ylihärmä. In 1907, he {{graduated}} from high school and started his studies at the Helsinki University of Technology. After receiving his diploma in 1913, Sirén worked for Jung & Fabritius until 1917. In 1918, he founded an office with Kaarlo Borg and Urho Åberg. In 1924, they won a contest for the design <b>of</b> Eduskuntatalo, the <b>Parliament</b> House <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> The three soon parted ways and Sirén continued work on the Eduskuntatalo alone. During the construction period from 1926 to 1931, he acted as a supervisor. Sirén went on to hold his own office, and his later work included the expansion of the main building of the University of Helsinki. In 1931, Sirén was also appointed a professor of architecture at the Helsinki University of Technology. He retired from the position in 1957, and died in Helsinki in 1961. He is buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.|$|R

25|$|The Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) was {{established}} on 17 December 1948 upon {{ratification of the}} Act and the Decree on the Security Police and became operational {{at the start of}} 1949. Supo was formed to replace its predecessor, the State Police (Valtiollinen poliisi, Valpo), after communists suffered a defeat in the July 1948 parliamentary elections and the eorganization of Valpo was recommended by a governmental committee in October 1948. In essence, Valpo was abolished by <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> {{due to the fact that}} its leadership positions had been filled by communists and implicated in erroneous and illegal elements according to a separate governmental committee investigation as well as linked to a number of disappearances in the aftermath of World War II.|$|E
25|$|In April 1930, the <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> allotted 4,000,000 Finnish markkas for {{procuring}} a second-hand full-rigged {{ship and}} refitting it {{as a school}} ship for the Finnish Navy. During the summer of 1930, the Finnish officials inspected a number of Finnish and foreign ships that were offered for sale. These included Gustav Erikson's four-masted barques Pommern and Herzogin Cecilie, and several other ships, but all were deemed either too large or too dilapidated. In the end, the most suitable candidate came from Germany where Oldenburg, a 28-year-old former school ship of the German merchant navy, was offered for sale. After inspecting the ship in Bremen, the Finnish officials purchased her in August 1930 and the German crew sailed the ship to Helsinki.|$|E
25|$|After his overthrow, Gamsakhurdia {{continued}} to promote {{himself as the}} legitimate president of Georgia. He was still recognized as such by some governments and international organizations, although {{as a matter of}} pragmatic politics the insurrectionist Military Council was quickly accepted as the governing authority in the country. Gamsakhurdia himself refused to accept his ouster, not least because he had been elected to the post with an overwhelming majority of the popular vote (in conspicuous contrast to the undemocratically appointed Shevardnadze). In November–December 1992, he was invited to Finland (by the Georgia Friendship Group of the <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland)</b> and Austria (by the International Society for Human Rights). In both countries, he held press conferences and meetings with parliamentarians and government officials (source: Georgian newspaper Iberia-Spektri, Tbilisi, December 15–21, 1992).|$|E

25|$|When the <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> {{accepted}} {{the declaration of}} independence given by the Senate on 6 December 1917, the state-owned icebreakers under Finnish command raised the colours of the independent Finland for the first time. However, when the Red Guard took over Helsinki and the Finnish Civil War began on 27 January 1918, Tarmo was still under Russian command. After negotiations with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union it was agreed that the Finnish icebreaker would be returned once the evacuation of the Russian forces – later known as the Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet — had been completed. However, after an attempt to evacuate the remaining members of the Senate from the occupied city by air had failed, Lieutenant Yrjö Roos was given an order to capture Tarmo from the Russians and bring her to a safe harbour at the Gulf of Bothnia. When the Germans captured the city of Tallinn {{on the other side of}} the Gulf of Finland, it was decided to take Tarmo there.|$|E
25|$|The unrest {{during the}} Russo-Japanese War {{resulted}} in a general strike in Finland in October 1905. The most immediate result was the Emperor's manifesto that cancelled all illegal regulations. A parliament based on universal and equal suffrage was also promised. An extraordinary session of the diet in December 1905 was called to implement the parliamentary reforms. The proposal {{was presented to the}} Emperor on 15 March 1906 and after his approval it was submitted to the estates on 9 May. The reforms came to force on 1 October 1906. The diet was reformed from a legislative assembly of four Estates into a unicameral parliament of 200 members. At the same time universal suffrage was introduced, which gave all men and women, 24 years or older, the right to vote and stand for election. Acts on the right of parliament to monitor members of the government, on the Freedom of Speech, Assembly and Association, and Freedom of the Press were also introduced. These reforms established the hallmarks of today's <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> The first election to the new parliament was arranged in 1907.|$|E

A citizens' initiative was launched to put the issue before the <b>Parliament</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> The initiative gathered the required 50,000 signatures of Finnish citizens in one day and exceeded 107,000 signatures by the time the media reported the figures. The campaign collected 166,000 signatures and the initiative was presented to the Parliament in December 2013. The initiative went to introductory debate on 20 February 2014 and was sent again to the Legal Affairs Committee. On 25 June, the bill was rejected by the Legal Affairs Committee on a vote of 106 and the third time on 20 November 2014, by 98.
