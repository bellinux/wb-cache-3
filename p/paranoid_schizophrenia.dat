40|$|Objective The {{study is}} to explore the {{relationship}} between antipsychotics and blood glucose level or lipid level of patients with mental illness in psychiatric outpatient clinic of Queen Mary Hospital. Participants and Methods Case reviews through Clinical Management System were carried out. Total 108 psychotic cases involved in the study. 24 were excluded as the patients {{did not have any}} treatment of antipsychotics. 84 patients were qualified for review. 40 females and 68 males involved. Their ages are between 13 and 68. Patients’ demographics information, blood glucose level or lipid level were retrieved. Some important findings are also noted. Data collection carried in May 2014. Results There are no significant changes in fasting blood glucose or lipid level for either typical or atypical antipsychotics. We found that the frequency of checking blood glucose or lipid level was too low and not regular. Risperidone and Olanzapine are the most commonly used in this psychiatric outpatient clinic. Moreover, 9 cases change from psychosis to <b>Paranoid</b> type <b>schizophrenia.</b> The most frequent diagnosis in the clinic is <b>Paranoid</b> type <b>schizophrenia.</b> 36 cases, one third of the samples, are diagnosed as <b>Paranoid</b> type <b>schizophrenia.</b> Conclusions Although we cannot conclude the effect of antipsychotics on blood glucose level or lipid level of patients with mental illness, there is an increasing concern about antipsychotics leading to metabolic problems through the case reviews. We suggest that routine physical health screening, guidelines setting up, predictors should be carried out in the clinic. published_or_final_versionPsychological MedicineMasterMaster of Psychological Medicin...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} study covering the period 1974 - 1978 {{was conducted on}} the inpatient population at the Department of Psychiatry, Howard University Hospital, for the two major diagnostic categories, major affective disorders (MAD) and the schizophrenias. Among the schizophrenias, the diagnoses of <b>schizophrenia,</b> <b>paranoid</b> type, and <b>schizophrenia,</b> not otherwise specified, account for approximately 73 percent of all schizophrenic diagnoses. The distribution of diagnoses among the MAD category demonstrated that approximately 74 percent of all diagnoses were accounted for by the subcategory depressive neurosis.

40|$|This {{is a study}} {{about the}} main character?s {{schizophrenia}} and his efforts to overcome it in Sylvia Nasar?s A Beautiful Mind. In this study, the writer will focuses on the kinds of schizophrenia the main character is suffering from and how he overcomes his schizophrenia. The writer will use the psychological approach and the theory of schizophrenia as tools to analyze the main character?s schizophrenic condition. Generally, there are five kinds of schizophrenia and each kind has its own symptoms. In analyzing this novel, the writer analyzes the symptoms of the main character?s schizophrenia which lead him to {{a certain kind of}} schizophrenia. Moreover, the writer analyzes the efforts that the main character does to overcome his schizophrenia. The writer finds that the main character begins to hear things that do not exist and starts to have hallucinations along with delusions. These delusions and hallucinations lead him in doing peculiar things. Nevertheless, he then realizes that he suffers from psychological problem and he is trying to overcome it. Fortunately, {{with the help of his}} willingness to seek for treatment, his efforts to think rationally, and his self-assertion, he can struggle with his schizophrenic condition and miraculously recover. In the final part of this study, the writer can conclude that the main character?s behavior and attitudes visualize the <b>paranoid</b> <b>schizophrenia?s</b> characteristics. The writer also concludes that the main character does several efforts to recover from schizophrenia...|$|R

5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that <b>paranoid</b> <b>schizophrenia</b> may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E

5|$|Monroe's early {{childhood}} was stable and happy. While Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, {{she was able}} to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne soon after the birth. They raised their foster children according to the principles of evangelical Christianity. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles. Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood. They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with <b>paranoid</b> <b>schizophrenia.</b> After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent {{the rest of her life}} in and out of hospitals, and was rarely in contact with Monroe.|$|E

The other affected women are human mothers who began to suffer from mental illness or strange behavior after giving birth to an Avatar. Ben's mother Flora was a religious fanatic who would not touch her son. Scudder's mother Emma cut her eyes out and killed several of her family members the night Scudder was born.

40|$|Previous work {{examining}} the neurobiological substrates of social cognition in healthy individuals has reported mod-ulation {{of a social}} cognitive network such that increased ac-tivation of the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, and superior temporal sulcus are evident when individuals judge a face to be untrustworthy as compared with trustworthy. We ex-amined whether this pattern would be present in individuals with schizophrenia who are known to show reduced activa-tion within these same neural regions when processing faces. Additionally, we sought to determine how modulation of this social cognitive network may relate to social functioning. Neural activation was measured using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} with blood oxygenation level dependent contrast in 3 groups of individuals—nonparanoid individuals with <b>schizophrenia,</b> <b>paranoid</b> individuals with <b>schizophrenia,</b> and healthy controls—while they rated faces as either trust-worthy or untrustworthy. Analyses of mean percent signal change extracted from a priori regions of interest demon-strated that both controls and nonparanoid individuals with schizophrenia showed greater activation of this social cognitive network when they rated a face as untrustworthy relative to trustworthy. In contrast, paranoid individuals did not show a significant difference in levels of activation based on how they rated faces. Further, greater activation of this social cognitive network to untrustworthy faces was signif-icantly and positively correlated with social functioning. These findings indicate that impaired modulation of neural activity while processing social stimuli may underlie deficits in social cognition and social dysfunction in schizophrenia.
