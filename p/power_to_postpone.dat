She usually bore a much stronger likeness to her mother than to her father, but now, looking with a grave, reckless, and angered expression of countenance at the kindling wick as she held it slanting into the other flame, her father's features were distinct in her. It {{was the first time}} Miss Aldclyffe had seen her in a passionate mood, and wearing that expression which was invariably its concomitant. It was Miss Aldclyffe's turn to start now; and the remark she made was an instance of that sudden change of tone from high-flown invective to the pettiness of curiosity which so often makes women's quarrels ridiculous. Even Miss Aldclyffe's dignity had not sufficient <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>postpone</b> the absorbing desire she now felt to settle the strange suspicion that had entered her head.|$|E
60|$|To {{this the}} priests of the oracle said in reply, that the {{destruction}} of the Lydian dynasty had long been decreed by the Fates, in retribution for the guilt of Gyges, the founder of the line. He had murdered his master, and usurped the throne, without any title to it whatever. The judgments of Heaven had been denounced upon Gyges for this crime, to fall on himself or on some of his descendants. The Pythian Apollo at Delphi had done all in his <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>postpone</b> the falling of the blow until after the death of Croesus, on account of the munificent benefactions which he had made to the oracle; but he had been unable to effect it: the decrees of Fate were inexorable. All that the oracle could do was to postpone--as it had done, it said, for three years--the execution of the sentence, and to give Croesus warning of the evil that was impending. This had been done by announcing to him that his crossing the Halys would cause {{the destruction of}} a mighty empire, meaning that of Lydia, and also by informing him that when he should find a mule upon the throne of Media he must expect to lose his own. Cyrus, who was descended, on the father's side, from the Persian stock, and on the mother's from that of Media, was the hybrid sovereign represented by the mule.|$|E

50|$|In mid-January, Paul Ryan, Chairman of the House Budget Committee, floated {{the idea}} of a {{short-term}} debt ceiling increase. He argued that giving Treasury enough borrowing <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>postpone</b> default until mid-March would allow Republicans to gain an advantage over Obama and Democrats in debt ceiling negotiations. This advantage would be {{due to the fact that}} postponing default until mid-March would allow for a triple deadline to be in March: the sequester on March 1, the default in the middle of the month, and the expiration of the current continuing resolution and the resulting federal government shutdown on March 27. This was supposed to provide extra pressure on the Senate and the President to work out a deal with the Republican-led House.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 April the {{parliament}} voted {{to postpone the}} election for six months {{by a vote of}} 63 to 11, with O'Neill and Namah voting for the postponement. The Parliamentary motion instructed head of the election commission, Andrew Trawen, to ask the Governor-General of Papua New Guinea Sir Michael Ogio for the delay. However, as Trawen has previously asserted that parliament has no <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>postpone</b> the election since its five-year term is specified in the constitution of Papua New Guinea and he had previously said that [...] "the nation is ready to go to the polls," [...] he was [...] "consulting his lawyers" [...] as to which direction to proceed. A former attorney-general, Sir Arnold Amet, said the vote was unconstitutional and would be challenged in court. Leader of the Opposition Carol Kidu said she was [...] "vehemently opposed" [...] to the suspension. [...] "How can we take anything they say at their word? The whole country is being held to ransom by these decisions." [...] However, after intense domestic and international pressure, O'Neill backed away from this demand and the election was held from 23 June to about 13 July which was in the scheduled timeslot.|$|E
