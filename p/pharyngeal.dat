5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second <b>pharyngeal</b> arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop from {{the first part of the}} <b>pharyngeal</b> pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first <b>pharyngeal</b> arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.|$|E
5|$|The neuroendocrine parafollicular cells, {{also known}} as C cells, {{responsible}} {{for the production of}} calcitonin, are derived from neural crest cells, which migrate to the <b>pharyngeal</b> arches. This part of the thyroid then first forms as the ultimopharyngeal body, which begins in the ventral fourth <b>pharyngeal</b> pouch and joins the primordial thyroid gland during its descent to its final location.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pharyngeal</b> jaws of teleosts, {{a second}} set of jaws {{contained}} within the throat, are composed of five branchial arches, loops of bone which support the gills. The first three arches include a single basibranchial surrounded by two hypobranchials, ceratobranchials, epibranchials and pharyngobranchials. The median basibranchial is covered by a toothplate. The fourth arch is composed of pairs of ceratobranchials and epibranchials, and sometimes additionally, some pharyngobranchials and a basibranchial. The base of the lower <b>pharyngeal</b> jaws is formed by the fifth ceratobranchials while the second, third and fourth pharyngobranchials create the base of the upper. In the more basal teleosts the <b>pharyngeal</b> jaws consist of well-separated thin parts that attach to the neurocranium, pectoral girdle, and hyoid bar. Their function is limited to merely transporting food, and they rely mostly on lower <b>pharyngeal</b> jaw activity. In more derived teleosts the jaws are more powerful, with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw; the pharyngobranchials fuse to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium. They have also developed a muscle that allows the <b>pharyngeal</b> jaws to have a role in grinding food in addition to transporting it.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from <b>pharyngeal</b> pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first <b>pharyngeal</b> cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first <b>pharyngeal</b> arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second <b>pharyngeal</b> arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E
5|$|As the {{recurrent}} nerve hooks {{around the}} subclavian artery or aorta, it gives off several branches. There is suspected {{variability in the}} configuration of these branches to the cardiac plexus, trachea, esophagus and inferior <b>pharyngeal</b> constrictor muscle.|$|E
5|$|One temnospondyl, the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis, {{may have}} brooded young {{in an area}} between the gills called the <b>pharyngeal</b> pouch. Small bones {{belonging}} to younger Trimerorhachis individuals {{have been found in}} these pouches. The living Darwin's Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way. An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic, eating its young like many amphibians do today. If this was the case, the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the <b>pharyngeal</b> pouch as the animal fossilized.|$|E
5|$|The ear {{develops}} {{from the}} first <b>pharyngeal</b> pouch and six small swellings that develop in the early embryo called otic placodes, which are derived from ectoderm.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves are {{the nerves}} {{of the sixth}} <b>pharyngeal</b> arch. The existence of the recurrent laryngeal nerve was first documented by the physician Galen.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} amount of {{research has focused on}} determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first <b>pharyngeal</b> arch that is necessary for the development of teeth.|$|E
5|$|In birds, {{the main}} arteries taking blood {{away from the}} heart {{originate}} from the right aortic arch (or <b>pharyngeal</b> arch), unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms {{this part of the}} aorta. The postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system. Unlike in mammals, the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The halfbeaks' {{fossil record}} extends into the Lower Tertiary. The {{earliest}} known halfbeak is Brachyrhamphus bolcensis from the Eocene at Monte Bolca, Italy. Apart from {{differences in the}} length of the upper and lower jaws, recent and fossil halfbeaks are distinguished by the fusion of the third pair of upper <b>pharyngeal</b> bones into a plate.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} is {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery. Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending <b>pharyngeal</b> artery, internal carotid artery, and the artery of the pterygoid canal.|$|E
5|$|The stapes {{develops}} {{from the}} second <b>pharyngeal</b> arch during the sixth to eighth week of embryological life. The central cavity of the stapes, the obturator foramen, {{is due to the}} presence embryologically of the stapedial artery, which usually regresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounded}} sac {{becomes the}} primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, {{such as the}} esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The esophagus develops {{as part of the}} foregut tube. The innervation of the esophagus develops from the <b>pharyngeal</b> arches.|$|E
5|$|The upper esophageal {{sphincter}} {{surrounds the}} upper part of the esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle but is not under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior <b>pharyngeal</b> constrictor.|$|E
5|$|During {{human and}} all {{vertebrate}} development, {{a series of}} <b>pharyngeal</b> arch pairs form in the developing embryo. These project forward {{from the back of}} the embryo towards the front of the face and neck. Each arch develops its own artery, nerve that controls a distinct muscle group, and skeletal tissue. The arches are numbered from 1 to 6, with 1 being the arch closest to the head of the embryo, and the fifth arch only existing transiently.|$|E
5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient <b>pharyngeal</b> space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} perfect ring-shaped {{formation of}} the foramen spinosum was observed in the eighth month after birth and the latest seven years after birth in a developmental study of the foramen rotundum, foramen ovale and foramen spinosum. The majority of the foramina in the skull studies were round in shape. The sphenomandibular ligament, derived from the first <b>pharyngeal</b> arch and usually attached to {{the spine of the}} sphenoid bone, may be found attached to the rim of the foramen.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the <b>pharyngeal</b> opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The somatic motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and <b>pharyngeal</b> {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve. Fibers cross over to and join the vagus nerve in the jugular foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular ganglion, and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve.|$|E
5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the <b>pharyngeal</b> arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the <b>pharyngeal</b> opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|Transmission occurs through {{inhalation}} {{of airborne}} variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or <b>pharyngeal</b> mucosa of an infected person. It {{is transmitted from}} one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. The virus can cross the placenta, but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first <b>pharyngeal</b> pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with <b>pharyngeal</b> oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{the primary}} organs of the {{respiratory}} system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone {{on either side of}} the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the <b>pharyngeal</b> muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of teleost species {{belong to the}} clade Euteleostei, which consists of 17,419 species classified in 2,935 genera and 346 families. Shared traits of the euteleosts include similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and dorsal fin (supraneural bones), an outgrowth on the stegural bone (a bone located near the neural arches of the tail) and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base. The {{majority of}} euteleosts are in the clade Neoteleosti. A derived trait of neoteleosts is a muscle that controls the <b>pharyngeal</b> jaws, giving them a role in grinding food. Within neoteleosts, the Acanthopterygii have a spiny dorsal fin which {{is in front of}} the soft-rayed dorsal fin. This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may also play a role in defense. Acanthomorphs have developed spiny ctenoid scales (as opposed to the cycloid scales of other groups), tooth-bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; <b>pharyngeal</b> arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending <b>pharyngeal</b> artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pharyngeal</b> {{syndrome}} is rare. It starts after infection of <b>pharyngeal</b> tissue, and buboes {{in the neck}} region can occur.|$|E
25|$|Mongolian {{possesses}} a different system of vowel harmony. The system includes both a <b>pharyngeal</b> harmony and a rounding harmony. In particular, the <b>pharyngeal</b> harmony involves the vowels: a, ʊ, ɔ (<b>pharyngeal)</b> and i, u, e, o (non-pharyngeal). Rounding harmony only affects the open vowels, e, o, a, ɔ.|$|E
25|$|Innervation {{of taste}} and {{sensation}} is different for the anterior and posterior {{part of the}} tongue because they are derived from different embryological structures (<b>pharyngeal</b> arch 1 and <b>pharyngeal</b> arches 3 and 4, respectively).|$|E
25|$|Cyprinids are stomachless {{fish with}} toothless jaws. Even so, food can be {{effectively}} chewed by the gill rakers of the specialized last gill bow. These <b>pharyngeal</b> teeth allow {{the fish to}} make chewing motions against a chewing plate formed by a bony process of the skull. The <b>pharyngeal</b> teeth are unique to each species and are used by scientists to identify species. Strong <b>pharyngeal</b> teeth allow fish such as the common carp and ide to eat hard baits such as snails and bivalves.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypopharynx}} {{includes the}} pyriform sinuses, the posterior <b>pharyngeal</b> wall, and the postcricoid area. Tumors of the hypopharynx frequently have an advanced stage at diagnosis, {{and have the}} most adverse prognoses of <b>pharyngeal</b> tumors. They tend to metastasize early due to the extensive lymphatic network around the larynx.|$|E
25|$|Both {{parts of}} the tongue develop from {{different}} <b>pharyngeal</b> arches.|$|E
25|$|The mylohyoid {{muscle is}} flat and triangular, and is {{situated}} immediately {{superior to the}} anterior belly of the digastric muscle. It is a <b>pharyngeal</b> muscle (derived from the first <b>pharyngeal</b> arch) and classified {{as one of the}} suprahyoid muscles. Together, the paired mylohyoid muscles form a muscular floor for the oral cavity of the mouth.|$|E
