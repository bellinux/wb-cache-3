5|$|European music between 800 and 1100 {{became more}} sophisticated, more {{frequently}} requiring instruments capable of polyphony. The 9th-century Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh mentioned in his lexicographical discussion of music instruments that, in the Byzantine Empire, typical instruments included the urghun (organ), shilyani (<b>probably</b> <b>a</b> type of harp or lyre), salandj (<b>probably</b> <b>a</b> bagpipe) and the lyra. The Byzantine lyra, a bowed string instrument, is an ancestor of most European bowed instruments, including the violin.|$|E

5|$|Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute {{believes}} the outer planets {{show signs of}} collisions with plutoids 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers in diameter: Uranus could have been tipped off its axis by a plutoid, and Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> captured plutoid from the Kuiper belt.|$|E

5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it did, it is likely that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with supersonic speed.
