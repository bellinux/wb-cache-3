25|$|The chiffon sari {{did what}} years of fashion {{interaction}} {{had not done}} in India. It homogenised fashion across this land. Its softness, lightness and beautiful, elegant, caressing drape was ideally suited to the Indian climate. Different courts adopted their own styles of draping and indigenising the sari. In most of the courts the sari was embellished with stitching hand-woven borders in gold from Varanasi, delicate zardozi work, gota, makaish and tilla work that embellished the <b>plain</b> <b>fabric,</b> simultaneously satisfying both traditional demands and ingrained love for ornamentation. Some images of maharanis in the Deccan show the women wearing a sleeveless, richly embellished waistcoat over their blouses. The Begum of Savanur remembers how sumptuous the chiffon sari became at their gatherings. At some courts it was worn with jaali, or net kurtas and embossed silk waist length sadris or jackets. Some of them were so rich that the entire ground was embroidered over with pearls and zardozi.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To develop novel biocomposites, three {{different}} silk-fibroin <b>fabrics</b> (<b>plain</b> woven <b>fabric,</b> <b>plain</b> weft-knit <b>fabric</b> and non-woven fabric) were, respectively, blended with poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) by a solution blending method. The effects of various fabric structures on the mechanical and microstructure properties of silk-fibroin fabric reinforced (SF-fabric-reinforced) PCL biocomposites were investigated. It {{was obvious that}} the breaking strength and elongation of SF-fabric-reinforced PCL biocomposites decreased while the Young’s modulus increased. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) photographs showed that silk-fibroin fabrics were well bonded with PCL matrix. From Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction (WXRD) analysis, plain woven and <b>plain</b> weft-knit <b>fabrics</b> showed higher ability to increase the crystallinity of PCL matrix compared with non-woven fabric...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} model is presented for the compressive behaviour of <b>plain</b> weave <b>fabric</b> composites under on-axis uniaxial loading. Analysis {{is based on}} curved beams on elastic foundation approach. The contributions of all the three structural elements within the <b>plain</b> weave <b>fabric</b> composite, namely longitudinal strand, transverse strand and pure matrix region have been considered. During compressive loading, the load sharing between structural elements is worked out and the stress state throughout the composite is determined. Effect of failed structural elements is taken into account for further calculations. Compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and failure strain data has been generated for different fabric geometries for both <b>plain</b> weave <b>fabric</b> E-glass/epoxy and T 300 carbon/epoxy composites. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on typical <b>plain</b> weave <b>fabric</b> E-glass/epoxy composites for validation.

The bloomer legs, which were often made from a <b>plain</b> <b>fabric</b> for reasons of thrift, were gathered below the knee. The bloomer leg cuffs had eyelets through which crocheted cordons called “vrakothilies” were passed, thus ensuring the pleated material fit snugly around the ankles.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} {{economical}} and flexible fabrics were prepared using high-strength polyester yarns with different fabric structures, weft density {{and number of}} layers. The effect of these factors on quasi-static puncture resistance was comparatively studied. The failure mode of the fabrics was analyzed with SEM photographs. Findings indicate that the structure and the weft density affected the quasi-static puncture resistance property of the <b>fabrics,</b> the <b>plain</b> <b>fabrics</b> had better puncture resistance property than twill and satin fabrics. The max puncture force and puncture energy of the <b>plain</b> <b>fabrics</b> with 160 yarn/ 10 cm reached the max values which were 107. 43 N and 0. 44 J, respectively. The number of layers had a linear relationship to quasi-static puncture resistance. The contact pressure and friction of the probe against the fibers were the main hindrance during the quasi-static puncture process and the breakage of the fibers during the penetration {{was caused by the}} bend and tensile deformation...|$|R

40|$|The <b>plain</b> and satin <b>fabrics</b> were weaved with 66. 67 tex flax yarns. With flax fabric as the {{reinforcement}} and Unsaturated Polyester Resin (UPR) as the matrix, composites of two, {{three and}} four layers were fabricated respectively by the Vacuum Assisted Resin Infusion (VARI) technique. The wetting capability of the composites was tested firstly. The wetting rate illustrated that {{the weight of the}} composites were fast increased when immersed in the water. And the impact property of the composites after saturated in the water for different duration time was tested. The impact property of the four-layer <b>plain</b> <b>fabrics</b> composites was decreased after immersing in water for one-, two-and three-month. After reaching the minimum impact property, the impact property was found recovered after six-month water immersion. For the two- and three-layer <b>plain</b> <b>fabrics</b> specimens, the impact property was increased in the whole experiment process. For the two-layer satin fabrics specimens, the impact property was increased initially for one-month, decreased for two-month and three-month and increased instead for six-month after water immersion. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that the enhancement effect of the wet flax fibre may be over-weighed by the degradation effect of the materials. The results indicated that the materials had experienced some forms of physical damage and/or chemical degradation. The weakening of bonding between fibre and matrix and softening of matrix material were also reasons of the decreased composite property...|$|R
5000|$|The {{outlines}} of the design to be worked are often screen printed onto the fabric or can be transferred to <b>plain</b> <b>fabric</b> using modern transfer pens, containing water-soluble ink or air-soluble ink, using a lightbox and a permanent pen, or iron-on designs applied using transfer sheets. The old-fashioned [...] "pinprick and chalk" [...] or [...] "prick and pounce" [...] methods also work well. The prick and pounce method involves transferring the design outlines - printed on paper - by pricking the outline with a needle to produce perforations along the lines. Powdered chalk or pounce material is then forced through the holes onto the fabric using a felt pad or stipple brush in order to replicate the design on the material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{the effects}} of yarn parameters, on the {{bursting}} strength of the <b>plain</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> were examined {{with the help of}} artificial neural networks. In order to obtain yarns having different properties such as tenacity, elongation, unevenness, the yarns were produced from six different types of cotton. In addition to cotton type, yarns were produced in four different counts having three different twist coefficients. Artificial neural network (ANN) was used to analyze the bursting strength of the <b>plain</b> knitted <b>fabrics.</b> As independent variables, yarn properties such as tenacity, elongation, unevenness, count, twists per inch together with the fabric property number of wales and courses per cm were chosen. For the determination of the best network architecture, three levels of number of neurons, number of epochs, learning rate and momentum coefficient were tried according to the orthogonal experimental design. After the best neural network for predicting the bursting strength of the <b>plain</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> was obtained, statistical analysis of the obtained neural network was performed. Satisfactory results for the prediction of the bursting strength of the <b>plain</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> were gained {{as a result of the}} study. ...|$|R
