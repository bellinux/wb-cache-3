40|$|Based on two {{surveys of}} manufacturers, this report {{summarizes}} several automotive body die tryout buyoff criteria, rework processes, and 3 D non-contact measurement strategies. Relative to historical die tryout performance levels, {{a significant reduction}} in the number of iterations is clearly achievable through the following: Improved ability to create die compensation models to create new machine files to rework parts closer to nominal without significant unintended consequences. Changes to existing die and production source <b>part</b> <b>approval</b> processes to make better decisions about when rework is needed to produce a dimensionally acceptable body. Related to these improvements is the need for an effective business process integrating 3 DNC measurement with new <b>part</b> <b>approval</b> processes to help manufacturers reduce the number of die rework iterations.
