40|$|The porous <b>polymer</b> <b>foams</b> {{act as a}} {{template}} for neotissuegenesis in tissue engineering, and, as a reservoir for cell transplants such as pancreatic islets while simultaneously providing a functional interface with the host body. The fabrication of foams with the controlled shape, size and pore structure is of prime importance in various bioengineering applications. To this end, here we demonstrate a thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) based facile process for the fabrication of <b>polymer</b> <b>foams</b> with a controlled architecture. The setup comprises of a metallic template bar (T), a metallic conducting block (C) and a non-metallic reservoir tube (R), connected in sequence T-C-R. The process hereinafter termed as Dip TIPS, involves the dipping of the T-bar into a polymer solution, followed by filling of the R-tube with a freezing mixture to induce the phase separation of a polymer solution {{in the immediate vicinity}} of T-bar; Subsequent free-drying or freeze-extraction steps produced the <b>polymer</b> <b>foams.</b> An easy exchange of the T-bar of a spherical or rectangular shape allowed the fabrication of tubular, open- capsular and flat-sheet shaped foams. A mere change in the quenching time produced the foams with a thickness ranging from hundreds of microns to several millimeters. And, the pore size was conveniently controlled by varying either the polymer concentration or the quenching temperature. Subsequent in vivo studies in brown Norway rats for 4 -weeks demonstrated the guided cell infiltration and homogenous cell distribution through the polymer matrix, without any fibrous capsule and necrotic core. In conclusion, the results show the "Dip TIPS" as a facile and adaptable process for the fabrication of anisotropic channeled porous <b>polymer</b> <b>foams</b> of various shapes and sizes for potential applications in tissue engineering, cell transplantation and other related fields...|$|R

Nevertheless, the limitation of using foam drilling fluid is the stability of its rheological properties which would affect its lubricity characteristics. Therefore, a research study was carried out to determine the stability and effectiveness of water soluble polymers as an additive in foam drilling fluid. To produce the required and most stable foam, four types of surfactants had been tested, namely sodium dodecyl sulfate (anionic), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (cationic), T× 100 (non ionic), and n-alkyl betaines (amphoteric). Then, the water soluble polymers, namely xanthan gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, and carboxymethyl cellulose, were evaluated as a stabilizer in the said foam drilling fluid. The laboratory works involved lubricity and rheological properties tests, which were conducted at ambient condition. The experimental results showed that the use of xanthan gum with anionic surfactant produced the most stable foam drilling fluid compared to other polymers. Rheological properties of the <b>polymer</b> <b>foam</b> drilling fluid were compared with water-based mud, and it was revealed that <b>polymer</b> <b>foam</b> drilling fluid could perform as effective as the latter.

Initial conditions for this outer solution are identified through matching with the asymptotic inner solution. A numerical solution for the leading order outer equation is also presented. Investigations are carried out to explore the influence of inertia on the bubble volume, fluid pressure and the stress tensors of the foam, and to explore the effect of fluid viscosity and acoustic pressure amplitude on the final bubble volume, and the curing time.
