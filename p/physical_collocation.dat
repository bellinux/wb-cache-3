30|$|Information flow is {{accomplished}} through (1) <b>physical</b> <b>collocation</b> plus virtual supporting tools and (2) intensive conferences.|$|E
30|$|Information flow {{is common}} in <b>physical</b> <b>collocation</b> and grouping. It is also a basic way of {{coordination}} (Puranam et al., 2014). In ZGC, <b>physical</b> <b>collocation</b> and grouping are accomplished through geographical proximity. Members of ZGC {{are on the same}} street. This geographical proximity allows them to exchange information conveniently. For example, company A, which provides promotion services, and its neighbor, company B, which provides acceleration services, can coordinate effectively.|$|E
30|$|Besides common <b>physical</b> <b>collocation</b> {{and virtual}} {{supporting}} tools, {{the presence of}} conferences also {{plays a significant role}} in information flow. Conferences provide venues for the interaction of actors, exchanges of information and of different opinions (Garud, 2008). In ZGC, for various participants within the DEE and with the existence of heterogeneous fields, intensive conferences connect people and ensure the efforts from different participants can be integrated.|$|E
30|$|As to the {{integration}} of effort, the connection among agents within a DEE is important. Common methods used to advance integration in ZGC are value co-creation and <b>physical</b> and virtual <b>collocation</b> (Gulati et al., 2012; Puranam et al., 2014). Some connections are visible, while others are invisible and hard to capture. These invisible connections {{are similar to the}} routine details or hidden rules in an organization which are based on formal authority and hierarchy. In DEEs, they are more detailed and complex. We argue that enabling elements such as a supportive culture and intensive use of conferences enhance these connections and therefore, achieve integration of effort.|$|R
30|$|Culture {{influences}} {{the actions of}} people (Swidler, 1986). Culture is a critical element in a DEE (Spigel, 2015). The effect of an entrepreneurial culture shapes the actions of people within a DEE, and people sharing the same culture are connected to enforce the integration of effort. Agents in the DEE may not share the system-level goal, but they share the same culture, which is critical to shape the connection among these agents. Meanwhile, intensive conferences link numerous individuals and activities and have positive effects on the emergence of innovations in certain fields (Garud, 2008). Value co-creation and <b>physical</b> plus virtual <b>collocation</b> construct the main connection among agents, while a supportive culture and intensive conferences achieve connection so that the integration of effort is accomplished. Therefore, the supportive elements of culture and conferences are necessary for the integration of effort.|$|R
3000|$|In {{the early}} stages of ZGC, tasks were {{designed}} by the architect. This is considered a highly centralized approach (Gulati et al., 2012). When designing the digital entrepreneurship ecosystem, a system-level goal is essential. Task division needs to support this goal. The government, as the architect of ZGC, after studying the experiences of Silicon Valley, imitated the structure of Silicon Valley. Thus, main categories of tasks were designed such as acceleration centers, venture capital, entrepreneurial mentors, education resources and <b>physical</b> infrastructure, including <b>collocation</b> places, telecommunication facilities, transportation infrastructure and security protection. As an officer who participated in the designing process of ZGC stated: “In the initial stage of this project, we designed the main structure of ZGC, in which some specific members are necessary, such as acceleration centers, venture capital, collocation places and so on.” [...]...|$|R
30|$|The {{information}} flow {{refers to the}} problem with ensuring that an organization’s agents have the information needed to execute their tasks and coordinate actions with others (Puranam et al., 2014, p. 166). It constructs the linkages among agents to integrate their efforts. <b>Physical</b> <b>collocation</b> and virtual tools are the common solutions to achieving {{information flow}} (Puranam et al., 2014). In many communities, a conference {{plays a significant role}} as a prime venue for information exchange and interaction (Garud, 2008).|$|E
40|$|In {{a globalized}} world, New Product Development (NPD) becomes crucial for {{organizations}} to increase competitiveness. In order to quickly respond to dynamic customer requirements, the way organizations operate their NPD teams plays a significant role. An efficient operational method not only improves collaboration but also accelerates the NPD process. Thanks to technology innovation, {{information and communication}} technology (ICT) enables organizations to collocate teams virtually. This report comprises two case studies which use qualitative methods― interviews for research. The findings illustrate different perspectives of the NPD process and the diverse organizational structure between an electronic company and a garment manufacturing company. From these two cases, it is concluded {{a number of factors}} which reveal the major differences between physical and virtual teams. Thus, it is suggested organizations should take new product development process, organizational structure and ICT adoption into account when establishing and operationalizing NPD teams. In addition, the results illustrate that the NPD process and team collaboration are positively associated with ICT. Furthermore, both <b>physical</b> <b>collocation</b> and virtual collocation strongly correlate with ICT. Finally, this report reveals that ICT-technology supports the effective functioning of each functional teams...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} effort {{focused on}} the program management issues of the U. S. Marine Corps' Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAAV) Program. The research answered the primary question of what were the critical program management decisions during the early phases {{of the program and}} how would an analysis of these decisions affect the future of the AAAV program. Interviews were conducted with key personnel from the AAAV office and General Dynamics Land Systems. Additionally, program documents and other relevant literature were reviewed. The key findings of the research effort concluded that reducing technical risk early in program is critical; Program Managers (PMs) must influence system design as early as possible; <b>physical</b> <b>collocation</b> of Government and contractor personnel facilitates the implementation of integrated Product and Process Development (lPPD) and Integrated Product Teams (lPTs); the use of IPPD and IPTs has helped the AAAV program but personnel need to be trained before implementation; adopting an evolutionary acquisition strategy will help prevent component obsolescence prior to fielding; and PMs should use special contracting provisions to incentivize contractors to reduce total ownership costs.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} {{we deal with}} a {{stochastic}} optimal Robin boundary control problem constrained by an advection-dffusion-reaction elliptic equation with advection-dominated term. We assume that the uncertainty comes from the advection filed and consider a stochastic Robin boundary condition as control function. A stochastic saddle point system is formulated and proved to be equivalent to the first order optimality system for the optimal control problem, based on which we provide the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution {{as well as some}} results on stochastic regularity with respect to the random variables. Stabilized finite element approximations in <b>physical</b> space and <b>collocation</b> approximations in stochastic space are applied to discretize the optimality system. A global error estimate in the product of physical space and stochastic space for the numerical approximation is derived. Illustrative numerical experiments are provided...|$|R

40|$|The {{stationary}} monochromatic {{radiative transfer}} equation (RTE) is a partial differential transport equation stated on a five-dimensional phase space, the Cartesian product {{of physical and}} angular domain. We solve the RTE with a Galerkin FEM in <b>physical</b> space and <b>collocation</b> in angle, corresponding to a discrete ordinates method (DOM). To reduce {{the complexity of the}} problem and to avoid the "curse of dimension", we adapt the sparse grid combination technique to the solution space of the RTE and show that we obtain a sparse DOM which uses essentially only as many degrees of freedom as required for a purely spatial transport problem. For smooth solutions, the convergence rates deteriorate only by a logarithmic factor. We compare the sparse DOM to the standard full DOM and a sparse tensor product approach developed earlier with Galerkin FEM in physical space and a spectral method in angle. Numerical experiments confirm our finding...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} method for spatially 1. 5 -dimensional and time-dependent studies of accretion disks around black holes, that is originated {{from a combination}} of the standard pseudo-spectral method and the adaptive domain decomposition method existing in the literature, but with a number of improvements in both the numerical and physical senses. In particular, we introduce a new treatment for the connection at the interfaces of decomposed subdomains, construct an adaptive function for the mapping between the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto collocation points and the <b>physical</b> <b>collocation</b> points in each subdomain, and modify the over-simplified 1 -dimensional basic equations of accretion flows to account for the effects of viscous stresses in both the azimuthal and radial directions. Our method is verified by reproducing the best results obtained previously by Szuszkiewicz & Miller on the limit-cycle behavior of thermally unstable accretion disks with moderate viscosity. A new finding is that, according to our computations, the Bernoulli function of the matter in such disks is always and everywhere negative, so that outflows are unlikely to originate from these disks. We are encouraged to study the more difficult case of thermally unstable accretion disks with strong viscosity, and wish to report our results in a subsequent paper.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} concept and {{functions}} of collection {{from the perspective of}} the user. In-depth interviews with ten professors from a social science discipline and a natural science department provided descriptions of their information seek-ing involving material sources and their perceptions of the library collection. Par-ticipants used the following parameters in perceiving the library collection: instant availability, selectivity, <b>physical</b> <b>collocation,</b> catalog representation, user privilege, material stability, and further parameters for subcollections, including subject and format. Additional components that were important in the users ’ information en-vironment were personal collections, the Internet, and other institutions ’ collec-tions. Analysis revealed that collections provided valuable functions, such as col-locating sources for convenience and saving time and money, selectivity, narrowing the search scope to increase precision and ease of use, presenting choices, and assisting in clarification of information need. The user’s perspective demonstrates the need for user-centered and flexible, rather than library-centered and fixed, collection structures. In library and information science (LIS), the concept of collection has no rigorous definition and represents many different entities that are often seen from a library management perspective rather than from the per-spective of users. Further, since collections have long been associated with the physical library, it is uncertain how the concept of a collection can be expanded in the virtual world. The purpose of this study was to begin an exploration of what constitutes a collection, to the library user, in the current information environment, where information is increasingly made available digitally. The study explored the following issues: (1) How do users perceive collections, including the one provided by the library? What explicit and implicit parameters do they use in perceiving collections?
