50|$|<b>Phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> are {{volcanic}} eruptions resulting from interaction between magma and water. They differ from exclusively magmatic eruptions and phreatic eruptions.

It is common for a large explosive eruption to have magmatic and phreatomagmatic components.|$|R

50|$|The Gour de Tazenat is a {{volcanic}} {{lake in the}} French department of Puy-de-Dôme. It was formed by a <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption</b> about 29,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|Lake Tikub is a maar or a {{low-profile}} volcano {{created by}} <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption</b> or {{the interaction between}} groundwater and magma underneath the Earth's surface. Like the seven lakes {{in the city of}} San Pablo, Laguna, which is about 15 km away, the lake is one of the monogenetic volcanoes located in the Southwestern Luzon Volcanic field.|$|E
50|$|The Rodderberg detonated in a <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption</b> about 250,000 years ago. This {{happened}} when the magmatic plume reached the groundwater level of the Rhine (about 50m higher than today). After the explosion, the crater was filled with water that formed a maar of about 90 m depth. In the last 250,000 years this feature filled with dust and soil until it was filled up to today's level.|$|E
30|$|<b>Phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> display {{characteristics}} of magmatic eruptions and phreatic <b>eruptions.</b> <b>Phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{are driven by}} magmatic processes but also involve vaporization of exogenous water as a contributing force (Zimanowski et al. 2015). Deposits from <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> have a clear component of juvenile material that displays textural evidence for quenching and fragmentation in response to violent interaction with coolant (e.g., Zimanowski et al. 2015; Alvarado et al. 2016). Eruptive products can be dominated by juvenile material or altered/lithic material. Eruptions in which hydrothermal processes are dominant in initiating the eruption, but which entrain passive or residual magma that does not {{play a significant role}} in driving the eruption, can still be considered phreatic (e.g., Christenson et al. 2010).|$|R
5|$|Volcanic ash {{is formed}} during {{explosive}} volcanic <b>eruptions,</b> <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> and during transport in pyroclastic density currents.|$|R
5|$|<b>Phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma. They are driven from thermal contraction (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which are driven by thermal expansion) of magma when it comes in contact with water. This temperature {{difference between the two}} causes violent water-lava interactions that make up the eruption. The products of <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the ECRIS was accompanied (and in some cases preceded) by volcanic activity over {{large parts of the}} rift system that persisted into the Quaternary. The largest volcanic centres were located to the southwest of the Limagne and Bresse Grabens, the Massif Central, at the rift triple junction at the northern end of the Upper Rhine Graben, the Vogelsberg Mountains and around the Eger Graben. The last recorded volcanic activity was a <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption</b> in the Chaîne des Puys about 6,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|Cerro Overo is a maar lying at {{the foot}} of Chiliques volcano and close to Laguna Lejía, in the Antofagasta Region of {{northern}} Chile over ignimbrites of Miocene-Pliocene age. It {{is the result of a}} <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption,</b> its maximum diameter is 600 m and its depth is 80 m. The maar formed in postglacial times and erupted basalts that originated in the deep crust, with no magma chamber. The lavas are of lower crustal provenience and are among the least evolved of northern Chile.|$|E
50|$|The Hatepe {{eruption}} in 232+/-12 AD was {{the latest}} major eruption at Lake Taupo in New Zealand's Taupo Volcanic Zone. There was minor initial phreatomagmatic activity followed by the dry venting of 6 km³ of rhyolite forming the Hatepe Plinian Pumice. The vent was then infiltrated by large amounts of water causing the <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption</b> that deposited the 2.5 km3 Hatepe Ash. The water eventually stopped the eruption though large amounts of water were still erupted from the vent. The eruption resumed with phreatomagmatic activity that deposited the Rotongaio Ash.|$|E
50|$|Phreatomagmatic ash {{is formed}} by the same {{mechanisms}} across {{a wide range of}} compositions, basic and acidic. Blocky and equant clasts with low vesicule content are formed. The deposits of <b>phreatomagmatic</b> explosive <b>eruptions</b> are also believed to be better sorted and finer grained than the deposits of magmatic eruption. This {{is a result of the}} much higher fragmentation of <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{morphology}} of ash {{particles from}} <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{is controlled by}} stresses within the chilled magma which result in fragmentation of the glass to form small blocky or pyramidal glass ash particles. Vesicle shape and density play only a minor role in the determination of grain shape in <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions.</b> In this sort of eruption, the rising magma is quickly cooled on contact with ground or surface water. Stresses within the [...] "quenched" [...] magma cause fragmentation into five dominant pyroclast shape-types: (1) blocky and equant; (2) vesicular and irregular with smooth surfaces; (3) moss-like and convoluted; (4) spherical or drop-like; and (5) plate-like.|$|R
50|$|Because they erupt under ice and water, tuyas have <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{creating}} {{layers of}} breccia and hyaloclastite above of pillow lavas. If the volcano breaches {{the surface of}} the glacier it will be topped by a subaerially erupted lava plateau.|$|R
50|$|Phreatic eruptions {{typically}} include {{steam and}} rock fragments; {{the inclusion of}} lava is unusual. The temperature of the fragments can range from cold to incandescent. If molten magma is included, it is classified as a <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption.</b> These eruptions occasionally create broad, low-relief craters called maars. Phreatic explosions can be accompanied by carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide gas emissions. The former can asphyxiate at sufficient concentration; {{the latter is a}} broad spectrum poison. A 1979 phreatic eruption on the island of Java killed 140 people, most of whom were overcome by poisonous gases.|$|E
50|$|After {{nine months}} of repose, Taal {{reactivated}} on July 5, 1966 with another <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption</b> from Mount Tabaro, followed by another similar eruption on August 16, 1967. The strombolian eruptions which started five months after on January 31, 1968 produced the first historical lava fountaining witnessed from Taal. Another strombolian eruption followed a year later on October 29, 1969. The massive flows from the two eruptions eventually covered the bay created by the 1965 eruption, reaching the shore of Lake Taal. The last major activities on the volcano were the phreatic eruptions of 1976 and 1977.|$|E
50|$|On 23 June 1944 at 0815 hours, smoke {{started to}} come out of the {{fissures}} and shortly after a huge eruption followed accompanied by a thunderous roar. On 2 July 1944, the eruption became even more vigorous, and a <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption</b> occurred. On 7 July 1944, a pyroclastic surge accompanied the eruption. The surge managed to reach the northern bank of Lake Tōya, burning forests and houses in the process. By the end of October 1944, Masao Mimatsu recorded a total of seven craters, seventeen major eruptions and countless minor ones. Furthermore, centimeters of volcanic ash from the eruption had been found deposited up to one kilometer way from the volcano, while the protuberance of the ground continued. From July 1944 to August 1944, the protuberance grew by two meters on some days.|$|E
50|$|These <b>eruptions</b> are {{commonly}} <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions,</b> representing violent explosions caused by rising basaltic or andesitic magma coming {{into contact with}} abundant, shallow groundwater or surface water. Tuff rings, pyroclastic cones of primarily ash, are built by explosive disruption of rapidly cooled magma.|$|R
30|$|Aso volcano becomes {{active at}} {{intervals}} of approximately 10 – 20  years (e.g., Sudo 2001), and Nakadake {{is the most}} active cone within the historic times. The total craterous area of Nakadake comprises seven craters that are roughly aligned in a N–S direction (Japan Meteorological Agency; JMA 2013), and volcanic eruptions have been more frequently observed in the northernmost crater (i.e., the first crater of Nakadake). The major type of post-caldera eruption for Aso volcano is strombolian. Mud, phreatic, and <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> have occasionally occurred when the volcano has been particularly active or unstable (Ikebe et al. 2008). Recently, magmatic eruptions occurred from November 2014 to May 2015, followed by two major <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> occurred on September 14, 2015, and October 8, 2016 (e.g., Miyabuchi et al. 2018; Ishii et al. 2018).|$|R
50|$|A further {{control on}} the {{morphology}} and characteristics of a deposit is the water to magma ratio. It is believed that the products of <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> are fine grained and poorly sorted where the magma/water ratio is high, but {{when there is a}} lower magma/water ratio the deposits may be coarser and better sorted.|$|R
50|$|A maar is a broad, low-relief {{volcanic}} crater {{caused by}} a <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption</b> (an explosion which occurs when groundwater comes into contact with hot lava or magma). A maar characteristically fills with water to form a relatively shallow crater lake which may also be called a maar. The name comes from a Moselle Franconian dialect word used for the circular lakes of the Daun area of Germany. Maars are shallow, flat-floored craters that scientists interpret as having formed above diatremes {{as a result of}} a violent expansion of magmatic gas or steam; deep erosion of a maar presumably would expose a diatreme. Maars range in size from 60 to 8000 m across and from 10 to 200 m deep; most maars commonly fill with water to form natural lakes. Most maars have low rims composed of a mixture of loose fragments of volcanic rocks and rocks torn from the walls of the diatreme.|$|E
50|$|Gour de Tazenat is a {{volcanic}} crater formed by a <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption.</b> The {{banks of the}} lake have {{a volcanic}} crescent moon shape (north, east and south) formed by projections arranged in layers. In the stratum at the base, the basaltic volcanic projections, released as blocks, volcanic bombs and pozzolana are mixed with boulders (granite, granulite metamorphic rocks) from the base torn out by violent explosions. The bombs have a cauliflower shape, typical of phreatomagmatic eruptions due to fissures created by contact with water. The setting up of these initial projections corresponds {{to the beginning of}} the eruption when magma rises to the surface in contact with continental water. It causes heavy explosions capable of breaking fragments of crystalline basement, and the appearance of volcanic bombs in cauliflower shapes. Thereafter, water is removed and activity becomes more magmatic than phreatic. After cessation of eruptive activity, the Gour de Tazenat gradually filled with rainwater.|$|E
50|$|Ticsani or Tixani is {{a volcano}} in the Andes of Peru, about 5408 m high. It is {{situated}} in the Moquegua Region, Mariscal Nieto Province, in the districts of Cuchumbaya and San Cristóbal. Ticsani, Ubinas and Huaynaputina sit on a volcanic lineament slightly oblique to the main volcanic front, and Ticsani and Huaynaputina {{are the product of}} discrete silicic eruptions and appear to share a geochemical source. The volcano is of dacitic composition and has been K-Ar dated to be 190000 years old. The volcano was constructed in several steps, starting from lava flows and volcaniclastics. This system collapsed westward leaving a 3 km long NW-SE ridge. In the middle Holocene, three andesitic lava domes formed with explosive eruptions. These were later overlaid with brown pumice and bombs from a later <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption.</b> The activity of this system ended with the emplacement of the Ticsani lava dome. One dacitic pumice fall of 0,4 km3 has been dated ca 11600 yr BP.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} {{the exact nature of}} <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions,</b> and some {{scientists}} believe that fuel-coolant reactions may be more critical to the explosive nature than thermal contraction. Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating stress waves, widening cracks and increasing surface area that ultimately leads to rapid cooling and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.|$|R
50|$|Hyaloclastite is glass {{found with}} pillow basalts that were {{produced}} by non-explosive quenching and fracturing of basaltic glass. These are still classed as <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions,</b> as they produce juvenile clasts from {{the interaction of}} water and magma. They can be formed at water depths of >500 m, where hydrostatic pressure is high enough to inhibit vesiculation in basaltic magma.|$|R

5000|$|The volcanoes at {{the west}} end of the {{archipelago}} are in general, taller, younger, have well developed calderas, and are mostly composed of tholeiitic basalt, while those on the east are shorter, older, lack calderas, and have a more diverse composition. The ages of the islands, from west to east are 0.05 Ma for Fernandina, 0.65 Ma for Isabela, 1.10 Ma for Santiago, 1.7 Ma for Santa Cruz, 2.90 Ma for Santa Fe, and 3.2 Ma for San Cristobal. The calderas on Sierra Negra and Alcedo have active fault systems. The Sierra Negra fault is associated with a sill 2 km below the caldera. The caldera on Fernandina experienced the largest basaltic volcano collapse in history, with the 1968 <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption.</b> Fernandina has also been the most active volcano since 1790, with recent eruptions in 1991, 1995, 2005, and 2009, and the entire surface has been covered in numerous flows since 4.3 Ka. The western volcanoes have numerous tuff cones.|$|E

30|$|The {{explosive}} <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruption</b> of Kuchinoerabujima on May 29, 2015, produced {{relatively low}} temperature pyroclastic density currents (PDC) which reached a maximum distance of 2.4  km {{from the source}} crater. Partial collapse of the eruption column on the steep slope of Shindake edifice caused the PDC.|$|E
30|$|Instability of the magmatic–hydrothermal {{interface}} {{may cause}} <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> (Morrissey et al. 2000). Phreatic or phreatomagmatic explosions {{are a common}} feature {{at the end of}} the eruption cycles of the Aso volcano (Sudo et al. 2006). During the continuous ash eruptions, from November 2014 to May 2015, phreatic to <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> did not occur and the interface seemed stable. The occasional hydrothermal solution input to the degassing conduit, forming the salt fallouts, did not cause further perturbation of the interface. The southern part of the crater floor, 100  m wide, suddenly subsided by 50  m on May 3, 2015, without any significant eruptive activity. The frequency and intensity of the ash eruptions decreased thereafter, and the eruption ceased on May 21, 2015. The crater lake water subsequently recovered by June 6, 2015. The immediate recovery of the crater lake is consistent with the continuous existence of a hydrothermal system.|$|R
40|$|<b>Phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{occur when}} rising magma {{encounters}} groundwater and/or surface water, causing a steam explosion and the ejection of country rock and pyroclastic material. The predominance {{of this type}} of activity at the Ubehebe volcanic field in northern Death Valley, California, is enigmatic owing to the extremely arid climate of the region. A novel application of 10 Be surface exposure dating is presented to determine the timing of <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> at Ubehebe Crater and to test the idea that volcanism may relate to a wetter than present hydro-climate. Twelve of the fifteen ages obtained lie between 0. 8 and 2. 1 ka, while three samples give older, mid-Holocene ages. The cluster between 0. 8 and 2. 1 ka is interpreted as encompassing the interval of volcanic activity during which Ubehebe Crater was formed. The remaining older ages are inferred to date eruptions at the older neighboring craters. The main and most recent period of activity encompasses the Medieval Warm Period, an interval of prolonged drought in the American southwest, as well as slightly wetter conditions prior to the Medieval Warm Period. Phreatomagmatic activity under varied hydrologic conditions casts doubt on the idea that eruptive timing relates to a wetter hydro-climate. Instead, the presence of a relatively shallow modern water table suggests that sufficient groundwater was generally available for <b>phreatomagmatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> at the Ubehebe site, in spite of prevailing arid conditions. This and the youth of the most recent activity suggest that the Ubehebe volcanic field may constitute a more significant hazard than generally appreciated...|$|R
50|$|The lakes are maars or {{low-profile}} volcanic craters {{located in}} the San Pablo Volcanic Field. They are among the 200 small monogenetic volcanoes found along the Macolod Corridor, a rift zone between Mount Makiling and Mount Banahaw, {{which is part of}} the larger Southwestern Luzon Volcanic Field,.
