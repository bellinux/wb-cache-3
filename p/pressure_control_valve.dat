50|$|However, {{with both}} variable- and constant-flow systems, fully {{automatic}} balancing {{can enhance the}} performance of the HVAC system, eliminating any problems caused by high or excessive system pressures, including noise from the valves and, ultimately, poor control of room temperature. The way the system is balanced will also {{have a major impact on}} energy usage, by minimising pumping costs. In variable-flow systems the use of combination valves, when fitted with a 0 to 10 V, 3 point or thermal motor, integrates the three functions of motorised control valve, differential <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> and a double-regulating valve commissioning set into one product. Applications for this type of product include the control of fan-coil units, chilled beams and air-handling units in variable-volume heating and cooling systems and the control of secondary flow on plate heat exchangers. This integrated approach significantly reduces installation and commissioning costs, since the three control functions are specifically matched to ensure optimum system performance and only one valve has to be mounted in the system instead of three. The problem of high and varying pressure drops across traditional 2-port control valves is also effectively eliminated, ensuring a control-valve authority of 100%. It also saves on space, an important concern in, for example, air handling unit installations where the available plant room space for valve installation is often severely restricted.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the Electrohydraulic Power Steering system for road vehicles, using {{electronic}} <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> With an ever increasing demand for safer vehicles and fewer traffic accidents, steering-related active safety functions are becoming more common in modern vehicles. Future road vehicles will also evolve towards autonomous vehicles, with several safety, environmental and financial benefits. A key component in realising such solutions is active steering. The power steering system was initially developed to ease the driver's workload by assisting in turning the wheels. This is traditionally done through a passive open-centre hydraulic system and heavy trucks must still rely on fluid power, due to the heavy work forces. Since {{the purpose of the}} original system is to <b>control</b> the assistive <b>pressure,</b> one way would be to use proportional <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> Since these are electronically controlled, active steering is possible and with closed-centre, energy efficiency can be significantly improved on. In this work, such a system is analysed in detail with the purpose of investigating the possible use of the system for Boost curve control and position control for autonomous driving. Commercially available valves are investigated since they provide an attractive solution. A model-based approach is adopted, where simulation of the system is an important tool. Another important tool is hardware-in-the-loop simulation. A test rig of an electrohydraulic power steering system, is developed. This work has shown how proportional <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> can be used for Boost curve control and position control and what implications this has on a system level. As it turns out, the valves add {{a great deal of time}} lag and with the high gain from the Boost curve, this creates a control challenge. The problem can be handled by tuning the Boost gain, pressure response and damping and has been effectively shown through simulation and experiments. For position control, there is greater freedom to design the controller to fit the system. The pressure response can be made fast enough for this case and the time lag is much less critical...|$|R

The {{way in which}} a self-sustained oscillation is formed is surprisingly complex, even for a simplified model. In short, a wind instrumentconsists of a resonator and a generator.

The generator consists of some kind of <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve,</b> wherethe relationship between air flow and pressure is starkly non-linear.

40|$|Since {{the fuel}} {{injection}} pressure in diesel engines {{is one of}} the main parameters which determine the emissions and the fuel efficiency, a precise control algorithm for the common-rail pressure is a required priority for improving the engine performances. This paper proposes a coordinated common-rail pressure control strategy for passenger car diesel engines using a metering unit and a <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> The metering unit, which is located at the high-pressure pump, adjusts the inlet fuel flow for the common rail using a first-order polynomial equation that describes the relation between the inlet fuel flow and the outlet fuel flow for the common rail. The injected fuel flow is used as the input for the control algorithm to determine the driving current of the metering unit. The designed control strategy for the metering unit effectively reduces the rail pressure wave generated by the high-pressure pump. Furthermore, since the inlet fuel flow is adjusted according to the injected fuel flow, the proposed control algorithm shows a robust performance to the injection disturbance. The <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> located on the common rail adjusts the outlet fuel flow of the common rail. The control algorithm for the <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is designed using quantitative feedback theory to assure robustness even when the variation in the plant characteristics (such as the static gain and the time constant) is caused by the metering unit operation. Engine experiments proved that the proposed control strategy can reduce the variation in the steady-state rail pressure to less than 10 bar; in addition, the proposed rail pressure controller has a good degree of consistency under various engine operating conditions.
