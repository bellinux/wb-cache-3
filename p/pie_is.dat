5|$|Stargazy <b>pie</b> <b>is</b> a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, {{is filled}} with whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, {{appearing}} to gaze at the stars. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the <b>pie</b> <b>is</b> moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the pie crust to give the effect of leaping through water.|$|E

Many fruit and berry <b>pies</b> <b>are</b> very similar, varying only the fruit used in filling. Fillings for sweet or fruity are often mixed, such as {{strawberry}} rhubarb pie.|$|R

It is no longer a popular dish, with less than 3% of British teenagers surveyed having eaten it.|$|E
5|$|Stargazy pie (sometimes called starrey gazey pie, stargazey pie {{and other}} variants) is a Cornish dish made of baked pilchards (or sardines), along with eggs and potatoes, {{covered with a}} pastry crust. Although {{there are a few}} {{variations}} with different fish being used, the unique feature of stargazy <b>pie</b> <b>is</b> fish heads (and sometimes tails) protruding through the crust, so that they appear to be gazing skyward. This allows the oils released during cooking to flow back into the pie.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} part of the 20th century, meat <b>pies</b> <b>were</b> sold from home kitchens or from carts by street vendors. By 1967, Natchitoches meat <b>pies</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} in commercial kitchens. [...] Now, they may be ordered online.|$|R

50|$|Missionaries and explorers {{spread the}} meat-based pie dish across the globe. The English Pilgrims of the North American colonies brought the recipes {{across the ocean}} with them. The crust of the <b>pie</b> <b>was</b> useful to {{preserve}} food during the long winter months in America (just as the <b>pies</b> <b>were</b> used in antiquity). But the <b>pie</b> <b>was</b> not considered popular there until the 1800s, and today meat pies have lost their popularity to be replaced with sweet pies.|$|R
5|$|The pie {{originates}} {{from the}} fishing village of Mousehole in Cornwall. As with {{many parts of}} Cornish heritage, a legend has appeared about its origins. In this case, the <b>pie</b> <b>is</b> served to celebrate the bravery of Tom Bawcock, a local fisherman in the 16th century. The legend explains that one winter had been particularly stormy, meaning {{that none of the}} fishing boats had been able to leave the harbour. As Christmas approached, the villagers, who relied on fish as their primary source of food, were facing starvation.|$|E
5|$|Home Made Mince <b>Pie</b> <b>is</b> a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a comedy of circumstances, in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner. The focus of the humor is in a mince pie that brandy is added to {{in an attempt to}} make it more appreciable, but three people each add brandy to the pie. Everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September 27, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one pie split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Long before European contact, Cucurbita {{had been}} a major food source for the native peoples of the Americas, and the species became an {{important}} food for European settlers, including the Pilgrims, even featuring at the first Thanksgiving. Commercially produced pumpkin commonly used in pumpkin <b>pie</b> <b>is</b> most often varieties of C.moschata; Libby's, {{by far the largest}} producer of processed pumpkin, uses a proprietary strain of the Dickinson pumpkin variety of C.moschata for its canned pumpkin. Other foods that can be made using members of this genus include biscuits, bread, cheesecake, desserts, donuts, granola, ice cream, lasagna dishes, pancakes, pudding, pumpkin butter, salads, soups, and stuffing. Squash soup is a dish in African cuisine. The xerophytic species are proving useful in the search for nutritious foods that grow well in arid regions. C.ficifolia is used to make soft and mildly alcoholic drinks.|$|E
50|$|During the broadcast, Ryan's <b>pie</b> <b>was</b> {{identified}} as a key lime <b>pie.</b> However, it <b>was</b> made with ordinary limes rather than key limes, and thus was not a key lime pie. Moreover, the pies described as American-style were actually tarts. American <b>pies</b> <b>are</b> baked in a smooth, slant sides pie pan, not the fluted tart pans that were used.|$|R

25|$|Post-Irradiation Examination (<b>PIE)</b> <b>is</b> {{the study}} of used nuclear {{materials}} such as nuclear fuel. It has several purposes. It is known that by examination of used fuel that the failure modes which occur during normal use (and {{the manner in which}} the fuel will behave during an accident) can be studied. In addition information is gained which enables the users of fuel to assure themselves of its quality and it also assists in the development of new fuels. After major accidents the core (or what is left of it) is normally subject to PIE to find out what happened. One site where <b>PIE</b> <b>is</b> done is the ITU which is the EU centre for {{the study of}} highly radioactive materials.|$|E
