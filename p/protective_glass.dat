25|$|Roman Catholic sources claim many miraculous and supernatural {{properties}} for the image {{such as that}} the tilma has maintained its structural integrity over nearly 500 years against soot, candle wax, incense, constant manual veneration by devotees and the historical fact that the image was displayed without any <b>protective</b> <b>glass</b> for the first 115 years when replicas normally last only about 15 years before suffering degradation, and that it repaired itself with no external help after a 1791 accident in which nitric acid was spilled on the top right of the image, causing considerable damage but leaving the aureola of the Virgin intact.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} a {{tarantula}} walks over Bond was initially shot by pinning a bed {{to the wall}} and placing Sean Connery over it, with a <b>protective</b> <b>glass</b> between him and the spider. Director Young did not like the final results, so the scenes were interlaced with new footage featuring the tarantula over stuntman Bob Simmons. Simmons, who was uncredited for the film, described the scene as the most frightening stunt he had ever performed. The book features a scene where Honey is tortured by being tied to the ground along with crabs, but since the crabs were sent frozen from the Caribbean, they did not move much during filming, so the scene was altered to have Honey slowly drowning. Simmons also served as the film's fight choreographer, employing a rough fighting style. The noted violence of Dr. No, which also included Bond shooting Dent in cold blood, caused producers to make adaptations to get an [...] "A" [...] rating – allowing minors to enter accompanied by an adult – from the British Board of Film Classification.|$|E
500|$|Today’s {{page numbers}} were {{assigned}} to the codex by Agostino Aglio when he became the first to transcribe the manuscript in 1825/26. For this, he divided the original codex into two parts, labeled Codex A and Codex B. [...] He sequenced Codex A on the front side followed by its back side, with the same order on Codex B. Today, historians such as Helmut Deckert and Ferdinand Anders understand that a codex reading should traverse the complete front side followed by the complete back side of the manuscript, i.e., pages 1-24 followed by 46-74 and 25-45. The librarian K. C. Falkenstein adjusted the relative position of pages for “esthetical reasons” in 1836, resulting in today’s two similar length parts. While deciphering the codex, the [...] librarian E. W. Förstemann noticed an error in Aglio’s page assignment of the sheets 1/45 and 2/44, so he correctly reassigned Aglio’s pages 44 and 45 to become pages 1 and 2. The reversal of the sheets 6/40, 7/39 and 8/38 is due to an error when the sheets were returned to their <b>protective</b> <b>glass</b> cabinet after drying from the water damage due to the bombing of Dresden in 1945.|$|E
