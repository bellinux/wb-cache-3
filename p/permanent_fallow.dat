40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in an {{experimental}} sweet cherry plantation, established in the spring of 1991 at the Institute of Agriculture - Kyustendil, Bulgaria on Chromic Luvisols (LVch), heavy loamy soil. It was found that with the application of considerable amounts of phosphorous and potassium (1200 kg/ha P 2 O 5 and 1000 kg/ha K 2 O) with the pre-planting mineral fertilization was provided a moderate supply of the soil, up to the fourth year after planting. Afterwards soil phosphorous balance was with a negative value. With the green manuring after the rye-peas mixture growing, for the period of investigation 9. 8 - 10. 5 kg/m 2 fresh plant matter was incorporated in the soil, containing 0. 84 - 0. 88 % P 2 O 5. Significantly higher quantity plant matter - about 28. 5 kg/m 2 was removed by the interrows crops and the phosphorous content was from 0. 75 to 0. 78 % of the dry matter content. As a whole, average for the experimental period less supplied with phosphorous were the leaves of the cultivar Bing at the lower nitrogen (N 100) fertilizer norm.

40|$|An {{ecological}} monitoring {{was carried out}} {{to find out how}} the vegetation succeeded on permanent set-aside fields over 18 and 21 years, respectively. Furthermore, the vegetation of field margins under permanent monitoring was surveyed over 10 and 12 years, respectively. The surveys took place on diluvial sites in the federal states Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Brandenburg. Plant diversity depends on the site, landscape and period of set-aside. Even after an extended period of setaside a few rare arable weeds like Anthoxanthum aristatum (annual vernal grass) and Consolida regalis (field larkspur) were found. A poor sandy site has been colonized by an interesting flora including plants typical of sandy dry meadow. Field margins adjacent to fields or <b>permanent</b> <b>fallows</b> partly showed considerable plant diversity. It depends on the site, landscape and management of adjacent fields and includes the sporadic but also permanent occurrence of arable weeds like Consolida regalis, Veronica triphyllos (fingered speedwell) or Camelina microcarpa (little-pod false flax). The long-term vegetative monitoring shows that permanent set-aside fields may produce remarkable plant diversity. However, 20 -years set-aside with self-greening supports the maintenance of rare arable weeds to a very limited extent only. Field margins could be used as refuge for arable weeds...|$|R
40|$|In Nigeria’s drylands, {{profitable}} {{crop production}} requires adequate soil fertility management. This study examines {{the effects of}} farmer-managed practices on soil fertility in Sabke catchment of the drylands. Seven sites under <b>permanent</b> cropland, <b>fallow</b> land, grassland, shrubland, orchard land, intercropping land and woodland distributed on four transects were selected across the catchment. At every site, five replicate soil samples were collected from 0 - 15 cm (topsoil) and 20 - 30 cm (subsoil) and analysed for C, N, P, Ca, Mg, K and Na. Higher topsoil values {{of most of the}} properties were observed under cropland and intercropping sites. The two cultivated plots receive annual applications of organic manure in addition to chemical fertilizer and crops residue retention while the other plots are not. Thus, improvement in soil organic matter and nutrients would be expected in soils of the area with high rate of application of manure and chemical fertilizer, and retention of crop residue...|$|R
50|$|Several types if {{stakeholders}} {{are recognized}} as potential participants in a water market, including agricultural users, industrial, and urban, {{as well as those}} who value in stream uses for recreation, habitat preservation, or other environmental benefits. Water rights holders—particularly agricultural users—can make water available for trade by employing water conservation technology, through <b>permanent</b> <b>fallowing,</b> seasonal fallowing, shifts in crop choice, or voluntary water conservation (for example, residential water conservation practices). Trades can then be long-term leases, permanent transfers, short-term leases, or a callable transfer, which is the ability of a city to lease water under specified drought conditions. There are other flexible trade tools used by urban areas, such as water leasebacks, wherein the municipality purchases the water right from agricultural users and then can lease it back to those users in non-drought years, as a way to ensure the urban water supply. Banking water is a related tool, wherein water is stored underground in non-drought years to be used in drought years, though this is not to be confused with water banks, which are brokering institutions. Water ranching is a method of accessing unclaimed water rights that are legally bound to land rights. While many areas have detached these two types of rights from one another, some still prohibit the severing of rights and thus continue to promote water ranching. In the event of water ranching, the groundwater removed from the property is often much greater than that which would be used for average agricultural use, which can be harmful to the ecosystems which rely on it. This practice also creates inefficiency in the dispersal of land and water access ownership, as non-agricultural parties, such as municipalities, may purchase a plot of land simply for its water.Water credits: The idea is to have a tradable certificate which notifies the quantity of water saved by an institution, organization or an individual this would help in maximum utilization of every available drop of water. It may be defined as a permit that allows the holder to trade the conserved water in the international market at their current market price.|$|R
40|$|In arable {{cropping}} systems, {{reduced or}} conservation tillage practices are linked with improved soil quality, C retention and higher microbial biomass, but most long-term studies rarely focus on depths greater than 15 cm nor allow comparison of microbial community responses to agricultural practices. We investigated microbial community structure {{in a long-term}} field trial (12 -years, Lincoln, New Zealand) established in a silt-loam soil over four depth ranges down to 30 cm. Our objectives were to investigate the degree of homogenisation of soil biological and chemical properties with depth, and to determine the main drivers of microbial community response to tillage. We hypothesised that soil microbiological responses would depend on tillage depth, observed by a homogenisation of microbial community composition within the tilled zone. Tillage treatments were mouldboard plough and disc harrow, impacting soil to ∼ 20 and ∼ 10 cm depth, respectively. These treatments were compared to a no-tillage treatment and two control treatments, both permanent pasture and <b>permanent</b> <b>fallow.</b> Bacterial and fungal communities collected from the site were not impacted by the spatial location of sampling across the study area but were affected by physicochemical changes associated with tillage induced soil homogenisation and plant presence. Tillage treatment effects on both species richness and composition were more evident for bacterial communities than fungal communities, and were greater at depths < 15  cm. Homogenisation of soil and changing land management appears to redistribute both microbiota and nutrients deeper in the soil profile while consequences for soil biogeochemical functioning remain poorly understood...|$|E
40|$|Physical (nine characteristics) and {{chemical}} (14) properties {{of red and}} black soils are described: sand, silt, clay, fine clay, BD, COLE, HC (hydraulic conductivity) and WDC; pH (H 2 O and KCl), EC, OC, CaCO 3, clay CO 3, extractable Ca, Mg, Na, K, CEC, clay CEC, BS and ESP are described in three ecosystems, namely sub-humid (moist and dry) [SH (m) and SH (d) ], semi-arid (moist and dry) [SA (m) and SA (d) ] and arid in SAT, India. Clay contents vary between 30 % in arid system to 82 % in sub-humid (dry) system and 79 % in semi-arid (dry) system. The red soils contain 8 –- 55 % clay. Fine clay (<b>permanent</b> <b>fallow</b> (grassland), horticultural system > agricultural system > wasteland. Surface soils of agricultural and horticultural systems store higher SIC as compared to other systems. The surface soils of semi-arid (moist) show higher SOC under agricultural system due to inclusion of sun hemp for green manuring in crop rotation. The average SOC values follow the trend of SA (m) (0. 825 %) > SH (d) (0. 804 %) > SH (m) (0. 642 %) > SA (d) (0. 633 %) > arid (0. 594 %) for black soils under agricultural system. The values of SOC follow the trend of SH (m) (1. 35) > SA (d) (0. 84) > SA (m) (0. 70) for the red soils used for cultivation. The level of SIC values in surface soils under agricultural system followed the trend of arid (2. 34 %) > SH (d) (1. 06 %) > SA (m) (0. 99 %) > SA (d) (0. 94 %) > SH (m) (0. 54 %) for black soils. In red soils, CaCO 3 in general is not found except in soils of semi-arid (dry) bioclimatic system. The SOC in surface horizon under agricultural systems shows higher values for cereal-based system (0. 79 %), followed by soybean systems (0. 70 %) and cotton-based systems (0. 68 %). Interestingly, the SIC values {{have been found to}} be the highest in cotton-based systems (1. 53 %), followed by soybean-based systems (0. 66 %) and cereal-based systems (0. 29 %). This trend is opposite to that of the corresponding SOC values. With the help of data generated, 14 systems (five in cotton, three in soybean, four in cereals, one in horticulture and one under forest) have been identified as ideal for organic carbon sequestration, keeping in view the existing level of management practices vis-à-vis soil health...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{greenhouse gas}} (GHG) savings {{resulting from the}} displacement of fossil energy sources by bioenergy mostly hinges on the uncertainty on the magnitude of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from arable soils occuring during feedstock production. These emissions are broadly related to fertilizer nitrogen input rates, but largely controlled by soil and climate factors which makes their estimation highly uncertain. Here, {{we set out to}} improve estimates of N 2 O emissions from bioenergy feedstocks by using ecosystem models and measurements and modeling of atmospheric N 2 O in the greater Paris (France) area. Ground fluxes were measured in two locations to assess the effect of soil type and management, crop type (including ligno- cellulosics such as triticale, switchgrass and miscanthus), and climate on N 2 O emission rates and dynamics. High-resolution maps of N 2 O emissions were generated over the Ile-de-France region (around Paris) with two ecosystem models using geographical databases on soils, weather data, land-use and crop management. The models were tested against ground flux measurements and the emission maps were fed into the atmospheric chemistry-transport model CHIMERE. The maps were tested by comparing the CHIMERE simulations with time series of N 2 O concentrations measured at various heights above the ground in two locations in 2007. The emissions of N 2 O, as integrated over the region, were used in a life-cycle assessment of representative biofuel pathways: bioethanol from wheat and sugar-beet (1 st generation), and miscanthus (2 nd generation chain); bio-diesel from oilseed rape. Effects related to direct and indirect land-use changes (in particular on soil carbon stocks) were also included in the assessment based on various land-use scenarios and literature references. The potential deployment of miscanthus was simulated by assuming it would be grown on the current sugar-beet growing area in Ile-de-France, or by converting land currently under <b>permanent</b> <b>fallow.</b> Compared to the standard methodology currently used in LCA, based on fixed emissions for N 2 O, the use of model-derived estimates leads to a 10 to 40 % reduction in the overall life-cycle GHG emissions of biofuels. This emphasizes the importance of regional factors in the relationship between agricultural inputs and emissions (altogether with biomass yields) in the outcome of LCAs. When excluding indirect land-use change effects (iLUC), 1 st generation pathways enabled GHG savings ranging from 50 to 73 % compared to fossile-derived equivalents, while this figure reached 88 % for 2 nd generation bioethanol from miscanthus. Including iLUC reduced the savings to less than 5 % for bio-diesel from rapeseed, 10 to 45 % for 1 st generation bioethanol and to 60 % for miscanthus. These figures apply to the year 2007 and should be extended to a larger number of years, but the magnitude of N 2 O emissions was similar between 2007, 2008 and 2009 over the Ile de France region...|$|E
40|$|The {{rainfall}} erosivity (R) {{and soil}} erodibility (K) factors of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) were determined on two {{sites in the}} Colombian Cauca Department over a five year period when rainfall was mostly lower than average. The {{results showed that the}} high erosion potential of the soils can be attributed more to high rain erosivity than soil erodibility. The R factor explained between 59 and 81 % of the variation in soil loss recorded on continuously clean-tilled fallow plots. The erodibility of Inceptisols in the study region is classified as low. Values for soil erodibility (K) ranged from 0. 012 to 0. 015 (measured in SI units) in the fifth year of <b>permanent</b> bare <b>fallowing.</b> K factors were higher in the rainy than in the dry season. Soils, previously under grass vegetation, were very resistant to erosion {{in the first two years}} of bare fallowing. In the third year erodibility increased sharply and continued to increase steadily until the sixth year. K factors predicted by the USLE nomograph underestimated the empirically-determined erodibility of these highly aggregated clay soils. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Implementation of ley {{grassland}} into {{crop rotation}} could have positive influence in soil ecosystem {{services such as}} C storage. The periodical changes of land-use plus the in situ labelling given {{by the introduction of}} maize crops under ley grassland induce differences in soil organic matter (SOM) that could be traced either by stable isotopes or by the characterization of plant biomarkers such as lignin derived phenols. Evaluation of SOM dynamics is often limited by the complexity of soil matrix. To override these limitations, a hierarchical approach to decompose the soil mosaic into aggregates has been proposed in this study. Soil and plant samples were collected from a long-term experimental area in Lusignan (western France). Soils from four different treatments (bare <b>fallow,</b> <b>permanent</b> maize, permanent grassland, and ley grassland based on 6 years of grassland followed by 3 years of maize) were sampled, fractionated into water stable aggregates, and finally analysed for carbon, nitrogen, and lignin contents, as well as for 13 C isotopic signature. Soils under ley and permanent grassland stored higher amount of SOM in larger aggregates and preserved more efficiently the lignin stocks than the corresponding samples under permanent maize. Contemporary, finer fraction of ley grassland showed higher mean residence time of organic carbon, probably due to a legacy effect of the previous years under grassland. Even if maize derived SOM was identified, the grassland footprint was still dominating the ley grassland soils, as described by the principal component analysis. Strong correlation between these results and the quality and stoichiometry of the vegetal litter returned to soil were found, evidencing the needs for a comprehensive evaluation at a molecular level of all the parameters modified by land-use changes, including tillage, to understand the potential for carbon storage of different agroecosystems...|$|R
