5|$|The Fragile Yellow Arc of Fragrance was {{the first}} script sent by Moris Farhi. It was one episode long and was a calling card piece never seriously pitched for production. This story {{never made it to}} the <b>production</b> <b>stage,</b> and was {{included}} in the 2009 publication of Farhi's script for Farewell Great Macedon. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010.|$|E

In November 2011, reports began that the film's name might be changed again to Muqtasar. At the time Kohli stated only {{that they had not}} yet decided the title of the film. Such speculation was believed to be a marketing choice to increase curiosity for the film.|$|E

5|$|The Tornado was {{developed}} and built by Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri-national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), MBB of West Germany, and Aeritalia of Italy. It first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979–1980. Due to its multirole design, {{it was able to}} replace several different fleets of aircraft in the adopting air forces. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) became the only export operator of the Tornado in addition to the three original partner nations.

5|$|After {{studying}} {{architecture and}} then drama, Cartier {{began his career}} as a screenwriter and then film director in Berlin, working for UFA Studios. After a brief spell in the United States he moved to the United Kingdom in 1935. Initially failing to gain a foothold in the British film industry, he began working for BBC Television in the lae 1930s (among other productions he was involved in the making of Rehearsal for a Drama, BBC 1939). The outbreak of war, however, meant that his contract was terminated; his television play The Dead Eye was stopped in the <b>production</b> <b>stage.</b> After the war, he occasionally worked for British films before he was again hired by the BBC in 1952. He soon became one of the public service broadcaster's leading directors and went on to produce and direct over 120 productions in the next 24 years, ending his television career with the play Loyalties in 1976.|$|E

25|$|Bill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid–1970s, {{said after}} the first series was {{produced}} that the show was {{a prime example of}} the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them, but, trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead.

25|$|The {{design work}} was delayed {{and the final}} trial <b>production</b> <b>stage</b> did not begin until June 2006.

This was first delayed to 21 September 2008 and finally took place on 28 November 2008 at Shanghai's Dachang Airfield. The aircraft completed a long-distance test flight on 15 July 2009, flying from Shanghai to Xi'an in 2hours 19minutes, over a distance of 1,300km. The second ARJ21 (serial number 102) completed the same test flight route on 24 August 2009. The third aircraft (serial number 103) similarly completed its first test flight on 12 September 2009. The fourth aircraft (CN 104) flew by November 2010. By August 2011, static, flutter and crosswind flight tests had been completed. Deliveries to customers were expected to begin in late 2010, starting with Chengdu Airlines.|$|E
25|$|The FARC are {{involved}} in all stages of production, from coca cultivation to wholesale drug trade. In the 1990s, the FARC successfully co-opted some cocalero (coca cultivators) movements, and was originally primarily involved in the <b>production</b> <b>stage</b> while paramilitary groups dominated the more lucrative drug trafficking. However, by {{the second half of}} the 1990s, the dismantling of the Medellín and Cali cartels and the dissolution of the Soviet Union triggered the entrance of the FARC into the drug trafficking business. A recent investigation by the Colombian attorney general's office concluded that FARC units {{are involved}} both directly and indirectly in the cultivation, processing and distribution - directly as owners of crops, laboratories, crystallization workshops as well as the distribution corridors contacting clients including national and international drug cartels; indirectly by providing security to crops or labs, organizing peasants in anti-eradication marches, setting product prices, charging taxes on the product or by providing security to third-party drug traffickers in return for a fee. The study also estimated at over US$22,900,000 (66,277,978,247 pesos) the guerrilla's revenues from narcotics and related taxes between 1995 and 2014.|$|E

From an idea of Desmond Saunders, a long-standing collaborator who had an interest in aviation, the Andersons-based the plot on the destruction of the British R101 in 1930. [...] Gerry Anderson researched airship history by reading books on the R101, the R100 and the Graf Zeppelin.

500|$|As {{the story}} {{approached}} the <b>production</b> <b>stage</b> in early 1997, {{it was unclear}} whether Pixar would produce the film, as the entire team of 300 was busy working on A Bug's Life for a 1998 release. [...] The Interactive Products Group, with a staff of 95, had its own animators, art department, and engineers. Under intense time pressure, they had put out two successful CD-ROM titles the previous year — The Toy Story Animated StoryBook and The Toy Story Activity Center. Between the two products, the group had created as much original animation as there was in Toy Story itself. Steve Jobs made the decision to shut down the computer games operation and the staff became the initial core of the Toy Story 2 production team.|$|E

Although Independent film {{producers}} vowed {{they would give}} [...] "no thought to Mr. Joe Breen or anything he represents", they caved on their stance within one month of making it. The major studios still owned most of the successful theaters in the country, and studio heads such as Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures had already agreed to stop making indecent films. In several large cities audiences booed when the Production seal appeared before films. But the Catholic Church was pleased, and in 1936 Pope Pius XI stated that the U.S. film industry [...] "has recognized and accepts its responsibility before society." [...] The Legion condemned zero films produced by the MPPDA between 1936 and 1943.|$|E

500|$|As {{development}} {{neared the}} <b>production</b> <b>stage,</b> Q*bert underwent location tests in local arcades under its preliminary title , before being widely distributed. According to Jeff Lee, his oldest written record attesting {{to the game}} being playable as [...] in a public location, a Brunswick bowling alley, dates back to September 11, 1982. Gottlieb also conducted focus groups, in which the designers observed players through a one-way mirror. The control scheme received a mixed reaction during play testing; some players adapted quickly while others found it frustrating. Initially, Davis was worried players would not adjust to the different controls; some players would unintentionally jump off the pyramid several times, reaching a game over in about tenseconds. Players, however, became accustomed to the controls after playing several rounds of the game. The different responses to the controls prompted Davis to reduce the game's level of difficulty—a decision that he would later regret.|$|E
