50|$|The {{density of}} the {{compacted}} powder increases {{with the amount of}} pressure applied. Typical pressures range from 80 psi to 1000 psi (0.5 MPa to 7 MPa), pressures from 1000 psi to 1,000,000 psi have been obtained. Pressure of 10 tons/in² to 50 tons/in² (150 MPa to 700 MPa) are commonly used for metal powder compaction. To attain the same compression ratio across a component with more than one level or height, it is necessary to work with multiple lower <b>punches.</b> <b>A</b> cylindrical <b>workpiece</b> is made by single-level tooling.

50|$|Punch tooling (punch and die) {{is often}} made of {{hardened}} steel or tungsten carbide. A die {{is located on}} the opposite side of the workpiece and supports the material around the perimeter of the hole and helps to localize the shearing forces for a cleaner edge. There is a small amount of clearance between the punch and the die to prevent the punch from sticking in the die and so less force is needed to make the hole. The amount of clearance needed depends on the thickness, with thicker materials requiring more clearance, but the clearance is always less than the thickness of the workpiece. The clearance is also dependent on the hardness of the workpiece. The punch press forces the <b>punch</b> through <b>a</b> <b>workpiece,</b> producing <b>a</b> hole that has a diameter equivalent to the punch, or slightly smaller after the punch is removed. All ductile materials stretch to some extent during punching which often causes the punch to stick in the workpiece. In this case, the punch must be physically pulled back out of the hole while the work is supported from the punch side, and this process is known as stripping. The hole walls will show burnished area, rollover, and die break and must often be further processed. The slug from the hole falls through the die into some sort of container to either dispose of the slug or recycle it.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: It occurs {{frequently}} in robotic applications that a robot manipulates <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> which {{is free to}} slide on a work surface. Because the pressure distribution supporting the workpiece on the work surface cannot in general be known, {{the motion of the}} workpiece cannot be calculated uniquely.

Here we find the locus of centers of rotation of <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> for all possible pressure distributions. The results allow a quantitative understanding of open-loop robot motions which guarantee the alignment of <b>a</b> <b>workpiece.</b> Several sample problems are solved using the results, including the distance that a flat "fence " or robot finger must push <b>a</b> polygonal <b>workpiece</b> to assure that a facet of the workpiece comes into alignment with the fence...|$|R

40|$|The main {{research}} {{topic of}} this dissertation thesis {{deals with the}} influence of the working accuracy related to large CNC machines on the required workpiece properties. The state-of-the art has constantly been developed and the customer’s requirements directed to manufacturers of the machine tools are increasingly demanding. There is required a high accuracy, reliability, shortening delivery times etc. The manufacturer is expected to fulfill all the customer’s requirements. The machining accuracy is dependent, among others, on the positioning accuracy of a machine tool that represents the position of the cutting tool relative to <b>a</b> <b>workpiece.</b> The accuracy of a particular machine tool is therefore a limiting factor concerned with reaching the highest accuracy and quality of <b>a</b> <b>workpiece.</b> Acceptance test procedures are initially realized within a manufacturing shop floor and then within a customer environment. The main subject of the testing procedures is to verify. basic properties of a machine tool such as basic dimensions of a machine, strokes in all respective coordinates, machine travels and spindle speeds. A machining of <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> with <b>a</b> desired precision specified by the customer is also performed. In this thesis, a new methodology to calculate and determine errors concerned with machining on vertical lathes is proposed with the aim of predicting the machining accuracy of CNC machine tools. The objective of this work was to determine the influence of machining accuracy of a CNC machine in connection with a subsequent geometrical accuracy of <b>a</b> <b>workpiece.</b> Considered position of a tool relative to <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> will be affected by errors concerned with a kinematical inaccuracy, geometrical errors and errors related to machining forces. A vertical lathe SKIQ 30 produced by TOSHULIN, a. s. {{has been used as a}} testing machine on which the proposed methodology has been verified. During processing various calculations in this thesis there has been found out that the machining inaccuracy of the machine – main topic of interest – is influenced by the machining conditions such as cutting conditions, material to be machined and even the setting of working positions of the machine. For instance, a position of the cross slide is determined by <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> height and <b>a</b> position of the lathe carriage that is determined by <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> diameter and <b>a</b> travel of the slide that is also determined by <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> height. It can be stated then that to predict the machining accuracy of work pieces, it is important to know the behavior of the machine in its all range of working envelope. Based on the information acquired about the behavior of the machine, it can be determined an appropriate position for <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> setting that allows utilizing the maximum reachable accuracy with respect to the stiffness and geometrical accuracy of the machine tool. An appropriate setting of initial working position may influence the subsequent geometrical accuracy of <b>a</b> <b>workpiece...</b>|$|R

These linkages belong to a class called composite serial/in-parallel manipulators.
