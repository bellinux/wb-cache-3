In typical applications, the <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> expanded <b>detonation</b> products gases is modeled by a Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) function: P{sub JWL} = f(v,s{sub CJ}); constants in that function are fit to cylinder test data.

For example, explosions inherently involve shock reflections from surfaces; this changes the entropy of the products, and in such situations the JWL function provides no information on the products states. In addition, most explosives are not oxygen balanced, so if hot detonation products mix with air, they after-burn, releasing the heat of reaction via a turbulent combustion process.

In the present study, an experimental investigation of the direct initiation <b>of</b> gaseous <b>detonations</b> by a line source of condensed explosives (detonating cord) is presented. Due to the high velocity <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> in the condensed explosive cord (6 [...] 7 km/s), the rapid chemical energy release along its length generates a quasi-cylindrical blast wave in the surrounding combustible mixture. For a sufficiently strong detonating cord, the generated blast wave is observed to decay to a stable Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) conical detonation. Below a certain critical energy, the blast wave decays to low velocities without initiating detonation.
