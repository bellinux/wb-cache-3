5|$|Himmler began {{developing}} {{the notion of}} a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only felt he could no longer be a member, but came to consider the church's political <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> a danger to the state.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{given that}} both {{population}} and prosperity increased substantially in this period, economic recovery in Byzantium {{appears to have}} been strengthening the economic basis of the state. This helps to explain how the Komnenian emperors, Manuel Komnenos in particular, were able to project their <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> so widely at this time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{decentralization}} {{of state}} power within the provinces occurred in the early Ming, the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s. By the late Ming dynasty, there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys, a system which reined in the <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> of the military by the civil establishment.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{industrial}} unrest, trade unions for black workers were instituted in 1946, though they lacked <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence.</b> Workers at the UMHK continued to demand higher wages, and strikes were {{common in the}} colony for the next decade. Nevertheless, both wages and living conditions improved significantly {{in the years after}} the war. The war began a second wave of industrialisation that lasted right up to Congolese independence in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived close {{together}} in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence,</b> some people make offerings to them as to a deity.|$|E

Upon his return, Harry, Ron, and Hermione learn that his mission, which was mostly unsuccessful, was to seek out the last giants to stop them from joining Lord Voldemort.

5|$|The Olympic Games {{reached their}} zenith in the 6th and 5thcenturiesBC, but then {{gradually}} declined in importance as the Romans gained <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> in Greece. While {{there is no}} scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393AD, when the emperor Theodosius I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated. Another date commonly cited is 426AD, when his successor, Theodosius II, ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{deals on}} a {{personal}} level with the change in Bond from a depressed man in mourning, to a man of action bent on revenge, to an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman. Through the mouths of his characters, Fleming also examines the decline of post-World WarII British <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence,</b> notably in relation to the United States. The book was popular with the public, with pre-orders in the UK totalling 62,000; critics were more muted in their reactions, generally delivering mixed reviews of the novel.|$|E
50|$|This co-existence of a Head of State {{with real}} <b>powers</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> with a prime {{minister}} responsible before Parliament was dubbed by many Brazilian political scientists as parlamentarismo às avessas (backwards parliamentarism), a criticism corresponding to their view that, in the parliamentary system created by Emperor Pedro II, the Chamber of Deputies was the weaker party, and {{the survival of the}} Cabinet depended more on the confidence of the Emperor than in that of Parliament.|$|R

5|$|Another {{stress test}} for German–Japanese {{relations}} was the Russo-Japanese War of 1904/05, during which Germany strongly supported Russia. This circumstance triggered the Japanese foreign ministry to proclaim that any ship delivering coal to Russian vessels within {{the war zone}} would be sunk. After the Russo-Japanese War, Germany insisted on reciprocity in the exchange of military officers and students, and in the following years, several German military officers were sent to Japan to study the Japanese military, which, after its victory over the tsarist army became a promising organization to study. However, Japan's growing <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> also caused increased distrust on the German side.|$|E
5|$|By 1941, Göring was at {{the peak}} of his <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence,</b> and Hitler {{designated}} him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the Second World War progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of German cities and resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering it an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.|$|E
5|$|From the 17th century onward, the Enlightenment {{questioned}} the <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> of the Catholic Church over Western society. In the 18th century, {{writers such as}} Voltaire and the Encyclopédistes wrote biting critiques of both religion and the Catholic Church. One target of their criticism was the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV of France, which ended a century-long policy of religious toleration of Protestant Huguenots. The French Revolution of 1789 brought about a shifting of powers from the Church to the State, destruction of churches {{and the establishment of}} a Cult of Reason. In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte's General Louis Alexandre Berthier invaded Italy, imprisoning Pope Pius VI, who died in captivity. Napoleon later re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801. The end of the Napoleonic Wars brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} factors of the {{traditional}} cultural energy of Iquitos is Amazonian mythology, which has a range of characters, identified by folklore in imaginary beings.

The dance and music, a mix of indigenous and mestizo heritage {{are closely related to}} the meanings of mythology, and also with the life of the citizen and Amazonian villager.|$|R
5000|$|The pre-Islamic period {{ended with}} the conquest of {{northern}} Afghanistan by Arab Muslims (651-661 AD). The area [...] "turned into a vast battlefield as the two great Arab and Persian cultures battled for not only political and geographical supremacy but ideological supremacy." [...] As a result, centuries of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity and indigenous pagan cults were swept away. Various Islamic dynasties rose to <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influenced</b> the locals. They included the Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Seljuks, and Ghurids.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} years of Anne's reign, the Whigs gained more <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> {{at the expense of the}} Tories. In his {{capacity}} as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, George held influence in parliamentary boroughs on the south coast of England, which he used to support Whig candidates in the general election of 1705. In that year's election for Speaker of the House of Commons, George and Anne supported a Whig candidate, John Smith. George instructed his secretary, George Clarke, who was a Member of Parliament, to vote for Smith, but Clarke refused, instead supporting the Tory candidate William Bromley. Clarke was sacked, and Smith was elected.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Khrushchev's ousting, three members were {{elected to the}} Presidium: Alexander Shelepin, the Chairman of the State Control Commission; Petro Shelest, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine; and Kirill Mazurov, a First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. While Brezhnev may have been General Secretary, {{he did not have}} a majority in the Presidium; when Kosygin and Podgorny agreed on policy, which was not often the case, Brezhnev found himself in the minority. Brezhnev could only count on three to four votes in the Presidium: Suslov, who often switched sides, Kirilenko, Pelše and Dmitry Polyansky. Brezhnev and Kosygin often disagreed on policy; Brezhnev was a conservative while Kosygin was a modest reformer. Kosygin, who had begun his premiership as Brezhnev's equal, lost much <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> within the Presidium when he introduced the 1965–1971 Soviet economic reform.|$|E
5|$|On {{moving into}} , Thatcher {{introduced}} {{a series of}} political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles {{in the wake of the}} Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt in 1984.|$|E
50|$|During {{the colonial}} era, {{the powers of}} Europe sought to carve new colonies for themselves. This was made {{possible}} geographically because West Africa's coast is on the Atlantic Ocean, making it both open to cultural <b>and</b> trade <b>influences,</b> {{as well as to}} conquest by sea. West Africa is rich in many precious metals, minerals and products, which invites the interest and competition of outside <b>powers</b> <b>and</b> <b>influences.</b> There were some bloody conflicts in the 20th century when some of these nations fought against the colonial powers, such as during the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence (1963-1974).|$|R
50|$|His work {{is focused}} on searching for beauty in desolation and destruction. Baltz's images {{describe}} {{the architecture of the}} human landscape: offices, factories and parking lots.

His minimalistic photographs in the trilogy Ronde de Nuit, Docile Bodies, and Politics of Bacteria, picture the void of the other. In 1974 he captured the anonymity and the relationships between inhabitation, settlement and anonymity in The New Industrial Parks near Irvine, California (1974).|$|R
50|$|In Indonesian history, {{there are}} records of some {{prominent}} women that held <b>and</b> exercised considerable <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influences</b> within their society, despite usually reserved only for elite ruling class.

5|$|The orphanage {{provided}} both {{academic and}} vocational training to orphaned {{boys and girls}} from Palestine, Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Germany, graduating students skilled in such trades as tailoring, shoemaking, engraving, carpentry, metalworking, pottery, painting, printing, farming, and gardening. In 1903 a {{school for the blind}} was opened on the premises, including dormitories, classrooms and vocational workshops. The orphanage also operated its own printing press and bindery; flour mill and bakery; laundry and clothing-repair service; carpentry; pottery factory; tree and plant nursery; and brick and tile factory. Located on high ground and surrounded by a high stone wall, the orphanage's distinctive onion-dome tower, multistory buildings, and decorative facades exuded the <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> of European Christians in Jerusalem in the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|The same year, Arsenal became {{embroiled in}} a scandal; footballers' pay {{at the time was}} limited by a maximum wage, but an FA enquiry found that Charlie Buchan had {{secretly}} received illegal payments from Arsenal as an incentive to sign for the club. Sir Henry Norris was indicted for his part and banned from football, but Chapman escaped punishment, and with the autocratic Norris replaced by the more benign Samuel Hill-Wood, Chapman's <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> within the club increased, allowing him control over all aspects of the club's business. He persevered in building the team, strengthening his attacking lineup with the signings of David Jack in 1928, and Alex James and Cliff Bastin in 1929. As at his previous clubs, Chapman worked on improving the defence, notably through the signings of Herbie Roberts and Eddie Hapgood at centre half and left back respectively.|$|E
5|$|The story centres on a plot by SMERSH, the Soviet {{counter-intelligence}} agency, {{to assassinate}} Bond {{in such a}} way as to discredit both him and his organisation. As bait, the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk and the Spektor, a Soviet decoding machine. Much of the action takes place in Istanbul and on the Orient Express. The book was inspired by Fleming's visit to Turkey on behalf of The Sunday Times to report on an Interpol conference; he returned to Britain by the Orient Express. From Russia, with Love deals with the East–West tensions of the Cold War, and the decline of British <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> in the post-Second World War era.|$|E
