Fourteen patients underwent limb salvage operations with tumor prosthesis arthroplasty, 6 with resection-arthrodesis, 4 with wide resection, and 1 with autoclaved autograft. Pre- and/or post-operative chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy was combined with these limb salvage operations. The average follow-up period was 25. 2 months (6 to 52 months) since diagnosis. The estimated 3. 5 -year survival rate of the total 25 patients was 39. 5 % based on the Kaplan-Meier survival plot. In the 15 cases of osteogenic sarcoma, the estimated Kaplan-Meier 34 -month survival rate was 46. 2 %. Seventeen patients who were followed up for more than 1 year were grouped by functional grading: 11 (65 %) were excellent; 3 (18 %) good; 2 fair (12 %); and 1 poor.

40|$|Abstract Background Primary extra-osseous <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcomas</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} in many tissues of the body but their occurrence in the breast is extremely rare. It can arise as a result of osseous metaplasia in a pre-existing benign or malignant neoplasm of the breast or as non-phylloides sarcoma from the soft tissue of a previously normal breast. Case presentation A 40 year-old Nigerian woman was clinically diagnosed to have carcinoma of the left breast. The histology report of core-needle biopsy of the mass showed a malignant neoplasm comprising islands of chondroblastic and osteoblastic stromal cells. This report changed the diagnosis from carcinoma to <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> of the breast. She had a left modified radical mastectomy, however there was significant post surgery skin deficit. A latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was used to cover the anterior chest wall defect. Sections from the mastectomy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> She died six months after mastectomy. Conclusion A diagnosis of <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> of the breast was made based on histology report and after excluding an <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> arising from underlying ribs and sternum.

40|$|While low-grade juxtacortical and low-grade {{intramedullary}} <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcomas</b> are histologically indistinguishable, {{they have}} been studied as separate entities. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, radiographic, histologic features and treatment of 59 patients treated surgically to compare the rate of local recurrence, grade progression, and survival between low-grade intramedullary and low-grade juxtacortical <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Forty-five (76 %) patients were treated for low-grade juxtacortical <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> and 14 (24 %) were treated for low-grade intramedullary <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Local recurrence rates of 7 % were similar for both groups studied. The rate of distant metastases was also similar for both groups.. The rate of dedifferentiation for the entire group was 29 %.

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of patients with <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> die from lung metastasis within 5 years of diagnosis. Molecular signatures that predict pulmonary metastasis from primary <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> and identify those patients at risk would be clinically useful as prognostic markers. Protein expression profiles of two clonally related murine <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> cell lines with low (K 12) and high (K 7 M 2) metastatic potential were compared using two different proteomic technologies, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and cell profiling by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Interrogation of a molecular pathways network database suggested several additional candidate molecules that potentially predict metastatic potential of primary <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Two such proteins, macrophage migration inhibitory factor and tumour necrosis factor were selected for further validation studies. Western blots confirmed increased expression of both cytokines in K 7 M 2 cells compared to K 12 cells. Levels of migration inhibitory factor and tumour necrosis factor were semi-quantitatively measured in human <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> samples by immunohistochemistry and were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters and patient outcomes. Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that tumour necrosis factor expression in chemotherapy naïve <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> is an independent prognostic factor for overall and metastasis-free survival.

40|$|Efficient gene {{delivery}} of a baculovirus-derived vector (BV-p 53 -lacZ) to a human <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> cell line, Saos- 2, was serendipitously found while evaluating the vector for {{gene delivery}} to human p 53 -null tumour cells in a previous study. Therefore, we investigated other human, rat and mouse <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> {{and other types of}} tumour cell lines for transduction efficiency via baculovirus vectors containing a lacZ reporter gene under the control of either a cytomegalovirus or Rous sarcoma virus promoter. The expression of b-galactosidase protein, assessed by X-Gal staining and b-galactosidase ELISA, demonstrated an extremely high level of transduction efficiency in some <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> cell lines, such as U- 2 OS, Saos- 2 and Saos-LM 2. These human <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> cell lines showed levels of b-galactosidase expression 5 – 40 times greater than HepG 2 cells, which were previously thought to be the mammalian cells most susceptible to baculovirus-mediated gene delivery. The level of acetylated histone proteins in these tumour lines did not correlate well with the high level of reporter gene expression. These results strongly suggest that some <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> cells are highly susceptible to baculovirus-mediated gene delivery and that a baculovirus-derived vector is an efficient gene delivery vehicle into human <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> cells...|$|R

This was excised but subsequent necropsy revealed multiple bony tumours in the lungs. The rarity of multiple <b>osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> is recalled as shown by {{a review of the}} literature. Although some are thought to be of multicentric origin owing to the short history, an early haema-togenous spread cannot be excluded and this latter process had certainly occurred in the present case. The characteristic radiological appearances in the skull are stressed as being diagnostic. The differential points in the histological diagnosis of the condition, especially in the invaded part of the calvarium, are described and should help to exclude a meningioma or other bone tumours. <b>Osteogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> rarely metastasizes to other bones, so that its occurrence five years after the removal of the original growth is worthy of record, expecially from the viewpoint of differential diagnosis.
