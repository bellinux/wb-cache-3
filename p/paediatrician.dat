5|$|Wilder's colleague, <b>paediatrician</b> Mynie Peterman, later {{formulated}} {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely {{to benefit from the}} diet, {{and the use of the}} ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E

Oral rehydration salt (ORS) was prescribed in more than 50 % of encounters by 53 % of general practitioners (GPs) and 61 % of <b>paediatricians.</b> Sixty-six percent of GPs and 50 % of <b>paediatricians</b> prescribed antibacterials, 60 % of GPs and 28 % of <b>paediatricians</b> prescribed antidiarrhoeals and 39 % of GPs and 32 % of <b>paediatricians</b> prescribed antiamoebics in more than 30 % of their encounters. Looking at all the encounters, we observed that ORS was prescribed in 52 and 51 %, antibacterials in 41 and 36 %, antidiarrhoeals in 48 and 29 %, and antiamoebics in 26 and 22 % of encounters by GPs and <b>paediatricians,</b> respectively.

The mean duration of encounters between patients and GPs was 3 Â± 2 minutes and between patients and <b>paediatricians</b> was 9 Â± 4 minutes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{aimed to}} study current {{practices}} in growth monitoring by European primary care <b>paediatricians</b> {{and to explore}} their perceived needs in this field. METHODS: We developed a cross-sectional, anonymous on-line survey and contacted primary care <b>paediatricians</b> listed in national directories in the 18 European countries with a confederation of primary care <b>paediatricians.</b> <b>Paediatricians</b> participated in the survey between April and September 2011. RESULTS: Of the 1, 198 <b>paediatricians</b> from 11 European countries (response rate 13 %) who participated, 29 % used the 2006 World Health Organization Multicentre Growth Reference Study growth charts, 69 % used national growth charts; 61 % used software to draw growth charts and 79 % did not use a formal algorithm to detect abnormal growth on growth charts. Among the 21 % of <b>paediatricians</b> who used algorithms, many used non-algorithmic simple thresholds for height and weight and none used the algorithms published in the international literature.

40|$|Abstract Background In 2007, the patient’s {{right to}} {{specialised}} palliative home care became law in Germany. However, childhood palliative care in territorial states with low patient numbers and long distances requires adapted models to ensure an area-wide maintenance. Actually, general <b>paediatricians</b> {{are the basic}} care providers for children and adolescents. They also provide home care. The {{aim of this study}} was to improve the knowledge about general paediatrician’s involvement in and contribution to palliative care in children. Findings To evaluate the current status of palliative home care provided by general <b>paediatricians</b> and their cooperation with other paediatric palliative care providers, a questionnaire survey was disseminated to general <b>paediatricians</b> in Lower Saxony, a German federal state with nearly eight million inhabitants and a predominantly rural infrastructure. Data analysis was descriptive. One hundred forty one of 157 included general <b>paediatricians</b> completed the questionnaire (response rate: 89. 8 %). A total of 792 children and adolescents suffering from life-limiting conditions were cared for by these general <b>paediatricians</b> in 2008. Severe cerebral palsy was the most prevalent diagnosis. Eighty-nine per cent of the general <b>paediatricians</b> stated that they had professional experience with paediatric palliative care. Collaboration of general <b>paediatricians</b> and other palliative care providers was stated as not well developed. The support by a specialised team including 24 -hour on-call duty and the intensification of educational programs were emphasised.

40|$|Background: Australian <b>paediatricians</b> use a {{wide variety}} of {{practices}} when managing sleep disturbances in children, including use of melatonin and behavioral strategies. However, practice patterns around the use of strategies, dosing, and how the patient populations managed, are unknown. Results could inform guidelines for the management of child sleep disturbances. Objective: We aimed to document management practices by Australian general <b>paediatricians</b> for paediatric sleep disturbances through an online survey sent to members of the Australian Paediatric Research Network (APRN) who are recruited from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Results: 181 (49 %) of 373 eligible <b>paediatricians</b> responded, with 101 prescribing melatonin. The most commonly prescribed medications for poor sleep initiation were melatonin (89. 1 %), clonidine (48 %) and antihistamines (29 %). Melatonin doses ranged from 0. 5. mg to 12. mg and duration of treatment was as long as 200. weeks. Less than half of the <b>paediatricians</b> were aware of any potential melatonin side effects. Most <b>paediatricians</b> (82 %) reported using behavioral strategies for sleep disturbances, most commonly anxiety relaxation techniques (75 %) for poor sleep initiation and graduated extinction (i. e. " controlled crying", 52 %) for disrupted overnight sleep. Conclusions: Australian <b>paediatricians</b> use both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for paediatric sleep disturbances. Melatonin is the most commonly prescribed medication, but wide variation in its prescribing suggests a lack of knowledge of recommended dosages and effectiveness. Given the prevalence and variation in prescribing, there is an urgent need to develop clear guidance for <b>paediatricians</b> managing children with sleep disturbance...|$|R
40|$|Paediatrics {{became a}} viable medical {{specialty}} in Australia and New South Wales between 1945 and 1965. <b>Paediatricians</b> took possession of occupational spaces previously claimed by other medical groups and {{created their own}} new spaces. They argued that children were still growing and differed physically and emotionally from adults. Their special needs warranted {{the formation of a}} new division in medicine. <b>Paediatricians</b> adopted the new knowledge, technology and therapeutics that became available in the post-war period and demonstrated that they were capable of following the scientific medicine paradigm, the prevailing standard in internal medicine. Access to the children's hospital was essential for <b>paediatricians</b> as a workshop for their professional development, to treat their seriously ill patients, to support their claims for occupational space and for their authority and status as specialists in medicine [...] Scientific medicine demanded more of the time of the <b>paediatricians</b> and in RAHC they elected to continue working in an honorary capacity. In another children's hospital, RCH in Melbourne, <b>paediatricians</b> were employed in a version of the full-time system. The different approaches to staffing illustrate the conflicts of interest found in specialty development in Australia and the pervasive influence of medico-political issues. As members of a privileged autonomous profession <b>paediatricians</b> in RAHC owed a duty to the people of NSW, and in their honorary positions, to the hospital. They had responsibilities to their patients, both private and public. They were committed to their own professional development and they had to make a living in private practice. By retaining the honorary system <b>paediatricians</b> in RAHC were obliged to give priority to their interests outside the hospital so that scientific medicine expanded only slowly. In RCH service development and research were enhanced because the conflicts of interest were reduced and <b>paediatricians</b> could devote more of their time to the hospital without compromising their other roles. The development of a new specialty required the acquisition by members of professional power, authority and status. This process was assisted by the formation of a professional association, but <b>paediatricians</b> had difficulty in creating an independent body that they controlled. For professional authority and status <b>paediatricians</b> in RAHC were strongly dependent on maintaining their dominant position in the hierarchy of the hospital. Although children were central to the development of paediatrics, their place {{at the bottom of the}} institutional hierarchy meant they were disempowered and unable to influence the development of the specialty.
