25|$|Appreciating the {{important}} quality affecting display aircraft i.e., appearance, the T-37s were painted all red. However, {{maintenance of the}} red-painted aircraft without the costly <b>polyurethane</b> <b>coating</b> became a problem. The team reverted to the all-metal finish, with only the nose, wing tips and tail painted day-glow orange. In 1980, with the induction of six ex-USAF T-37s, which were polyurethane-coated all white, ‘Sherdils’ became a logical choice for a new titillating appearance. The dramatic ‘sunburst’ paint scheme was adopted, red rays on an all-white background. Later, the aircraft were again painted red, but with the rays in white, a scheme that is in vogue today. Coloured smoke {{has been used to}} enhance the aesthetic qualities of the formation; smoke trails give the impression of multicoloured ribbons twirling in the sky.|$|E
500|$|The entire ceiling {{contains}} a [...] mural named [...] "Transport and Human Endeavor", commissioned by Edward Trumbull in 1930. The mural is themed around [...] "energy and man's application {{of it to}} the solution of his problems", and pays homage to the Golden Age of Aviation and the Machine Age. The mural is painted {{in the shape of a}} [...] "Y" [...] with ocher and golden tones. In its center is central image of the mural is a [...] "muscled giant whose brain directs his boundless energy to the attainment of the triumphs of this mechanical era", according to a 1930 pamphlet that advertised the building. The mural's Art Deco theme manifests itself in the characteristic triangles, sharp angles, slightly curved lines, chrome ornaments, and numerous patterns. The mural depicts several silver planes, including the Spirit of St. Louis, as well as furnaces of incandescent steel and the building itself. There is a wall panel dedicated to the work of clinchers, surveyors, masons, carpenters, plasterers and builders. Fifty different figures were modeled based on workers who participated in its construction. In 1999, the mural was returned to its original state after a restoration that removed the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>coating</b> and filled-in holes added in the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|Scientists have {{developed}} a <b>polyurethane</b> <b>coating</b> that heals its own scratches when exposed to sunlight. The self-healing coating uses chitosan incorporated into traditional polymer materials, such as those used in coatings on cars to protect paint. When a scratch damages the chemical structure, the chitosan responds to sunshine by forming chemical chains that bond with other materials in the substance, eventually smoothing the scratch. The process can take less than an hour.|$|E
