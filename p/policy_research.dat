5|$|Despite its stated {{commitment}} to providing politically balanced programming, C-SPAN and its {{shows such as}} Washington Journal, Booknotes, Q & A, and After Words have been accused by some liberal organizations of having a conservative bias. In 2005, the media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) released a study of C-SPAN's morning telephone call-in show Washington Journal, showing that Republicans were favored as guests over Democrats by a two-to-one margin during a six-month period that year, and that people of color are underrepresented. A 2007 survey released by the Center for Economic and <b>Policy</b> <b>Research</b> reported that C-SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left-of-center think tanks.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the report}} {{produced}} by the OIR, by 1957 the CIA realized that its version {{of the history of}} the Árbenz government and the coup were not gaining traction. Books written by defenders of the Árbenz government, which were strongly critical of the US intervention, were generally better received. Nationalist Latin Americans were inclined to view the Castillo Armas government as a creation of the US. As a result, the US government decided to allow Ronald Schneider, a historian who was in the process of completing his Ph.D, to access the PBHistory archive. Scheider published Communism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954 in 1959. Later observers have stated that the publication may have been subsidized in some way by the CIA: both the Foreign <b>Policy</b> <b>Research</b> Institute, where Schneider worked, and Frederick A. Praeger, who published Schneider's book, received CIA funds. Schneider stated in his book that the Comite was responsible for collecting the documents he accessed, but did not mention the CIA's role in funding the Comite, nor did he explain how the documents came to the US. Schneider's book did not rely on PBHistory material alone, but also on information that Schneider gathered during a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957. The book was generally well received.|$|E

40|$|Background: Many of society's health {{problems}} require research-based knowledge acted on by healthcare practitioners together with implementation of political measures from governmental agencies. However, {{there has been}} limited knowledge exchange between implementation science and <b>policy</b> implementation <b>research,</b> which has been conducted since the early 1970 s. Based on a narrative review of selective literature on implementation science and <b>policy</b> implementation <b>research,</b> {{the aim of this}} paper is to describe the characteristics of <b>policy</b> implementation <b>research,</b> analyze key similarities and differences between this field and implementation science, and discuss how knowledge assembled in <b>policy</b> implementation <b>research</b> could inform implementation science. Discussion: Following a brief overview of <b>policy</b> implementation <b>research,</b> several aspects of the two fields were described and compared: the purpose and origins of the research; the characteristics of the research; the development and use of theory; determinants of change (independent variables); and the impact of implementation (dependent variables). The comparative analysis showed that there are many similarities between the two fields, yet there are also profound differences. Still, important learning may be derived from several aspects of <b>policy</b> implementation <b>research,</b> including issues related to the influence of the context of implementation and the values and norms of the implementers (the healthcare practitioners) on implementation processes. Relevant research on various associated policy topics, including The Advocacy Coalition Framework, Governance Theory, and Institutional Theory, may also contribute to improved understanding of the difficulties of implementing evidence in healthcare. Implementation science is at a relatively early stage of development, and advancement of the field would benefit from accounting for knowledge beyond the parameters of the immediate implementation science literature. Summary: There are many common issues in <b>policy</b> implementation <b>research</b> and implementation science. Research in both fields deals with the challenges of translating intentions into desired changes. Important learning may be derived from several aspects of <b>policy</b> implementation <b>research...</b>|$|R
