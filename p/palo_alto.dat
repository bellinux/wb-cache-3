5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: violent crime and property crime. Historically, violent crime has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for violent crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also {{the source of the}} most violent crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw violent crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw violent crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, {{which was one of the}} safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its violent crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of violent crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City.|$|E
5|$|TouchWave, Inc. (now WebCom), was {{a privately}} held <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> California IP-telephony network switch {{provider}} founded in 1997. TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch {{that was designed}} to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part of a phone system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts have been viewed as less than successful.|$|E
5|$|After rising {{tensions}} with Mexico following the United States' annexation of Texas, {{war broke out}} in 1846. During the conflict, Grant distinguished himself as a daring and competent soldier. Before the war, President John Tyler had ordered Grant's unit to Louisiana {{as part of the}} Army of Observation under Major General Zachary Taylor. In September 1846, Tyler's successor, James K. Polk, unable to provoke Mexico into war at Corpus Christi, Texas, ordered Taylor to march 150 miles south to the Rio Grande. Marching south to Fort Texas, to prevent a Mexican siege, Grant experienced combat {{for the first time on}} May 8, 1846, at the Battle of <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Warner {{announced}} {{before the}} 1922 season {{that he was}} leaving to take the head-coaching position at Stanford, he honored his contract and remained at Pitt through 1923. The 1922 team had an 8–2 record, and the season ended with the Panthers taking their first cross-country train trip to defeat Stanford 16–7 in <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> (coached by two Pitt assistants, sent ahead by Warner). Andrew Kerr became head coach at Stanford during Warner's last two years at Pitt. Warner's final season was his worst at Pitt, as the Panthers stumbled to a 5–4 record in 1923. However, the Warner era ended on a high note with a 20–3 victory over Penn State on November 29.|$|E
5|$|Booker {{graduated}} from Northern Valley Regional High School at Old Tappan, {{where he played}} varsity football and {{was named to the}} 1986 USA Today All-USA high school football team. Booker went on to Stanford University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1991 and a Master of Arts in sociology the following year. While at Stanford, he played football as a tight end and was teammates with Brad Muster and Ed McCaffrey, and also made the All–Pacific-10 Academic team and was elected senior class president. In addition, Booker ran The Bridge Peer Counseling Center, a student-run crisis hotline, and organized help from Stanford students for youth in East <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> California.|$|E
5|$|In July 1918, Graves was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 8th Division, which was then based at <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> California, and scheduled {{to be sent to}} France in 30 days. Graves took Eichelberger with him, initially as his Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3 (Operations). While he was en route to California, Eichelberger learned from Graves that the 8th Division's destination had changed, and it was now bound for Siberia instead. President Woodrow Wilson had agreed to support the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and Graves would command the American Expeditionary Force Siberia. The American Expeditionary Force Siberia departed San Francisco on 15 August, with Eichelberger as its Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (Intelligence).|$|E
5|$|Longstreet {{served with}} {{distinction}} in the Mexican–American War with the 8th U.S. Infantry. He fought under Zachary Taylor as a lieutenant in May 1846 in the battles of <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> and Battle of Resaca de la Palma, while saying {{nothing in his}} memoirs about his personal role in the battles. He fought again with Taylor's army at the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846. He received brevet promotions to captain for Contreras and Churubusco and to major for Molino del Rey. In the Battle of Chapultepec on September 12, 1847, he {{was wounded in the}} thigh while charging up the hill with his regimental colors; falling, he handed the flag to his friend, Lt. George E. Pickett, who was able to reach the summit.|$|E
5|$|May {{spent most}} of his career in the Second Regiment of Dragoons, but also had a brief stint in the First Regiment of Dragoons. As a lieutenant, he participated in the Second Seminole War, where he was {{responsible}} for the capture of an important tribal chief. During the Mexican War, he commanded a squadron during Zachary Taylor's expedition, and saw action in the Battles of <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> Resaca de la Palma, Monterrey, and Buena Vista. He distinguished himself in those actions and was eventually promoted to the rank of brevet colonel, with a permanent rank of major. May later served {{in various parts of the}} American frontier, including during the Bleeding Kansas crisis.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 1846, after a final {{attempt to}} {{pressure}} Mexico {{to settle on}} a boundary for Texas, Secretary of War William L. Marcy ordered Brigadier General Zachary Taylor to move his army, which included May's dragoon squadron, to the Rio Grande. Taylor's destination was the river's north bank, directly opposite the Mexican town of Matamoros, which stood at a natural choke-point and controlled access to well-traveled routes to the south. When Taylor refused to leave the region, Mexican cavalry ambushed a dragoon detachment under Captain Seth B. Thornton on April 25, 1846, which officially commenced hostilities. On May 8, 1846, the two main forces met at the Battle of <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> where May's squadron was held in reserve and mounted an unsuccessful cavalry charge.|$|E
5|$|After Texas's annexation, Mexico broke {{diplomatic}} relations with the United States. While the United States claimed that Texas's border stretched to the Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River. While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims, the United States had the military strength and {{the political will to}} do so. President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846. A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican–American War. The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the Siege of Fort Texas, Battle of <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> and Battle of Resaca de la Palma. After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory ending the fighting in Texas.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, at {{the dawn}} of the freeway era, the state was making plans to convert the Bayshore Highway into a ten-lane Bayshore Freeway between San Francisco and <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto.</b> The first piece built was from Peninsula Avenue at the San Mateo-Burlingame line to South San Francisco. This six-lane freeway, {{completed}} in 1949, followed the existing highway to Broadway in Burlingame, but then took a more inland alignment past the San Francisco International Airport, and crossed the old road at South San Francisco, running just east of it to near the south end of the cut at Sierra Point. Construction began inside San Francisco in 1950 and was completed in 1958; the new causeway across Candlestick Cove, connecting the completed section in South San Francisco with San Francisco, was dedicated in mid-1957. In 1951, the state legislature renamed the portion within San Francisco after James Lick, a California pioneer and philanthropist.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, TouchWave was {{a privately}} held, venture-backed startup company in <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> California, with future {{entrepreneur}} Oliver Muoto as its marketing director. Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson, Jeff Snider, David F. Wittenkamp, and Jesper Stroe, TouchWave released its first product, WebSwitch, in 1997. WebSwitch, a Web-based phone switch, provided telephony over IP and targeted small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations. The WebSwitch {{was designed to}} deliver significantly lower costs for communications, ease of management and administration and offered services on a single IP-based network platform. The timing of TouchWave's late 1997 release of its phone switch product matched Level 3's development of its first softswitch, a method to connect calls from one phone line to another without a need to use traditional hardware.|$|E
5|$|MIT's {{inability}} {{to secure a}} more stable financial footing during this era can largely {{be attributed to the}} existence of the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard. Given the choice between funding technological research at the oldest university in the nation, or at an independent and adolescent institution, potential benefactors were indifferent or even hostile to funding MIT's competing mission. Earlier overtures from Harvard President Charles William Eliot towards consolidation of the two schools were rejected or disrupted by Rogers in 1870 and 1878. Despite his tenure at the analogous Sheffield School of Yale University, Walker remained committed to MIT's independence from a larger institution. Walker also repeatedly received overtures from Leland Stanford to become the first president of his new university in <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> California, but Walker remained committed to MIT owing to his Boston upbringing.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} 32 stations, 29 served daily and two weekend-only. San Francisco 4th and King Street is the {{northern}} terminus of the system, while Gilroy is the southern terminus. Atherton and Broadway are served only on weekends, and Stanford is served only on Stanford University's football game days. College Park is served only on weekdays during Bellarmine College Preparatory's school commute time. Tamien {{is served by}} train on weekdays and by shuttle bus on weekends. The five southernmost stations—Capitol, Blossom Hill, Morgan Hill, San Martin, and Gilroy—are served only on weekdays during commute time. Twelve stations are served by the express train service known as Baby Bullet, inaugurated in 2004. Seven stations (Millbrae, Burlingame, San Carlos, Menlo Park, <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> Santa Clara, and San Jose Diridon) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.|$|E
5|$|Aubrey Lafell Dawkins (born May 8, 1995) is an American college {{basketball}} player for the UCF Knights {{who is sitting}} out the season for the 2016–17 team. He transferred to UCF after he completed his sophomore season for the 2015–16 Michigan Wolverines. He {{is the son of}} Johnny Dawkins who became the UCF coach following the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Dawkins was raised in North Carolina until spending his high school years in Northern California at St. Francis High School and <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> High School and a post graduate year in New England at New Hampton Prep. As a collegiate freshman for the 2014–15 Wolverines, he began the season on the bench, but became a starter when injuries plagued the team in January 2015. In his more prominent role later in the season, Dawkins led the 2014–15 Big Ten Conference in effective field goal percentage and true shooting percentage during conference play.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, as the {{annexation}} of Texas was underway, President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande area {{in anticipation of}} a potential battle with Mexico over the disputed Texas–Mexico border. The Mexican–American War broke out in April 1846. In May, Taylor defeated Mexican troops commanded by General Mariano Arista at the Battles of <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> and Resaca de la Palma and managed to drive his troops out of Texas. Taylor subsequently led his troops into Mexico, where they once again defeated Mexican troops commanded by Pedro de Ampudia at the Battle of Monterrey in September. Defying orders, Taylor moved his troops further south. Despite being severely outnumbered, he dealt a crushing blow to Mexican forces under Antonio López de Santa Anna in February 1847 at the Battle of Buena Vista. After this, most of Taylor's troops were transferred to the command of Major General Winfield Scott, but Taylor's popularity remained significant.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{moved back}} to Harvard as a tenured {{associate}} professor in 1955 and became a full professor in 1958, expanding his research into how language affects human cognition. At the university he met a young Noam Chomsky, another {{of the founders of}} cognitive science. They spent a summer together at Stanford training the faculty, and their two families shared a house. In 1958–59, Miller took leave to join the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto,</b> California, (now at Stanford University). There he collaborated with Eugene Galanter and Karl Pribram on the book Plans and the Structure of Behavior. In 1960, along with Jerome S. Bruner, he co-founded the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard. The cognitive term was a break from the then-dominant school of behaviorism, which insisted cognition was not fit for scientific study. The center attracted such notable visitors as Jean Piaget, Alexander Luria and Chomsky. Miller then became the chair of the psychology department. Miller was instrumental at the time for recruiting Timothy Leary to teach at Harvard. Miller knew Leary from the University of Alabama, where Miller was teaching psychology and Leary graduated with an undergraduate degree from the department.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's men {{advanced}} to the Rio Grande in March 1846. Polk's attempts to negotiate with Mexico had failed, and war appeared imminent. Violence broke out several weeks later, when some of Captain Seth B. Thornton's men were attacked by Mexican forces north of the river. Polk, learning of the Thornton Affair, told Congress in May that a war between Mexico and the U.S. had begun. That same month, Taylor commanded American forces at the Battle of <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> and the nearby Battle of Resaca de la Palma. Though greatly outnumbered, he defeated the Mexican force, which consisted of the Army of the North, commanded by General Mariano Arista, and forced the troops back across the Rio Grande. Before accepting a prisoner exchange with General Arista, Taylor was noted for his humane treatment of the wounded Mexican soldiers, giving them the same care as {{was given to the}} American wounded. After tending to the wounded he performed the last rites for the dead of both the American and Mexican soldiers killed during the battle.|$|E
