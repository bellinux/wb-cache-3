The apparent spread of the disease, {{from tree to tree}} along the <b>planting</b> <b>line,</b> strongly supported the implication of a pathogen that could be transmitted mechanically via the tapping knife. In order to detect a causal agent of the disease, studies focusing on characterization of the known mechanically transmitted pathogens (e. g. viroids, cryptic viruses or phytoplasma) were initiated. RNA strands of low molecular weight (200 - 400 and > 500 bp) displaying structural similarities with viroids and viral dsRNAs were observed in various tested samples. However, attempts to show the potential role of these RNA molecules in the spread of the disease failed. First of all, there was no significant or reproducible correlation between the health status of the rubber trees sampled and these RNA molecules. Moreover, no sequence homology with known pathogens could be found when randomly amplified cDNA fragments isolated from trees presenting the disease symptoms were sequenced. In conclusion, the aetiological investigations, in order to show the presence of a pathogen responsible of the TPN disease, were non-conclusive, which tends to disprove the hypothesis of a biotic causal agent...|$|E

The data came from an experimental plantation located at Fazenda Lageado, Jaguariaíva, Parana State, in southern Brazil, owned by PISA Pulp and Paper Co. The spicings evaluated were: 2. 5 x 1. 2 m; 2. 5 x 2. 0 m; 2. 5 x 2. 8 m; 2. 5 x 3. 6 m e 2. 5 x 4. 4 m. The thinning regimes compared were: a single final cut at age 15 without thinning; a single final cut at age 20 without thinning; systematic thinning along the 6 th <b>planting</b> <b>line</b> at age 9 and final cut at age 20; selective low thinning of 50 % of {{the trees in the}} stand at ages 9 and 15 and final cut at age 20; and systematic cut along the 6 th <b>planting</b> <b>line</b> combined with selective low thinning at age 9 for 50 % of the trees in the stand, selective low thinning for 50 % of the trees in the stand at age 15 and final cut at age 20. The factorial experiment was analyzed by ANOVA and the test of Tukey. The results revealed significant differences (p< 0, 01) among the initial plant spacings and the thinning regimes. The interaction between them was also statistically significant. The results showed that, for the pulp and paper wood yield, the choice of planting with higher initial density (2. 5 x 1. 2 or 2. 5 x 2. 0 m) is recommendable. When selective thininngs are conducted, the higher density treatment results in greater pulp and paper wood yield. In addition, no significant difference could be noticed as compared to the 2. 5 x 2. 0 m spacing, when no thinning or a single systematic thinning was carried out. It was concluded from the analysis that the no thinning regime is more favorable to the pulp and paper wood yield in a 20 -year rotation. Nonetheless, shorter rotation (15 years for instance) is not recommendable because of the low yield, which corroborated the practice adopted by various forest companies nowadays. The best combination of initial density with thinning regime was 2. 5 x 1. 2 m and a single final cut at age 20. However, for this stand density, the adoption of the 2. 5 x 2. 0 m spacing did not affect the pulp and paper wood yield. There is {{no significant difference between the}} thinning regime without thinning and that using a single systematic thinning and a final cut at age 20, if the highest initial spacing is chosen...|$|E

40|$|Festuca rubra plants {{maintain}} {{associations with}} the vertically transmitted fungal endophyte Epichloë festucae. A high prevalence of infected host plants in semiarid grasslands {{suggests that this}} association could be mutualistic. We investigated if the Epichloë-endophyte affects the growth and nutrient content of F. rubra plants subjected to drought. Endophyte-infected (E+) and non-infected (E-) plants of two half-sib lines (PEN and RAB) were subjected to three water availability treatments. Shoot and root biomass, nutrient content, proline, phenolic compounds and fungal alkaloids were measured after the treatments. The effect of the endophyte on shoot and root biomass and dead leaves depended on the <b>plant</b> <b>line.</b> In the PEN <b>line,</b> E+ <b>plants</b> had a greater S:R ratio than E-, but the opposite occurred in RAB. In both <b>plant</b> <b>lines</b> and all water treatments, endophyte-infected plants had greater concentrations of N, P and Zn in shoots and Ca, Mg and Zn in roots than E- plants. On average, E+ plants contained in their shoots more P (62 %), Zn (58 %) and N (19 %) than E- plants. While the proline in shoots increased in response to water stress, the endophyte did not affect this response. A multivariate analysis showed that endophyte status and <b>plant</b> <b>line</b> impose stronger differences {{in the performance of}} the plants than the water stress treatments. Furthermore, differences between PEN and RAB lines seemed to be greater in E- than in E+ plants, suggesting that E+ <b>plants</b> of both <b>lines</b> are more similar than those of their non-infected version. This is probably due to the endophyte producing a similar effect in both <b>plant</b> <b>lines,</b> such as the increase in N, P and Zn in shoots. The remarkable effect of the endophyte in the nutrient balance of the plants could help to explain the high prevalence of infected plants in natural grasslands...|$|R
40|$|Most Gram-negative plant {{pathogenic}} bacteria translocate effector proteins (T 3 Es) {{directly into}} plant cells via a conserved type III secretion system, which {{is essential for}} pathogenicity in susceptible plants. In resistant plants, recognition of some T 3 Es is mediated by corresponding resistance (R) genes or R proteins and induces effector triggered immunity (ETI) that often results in programmed cell death reactions. The identification of R genes and understanding their evolution/distribution bears great potential for the generation of resistant crop plants. We focus on T 3 Es from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv), the causal agent of bacterial spot disease on pepper and tomato plants. Here, 86 Solanaceae lines mainly of the genus Nicotiana were screened for phenotypical reactions after Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression of 21 different Xcv effectors to (i) identify new <b>plant</b> <b>lines</b> for T 3 E characterization, (ii) analyze conservation/evolution of putative R genes and (iii) identify promising <b>plant</b> <b>lines</b> as repertoire for R-gene isolation. The effectors provoked different reactions on closely related <b>plant</b> <b>lines</b> indicative of a high variability and evolution rate of potential R genes. In some cases, putative R genes were conserved within a plant species but not within superordinate phylogenetical units. Interestingly, the effector XopQ was recognized by several Nicotiana spp. lines, and Xcv infection assays revealed that XopQ is a host range determinant in many Nicotiana species. Non-host resistance against Xcv and XopQ recognition in N. benthamiana required EDS 1, strongly suggesting {{the presence of a}} TIR domain-containing XopQ-specific R protein in these <b>plant</b> <b>lines.</b> XopQ is a conserved effector among most xanthomonads, pointing out the XopQ-recognizing RxopQ as candidate for targeted crop improvement...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{integrated}} weed management (IWM) {{is to use}} {{of a combination of}} different practices to maintain weed densities at manageable levels. A field experiment was conducted at Agricultural College, Tehran of University, in Karaj city 2005 - 2006 by planting wheat, to investigate the response of planting methods and tank mixed herbicides. The experiment was laid out using a split plot arrangement, in randomized complete block design with three replications. Methods of planting were assigned to the main plots; while tank mixed herbicdes were kept in the sub-plots. The subplot size measured 4. 5 × 4. 5 m 2. Row to row distance was kept at 30 cm. Data were recorded on weed density m- 2, plant height (cm), spike length (cm), Number of spikes m- 2, Number of grains spike- 1, 1000 grain weight (g), biological yield (kg ha- 1), and grain yield (kg ha- 1). The data for individual traits were subjected to the ANOVA technique and significant means were separated by the LSD test. The analysis of the data showed that methods of sowing were statistically significant for plant height, No. of grains spike- 1, 1000 -grain weight and biological yield. The herbicides were statistically significant for all the parameters investigated except No. of grains spike- 1, while the interaction of methods of planting with herbicides could not reach the level of significance in any of the traits examined. Among the methods of <b>planting,</b> <b>line</b> sowing was the best followed by line + broadcast sowing. The herbicide mixtures controlled mixed stands of broadleaf and grassy weeds to the tune of 65 to 74 % with a consequent increase in grain yield from 58 - 107 %.

40|$|Fine root length density (FRLD) was {{evaluated}} in mixed and monospecific stands of Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla and Acacia mearnsii in Southern Brazil. FRLD (&# 8804; 2, 0 mm) at 8 and 18 months after planting in the treatments: 100 E (100 % of eucalyptus); 100 A (100 % of Acacia mearnsii); 50 E: 50 A (50 % of eucalyptus + 50 % of Acacia mearnsii). The findings {{demonstrated that the}} FRLD at 8 months of age have the same distribution, in the two different species, {{in the distribution of}} the different soil layers, reaching the maximum projection of 125 cm from the tree trunk. For the age of 18 months after planting, it was verified that the FRLD in the monospecific stand of Acacia mearnsii was higher than in the monoculture and mixed stand of Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla. Therefore, no interaction, neither positive nor negative, between the root systems of Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla and Acacia mearnsii during the 18 months after planting was found. The higher FRLD is found at the soil layers surface, next to the tree trunk and in the <b>planting</b> <b>line,</b> followed by the diagonal and planting rows. The initial growth in length of the root system of Acacia mearnsii is more dynamic with higher density than the eucalyptus, but without interfering directly in the global growth of fine roots in mixed stands. Avaliou-se a densidade do comprimento de raízes finas (DCRF) de plantios monoespecíficos e misto de Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla e de Acacia mearnsii na região sul do Brasil. A DCRF (&# 8804; 2, 0 mm) foi determinada aos 8 e 18 meses após o plantio nos tratamentos: 100 E (100 % de eucalipto); 100 A (100 % de Acacia mearnsii); 50 E: 50 A (50 % de eucalipto + 50 % de Acacia mearnsii). A DCRF aos oito meses de idade possui o mesmo comportamento para a ocupação das diferentes camadas do solo, atingindo uma projeção máxima de 125 cm de distância em relação ao tronco da árvore. Já, aos 18 meses após o plantio, verificou-se que, no cultivo monoespecífico de Acacia mearnsii, a DCRF foi superior em relação ao monocultivo e plantio misto de Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla. Não ocorreram interações positivas ou negativas entre os sistemas radiculares do eucalipto e da acácia-negra durante os primeiros 18 meses após o plantio. A maior DCRF encontra-se nas camadas superficiais do solo, nas proximidades do tronco da árvore e na linha de plantio, seguida pela diagonal e entrelinha de plantio. O crescimento inicial em comprimento do sistema radicular da Acacia mearnsii é mais dinâmico e maior do que a do eucalipto, mas sem interferir diretamente no crescimento global das raízes finas no cultivo misto...|$|E
