40|$|A new {{paradigm}} and methods for special effects in images were recently proposed by artist and movie producer Steven Hylen. Based on these methods, images resembling paintings may be formed using optical <b>phase</b> <b>plates.</b> The {{role of the}} mathematical and optical properties of the <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> is studied {{in the development of}} these new art forms.

40|$|Effects of <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> on focused {{laser beams}} are studied numerically. Gaussian beams are {{simulated}} when {{they pass through}} several kinds of phase device (random <b>phase</b> <b>plates,</b> <b>phase</b> gratings, etc.). Partially coherent and aberrated beams are also considered. Their control by phase devices is analyzed. In particular this work is devoted either to reducing the intensity transverse modulations on the spot region, which are able to excite filamentation instability in plasmas, or to producing such modulations in a controllable way in order to investigate filamentation accurately...|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} means by which the National Ignition Facility (NIF) laser system, being built for indirect-drive laser fusion, can be used for {{symmetric}} direct-drive implosions producing high fusion neutron yields as soon as the NIF is operational. It uses polar direct drive (PDD), which involves repointing the laser beams away {{from the center of the}} target in an attempt to maintain shell radius uniformity during the implosion. All PDD designs proposed to date need specially designed <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> that will not be available for initial NIF experiments. However, this work shows that good uniformity can still be obtained without special <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> by certain combinations of defocusing and pointing of the beams, including pointing offsets of individual beams within the NIF laser beam quads, which are easy to implement. Two designs have been developed using the two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation code SAGE. The first design uses the elliptical <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> that will be used for indirect drive on the NIF; the second design uses no <b>phase</b> <b>plates.</b> Both designs will make high-yield direct-drive implosions possible with the initial NIF setup. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Apart from formal {{decomposition}} in Fourier series the {{speckle pattern}} may be composed for plane waves emitted by tilted {{regions of the}} <b>phase</b> <b>plate.</b> This approach significantly simplifies numerical modelling.

5000|$|A spatial light {{modulator}} is a computer-controlled electronic liquid-crystal device {{which can}} create dynamic vortices, arrays of vortices, {{and other types of}} beams by creating a hologram of varying refractive indices. [...] This hologram may be a fork pattern, a spiral <b>phase</b> <b>plate,</b> or some similar pattern with non-zero topological charge.|$|E
5000|$|Phase {{contrast}} {{dispersion staining}} requires that a phase contrast objective {{with the appropriate}} phase annulus in the substage condenser be used to see the effect. It {{takes advantage of the}} fact that the rays of light that are not shifted in phase by the presence of the object are separated from the phase shifted rays at the back focal plane of the objective. [...] These unaffected rays are then significantly decreased in intensity. With “Positive Phase Contrast”, the particle appears colored from the contributing wavelengths for which the mounting medium has the higher refractive index. Because of the physical size of the <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> and its image onto the back focal plane of the objective where it is modified, a halo is formed around the particle. This halo takes on the color of the combined wavelengths for which the particle has the higher refractive index. The colors seen with this type of dispersion staining are about the same as those with the Becke` Line method shown in Chart 1. Examples of this type of dispersion staining and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at the microlabgallery.com site for Phase Contrast Dispersion Staining. The presence of two colors helps to bracket the wavelength at which the refractive index matches for the two materials.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the late}} 1960 s Alvarez and Lohmann {{independently}} suggested cubic <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> as varifocal elements. A {{variety of different}} theoretical as well as experimental approaches have been discussed since. Today compact tunable optics is of specific interest e. g. in miniaturized optical systems. Recently developed fabrication technologies like diamond turning or milling nowadays enable the fabrication of higher order freeform surface profiles as implementation of efficient <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> for an optimization of the imaging properties. We present a non-paraxial analysis of the imaging behavior of diffractive, refractive and hybrid Alvarez-Lohmann lenses with increased numerical aperture. Our analysis includes the influence of lateral focus shifts as well as monochromatic and polychromatic aberrations over the tuning range. Experimental results with <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> fabricated by diamond milling and lithographic techniques will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Thin-film based <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> are {{meanwhile}} {{a widespread}} tool {{to enhance the}} contrast of weak-phase objects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The thin film usually consists of amorphous carbon, which suffers from quick degeneration under the intense electron-beam illumination. Recent investigations {{have focused on the}} search for alternative materials with an improved material stability. This work presents thin-film based <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> fabricated from metallic glass alloys, which are characterized by a high electrical conductivity and an amorphous structure. Thin films of the zirconium-based alloy Zr 65. 0 Al 7. 5 Cu 27. 5 (ZAC) are prepared and their phase-shifting properties are tested. The ZAC-alloy film is investigated by different TEM techniques, which reveal a range of beneficial characteristics. Particularly favorable is the small probability for inelastic plasmon scattering, which is promising to improve the performance of thin-film based <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> in phase-contrast TEM...|$|R
40|$|An {{adjustable}} spiral <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> and computer-generated holograms were inves-tigated as {{methods for}} creating optical vortices. The <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> {{was created by}} cutting a plastic microscope cover slip from a corner to its center and separat-ing the resultant tabs by inserting a uniformly thick wedge between them. The computer-generated holograms were designed by mathematically interfering an oblique plane wave with an optical vortex in Matlab; we then printed them on common overhead transparencies. The two devices were tested in an originally developed interferometer, and the intensity profiles of vortices created by shining a laser beam through the <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> and CGHs were measured. The curvature of the <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> was mapped using an optical scanning setup. A composite-vortex grid hologram was designed for future use in an orbital angular momentum sorter {{in conjunction with the}} spiral <b>phase</b> <b>plate.</b> Both devices simplified previous designs and proved to be a highly effective means of generating optical vortices. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{implementation}} of an electrostatic Einzel lens (Boersch) <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> in a prototype transmission electron microscope dedicated to aberration-corrected cryo-EM. The combination of <b>phase</b> <b>plate,</b> C s corrector and Diffraction Magnification Unit (DMU) as a new electron-optical element ensures minimal information loss due to obstruction by the <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> and enables in-focus phase contrast imaging of large macromolecular assemblies. As no defocussing is necessary and the spherical aberration is corrected, maximal, non-oscillating phase contrast transfer can be achieved up to the information limit of the instrument. A microchip produced by a scalable micro-fabrication process has 10 phase plates, which are positioned in a conjugate, magnified diffraction plane generated by the DMU. Phase plates remained fully functional for weeks or months. The large distance between <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> and the cryo sample permits {{the use of an}} effective anti-contaminator, resulting in ice contamination rates of < 0. 6 nm/h at the specimen. Maximal in-focus phase contrast was obtained by applying voltages between 80 and 700 mV to the <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> electrode. The <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> allows for in-focus imaging of biological objects with a signal-to-noise of 5 – 10 at a resolution of 2 – 3 nm, as demonstrated for frozen- hydrated virus particles and purple membrane at liquid-nitrogen temperature...|$|E

40|$|Diffraction {{limit is}} always a key point to almost all optical systems, and {{diffraction}} effect is mostly dependent on the numerical aperture of objective and wavelength of light. However, it will be ultimately limited to improve the resolution continuously by increasing the numerical aperture or reducing the wavelength. Here, it is introduced that when these two parameters are fixed, focal spot smaller than Airy pattern could be obtained by means of superresolution techniques. Theoretical analysis for superresolution is presented. Binary <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> corresponding to transverse or axial superresolution are designed, especially three-dimensional superresolution is proposed employing some optimization algorithms. The simulation results show that for light source with single wavelength or narrow spectral width, superresolution effects are fine, and when the superresolved <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> are applied to femtosecond laser microfabrication system, the superresolution performances are even better when two-photon absorption is considered. Finally, the influences of spectrum of light sources are discussed. It has been demonstrated that when the spectral width is narrow, the performance of superresolved <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> is approximately {{the same as that}} of a single wavelength. In conclusion, the superresoloved <b>phase</b> <b>plates</b> can be successfully applied to femtosecond laser systems for microfabrication, data memory and et al...|$|R

40|$|Femtosecond laser {{filament}} arrays {{are generated}} in air by using {{three kinds of}} step phase plates with p phase lag, namely, the semicircular <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> (SCPP), the quarter-circle <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> (QCPP) and eight-octant <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> (EOPP). Experimental results and simulations show that filament arrays consisting of two, four and eight filaments, respectively, are produced by three phase plates. The transverse patterns of the filament arrays {{are determined by the}} geometrical shapes of the phase plates. At the same time, the separation distances are found to vary with the focal lengths of the used lenses. We further propose that by using an axicon, filament array in the form of ring shape could be realized while the lengths of the filaments could be significantly elongated at the same time. Our study has suggested a realistic method to generate filament array by the step <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> with p phase lag. (C) 2013 Optical Society of Americ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} theory, simulations, and experiments that extend the conventional Fabry-Perot etalon {{to a new}} geometry, namely the spiral <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> etalon. In {{the development of the}} theory, the spiral <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> etalon is treated in the thin plate approximation and thick plate approximation. The thin plate approximation elucidates properties of the device such as the presence of a coherent superposition of orbital angular momentum modes with different winding numbers in the device, and an intensity pattern that varies as a function of angle. The thick plate approximation captures additional angular interference phenomena in the high finesse limit of the device not seen in the thin plate approximation. These are distinguishing features of the spiral <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> etalon compared to the conventional Fabry-Perot etalon, which is treated {{for the first time in}} this dissertation. In the experiment, optical transmission through the spiral <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> etalon is probed with a laser beam, and observed to have an intensity variation as a function of angle. The angular intensity pattern is observed to rotate when the laser frequency is varied. These properties of the spiral <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> etalon are measured and experimentally quantified for the first time. The experimental data is compared to theory, and simulations of the optical intensity profiles in which the dominant source of noise is shot noise. In each case, the statistical uncertainty of the parameters used to describe the spiral <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> etalon are determined, for which the phase sensitivity of the angular intensity pattern to rotation is deduced. The simulations are also used to understand systematic errors in the data. In addition, the optimal parameters to design a spiral <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> etalon for best position and frequency resolution (sensitivity) of the optical angular intensity pattern to rotation is obtained. This device is expected to have wide ranging applications, including the possibility to serve as a unique tool in optical frequency metrology, as well as in the study of atomic and molecular physics, quantum optics and quantum information science...|$|E

40|$|When {{the surface}} of a {{distributed}} <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> (DPP) is designed via the phase retrieval method, the resulting phase profile is discontinuous because of the use of the inverse tangent function. The precise manufacturing of a discontinuous <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> is impossible, however, and any imperfections scatter the laser beam out of the desired far-field intensity pattern. Phase unwrapping is therefore employed to create a continuous <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> by removing discontinuities between adjacent data points. An unwrapping algorithm that attempts to smooth over the data while retaining the desired far-field mapping was successfully implemented and will be integrated into the phase retrieval method for future calculations of DPPs. The weighted form of the algorithm is expected to increase its effectiveness at unwrapping uncertain data. 2...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of implementing a Zernike <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> in a {{transmission electron microscope}} is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The phase-retarding plate {{in the form of}} thin film with a hole in the center is positioned in the back-focal plane of the objective lens. The experiments showed that the <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> functions as predicted, producing a cosine-type phase contrast transfer function. Images of negatively stained horse spleen ferritin were highly improved in the contrast and the image-modulation, compared to those acquired without the <b>phase</b> <b>plate.</b> Electrostatic charging and related difficulties were encountered during the <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> experiments. The radial distribution of the beam-induced charge in thin films was investigated using the contrast transfer properties of the transmission electron microscope. The phase shift due to charging was measured as the phase difference between the contrast transfer functions of two photos taken with and without film at the back focal plane. Solving the inverse Laplace problem with this input data recovers the charge density of the measured film. The surface charge density reaches quasi-equilibrium state after the first 30 min of the electron beam pre-irradiation. An explanation of the qualitative behavior of the charge density, based on the contamination diffusion theory, is proposed. The first experimental realization of the complex reconstruction scheme is presented.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an alternative to}} fiber-gratings for converting higher-order LP 0 m (m > 1) fiber modes into a nearly fundamental Gaussian shape at the output of a fiber. This schematic {{enables the use of}} light propagation in higher-order modes of a fiber, a fiber-platform that has recently shown great promise for achieving very large mode areas needed for future high-power lasers and amplifiers. The conversion will be done by using a binary <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> in the near field of the fiber, which emits the LP 0 m mode. Since the binary <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> alone cannot increase the quality factor M- 2 of the laser beam because of some broad sidebands, a filtering of the sidebands is done in the Fourier plane of a telescope. Of course, this will cost some of the total light power, but on the other side the M- 2 factor can be reduced to nearly the ideal value near 1. 0, and it is shown that similar to 76 % of the total light power can be conserved for all investigated modes (2 <= m <= 8). A tolerance analysis for the <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> and its adjustment is made, and different optical imaging systems to form a magnified image of the fiber mode on the <b>phase</b> <b>plate</b> are discussed in order to have more tolerance for the adjustment of the <b>phase</b> <b>plate.</b> (c) 2007 Optical Society of America...|$|E

Given the limited variety of reversed <b>phase</b> <b>plates,</b> mobile <b>phase</b> composition optimization is necessary to obtain better separation of analytes with similar characteristics, which is often a time consuming step. We present polarity-adjustable reversed phase ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC) plates, which simplifies the mobile phase screening process and greatly expands the selection of reversed <b>phase</b> <b>plates.</b> The plates were fabricated on glass substrates with SiO 2 nanopillars deposited using the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique. SiO 2 nanopillars were functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane to generate a super hydrophobic stationary phase. Unlike commercial silica-gel based stationary phases, the isolated nanopillar architecture presented here exposes a high surface area to post-fabrication surface treatments. In our work, an O 2 plasma treatment at different powers, pressures and exposure times was used to shorten the silane carbon chain and introduce COOH groups to the surface, producing plates with finely tunable polarities. Separation of a model dye mixture of Sudan blue and Sudan IV confirmed the tuning of surface polarities by measurement of retention behavior changes. The dye elution order reversed {{as a result of the}} change in surface polarity. When the same plasma treatment process was tested on commercial reversed <b>phase</b> <b>plates,</b> separation behavior did not change because the disordered and tortuous silica gel restricts the accessible surface area.
