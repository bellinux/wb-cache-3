50|$|Vino-Seal is a plastic/glass closure {{released}} by Alcoa. Since its introduction into the European market in 2003, over 300 wineries have utilized Vino-Seal. Using a <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> with an inert o-ring, the Vino-Seal creates a hermetic seal that prevents oxidation and TCA contamination. A disadvantage with the Vino-Seal is {{the relatively high}} cost of each plug (70 cents each) and cost of manual bottling {{due to the lack}} of compatible bottling equipment outside of Europe. Vinolok is a <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> developed and produced by a Czech crystal glass producer Preciosa.|$|R

30|$|The {{adsorption}} kinetics {{were carried out}} in static regime; batch experiments were conducted at a controlled temperature by adding a known weight of sawdust {{into a number of}} 500  mL <b>glass</b> <b>stoppered</b> conical flasks on magnetic shaker.|$|R
30|$|A PYREX {{glass batch}} reactor of 250  mL with a <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> {{equipped}} with a condenser, a thermocouple, and pH meter was used. To minimize external mass transport effects, experiments were carried out with a high-speed stirring. Testing was performed in contact with air, at atmospheric pressure. The reaction volume was 100  mL.|$|R
5000|$|A {{chemistry}} {{test tube}} typically has a flat bottom, a round bottom, or a conical bottom. Some test tubes {{are made to}} accept a ground <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> or a screw cap. They are often provided with a small ground glass or white glaze area near the top for labelling with a pencil.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> {{is often}} called a [...] "ground glass joint" [...] (or [...] "joint taper"), a rubber stopper is {{sometimes}} called a [...] "rubber bung", and a cork stopper is called simply a [...] "cork". Bung stoppers used for wine bottles {{are referred to as}} [...] "corks", even when made from another material.|$|R
60|$|The box, {{which was}} a {{hospital}} medical chest, was filled with drugs of all kinds. Bathurst put a stick of caustic into a small vial, and half filled another, which had a <b>glass</b> <b>stopper,</b> with nitric acid, filled it up with water, and tried the effect of rubbing a few drops on his arm.|$|R
6000|$|Still in silence, {{she turned}} to the table, and searching again in her dressing-case, found a little empty bottle. She filled it and {{carefully}} fitted in the <b>glass</b> <b>stopper.</b> Jack held out his hand. She suddenly drew her own hand back. [...] "No," [...] she said. [...] "On second thoughts, I won't let you have it." ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of stopper: the Glass Pennyhead and the <b>Glass</b> Robotic <b>stopper.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{discovered}} the bottle, carefully guarded by a <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> tied over with leather. The preparation which it contained was, as I had anticipated, the common Tincture of Opium. Finding the bottle still well filled, I have resolved to use it, in preference to employing {{either of the}} two preparations with which I had taken care to provide myself, in case of emergency.|$|R
25|$|A Snyder {{column is}} an {{extremely}} effective air-cooled column used in selected fractional distillations. It is a single glass tube {{with a series of}} circular indentations/restrictions in the walls of the cylinder (e.g., 3 or 6) in which rest, inverted, the same number of roughly tear-shaped, hollow, sealed glass stoppers; above each point where an inverted tear-shaped stopper rests, the cylinder has further Vigreux-type indentations, in this case serving to limit how high the <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> can be raised (by vapor flow) above its resting place, where, when not raised, it seals the circular opening created by the circular indentation. These floating <b>glass</b> <b>stoppers</b> act as check valves, closing and opening with vapor flow, and enhancing vapor-condensate mixing. A standard application of Snyder columns, is as the condenser/fractionation column above a Kuderna-Danish concentrator, used to efficiently separate a low boiling extraction solvent such as methylene chloride from volatile but higher boiling extract components (e.g., after the extraction of organic contaminants in soil).|$|R
5000|$|The main {{characteristic}} that sets apart three-mold ware from <b>pressed</b> <b>glass</b> {{is that the}} inverse of the pattern of three-mold glass can be felt {{on the inside of}} the object. <b>Pressed</b> <b>glass</b> is patterned only on the exterior and smooth inside. [...] <b>Pressed</b> <b>glass,</b> termed “mold-pressed,” has an interior form independent of the exterior, in contrast to mold-blown glass, whose interior corresponds to the outer form. [...] Plates, lamp bases and door knobs were usually made of <b>pressed</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R
60|$|Presently the <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> of the manhole {{was so far}} undone {{that the}} denser air within our sphere began to escape along the thread of the screw, singing as a kettle sings before it boils. Thereupon he made me desist. It speedily became evident that the {{pressure}} outside was very much less than it was within. How much less it was we had no means of telling.|$|R
60|$|It {{was simple}} work, the tying of <b>glass</b> <b>stoppers</b> into small bottles. At his waist {{he carried a}} bundle of twine. He held the bottles between his knees {{so that he might}} work with both hands. Thus, in a sitting {{position}} and bending over his own knees, his narrow shoulders grew humped and his chest was contracted for ten hours each day. This was not good for the lungs, but he tied three hundred dozen bottles a day.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pycnometer}} (from Greek: πυκνός (puknos) meaning [...] "dense"), {{also called}} pyknometer or specific gravity bottle, is a device {{used to determine}} the density of a liquid. A pycnometer is usually made of glass, with a close-fitting ground <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> with a capillary tube through it, so that air bubbles may escape from the apparatus. This device enables a liquid's density to be measured accurately by reference to an appropriate working fluid, such as water or mercury, using an analytical balance.|$|R
5000|$|The Riesling grape is {{the only}} grape variety used in the winery. Nevertheless, {{the whole range of}} Prädikat designations such as Kabinett, Spätlese, Auslese, Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese up to the Eiswein is vinified. Schloss Vollrads also {{produces}} dry wines under the Erstes Gewächs designation. The Vollrads Lage is highly [...] "terroir-expressive", meaning that the character of Riesling wines is clearly influenced by the wine's place of origin. In order to avoid cork taint, the wine is sealed with Vino-Lok <b>glass</b> <b>stoppers.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Flower-in-the-Bottle line bore Blocki's unique {{presentation}} style {{but he also}} produced several lines of perfume that followed the popular style of the times. His Regal and Bouquet lines of perfume that debuted in the early nineteen hundreds were typical of the Belle Epoque style. They were presented in classic flacons with cut <b>glass</b> <b>stoppers</b> and colorful, embossed labels depicting bold and beautiful women. Many of these perfumes were named after famous operas or historical figures; particularly Prussian and Polish noble families given his heritage.|$|R
5000|$|Reagent flasks {{are usually}} a {{flat-bottomed}} flask, which {{can thus be}} conveniently placed on the table or in a cabinet. These flasks cannot withstand too much pressure or temperature differences, due to the stresses which arise in a flat bottom, these flasks are usually made of weaker glass than reaction flasks. Certain types of flasks are supplied with a ground <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> in them, and others that are threaded neck and closes with an appropriate nut or automatic dispenser, these flasks are available in two standard shapes: ...|$|R
60|$|So Bickley and I said to each other, and yet {{presently}} {{he changed}} his mind and in a special metal machine carefully made some extremely strong black coffee which he poured into a thermos flask, previously warmed with hot water, adding thereto about a claret glass of brandy. Also he extracted certain drugs from his medicine-chest, and with them, as I noted, a hypodermic syringe, which he first boiled in a kettle and then shut up in a little tube with a <b>glass</b> <b>stopper.</b>|$|R

60|$|Both his hearers felt vividly {{the urgent}} {{necessity}} to hear no more. D'Alcacer, uncomfortable on a campstool, sat stiff {{and stared at}} the <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> of a carafe. Mrs. Travers turned a little sideways and leaning on her elbow rested her head on {{the palm of her hand}} like one thinking about matters of profound import. Mr. Travers talked; he talked inflexibly, in a harsh blank voice, as if reading a proclamation. The other two, as if in a state of incomplete trance, had their ears assailed by fragments of official verbiage.|$|R

50|$|<b>Pressed</b> <b>glass</b> (or pattern glass) {{is a form}} {{of glass}} made using a plunger to <b>press</b> molten <b>glass</b> into a mold. It was first {{patented}} by American inventor John P. Bakewell in 1825 to make knobs for furniture.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glass</b> flasks, <b>stoppers,</b> valves, funnels, and tubing {{are often}} {{connected}} together by ground glass joints, matching pairs of conical or spherical surfaces {{that have been}} ground to a precise shape.|$|R
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{was developed in}} the United States from the 1820s and in Europe, particularly France, Bohemia, and Sweden from the 1830s. By the mid-19th century, most inexpensive mass-produced glassware was pressed (1850-1910). [...] One type of <b>pressed</b> <b>glass</b> is carnival <b>glass.</b> Painted <b>pressed</b> <b>glass</b> produced in the early 20th century is often called goofus glass. The method is also used to make beads.|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 10  mg of oil sample was mixed with 10  mL of toluene. A total of 20  mL of the {{solution}} mixture was diluted with 1  mL of toluene/methanol (3 : 17, v/v) solution. Acetic acid was added (5  μL to every 1  mL of sample solution) to ensure efficient ionization for positive ion ESI analysis, and ammonium hydroxide was added (10  μL to every 1  mL of sample solution) for negative ion ESI analysis. The toluene and methanol used were analytical reagent-grade solvents that were distilled twice and kept in glass bottles with ground <b>glass</b> <b>stoppers</b> [14, 15, 17].|$|R
50|$|At the opening(s) at top of {{the neck}} of some glass flasks such as round-bottom flasks, retorts, or {{sometimes}} volumetric flasks, there are outer (or female) tapered (conical) ground glass joints. Some flasks, especially volumetric flasks, come with a stopper or cap for capping the opening at the {{top of the}} neck. Such stoppers can be made of glass or plastic. <b>Glass</b> <b>stoppers</b> typically have a matching tapered inner (or male) ground glass joint surface, but often only of stopper quality. Flasks which do not come with such stoppers or caps included may be capped with a rubber bung or cork stopper.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first season}} bottle {{had a clear}} <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> that Tony took from a 1956 Old Grand-Dad Bourbon bottle in his home, as the {{original}} stopper was left behind on the beach where Tony found Jeannie. In the first color episode, Jeannie returns to the beach, and her bottle is seen to have its original stopper (painted to match the bottle), presumably retrieved by her upon her return there. The rest of the TV series (and the movies) used the original bottle stopper. (During some close-ups, one {{can still see the}} plastic rings that hold the cork part of the stopper in place.) ...|$|R
