40|$|We present initial {{results of}} a new {{campaign}} of simulations focusing on the interaction of <b>planetary</b> <b>winds</b> with stellar environments using Adaptive Mesh Refinement methods. We have confirmed the results of Stone & Proga 2009 that an azimuthal flow structure is created in the <b>planetary</b> <b>wind</b> due to day/night temperatures differences. We show that a backflow towards the planet will occur with a strength {{that depends on the}} escape parameter. When a stellar outflow is included, we see unstable bow waves forming through the outflow's interaction with the <b>planetary</b> <b>wind.</b> Comment: To appear in the proceedings of IAU Symposium 314 "Young Stars and Planets Near the Sun...|$|R
5|$|The {{solar wind}} is quite {{different}} from a terrestrial wind, in that its origin is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar <b>wind,</b> the <b>planetary</b> <b>wind</b> is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres. Over long periods of time, the <b>planetary</b> <b>wind</b> can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres.|$|R

40|$|Attention {{is given}} to the effect of changes in the dynamic {{pressure}} of the solar wind on the structure of a centrifugally driven <b>planetary</b> <b>wind</b> from Jupiter. It is suggested that dynamic pressure variations can induce a transition between a super-Alfvenic wind and a sub-Alfvenic wind breeze on Jupiter's dayside. This could possibly account for the observed large-scale changes in the structure of Jupiter's outer magnetosphere. An attempt is then made to conceptually merge <b>planetary</b> <b>wind</b> models of Jupiter's outer magnetosphere with reconnection models of Jupiter's outer magnetosphere...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that if Io-injected plasma is lost via a <b>planetary</b> <b>wind</b> a sun-fixed Birkeland current system may result. This {{is due to}} the fact that a current flows across a density {{gradient}} produced by the loss of plasma through the <b>planetary</b> <b>wind</b> in the tail. The divergent current is connected to field-aligned Birkeland currents which flow into the ionosphere at dawn and out of it at dusk. The closure currents in the ionosphere require a dawn-to-dusk electric field which at the orbit of Io is estimated to have a strength of a few mV/m. Independent estimates derived from the local time asymmetry of the torus u. v. emission indicate a field of 1. 5 mV/m...|$|R

40|$|Filament winding {{technique}} is developed {{as the primary}} process for composite cylindrical structures fabrication at low cost. Fibres are wound on a rotating mandrel by a filament <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> where resin impregnated fibres pass through a pay-out eye. This paper aims to develop and optimize a 3 -axis, lightweight, practical, efficient, portable filament <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> to satisfy the customer demand, which can fabricate pipes and round shape cylinders with resins. There are 3 main units on the 3 -axis filament <b>winding</b> <b>machine,</b> which are the rotary unit, the delivery unit and control system unit. Comparison with previous existing filament <b>winding</b> <b>machines</b> in the factory, it has 3 degrees of freedom and can fabricate more complex shape specimens based on the mandrel shape and particular control system. The machine has been designed and fabricated on 3 axes movements with control system. The x-axis is for movement of the carriage, the y-axis is the rotation of mandrel and the z-axis is {{the movement of the}} pay-out eye.

40|$|Filament winding is {{a process}} of loading high degree of fibres to take {{advantage}} of high tensile in manufacturing of hollow, generally cylindrical products. The process affords the high strength to weight ratio laminates and provides a high degree of control over uniformity and fibre orientation. Filament wound structures can be accurately machined, and labour factor for filament winding is lower than other open molding processes. The filament wound composite pipes are fabricated using high strength fiber and resin matrix by hand lay-up using 2 -axis filament <b>winding</b> <b>machine.</b> The present work, the low cost filament <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> is designed and developed for the fabrication of FRP pipes and cylindrical specimens.

40|$|In Domestic <b>Wind</b> <b>Machines,</b> if the <b>wind</b> {{speed is}} low, the output voltage is not {{sufficient}} to charge the battery as it is lower than the rated charging voltage of the battery. This limits the overall efficiency of the <b>Wind</b> <b>Machine</b> to 20 %. This study proposed to design and develop a Buck Boost Controller for the effective utilization of the <b>wind</b> <b>machine.</b> By implementing a controller based Buck Boost converter, the voltage produced at the lower wind speeds can also be utilized effectively by boosting it to the rated charging voltage of the battery. Also if the wind speed is high (> 14 m/s), the DC output voltage will increase to more than 65 V. The converter bucks this high voltage to the nominal battery charging voltage (52 V), thereby protecting the battery from over charging voltage. Thus the effective utilization of the <b>wind</b> <b>machine</b> has been achieved by the use of the proposed Buck Boost Controller...|$|R
