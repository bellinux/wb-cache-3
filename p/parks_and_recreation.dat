5|$|Poehler became {{pregnant}} {{during the latter}} half of the season, with her baby due in the summer or early fall of 2010. The <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Recreation</b> producers decided not to write the pregnancy into the show, so they decided to enter into a continuous production after the season ended to bank episodes for the third season. Six season three episodes were filmed in this fashion. However, in May 2010, NBC announced the third season of <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Recreation</b> was being moved to an undisclosed midseason premiere date to allow the network's new comedy, Outsourced, to run in the Thursday two-hour comedy schedule block. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Recreation,</b> and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no effect on the show's momentum, but could actually build anticipation for its eventual return. In November 2010, it was announced <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Recreation</b> would return to a 9:30p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with determining the competencies required and the subsequent education needed {{for the implementation of}} inclusive practices within the <b>park</b> <b>and</b> <b>recreation</b> industry. With 3. 6 million people or 19 percent of its total population possessing a disability, Australia is experiencing a transformation of its programs and practices as they relate to the inclusion of people with disabilities. Especially noteworthy is the impact that inclusion is having on the <b>park</b> <b>and</b> <b>recreation</b> industry. In order for <b>park</b> <b>and</b> <b>recreation</b> professionals to achieve a cutting edge standard of service delivery to people of all abilities, a study was undertaken to determine the skills, ability and knowledge that are needed to ensure inclusive practices. <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Leisure Australia agreed, through its National Board of Directors, for its members to serve as participants in this study. The data analysed to obtain {{the results of the study}} was gathered from a questionnaire that was mailed to a random sample of eight hundred <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Leisure Australia members. It sought information in the following areas: • The importance of competencies to <b>park</b> <b>and</b> <b>recreation</b> professionals' jobs for including people with disabilities. • The level of perceived competence <b>park</b> <b>and</b> <b>recreation</b> professionals possess for including people with disabilities. • The professional development needed by <b>park</b> <b>and</b> <b>recreation</b> professionals for implementation of inclusive practices. This study examined the results of a needs assessment of <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Leisure Australia members and provides a list of recommendations for continuing education programs that will assist the <b>park</b> <b>and</b> <b>recreation</b> industry to break down existing barriers to inclusive practice. The results of this study will provide important opportunities for the enhancement of the professional development requirements of modern day <b>park</b> <b>and</b> <b>recreation</b> professionals <b>and</b> the promotion of the rights of people with disabilities and their families...|$|R
