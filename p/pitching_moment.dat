5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down <b>pitching</b> <b>moment</b> that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E
5|$|The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest {{was held}} in 1908 and a women's {{competition}} was introduced in 1932. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100m – edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances and {{the increasing number of}} horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward <b>pitching</b> <b>moment</b> to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from the record books. The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7m in length and 800grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3m and 600g for women.|$|E

A custom build force balance, sensitive enough to measure the cycle averaged <b>pitch</b> <b>moment</b> as well as lift force, is also presented.

40|$|Tests {{were made}} of the Clark Y wing having split flaps with {{a gap between the}} flap and the lower surface of the wing. Lift, drag, and <b>pitching</b> <b>moments</b> were {{measured}} for the wing with three different sizes of flap.

40|$|Background Locomotion {{results from}} the {{generation}} of ground reaction forces (GRF) that cause translations {{of the center of}} mass (COM) and generate moments that rotate the body around the COM. The trot is a diagonally-synchronized gait performed by horses at intermediate locomotor speeds. Passage is a variant of the trot performed by highly-trained dressage horses. It is distinguished from trot by having a slow speed of progression combined with great animation of the limbs in the swing phase. The slow speed of passage challenges the horse’s ability to control the sagittal-plane moments around the COM. Footfall patterns and peak GRF are known to differ between passage and trot, but their effects on balance management, which we define here as the ability to control nose-up/nose-down <b>pitching</b> <b>moments</b> around the horse’s COM to maintain a state of equilibrium, are not known. The objective was to investigate which biomechanical variables influence <b>pitching</b> <b>moments</b> around the COM in passage. Methods Three highly-trained dressage horses were captured by a 10 -camera motion analysis system (120 Hz) as they were ridden in passage over four force platforms (960 Hz). A full-body marker set was used to track the horse’s COM and measure balance variables including total body center of pressure (COP), <b>pitching</b> <b>moments,</b> diagonal dissociation timing, peak force production, limb protraction–retraction, and trunk posture. A total of twenty passage steps were extracted and partial correlation (accounting for horse) was used to investigate significant (P < 0. 05) relationships between variables. Results Hindlimb mean protraction–retraction correlated significantly with peak hindlimb propulsive forces (R = 0. 821; P < 0. 01), mean <b>pitching</b> <b>moments</b> (R = 0. 546, P = 0. 016), trunk range of motion, COM craniocaudal location and diagonal dissociation time (P < 0. 05). Discussion <b>Pitching</b> <b>moments</b> around the COM were controlled by a combination of kinematic and kinetic adjustments that involve coordinated changes in GRF magnitudes, GRF distribution between the diagonal limb pairs, and the moment arms of the vertical GRFs. The moment arms depend on hoof placements relative to the COM, which were adjusted by changing limb protraction–retraction angles. Nose-up <b>pitching</b> <b>moments</b> could also be increased by providing a larger hindlimb propulsive GRF...|$|R
2500|$|The Gurney flap {{increases}} the maximum lift coefficient (CL,max), decreases {{the angle of}} attack for zero lift (α0), and {{increases the}} nosedown <b>pitching</b> <b>moment</b> (CM), {{which is consistent with}} an increase in camber of the airfoil.

2500|$|The {{center of}} {{pressure}} of an aircraft is the point where all of the aerodynamic pressure field may be represented by a single force vector with no moment. [...] A similar idea is the aerodynamic center which is the point on an airfoil where the <b>pitching</b> <b>moment</b> produced by the aerodynamic forces is constant with angle of attack.|$|E
2500|$|On a {{cambered}} airfoil {{the center}} of pressure does not occupy a fixed location. [...] For a conventionally cambered airfoil, {{the center of}} pressure lies a little behind the quarter-chord point at maximum lift coefficient (large angle of attack), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) the center of pressure moves toward the rear. [...] When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a conventionally cambered airfoil generates a nose-down <b>pitching</b> <b>moment,</b> so {{the location of the}} center of pressure is an infinite distance behind the airfoil.|$|E
40|$|Hovering {{flapping}} flight is inherently unstable {{and needs to}} be stabilized actively. We present a control mechanism that modulates independently the wing flapping amplitude and offset by displacing joints of a flapping linkage mechanism. We demonstrate its performance by high speed camera recordings of the wing motion as well as by direct measurements of <b>pitch</b> <b>moment</b> and lift force. While flapping at 17 Hz the prototype produces 90 mN of lift and generates <b>pitch</b> <b>moments</b> from - 0. 7 N. mm to 1. 1 N. mm.

40|$|A problem {{associated}} with the wind tunnel testing of very slow flying aircraft is the correction of observed <b>pitching</b> <b>moments</b> to free air conditions. The most significant effects of such corrections {{are to be found}} at moderate downwash angles typical of the landing approach. The wind tunnel walls induce interference velocities at the tail different from those induced at the wing, and these induced velocities also alter the trajectory of the trailing vortex system. The relocated vortex system induces different velocities at the tail from those experienced in free air. The effect of the relocated vortex and the walls is to cause important changes in the measured <b>pitching</b> <b>moments</b> in the wind tunnel...|$|R
2500|$|For a reflex-cambered airfoil, {{the center}} of {{pressure}} lies {{a little ahead of}} the quarter-chord point at maximum lift coefficient (large angle of attack), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) {{the center of}} pressure moves forward.

For very high Mach number (M > 25) simulations, models can be launched into a counter-flowing gas stream generated by the shock tube.

2500|$|The {{high angle}} of attack {{investigations}} on the Gulfstream II indicated that stable trim conditions existed up to 45 degrees {{angle of attack}}. [...] The elevator deflection required to trim to the primary stall at most forward center of gravity was sufficient to trim a deep stall at the aft center of gravity, but recovery from deep stall was immediate upon forward stick motion, and more than adequate nose-down elevator control was available. [...] The acceptability of the Gulfstream II high angle of attack characteristics {{and the absence of}} a deep stall influence on configuration sizing and arrangement was attributed to the mitigating influence of the nacelle-wing overlap on nacelle contribution. Configuration buildup studies revealed the adverse nacelle influence on tail <b>pitching</b> <b>moment</b> contribution above 30 degrees angle of attack was not unduly severe and no appreciable effect on elevator or stabilizer effectiveness was found.|$|E
40|$|Bipedal animals {{experience}} ground {{reaction forces}} (GRFs) that pass {{close to the}} centre of mass (CoM) throughout stance, first decelerating the body, then re-accelerating it {{during the second half}} of stance. This results in fluctuations in kinetic energy, requiring mechanical work from the muscles. However, here we show analytically that, in extreme cases (with a very large body <b>pitch</b> <b>moment</b> of inertia), continuous alignment of the GRF through the CoM requires greater mechanical work than a maintained vertical force; we show numerically that GRFs passing between CoM and vertical throughout stance are energetically favourable under realistic conditions; and demonstrate that the magnitude, if not the precise form, of actual CoM-torque profiles in running is broadly consistent with simple mechanical work minimization for humans with appropriate <b>pitch</b> <b>moment</b> of inertia. While the potential energetic savings of CoM-torque support strategies are small (a few per cent) over the range of human running, their importance increases dramatically at high speeds and stance angles. Fast, compliant runners or hoppers would benefit considerably from GRFs more vertical than the zero-CoM-torque strategy, especially with bodies of high <b>pitch</b> <b>moment</b> of inertia—suggesting a novel advantage to kangaroos of their peculiar long-head/long-tail structure...|$|R
25|$|With {{the model}} {{mounted on a}} force balance, one can measure lift, drag, lateral forces, yaw, roll, and <b>pitching</b> <b>moments</b> over a range of angle of attack. This allows one to produce common curves such as lift {{coefficient}} versus angle of attack (shown).|$|R
