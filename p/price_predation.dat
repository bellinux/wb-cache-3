40|$|The Raising Rivals' Costs {{theory is}} the newest and most {{important}} theory of non <b>price</b> <b>predation.</b> This dissertation assesses its ramifications for s. 36 of the Commerce Act 1986. Chapter I introduces the topic. Chapter II deals with non <b>price</b> <b>predation</b> and shows how it is an attractive strategy for dominant firms. Chapter III discusses the RRC model in depth. Chapter IV critiques it. Chapter V deals with the constituent elements of s. 36. Chapters VI to XIV deal with examples of prohibited conduct under s. 36. In each chapter I analyse whether the theory helps explain the cases, adds anything new and is relevant. I discuss U. S., Australian and New Zealand cases. Chapter XV concludes that the theory is relevant and useful under s. 36...|$|E
40|$|This article {{outlines}} the economic principles necessary {{for understanding the}} issues of cross-subsidization and <b>price</b> <b>predation</b> using a series of straw men, or myths, involving regulatory costing and pricing. It is shown that {{to ensure that a}} firm is not cross-subsidizing it is sufficient that each product individually and every possible subset of the product line pass the net incremental cost test. Alternatively, the stand-alone cost test yields equivalent information when the firm is constrained to earn a non-excessive rate of return on investment. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} the Areeda-Turner test for predatory pricing and the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{adoption}} of demanding proof requirements in its 1993 Brooke Group decision have made {{it very difficult for}} plaintiffs to win conventional predatory pricing claims. While many challenges to exclusionary pricing continue to be made, the legal theory has evolved away from classical predation to a variety of other theories. These include challenges to quantity and market share discounts, single item and package discounts, and various purchasing practices, including slotting fees, overinvestment in fixed cost assets, and overbuying of variable cost inputs. Plaintiffs have enjoyed somewhat greater success with these alternative theories, in large part because the practices are not as well understood as conventional <b>price</b> <b>predation</b> is. This essay examines the state of the law of both conventional predatory pricing and these more recent variants and offers some recommendations...|$|E

50|$|The {{first person}} to seriously conceptualize the {{developmental}} state was Chalmers Johnson. Johnson defined the developmental state as a state that is focused on economic development and takes necessary policy measures to accomplish that objective. He argued that Japan's economic development {{had much to do}} with far-sighted intervention by bureaucrats, particularly those in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). He wrote in his book MITI and the Japanese Miracle:In states that were late to industrialize, the state itself led the industrialization drive, that is, it took on developmental functions. These two differing orientations toward private economic activities, the regulatory orientation and the developmental orientation, produced two different kinds of business-government relationships. The United States is a good example of a state in which the regulatory orientation predominates, whereas Japan is a good example of a state in which the developmental orientation predominates. A regulatory state governs the economy mainly through regulatory agencies that are empowered to enforce a variety of standards of behavior to protect the public against market failures of various sorts, including monopolistic <b>pricing,</b> <b>predation,</b> and other abuses of market power, and by providing collective goods (such as national defense or public education) that otherwise would be undersupplied by the market. In contrast, a developmental state intervenes more directly in the economy through a variety of means to promote the growth of new industries and to reduce the dislocations caused by shifts in investment and profits from old to new industries. In other words, developmental states can pursue industrial policies, while regulatory states generally can not.|$|R
50|$|His work on auction {{theory is}} {{probably}} his best-known. He has explored issues of design, bidding and outcomes for auctions with different rules. He designed auctions for multiple complementary items, {{with an eye}} towards practical applications such as frequency spectrum auctions. Professor Milgrom’s research in industrial organization includes influential studies on limit <b>pricing,</b> entry deterrence, <b>predation,</b> and advertising. In addition, Milgrom has added important novel insights to finance, particularly in connection to speculative trading and market micro-structure. The common theme of his works on auctions, industrial strategies, and financial markets is that economic actors infer from prices and other observables information about the fundamental market values.|$|R
40|$|The {{relatively}} {{short history of}} the airline industry is characterized by sudden shifts and divergent standards that attempt to negotiate a complex market. High demand, uniqueness of service, and difficulty of market entry render the market particularly susceptible to monopolization among competitors. Recently, {{the rise of the}} low-cost carrier business model has exposed high barriers to entry into the airline market. In attempts to remedy the harm against both prospective market entrants and consumers, lowcost carriers have levied <b>price</b> <b>predation</b> claims against entrenched legacy airlines. Due to the difficulty in negotiating the divide between predatory behavior and lawful competition, courts have been justifiably reticent to penalize carriers for competitive pricing of passenger fare. However, despite the likely legality of the pricing structure of incumbent airlines, other exclusionary practices, such as gate monopolization, fortify high barriers to entry and highlight the need for a shift in judicial and regulatory standards. Through analysis of the decision in Spirit Airlines, Inc. v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., this Note analyzes antitrust issues within the helpful framework of contestability theory and considers judicial and regulatory changes to benefit new entrant airlines and consumers...|$|E
40|$|For several years, the {{literature}} has discussed whether a country’s particular economic circumstances {{should be taken}} into account in competition law and policy design. This thesis discusses whether economic growth should be considered as the guiding principle for Latin American Emerging Economies’ competition law and policy design. It specifically explains why having economic growth as competition policy’s guiding principle makes a difference in choosing superior rules and standards, among the large range of efficient rules. In order to explain how economic growth as a guiding principle has an impact on competition policy design, this thesis studies whether the analysis and application of the prohibitions and standards of abuse of dominance in emerging Latin American economies are appropriate, and why, having regard to economic growth, a different approach might be justified. To engage in the study of such questions this thesis centres on the regulation of dominance and the law governing abuse of dominance, in particular on predatory pricing and excessive pricing. After a careful analysis of such institutions, an optimal rule for the regulation of pricing abuses in these emerging economies is proposed. Similarly, having regard to economic growth as the policy’s guiding principle, the mainstream standards on excessive pricing and <b>price</b> <b>predation</b> are evaluated and a different approach is found to be justified. It is concluded that economic growth should be the principle guiding Latin American emerging economies’ competition law and policy design and it is demonstrated that this will grant these economies policy soundness and identity.

40|$|Dumping {{is one of}} {{the most}} poorly {{understood}} and contentious issues in trade policy. The primary reason is that the agreed definitions of dumping are not based on a solid economic foundation. This allows antidumping measures to be used for protectionist ends and to harass trade partners. While putting antidumping measures on a sounder economic foundation in international law may be difficult given their popularity with politicians, no progress can be made until economists provide a theoretically sustainable definition of dumping and devise a set of transparent criteria for determining if dumping is occurring. This paper explains the difficulties with the current definitions of dumping and outlines an agenda for future progress. dumping, international <b>predation,</b> <b>price</b> discrimination, protectionist, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|Predation {{occurs when}} a firm offers {{consumers}} favorable deals, usually in the short run, that get rid of competition and thereby harm consumers in the long run. Modern economic theory has shown how commitment or collective-action problems among consumers can lead to such paradoxical effects. But the paradox does signal danger. Too hawkish a policy might ban favorable deals that are not predatory. “It would be ironic indeed if the standards for predatory pricing liability were so low that antitrust suits themselves became a tool for keeping <b>prices</b> high. ” <b>Predation</b> policy must therefore diagnose the unusual cases where favorable deals harm competition. To this end, courts and commentators have largely defined predation as “sacrifice” followed, at least plausibly, by “recoupment” at consumers’ expense. The American Airlines case raises difficult questions about this approa...|$|R
40|$|The double-crested cormorant, Phalacrocorax auritus, is {{considered}} the primary depredating bird species on commercially produced channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, in the southeastern USA. We simulated different levels of cormorant predation on losses at harvest and economic effects on channel catfish production in a multiple-batch cropping system. We observed significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) declines in catfish production at increasing levels of cormorant predation in this study. This decline was mitigated by increased individual growth of catfish at higher predation rates (i. e., lower catfish densities). This mitigating effect produced a non-linear relationship with total kg of catfish harvested per pond resulting in a non-linear incremental increase in breakeven <b>price</b> related to <b>predation.</b> Costs of production (/kg) increased with increasing predation levels up to very high levels of predation with a cumulative maximum increase in breakeven price of 0. 143 /kg. These results indicate that losses at harvest due to cormorant predation occur immediately but are mitigated in part by compensatory growth of individual catfish. Losses due to cormorant predation in multi-batch systems can be considerable, {{but there is not}} a 1 : 1 relationship between losses and kg of catfish harvested due to compensatory factors...|$|R
