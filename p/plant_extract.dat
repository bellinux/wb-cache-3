Depending on the paper used, plant pastes can dry in 10 to 15 minutes. The more {{absorbent}} the paper is, the faster it dries as the paper absorbs most of the oil. Also, plant pastes tend to smudge more easily than silk pastes due to the loose binding agent.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{observation that}} amiodarone's progenitor molecule, khellin, had cardioactive properties, {{was made by}} the Russian physiologist Gleb von Anrep while working in Cairo in 1946. Khellin is obtained from a <b>plant</b> <b>extract</b> of Khella or Ammi visnaga, a common plant in north Africa. Anrep noticed that one of his technicians had been cured of anginal symptoms after taking khellin, then used for various, non-cardiac ailments. [...] This led to efforts by European pharmaceutical industries to isolate an active compound. Amiodarone was initially developed in 1961 at the Labaz company, Belgium, by chemists Tondeur and Binon, who were working on preparations derived from khellin. It became popular in Europe as a treatment for angina pectoris.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Plant</b> <b>extracts</b> {{have been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine for the treatment of various maladies including neurological diseases. Several central nervous system receptors have been demonstrated to interact with <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> and components affecting the pharmacology and thereby potentially playing a role in human disease and treatment. For instance, extracts from Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort) targeted several CNS receptors. Similarly, extracts from Piper nigrum, Stephania cambodica, and Styphnolobium japonicum exerted inhibition of agonist-induced activity of the human neurokinin- 1 receptor. Methods: Different methods have been established for receptor binding and functional assays based on radioactive and fluorescence-labeled ligands in cell lines and primary cell cultures. Behavioral studies of the effect of <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> have been conducted in rodents. <b>Plant</b> <b>extracts</b> have further been subjected to mood and cognition studies in humans. Results: Mechanisms of action at molecular and cellular levels have been elucidated for medicinal plants in support of standardization of herbal products and identification of active extract compounds. In several studies, <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> demonstrated affinity to a number of CNS receptors in parallel indicating the complexity of this interaction. In vivo studies showed modifications of CNS receptor affinity and behavioral responses in animal models after treatment with medicinal herbs. Certain <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> demonstrated neuroprotection and enhanced cognitive performance, respectively, when evaluated in humans. Noteworthy, the penetration of <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> and their protective effect on the blood-brain-barrier are discussed. Conclusion: The affinity of <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> and their isolated compounds for CNS receptors indicates an important role for medicinal plants in the treatment of neurological disorders. Moreover, studies in animal and human models have confirmed a scientific basis for the application of medicinal herbs. However, additional investigations related to <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> and their isolated compounds, as well as their application in animal models and the conducting of clinical trials, are required...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} 31 <b>plant</b> <b>extracts,</b> which most are {{traditionally}} {{used to treat}} ciguatera fish poisoning in the Pacific area, were Studied on the cytotoxicity of mouse neuroblastoma cells produced by ouabain, veratridine and/or brevetoxin- 3 or Pacific ciguatoxin- 1. The cell viability was determined using a quantitative colorimetric method. A marked cytotoxicity of seven of the 31 <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> studied, was observed. Despite this, these <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> were suspected to contain active compound(s) against the cytotoxicity produced by brevetoxin (2 extracts), brevetoxin, ouabain and/or veratridine (3 extracts), or only against that of ouabain and/or veratridine (2 extracts). Among the 24 <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> that exhibited by themselves no cytotoxicity, 22 were active against the effect of brevetoxin or against that of both veratridine and brevetoxin. similar results were obtained when the seven most active <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> were reassayed using ciguatoxin instead of brevetoxin. In conclusion, the present work reports the first activity assessment of some <b>plant</b> <b>extracts,</b> achieved in vitro on a quite large scale. The fact that 27 <b>plant</b> <b>extracts</b> were found to exert, in vitro, a protective effect against the action of ciguatoxin and/or brevetoxin, paves the way for finding new active compounds to treat ciguatera fish poisoning, provided these compounds also reverse the effects of sodium channel activators.
