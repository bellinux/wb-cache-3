50|$|The LP effect {{consists}} in a periodic {{variation of the}} Tc with the magnetic flux, which {{is the product of}} the magnetic field (coaxial) and the cross sectional area of the cylinder. Tc depends on the kinetic energy (KE) of the superconducting electrons. More precisely, the Tc is such temperature at which the free energies of normal and superconducting electrons are equal, for a given magnetic field. To understand the <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the Tc, which constitutes the LP effect, one needs to understand the periodic variation of the kinetic energy. The KE oscillates because the applied magnetic flux increases the KE while superconducting vortices, periodically entering the cylinder, compensate for the flux effect and reduce the KE. Thus, the <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the kinetic energy and the related <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the critical temperature occur together.|$|E

Although the circuits have structural symmetry, asymmetric patterns of oscillations {{have been observed}} in real power systems. This paper describes an approach to understanding typical patterns of oscillations in the three-phase circuits using symmetry. In order to figure out oscillation patterns, we introduce a three LC ladder circuit which has a higher symmetry than the three-phase circuit. Using only the symmetries of the three LC ladder circuit, we classify <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations</b> and construct a lattice of those modes. Further, extending the method to almost <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations,</b> we decompose and characterize typical almost <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations</b> by their symmetry.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the existence of local and global Hopf bifurcations for a price adjusting model with time delay. It can be concluded that time delay may destabilize the equilibrium of that model and induce <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Moreover, the <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations</b> will persist even when the delay is sufficiently large, which indicates the global existence of a Hopf bifurcation in the model. Thus, the results obtained here can supplement the previous literature and help people to understand price fluctuation mechanisms.|$|R

The Stern–Brocot tree is more general than the Farey tree.

Hopf bifurcations and amplitude death induced by the coupling time delay are first investigated by analyzing the related characteristic equation. Then the oscillation patterns of these bifurcating <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations</b> are determined and we find {{that there are two}} kinds of critical values of the coupling time delay: one is related to the synchronous <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations,</b> the other is related to eight branches of asynchronous periodic solutions bifurcating simultaneously from the zero solution. The stability of these bifurcating periodic solutions are also explicitly determined by calculating the normal forms on center manifolds, and the stable synchronous and stable phase-locked periodic solutions are found. Finally, some numerical simulations are employed to illustrate and extend our obtained theoretical results and numerical studies also describe the switches of stable synchronous and phase-locked <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations...</b>|$|R

When the overtones are integer multiples (e.g., 2&times;, 3&times; ... 6&times; ... of the fundamental frequency (called harmonics), then - neglecting damping - the oscillation is periodic—i.e., it vibrates exactly the same way over and over. Humans seem to enjoy the sound of <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations.</b> For this reason, many musical instruments, including pianos, are designed to produce nearly <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations,</b> that is, to have overtones {{as close as possible to}} the harmonics of the fundamental tone.|$|R
40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocyte (CTL) {{response to}} the infection of CD 4 + T cells by human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) has previously been modelled using standard response functions, with relatively simple dynamical outcomes. In this paper, we investigate {{the consequences of a}} more general CTL response and show that a sigmoidal response function gives rise to complex behaviours previously unobserved. Multiple equilibria are shown to exist and none of the equilibria is a global attractor during the chronic infection phase. Coexistence of local attractors with their own basin of attractions is the norm. In addition, both stable and unstable <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations</b> can be created through Hopf bifurcations. We show that transient <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations</b> occur when a saddle-type periodic solution exists. As a consequence, transient <b>periodic</b> <b>oscillations</b> can be robust and observable.
