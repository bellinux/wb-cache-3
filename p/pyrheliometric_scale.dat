40|$|Solar {{irradiance}} measurements by instruments (Eppley Angstrom Pyrheliometers) reproducing the International <b>Pyrheliometric</b> <b>Scale</b> (IPS) {{have been}} compared with measurements made simultaneously {{by a number}} of JPL Active Cavity Radiometers (ACR) and the Practical Absolute Cavity Radiometer (PACRAD). The results of these tests demonstrate a systematic difference between the absolute radiation scale as defined by the ACR and PACRAD measurements and the IPS...|$|E
40|$|The Active Cavity Radiometer (ACR), an {{accurate}} absolute pyrheliometer, {{has been developed}} for measurements of total solar irradiance. It {{has been used to}} discover a - 2. 2 % error in the International <b>Pyrheliometric</b> <b>Scale</b> and to make measurements in balloon flight experiments yielding a solar constant value of 136. 6 (+ or - 0. 7) mW/sq cm. New ACRs are being developed to monitor the total output of solar optical radiation in balloon, satellite and space shuttle experiments with long-term absolute uncertainty of + or - 0. 1 % or less. In a separate program, instrumentation for the measurement of the scattering and extinction of solar radiation by the atmosphere is being constructed to provide data for modeling atmospheric aerosol content. The aerosol models will facilitate computation of radiative transfer effects yielding quantitative net fluxes useful in evaluating the climatological impact of aerosols...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{absolute}} cavity radiometers, {{designed to measure}} solar irradiance, has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Analysis indicates the absolute uncertainty of irradiance measurements made by the most recent devices {{to be less than}} plus or minus 0. 5 mW/sq cm. In a series of experiments the radiometric scale defined by the JPL instruments has been compared with the International <b>Pyrheliometric</b> <b>Scale</b> (IPS). A systematic 2. 2 % difference has been observed with the IPS producing consistently lower measurements. The solar constant and spectral distribution have been derived from high-altitude balloon flight measurements made by two types of JPL cavity radiometers. Measurements at 25 km in 1968 produced a solar constant value of 137. 0 mW/sq cm. From 1969 measurements at 36 km, a value of 136. 6 mW/sq cm was derived, with an estimated absolute uncertainty of plus or minus 0. 5 %. The solar spectrum information from these experiments agrees most closely with the solar spectrum model of Labs and Neckel (1968) ...|$|E
