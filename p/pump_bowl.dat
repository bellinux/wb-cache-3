25|$|Corrosion from {{tellurium}} - The reactor makes {{small amounts}} of tellurium as a fission product. In the MSRE, this caused {{small amounts of}} corrosion at the grain boundaries of the special nickel alloy, Hastelloy-N. Metallurgical studies showed that adding 1 to 2% niobium to the Hastelloy-N alloy improves resistance to corrosion by tellurium. Maintaining the ratio of / to less than 60 reduced corrosion by keeping the fuel salt slightly reducing. The MSRE continually contacted the flowing fuel salt with a beryllium metal rod submerged in a cage inside the <b>pump</b> <b>bowl.</b> This caused a fluorine shortage in the salt, reducing tellurium to a less aggressive (elemental) form. This method is also effective in reducing corrosion in general, because the fission process produces more fluorine atoms that would otherwise attack the structural metals.|$|E

50|$|After {{the final}} {{shutdown}} in December 1969, the reactor {{was left in}} standby for nearly a year. A limited examination program was then carried out, including a moderator bar from the core, a control rod thimble, heat exchanger tubes, parts from the fuel <b>pump</b> <b>bowl,</b> and a freeze valve that had developed a leak during the final reactor shutdown. The radioactive systems were then closed to await ultimate disposal.|$|E

40|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{study of}} ²²²Rn {{concentrations in the}} ground water of the North-Central Tucson basin revealed a range of concentrations from 80 to 1400 pCi/L in wells, and 60 to 1260 pCi/L in domestic waters. Estimated degradation of Rn in water from wells to homes ranges from 8 to 50 %. The interior well field of mid-Tucson, may represent background concentrations of Rn with a mean value of 250 pCi/L. The limited data define an anomalous trend (500 to 1400 pCVL) of ²²²Rn paralleling the Santa Cruz River area. 222 Rn concentrations above 500 pCVL correlate positively with temperature, and no low temperature water contains high ²²²Rn levels. Weak inverse correlations of ²²²Rn with <b>pumping</b> <b>bowl</b> depth, <b>pumping</b> water level and average upper perforation intervals are evident. It is concluded {{that the source of}} ²²²Rn is close to the well bore. Considered are several possible hypothesis and mechanisms responsible for the anomalous Santa Cruz ²²²Rn trend, including mechanisms related to water circulation along the Santa Cruz fault, lithology, and aquifer compaction...|$|R
50|$|One {{unexpected}} {{finding was}} shallow, inter-granular cracking in all metal surfaces {{exposed to the}} fuel salt. The cause of the embrittlement was tellurium - a fission product generated in the fuel. This was first noted in the specimens that {{were removed from the}} core at intervals during the reactor operation. Post-operation examination of pieces of a control-rod thimble, heat-exchanger tubes, and <b>pump</b> <b>bowl</b> parts revealed the ubiquity of the cracking and emphasized its importance to the MSR concept. The crack growth was rapid enough to become a problem over the planned thirty-year life of a follow-on thorium breeder reactor. This cracking could be reduced by adding small amounts of niobium to the Hastelloy-N.|$|E

40|$|A nebulizer-hydride {{generator}} {{system has been}} developed in which large droplets of the acidified sample aerosol from a pneumatic nebulizer were trapped by the impact wall of a smoking-pipe shaped hydride generator, collected in its bowl, and reacted with NaBH 4 or KBH 4 solution <b>pumped</b> into the <b>bowl</b> to form volatile hydrides. The gas-aerosol mixture passed into an inductively coupled plasma for simultaneous determination of the hydrideforming and other elements. With this system the detection limits for the hydride-forming elements could be improved by more than 20 times compared to those obtained with the conventional nebulizing system, white {{those of the other}} elements remained practically unaffected. The sample consumption remained essentially the same for both systems. The new system could be easily switched to conventional nebulization...|$|R
50|$|The Sepro Leach Reactor {{is a high}} {{concentration}} leach reactor developed to treat the gold concentrate produced by the Falcon Concentrator. The unit consists of a concentrate holding tank and a leach tank and impeller which are linked by a Sepro vertical <b>bowl</b> <b>pump.</b> The SLR uses either peroxide or oxygen gas to achieve elevated levels of dissolved oxygen required to accelerate the leaching process with no reagents required. The pregnant leach solution produced can be directly electrowon. With the addition of an electrowinning unit the final product becomes a gold plated carbon that can be directly refined to produce gold bullion. Extensive test work of the SLR on site has shown over 99% of the target mineral is recovered through a simple, fully automated process that is easily incorporated into recovery operations. Sepro Mineral Systems Corp. supplies SLR units with capacities ranging from 1000-50,000 kg.|$|R

40|$|A {{compilation}} {{is presented}} of results obtained to date {{from a number}} of reactor physics calculations for the molten salt reactor experiment (MSRE). Included are one-dimensional multigroup and two-dimensional twogroup calculations of critical mass, flux, and power density distributions; gamma heating in the core can, reactor vessel, and core support grid; drain tank criticality; and an estimate of the beta, gamma, and delayed neutron dose rates due to fission products in the fuel contained in the <b>pump</b> <b>bowl.</b> For a cylindrical core 54 in. in diameter and 66 in. high, graphite-mcderated with 8 vol% fuel salt, the calculated critical loading is 0. 76 mole% uranium (93. 3 % U/sup 235 /), which is equivalent to a critical mass of 16 kg. At a reactor power of 10 mw, the peak power density in the core assuming a homogeneous mixure of fuel salt and graphite is 10 watts/cm/sup 3 /, the average power density is 4 watts/cm/sup 3 /. The computed peak thermal flux is 7. 3 x 10 /sup 13 / neutrons/cm/sup 2 / sec and the average is 2. 5 x l 0 /sup 13 / neutrons/cm/sup 2 / sec. Gamma heating prcduces a power density of 0. 2 watts/cm/sup 3 / in the core wall at the midplane and 0. 4 watts/cm/sup 3 / in the support grid {{at the bottom of the}} core at the reactor center line.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} an {{accurate}} and efficient numerical algorithm for simulation of three-dimensional turbomachinery flows is presented. This model is used later for turbomachinery performance prediction. Mathematical model {{is based on}} the RANS equations that are written in non-inertial frame of reference. Reynolds stresses are approximated with Boussinesq hypothesis using two-equation k-ω near-wall turbulence closure. Discretization of convective fluxes of the mean flow equation is performed using central differences, by explicitly added eigenvalue scaling non-isotropic matrix-valued artificial dissipation. In turbulence closure equations, numerical convective fluxes are approximated according to Roe second order upwind scheme in conjunction with monotone (TVD) variable extrapolations. The semi-discrete equations are advanced in time using a four stage explicit Runge-Kutta scheme enhanced with local time stepping, variable coefficient implicit residual smoothing and multigrid acceleration. Developed software is applied for numerical analysis of work processes in the model of NEL mixed-flow <b>bowl</b> <b>pump.</b> Obtained numerical results are in good agreement with the available experimental data in the operating conditions at the bes...|$|R
