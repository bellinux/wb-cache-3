5|$|Linseed oil's {{properties}} as a polymer make it highly {{suitable for}} wood finishing, {{for use in}} oil paints, as a plasticizer and hardener in <b>putty</b> and in making linoleum. When used in food or medicinally, linseed oil is called flaxseed oil.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} <b>putty.</b> The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting {{his face in the}} <b>putty,</b> so he was instructed to hold his breath as long as he possibly could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E

5000|$|The Z-Putties are Lord Zedd's own army of <b>Putties.</b> Despite being {{stronger}} than Rita's <b>Putties,</b> their main weakness is the [...] "Z" [...] on their chests which {{causes them to}} shatter/explode when hit. Following this discovery, Z-Putties become less effective than Rita's as Zedd sacrifices durability for strength. In season three, the <b>Putties</b> and Z-Putties are replaced by Rito's own army of foot soldiers the Tenga Warriors.|$|R
50|$|Technically {{known as}} <b>putties,</b> but more {{commonly}} Plastic explosives, these mixtures are a thick, flexible, moldable solid material {{that can be}} shaped and will retain that shape after forming, much like clay. <b>Putties</b> normally contain mostly RDX explosive, but may include some PETN (Semtex, for example).|$|R

50|$|Types of {{sealants}} {{fall between}} the higher-strength, adhesive-derived sealers and coatings at one end, and extremely low-strength <b>putties,</b> waxes, and caulks at the other. <b>Putties</b> and caulks serve only one function - i.e., {{to take up}} space and fill voids. Silicone {{is an example of}} a sealant - and has a proven long life and is unaffected by UV or extremes of weather or temperature.|$|R
50|$|Rita creates Goldar, {{raises an}} army of <b>Putties,</b> and attacks Angel Grove to find the Zeo Crystal. The Rangers battle the <b>Putties</b> and head to Angel Grove in their Zords. After the Rangers destroy the <b>Putties,</b> Goldar pushes the Rangers and their Zords into a fiery pit. In the pit, the Zords combine, forming the Megazord. Rita merges with Goldar. The Rangers battle and destroy Goldar. After refusing Jason's offer to surrender, a defiant Rita tells the Rangers that more will come for the crystal and leaps at the Megazord only to be slapped into space. The Rangers are praised as local heroes, and with Rita's threats foiled, they return to their normal lives.|$|R
25|$|A rubbery polymer {{sometimes}} called Slime, Flubber, 'gluep' or 'glurch' (or erroneously called Silly <b>Putty,</b> {{which is based}} on silicone polymers), can be made by cross-linking polyvinyl alcohol with borax. Making flubber from polyvinyl acetate-based glues, such as Elmer's Glue, and borax is a common elementary-science demonstration.|$|E

Crayola markers were introduced in 1978 {{to coincide with the}} 75th anniversary of Crayola crayons. In 1984, the company was acquired by Hallmark Cards, a privately held corporation. Colored pencils and a line of washable markers were added in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{finishing}} {{starts with}} sanding either by hand, typically using a sanding block or power sander, scraping, or planing. Imperfections or nail holes {{on the surface}} may be filled using wood <b>putty</b> or pores may be filled using wood filler. Often, the wood's color is changed by staining, bleaching, or any {{of a number of}} other techniques.|$|E

40|$|Latex gloves retard {{the setting}} of {{polyvinyl}} siloxane impression materials. Thiocarbamates contained in latex were cited as the cause. This study investigated the presence of thiocarbamates in gloves and on glove-mixed impression <b>putties</b> by an iodine/azide spot test. This study also used oscillating rheometry to monitor the setting behavior of a polyvinyl siloxane impression material (President) following mixing with natural latex and hypoallergenic latex rubber gloves. To detect chemical interaction between latex gloves and the impression material, Differential Scanning Calorimetry was employed non-isothermally to set impression <b>putties</b> with and without o. 2 % zinc dithiocarbamate. The {{results of this study}} showed that while natural latex gloves retard {{the setting of}} polyvinyl siloxane impression <b>putties,</b> hypoallergenic latex gloves totally inhibit it. It has also been found that thiocarbamates are transferred from the gloves to the <b>putties</b> and consequently, interact with them. Clinical Significance: Latex gloves will partially or totally inhibit the setting of polyvinyl siloxane impression material, and with some types, even after they are removed, if the hands were not washed thoroughly.

25|$|One {{example of}} the {{dramatic}} ways that toys can influence child development involves clay sculpting toys such as Play-Doh and Silly <b>Putty</b> and their home-made counterparts. Mary Ucci, Educational Director of the Child Study Center of Wellesley College, demonstrates how such toys positively impact the physical development, cognitive development, emotional development, and social development of children.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the few}} issues Paxton {{could not}} {{completely}} solve was leaks - when completed, rain {{was found to be}} leaking into the huge building in over a thousand places. The leaks were sealed with <b>putty,</b> but the relatively poor quality of the sealant materials available at the time meant that the problem was never totally overcome.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe role {{of aging}} on {{rheological}} properties of lime <b>putties</b> was investigated by rotational rheometry, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and particle size distribution analyzes. Disaggregation of large clusters during aging and resulting microstructural enrichment of micron-sized particles {{was found to be}} one of the possible reasons for the continuous increment of plasticity and yield stress of lime <b>putties</b> during long-term aging. The extent of thixotropic and rheopectic behavior is affected by both calcination process and microstructure development during aging...|$|R

25|$|Silicones {{are often}} used in {{waterproofing}} treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature greases and waxes, and caulking compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly <b>Putty</b> was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil. Other silicon compounds function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide. Silicon is a component of some superalloys.|$|E
25|$|Most commonly, the {{continuously}} linked {{backbone of}} a polymer {{used for the}} preparation of plastics consists mainly of carbon atoms. A simple example is polyethylene ('polythene' in British English), whose repeating unit is based on ethylene monomer. However, other structures do exist; for example, elements such as silicon form familiar materials such as silicones, examples being Silly <b>Putty</b> and waterproof plumbing sealant. Oxygen is also commonly present in polymer backbones, {{such as those of}} polyethylene glycol, polysaccharides (in glycosidic bonds), and DNA (in phosphodiester bonds).|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} modern {{aquarium}} {{made of glass}} {{was developed in the}} 19th century by Robert Warrington. During the Victorian age, glass aquariums commonly had slate or steel bottoms, which allowed them to be heated underneath by an open-flame heat source. These aquariums had the glass panels attached with metal frames and sealed with <b>putty.</b> Metal-framed aquariums were still available until the mid-1960s, when the modern, silicone-sealed style replaced them. Acrylic aquariums first became available to the public in the 1970s. Laminated glass is sometimes used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic.|$|E
