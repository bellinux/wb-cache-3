I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, {{he was the only}} virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.|$|E

50|$|Pianos {{have had}} <b>pedals,</b> or some close equivalent, since the {{earliest}} days. (In the 18th century, some pianos used levers pressed upward by the player's knee instead of <b>pedals.)</b> Most grand pianos in the US have three pedals: the soft <b>pedal</b> (una corda), sostenuto, and sustain <b>pedal</b> (from left to right, respectively), while in Europe, the standard is two pedals: the soft <b>pedal</b> and the sustain <b>pedal.</b> Most modern upright pianos also have three pedals: soft <b>pedal,</b> practice <b>pedal</b> and sustain <b>pedal,</b> though older or cheaper models may lack the practice <b>pedal.</b> In Europe {{the standard for}} upright pianos is two pedals: the soft and the sustain <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A sustain <b>pedal</b> or {{sustaining}} <b>pedal</b> (also called damper <b>pedal,</b> loud <b>pedal,</b> or open <b>pedal)</b> is {{the most}} commonly used <b>pedal</b> in a modern piano. It is typically the rightmost of two or three <b>pedals.</b> When pressed, the sustain <b>pedal</b> [...] "sustains" [...] all the damped strings on the piano by moving all the dampers away from the strings and allowing them to vibrate freely. All notes played will continue to sound until the vibration naturally ceases, or until the <b>pedal</b> is released.|$|R
25|$|Racing cyclists {{often have}} gears {{with a small}} {{relative}} difference of around 7% to 10%; this allows fine adjustment of gear ratios to suit the conditions and maintain a consistent <b>pedalling</b> speed. Mountain bikes and hybrid bikes often have gears with a moderate relative difference of around 15%; this allows for a much larger gear range while having an acceptable step between gears. 3-speed hub gears may have a relative difference of some 33% to 37%; such big steps require a very substantial change in <b>pedalling</b> speed and often feel excessive. A step of 7% corresponds to a 1-tooth change from a 14-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket, while a step of 15% corresponds to a 2-tooth change from a 13-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket.|$|E
25|$|Human {{factors can}} also be significant. Rohloff {{demonstrates}} that overall efficiency can be improved in some cases by using a slightly less efficient gear ratio when this leads to greater human efficiency (in converting food to pedal power) because a more effective <b>pedalling</b> speed is being used.|$|E
25|$|The Temecula Duck Pond is {{also home}} to an art piece {{entitled}} Singing in the Rain. It was commissioned by the city of Leidschendam-Voorburg as a gift to the city to commemorate the resilient American spirit {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks. The piece depicts a mother and her children bravely <b>pedalling</b> a bicycle into the strong headwinds of a storm.|$|E
50|$|A double <b>pedal</b> is two <b>pedal</b> tones played simultaneously.An {{inverted}} <b>pedal</b> is a <b>pedal</b> {{that is not}} in {{the bass}} (and often is the highest part.) Mozart included numerous inverted <b>pedals</b> in his works, particularly in the solo parts of his concertos. An internal <b>pedal</b> is a <b>pedal</b> that is similar to the inverted <b>pedal,</b> except that it is played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.|$|R
50|$|Piano <b>pedals</b> are {{foot-operated}} levers at {{the base}} of a piano which change the instrument's sound in various ways. Modern pianos usually have three <b>pedals,</b> from left to right, the soft <b>pedal</b> (or una corda), the sostenuto <b>pedal,</b> and the sustaining <b>pedal</b> (or damper <b>pedal).</b> Some pianos omit the sostenuto <b>pedal,</b> or have a middle <b>pedal</b> with a different purpose such as a muting function also known as silent piano.|$|R
50|$|The {{tire changer}} has two foot <b>pedals.</b> The left <b>pedal</b> {{is called the}} clamp control <b>pedal,</b> a three {{position}} <b>pedal</b> that opens and closes the rim clamps. Once pressed, pneumatic pistons move the 4 rim clamps together or apart simultaneously. The right <b>pedal</b> is the table top <b>pedal,</b> which is a three position <b>pedal</b> that controls {{the rotation of the}} table top. When the table top <b>pedal</b> is pressed down, the table top spins clockwise. The table top spins counter clockwise when the <b>pedal</b> is raised.|$|R
25|$|The {{chain drive}} {{improved}} comfort and speed, as the drive {{was transferred to}} the non-steering rear wheel and allowed for smooth, relaxed and injury free pedaling (earlier designs that required <b>pedalling</b> the steering front wheel were difficult to pedal while turning, due to the misalignment of rotational planes of leg and pedal). With easier pedaling, the rider more easily turned corners.|$|E
25|$|Factors {{which have}} been shown to affect the {{drive-train}} efficiency include the type of transmission system (chain, shaft, belt), the type of gearing system (fixed, derailleur, hub, infinitely variable), the size of the sprockets used, the magnitude of the input power, the <b>pedalling</b> speed, and how rusty the chain is. For a particular gearing system, different gear ratios generally have different efficiencies.|$|E
25|$|Descending any {{significant}} gradient {{is more difficult}} as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve <b>pedalling</b> performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.|$|E
50|$|Boss's line of compact <b>pedals</b> {{began in}} 1977 {{with the release}} of six <b>pedals,</b> all of them discontinued: an {{overdrive}} <b>pedal</b> (OD-1), a phaser <b>pedal</b> (PH-1), a parametric equalizer called the Spectrum (SP-1), a 6-band graphic equalizer (GE-6), a compressor <b>pedal</b> (CS-1) and an automatic wah <b>pedal</b> (TW-1). The Boss DS-1 was released the next year, in 1978. Their first compact chorus <b>pedal</b> (CE-2) came in 1979, and their first flanger <b>pedal</b> (BF-2) in 1980. In 1983 Boss released the DD-2 Digital Delay, the first mass-produced digital delay in a compact <b>pedal</b> format. The Metal Zone (MT-2) was released in 1991. In 1992 Boss released nine new <b>pedals,</b> including the Turbo Distortion (DS-2). The Heavy Metal (HM-2) distortion <b>pedal</b> {{was an integral part of}} the guitar sound of many styles of heavy metal music ever since. The <b>pedals</b> all share the same 'footprint', for compatibility with <b>pedal</b> boards.|$|R
50|$|The crescendo <b>pedal</b> is {{typically}} used only in certain repertoire, and, generally speaking, the organ's expression <b>pedal(s)</b> are more commonly used. Because the crescendo <b>pedal</b> both resembles and is {{adjacent to the}} expression <b>pedal(s),</b> it may confuse beginning organists, such as pianists who are filling in at the church organ, who intend to use the expression <b>pedal(s)</b> rather than the crescendo <b>pedal.</b> To avoid this danger, the organist should look at the <b>pedals</b> before playing to ascertain if they are labeled, as well as practice locating the correct <b>pedal</b> by feel. When feeling for a <b>pedal</b> while playing, the organist should remember that the crescendo <b>pedal</b> is normally the right-most of the volume <b>pedals,</b> and that its surface is often raised slightly above the expression <b>pedal(s)</b> so as to help the organist to avoid selecting it by mistake.|$|R
40|$|<b>Pedal</b> force {{effectiveness}} in cycling is usually {{measured by the}} ratio of force perpendicular to the crank (effective force) and total force applied to the <b>pedal</b> (resultant force). Most studies measuring <b>pedal</b> forces have been restricted to one leg but {{a few studies have}} reported bilateral asymmetry in <b>pedal</b> forces. <b>Pedal</b> force effectiveness is increased at higher power output and reduced at higher <b>pedaling</b> cadences. Changes in saddle position resulted in unclear effects in <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness, while lowering the upper body reduced <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness. Cycling experience and fatigue had unclear effects on <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness. Augmented feedback of <b>pedal</b> forces can improve <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness within a training session and after multiple sessions for cyclists and non-cyclists. No differences in <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness were evident between summarized and instantaneous feedback. Conversely, economy/efficiency seems to be reduced when cyclists are instructed to improve <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness during acute intervention studies involving one session. Decoupled crank systems effectively improved <b>pedal</b> force effectiveness with conflicting effects on economy/efficiency and performance. <br /...|$|R
25|$|On tandem {{bicycles}} the <b>pedalling</b> {{contribution of}} both riders is often combined and coordinated by the crank arms. There {{may be a}} second set of chainrings, often on the opposite side from the regular drive train, one on each crank set and connected by a separate chain. The most common implementation has both cyclists pedaling at exactly the same pace and usually in phase, although it is possible to configure the system for out-of-phase pedaling.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, EBT rode a 3775km journey by solar vehicle from Darwin to {{the steps}} of the Victorian State Parliament from 23 November - December 9, just as the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen opened. Their Outback Rode RAGE (Ride Against Greenhouse Emissions) {{campaign}} aimed to raise awareness about climate change and how individuals can reduce their environmental footprints. Seven students took turns on the hi-tech vehicle. The vehicle was 30 per cent powered by solar electricity and 70 per cent by <b>pedalling</b> and hit a top of 115km/h.|$|E
25|$|The next {{development}} of the bicycle, the penny-farthings, were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back <b>pedalling.</b> During its development from 1870 to 1878, there were various designs for brakes, most of them operating on the rear wheel. However, as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller, {{with more of the}} rider's weight over the front wheel, braking on the rear wheel became less effective. The front brake, introduced by John Kean in 1873, had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power.|$|E
50|$|Rogers uses an {{overdrive}} <b>pedal</b> and a tremolo <b>pedal,</b> {{the latter}} custom made by Colin Bloxom, {{as well as}} a wah <b>pedal</b> and, occasionally, a Route 66 overdrive/compression <b>pedal.</b> Rogers also uses an overdrive <b>pedal</b> that was built by Ramblin' Guitars.|$|R

25|$|Some penny-farthing riders {{used only}} back <b>pedalling</b> and got off {{and walked down}} steep hills, but most also used a brake. Having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their feet off the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars, {{although}} most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills. Putting the legs under the handlebars with the feet off the pedals placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in the spokes.|$|E
25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on racing bicycles with two chainrings. The relative {{step on the}} chainrings (say 35%) is typically around {{three or four times}} the relative step on the cogset (say 8% or 10%), e.g. chainrings 39-53 and close-range cogsets 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21 or 12-13-15-17-19-21-23-25. This arrangement provides much more scope for adjusting the gear ratio to maintain a constant <b>pedalling</b> speed, but any change of chainring must be accompanied by a simultaneous change of 3 or 4 sprockets on the cogset if the goal is to switch to the next higher or lower gear ratio.|$|E
25|$|Rachmaninoff {{was also}} {{involved}} in various ways with music on piano rolls. Several manufacturers, {{and in particular the}} Aeolian Company, had published his compositions on perforated music rolls from about 1900 onwards. His sister-in-law, Sofia Satina, remembered him at the family estate at Ivanovka, <b>pedalling</b> gleefully through a set of rolls of his Second Piano Concerto, apparently acquired from a German source, most probably the Aeolian Company's Berlin subsidiary, the Choralion Company. Aeolian in London created a set of three rolls of this concerto in 1909, which remained in the catalogues of its various successors until the late 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Morley <b>Pedals</b> is {{the name}} of a guitar effects <b>pedal</b> company, famous for {{manufacturing}} wah-wah <b>pedals</b> and other treadle type effects for guitar. Morley <b>pedals</b> use electro-optical circuitry rather than a potentiometer to control the effect. The foot treadle controls a shutter inside the <b>pedal</b> that in turn controls the amount of light reaching a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). The advantage to this system is that there are no potentiometers in the signal path to wear out or become [...] "scratchy sounding" [...] over time. Electro-optical circuitry is used throughout the classic Morley <b>pedal</b> line, which includes or has included volume <b>pedals,</b> delay <b>pedals,</b> chorus and phaser <b>pedals,</b> and many others.|$|R

25|$|Vehicles {{using two}} freewheels. A freewheel, as {{used on a}} pedal bicycle for example, allows a road wheel to rotate faster than the {{mechanism}} that drives it, allowing a cyclist to stop <b>pedalling</b> while going downhill. Some early automobiles had the engine driving two freewheels, one for each driving road wheel. When the vehicle turned, the engine would continue to drive the wheel {{on the inside of}} the curve, but the wheel on the outside was permitted to rotate faster by its freewheel. Thus, while turning, the vehicle had only one driving wheel. Driving in reverse is impossible as is engine braking due to the freewheels.|$|E
25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a freewheel {{to allow the}} pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without <b>pedalling</b> using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to {{the hub of the}} back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.|$|E
25|$|Since cyclists' {{legs are}} most {{efficient}} over {{a narrow range}} of pedaling speeds, or cadence, a variable gear ratio helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum <b>pedalling</b> speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use hub gears with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the chainring and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes {{have two or three}} chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pedal</b> {{points are}} {{somewhat}} problematic on the harpsichord, which {{has only a}} limited sustain capability. Often the <b>pedal</b> note is simply repeated at intervals. A <b>pedal</b> tone can also be realized with a trill; this is particularly common with inverted <b>pedals.</b> Another method of producing a <b>pedal</b> point on the harpsichord is to repeat the <b>pedal</b> point note (or its octave) on every beat. The rarely seen <b>pedal</b> harpsichord, a harpsichord with a <b>pedal</b> keyboard, {{makes it easier to}} perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord, since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{development}} of the <b>pedals</b> on the piano came the phenomenon of the <b>pedal</b> piano, a piano with a pedalboard. Some of the early <b>pedal</b> pianos date back to 1815. [...] The <b>pedal</b> piano developed partially for organists to be able to practice <b>pedal</b> work away from the organ. In some instances, the <b>pedal</b> piano was actually a special type of piano with a built-in <b>pedal</b> board and a higher keyboard and bench, like an organ. Other times, an independent <b>pedal</b> board and set of strings could be connected to a regular grand piano.|$|R
