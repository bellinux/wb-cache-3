Most generals had vehemently opposed the plan as being much too risky; even those supporting it had mainly done so out of desperation because the geostrategic <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> seemed so hopeless. Count Ciano later in the war observed that [...] "victory has a hundred fathers, but defeat is an orphan" [...] and Fall Gelb would have no lack of sires.

Because Hitler had not liked Halder's original plans, he had suggested many alternatives, some of them bearing a resemblance to the Manstein Plan, the closest being a proposal made by him on 25 October 1939.

Her principal arm, her marine, could here be of no sort of use.|$|E

This initiative led to the Haldane Mission, in which Germany offered to accept British naval superiority in exchange for British neutrality in a war in which Germany could {{not be said to}} be the aggressor. This proposal was rejected, as for Britain there was nothing to gain by such a treaty since their naval superiority was insecure, although the British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey favoured a more assertive policy against Germany.|$|E

If one judges, not by the boastful assertions of the German propagandists, but by the actual <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany,</b> {{it will not be}} {{difficult}} to understand that the German-fascist invaders are facing disaster. Hunger and impoverishment reign in Germany to-day; in four months of war Germany has lost four and a half million men; Germany is bleeding, her reserves of man-power are giving out, the spirit of indignation is spreading not only among the peoples of Europe who have fallen under the yoke of the German invaders but also among the German people themselves, who see no end to war. The German invaders are straining their last efforts. There is no doubt that Germany cannot sustain such a strain for long. Another few months, another half-year, perhaps another year, and Hitlerite Germany must burst under the pressure of her crimes.|$|E

50|$|In early June 1934 {{that plan}} was jeopardized when Hindenburg - earlier than in {{previous}} years - left Berlin for his estate at Neudeck in East Prussia, thus becoming harder to contact.

Pressured by this turn of events, Bose and his colleagues decided to accelerate the eruption of the smouldering crisis that existed in Germany in those months due to the conflict between Hitler's SA, which demanded to be promoted to the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany's</b> regular army, and the Reichswehr, which intended to defend its own status.|$|R
