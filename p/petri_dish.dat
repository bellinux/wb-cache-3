5|$|Agar.io is a massively {{multiplayer}} online action game {{created by}} Matheus Valadares. Players control a cell in a map representing a <b>petri</b> <b>dish.</b> The {{goal is to}} gain as much mass as possible by eating agar and cells smaller than the player's cell, while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player's cell(s). The name comes from the substance agar, used to culture bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Mycena aurantiomarginata uses a tetrapolar mating system, whereby genes at two {{different}} locations on the chromosomes regulate sexual compatibility, or mating type. This system prevents self-fertilization and ensures {{a high degree}} of genotypic diversity. When the fungal mycelia is grown in culture on a <b>petri</b> <b>dish,</b> the colonies are white, odorless, and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface, which abruptly become flattened to submerged, and occasionally form faint zone lines. The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts, especially where the hyphae are vegetatively incompatible and destroy each other by lysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{anamorphic}} form of P.semilanceata is an asexual {{stage in}} the fungus's life cycle involved {{in the development of}} mitotic diaspores (conidia). In culture, grown in a <b>petri</b> <b>dish,</b> the fungus forms a white to pale orange cottony or felt-like mat of mycelia. The conidia formed are straight to curved, measuring 2.0–8.0 by 1.1–2.0μm, and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets. Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of P.semilanceata beyond the confines of laboratory culture, in general, the morphology of the asexual structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{evaluation}} of the photoactivated antibacterial activity of titanium dioxide (TiO 2)-coated surfaces. Bacterial inactivation was evaluated using TiO 2 -coated <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes.</b> The experimental conditions optimized with <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> were used to test the antibacterial effect of TiO 2 -coated ceramic tiles. The best antibacterial effect with <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> was observed at 180, 60, 30 and 20 min of exposure for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas putida and Listeria innocua, respectively. The ceramic tiles demonstrated a photoactivated bactericidal effect at the same exposure time. In general, no differences were observed between the antibacterial effect obtained with <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> and tiles. However, the photochemical activity of <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> was greater than the activity of the tiles.|$|R

5|$|The {{objective}} of Agar.io is {{to grow a}} cell on a <b>petri</b> <b>dish</b> by swallowing both randomly generated pellets (agar), which slightly increases a cell's mass, and smaller cells, without being swallowed by larger cells. The browser version currently holds four game modes: FFA (Free-For-All), Teams, Experimental, and Party. The mobile version of the game includes FFA (Free-For-All) and Rush Mode. The goal {{of the game is}} to obtain the largest cell; players must restart when all their cells are eaten. Players can change their cell's appearance with predefined words, phrases, symbols or skins. The more mass a cell has, the slower it will move. Cells gradually lose a small amount of mass over time.|$|E

25|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} in S. aureus was uncommon when penicillin {{was first introduced}} in 1943. Indeed, the original <b>Petri</b> <b>dish</b> on which Alexander Fleming of Imperial College London observed the antibacterial activity of the Penicillium fungus was growing a culture of S. aureus. By 1950, 40% of hospital S. aureus isolates were penicillin-resistant; by 1960, this had risen to 80%.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Equipment can {{be readily}} made in the {{laboratory}} for the mechanical preparation of roll-tubes. Roll-tubes so prepared can largely replace <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> both for counting and for single colony isolations. The recent shortage of <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> has compelled the adoption of an alternative method for counting viable bacteria. The roll-tube method, which consists essentially in the replacement of <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> by test-tubes, was chosen (Wilson, 1922). Apart from considerations of accuracy, rolled tubes are more economical than <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> since ordinary test-tubes may be used; only one-fifth of the medium is required {{and the number of}} dilutions is reduced since it is customary to use a standardized dropping pipette to deliver a known volume of inoculum into the tube. Against this must be set the disadvantage that streaking and picking of individual colonies requires a greater manipulative skill than with <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes.</b> Withell (1938) obtained a standard error of & 5 yo with roll-tube counts. Using similar statistical methods Jenninson & Wadsworth (1940) obtaine...|$|R

5000|$|Modern <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> usually feature rings and/or slots {{on their}} lids and bases {{so that when}} stacked, they are less prone to sliding off one another. Multiple dishes can also be {{incorporated}} into one plastic container to create a [...] "multi-well plate". While glass <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> may be reused after sterilization (via an autoclave or one hour's dry-heating in a hot-air oven at 160 °C, for example), plastic <b>Petri</b> <b>dishes</b> are often disposed of after experiments where cultures might contaminate each other.|$|R

25|$|Camponotus anderseni {{workers of}} {{neighboring}} nests {{are known to}} be highly aggressive to each other. This was observed in a careful study from the University of Aarhus by watching neighboring ants in their environment as well as in a laboratory. When ants from different nests were placed together in a <b>Petri</b> <b>dish,</b> several began to fight. This indicates that nests represent separate colonies.|$|E
25|$|To {{quantify}} {{the number of}} cells in a culture, the cells can be simply plated on a <b>petri</b> <b>dish</b> with growth medium. If the cells are efficiently distributed on the plate, it can be generally assumed that each cell will {{give rise to a}} single colony or Colony Forming Unit (CFU). The colonies can then be counted, and based on the known volume of culture that was spread on the plate, the cell concentration can be calculated.|$|E

His symptoms disappeared after two weeks, but he took antibiotics to kill the remaining bacteria at the urging of his wife, since halitosis is one of the symptoms of infection. This experiment was published in 1984 in the Australian Medical Journal and is among the most cited articles from the journal.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida used {{a culture}} of 25,000 neurons taken from a rat's brain to fly a F-22 fighter jet {{aircraft}} simulator. After collection, the cortical neurons were cultured in a <b>petri</b> <b>dish</b> and rapidly began to reconnect themselves to form a living neural network. The cells were arranged over a grid of 60 electrodes and used to control the pitch and yaw functions of the simulator. The study's focus was on understanding how the human brain performs and learns computational tasks at a cellular level.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most members}} of the Mucorales, Apophysomyces species often fail to sporulate under {{standard}} clinical laboratory culture conditions. These fungi require Czapek's agar (CZA), a nutrient-defined medium. Colonies grow rapidly at 37°C on CZA and initially appear white and woolly becoming greyish brown with age. Colonies are grey and floccose, will grow on the lid of the <b>petri</b> <b>dish,</b> and are colourless on reverse. Sporangiosphores are unbranched, smooth-walled, and light brown. Sporangia are apophyseal, pyriform, beginning as whitish and turning brown with maturity. Sporangiospores are variable in size and shape. Sexuality has not been observed in A. variabilis.|$|E

25|$|Water-gas-tar {{creosote}} is also {{derived from}} petroleum oil or shale oil, {{but by a}} different process; its distilled during the production of water gas. The tar is a by-product resulting from enrichment of water gas with gases produced by thermal decomposition of petroleum. Of the creosotes derived from oil, it is practically the only one used for wood preservation. It has {{the same degree of}} solubility as coal-tar creosote and is easy to impregnate into wood. Like standard oil-tar creosote, it has a low amount of tar acids and tar bases, and has less antiseptic qualities. <b>Petri</b> <b>dish</b> tests have shown that water-gas-tar creosote is one-sixth as anti-septically effective as that of coal-tar.|$|E
25|$|When {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} is not available, a faster, lower cost technique is potassium permanganate staining. The collected eggs are rinsed with a normal saline solution {{and placed in a}} glass <b>petri</b> <b>dish.</b> The eggs are soaked in a 1% potassium permanganate solution for one minute and then dehydrated and mounted onto a slide for observation. These slides can be used with any light microscope with a calibrated eyepiece to compare various morphological features. The most important and useful features for identifying eggs are the size, length, and width of the plastron, as well as the morphology of the plastron in the area around the micropyle. The various measurements and observations when compared to standards for forensically important species are used to determine the species of the egg.|$|E
25|$|Another {{germination}} event {{during the}} life cycle of gymnosperms and flowering plants is the germination of a pollen grain after pollination. Like seeds, pollen grains are severely dehydrated before being released to facilitate their dispersal from one plant to another. They consist of a protective coat containing several cells (up to 8 in gymnosperms, 2-3 in flowering plants). One of these cells is a tube cell. Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma of a receptive flower (or a female cone in gymnosperms), it takes up water and germinates. Pollen germination is facilitated by hydration on the stigma, {{as well as by the}} structure and physiology of the stigma and style. Pollen can also be induced to germinate in vitro (in a <b>petri</b> <b>dish</b> or test tube).|$|E
