Moreover, previous research has linked procrastination and perfectionism mainly to anxiety and depression. Therefore, the relationship among worry, procrastination, and dimensions of perfectionism was investigated irt a sample of 180 students, controlling for anxiety and depression. Results show that worry had substantial correlations with procrastination and perfectionism, particularly with perfectionist concern over mistakes and doubts. Moreover, worry was related to parental criticism and expectations, but unrelated to excessively high personal standards. instead high-worriers reported to lower standards under stress.

50|$|Schemas {{are used}} to {{interpret}} the functions involved when individuals would {{make sense of their}} surroundings. This cognition happens through an explicit process of recalling an item routinely or implicit process that is outside conscious awareness control. A recent study suggests individuals who have experienced a difficult upbringing develop schemata of fear as well as anxiety and will react almost immediately when they feel threatened. People who are anxious predominantly focus on any peril-related stimuli since they are hyper vigilant. For example, an anxious individual who is about to cross the street {{at the same time a}} car drives to a stop sign. The anxious person will automatically assume the driver will not stop. This is recognition of threat through a semantic process that instantaneously occurs. Ambiguous cues are viewed as a threat since there is no relevant knowledge to make sense of. People will have a difficult time to understand and will respond negatively. This kind of behavior can explain how implicit cognition may be an influence for <b>pathological</b> <b>anxiety.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess which types of {{experiences}} are most closely associated with pathological forms of dental anxiety. Data came from a sample of dental patients (n = 1462). <b>Pathological</b> dental <b>anxiety</b> was operationalized in two ways: (1) a score of ≥ 36 on the Short form of the Dental Anxiety Inventory (S-DAI; high dental anxiety, HDA), or (2) fulfilling the screening criteria of specific phobia (DSM-IV-TR; dental phobia, DP). A wide variety of dental experiences appeared to be significantly related with both HDA and DP, while general traumatic experiences were not. No differences were found between women and men. Retrospective accounts of dental experiences involving helplessness were most strongly associated with having HDA [OR = 8. 2] and positive screens of DP [OR = 16. 2].

40|$|Abstract. Effective therapies for {{pathological}} gambling exist, but their use {{is limited to}} about 10 % of the target population. In an attempt to lower the barriers for help, Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) {{has been shown to}} be effective when delivered to a non-depressed sample with {{pathological gambling}}. This study sought to extend this finding to a larger, more representative population, and also test a model to predict responder status. Following advertisement, a total of 284 participants started an 8 -week ICBT programme with minimal therapist contact via e-mail and weekly telephone calls of less than 15 min. The average time spent on each participant, including telephone conversations, e-mail, and administration, was 4 h. In addition to a mixed effects model to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment, two logistic regression analyses were performed with the following eight pre-defined response predictor variables: work-life satisfaction, primary gambling activity, debts due to gambling, social support, personal yearly salary, alcohol consumption, stage of change, and dissociative gambling. ICBT resulted in statistically significant reductions in the scores of <b>pathological</b> gambling, <b>anxiety,</b> and depression as well as an increase in quality of life compared to pre-treatment levels. Follow-ups carried out in the treatment group at 6, 18, and 36 months indicated that treatment effects were sustained. Using the eight predictor variable model rendered an acceptabl...|$|R

According to Tillich, the last of these three types of existential anxiety, i.e. spiritual anxiety, is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods. Tillich argues that this anxiety can be accepted {{as part of the}} human condition or it can be resisted but with negative consequences.

40|$|<b>Pathological</b> <b>anxiety</b> and {{depression}} are prevalent forms of psychopathology and {{are associated with}} significant impairment in multiple areas of life, including occupational and social functioning.

Levels of trait approach and avoidance motivation may be relevant for understanding the differential correlates of anxiety {{and depression}}, given research indicating that they have distinct relationships with dimensions of trait motivation. An integrative model of the brain regions instantiating the approach and avoidance motivational systems is needed to understand how dysfunction in these systems manifests in anxiety and depression.

We discuss the potential benefits of expanding the human fear conditioning paradigm by (1) including action tendencies as an important index of fear and (2) paying more attention to “weak” (i. e., ambiguous) rather than “strong” fear learning situations (Lissek et al., 2006), such as contained in selective learning procedures. We present preliminary data that illustrate these ideas and discuss the importance of response systems divergence in understanding individual differences in vulnerability for the development of <b>pathological</b> <b>anxiety...</b>|$|E
40|$|Kierkegaard was {{the first}} to {{dedicate}} a book to the philosophical study of anxiety. The Danish thinker showed that mans anxiety is inseparable from his specifically human relation to himself and his world. Man exists; he stands out of nature and is conscious of himself. His existence produces an ambiguous anxiety that can be a destructive as well as a constructive force in human life. Many have been influenced by Kierkegaard’s complex analyses of the different ways in which man tries to deal with his existence. In various attempt to escape anxiety man limits his self-consciousness and creativity. It is not difficult to see the similarities between Kierkegaard’s descriptions of destructive conditions and certain clinical diagnoses. In psychiatry and psychology {{there is a tendency to}} focus on <b>pathological</b> <b>anxiety</b> at the expense of the existential anxiety that precedes the development of destructive conditions. Here I will attempt to examine the concepts of existential and <b>pathological</b> <b>anxiety</b> further.

Through our attempted investigation we will get acquainted with the psychologist Rollo May, the anthropologist Ernest Becker and the philosopher and theologist Paul Tillich. It will become apparent that we are also moving across different levels. We will inevitably touch upon philosophical questions such as those concerning the self, freedom, being, non-being, doubt, faith, health and illness...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Human fear {{conditioning}} {{is widely}} {{regarded as one of the}} prime paradigms for the study of fear and anxiety disorders. We provide an evaluation of a commonly used subjective measure in the human fear conditioning paradigm, namely the US-expectancy measurement. Methods: We assess the validity of US-expectancy with respect to conditions of <b>pathological</b> fear and <b>anxiety</b> using four established criteria for scrutiny of a laboratory test or model (i. e., face validity, diagnostic validity, predictive validity, construct validity). Results: Arguably, there is sufficient evidence for the face validity, diagnostic validity, predictive validity and construct validity of the US-expectancy measure. Limitations: Presumed limitations of the US-expectancy measure, including its susceptibility to experimental demand and memory bias, are discussed. Conclusions: The US-expectancy measure is a valuable measurement method that can be effectively used in research that aims to enhance our understanding of fear and anxiety disorders. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{theoretical}} models hold that avoidance reflects {{the interplay of}} Pavlovian and instrumental learning. Here we suggest that avoidance tendencies to intrinsically neutral cues may be established by mere Pavlovian association. Following fear conditioning, in which pictures of one object were paired with shock (CS+) whereas pictures of another object were not (CS−), CS+ pictures facilitated avoidance reactions and interfered with approach responses, relative to CS− pictures, in a symbolic approach/avoidance reaction time task. This was achieved without any instrumental relation between responses and CS continuation or unconditioned stimulus presentation. Moreover, those avoidance tendencies were sensitive to Pavlovian extinction (they were reduced after repeated presentations of the CS+ without shock) and renewal (recovery of conditioned responding upon returning to the initial conditioning context after extinction in a different context). The present results may {{help us understand the}} self-perpetuating nature of <b>pathological</b> fear and <b>anxiety...</b>|$|R

In this study, participants with and without a diagnosis of SAD (generalized subtype) described their daily face-to-face social interactions for 2 weeks using handheld computers. We hypothesized that, compared with healthy controls, individuals diagnosed with SAD would experience fewer positive emotions, rely more on experiential avoidance (of anxiety), and have greater self-control depletion (feeling mentally and physically exhausted after socializing), after accounting for social anxiety, negative emotions, and feelings of belonging during social interactions. We found that compared with healthy controls, individuals with SAD experienced weaker positive emotions and greater experiential avoidance, but there were no differences in self-control depletion between groups. Moreover, the differences we found could not be attributed to comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders. Our results suggest that negative emotions alone do not fully distinguish normal from <b>pathological</b> social <b>anxiety,</b> and that assessing social anxiety disorder should include impairments in positive emotional experiences and dysfunctional emotion regulation (in the form of experiential avoidance) in social situations...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} the nature and the degree of automaticity of this interpretation bias. We applied an implicit association test (IAT) in 20 subjects during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate behavioral and neural correlates of implicit attitudes towards symptom words. On the behavioral level, body symptom words elicited strong negative implicit association effects, as indexed by slowed reaction times when symptom words were paired with the attribute harmless (incongruent condition) relative to a control condition. fMRI revealed increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex for the comparison of incongruent words with control words, as well as with a lower significance threshold also in comparison to congruent words. Moreover, activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and cerebellum varied with individual levels of HA (again, in comparison to control words, as well as with a lower significance threshold also in comparison to congruent words). Slowed reaction times as well as increased activation in dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex point to increased inhibitory demands during the incongruent IAT condition. The positive association between HA severity and neural activity in nucleus accumbens, dorsolateral prefrontal, and posterior parietal cortex suggests that HA is characterized by both intensified negative implicit attitudes and hampered cognitive control mechanisms when confronted with body symptoms...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis {{and of its}} {{peripheral}} indices {{have been}} reported in both normal and <b>pathological</b> <b>anxiety</b> with controversial findings. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the possible correlations between serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) levels and DHEA-S/cortisol ratio, and panic-agoraphobic spectrum dimensions in a sample of healthy subjects. METHODS: Forty-two healthy subjects of both sexes, with no current or lifetime psychiatric disorders, were assessed by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I/P) and the so-called Panic Agoraphobic Spectrum-Self Report lifetime version (PAS-SR). RESULTS: Significant, negative correlations were found between cortisol levels and the total score of the separation sensitivity, panic-like symptoms, and medication/substance sensitivity PAS-SR domains. The PAS-SR total and the panic-like symptoms domain scores were positively related to the DHEAS/cortisol ratio. When the sample was divided in women and men, these correlations were present in women only. DISCUSSION: These findings, while indicating the presence of significant relationships between panic-agoraphobic traits and some indices of HPA axis functioning in healthy women, would suggest this as one of the factors explaining the greater vulnerability of women to cross the line between normal and <b>pathological</b> <b>anxiety.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to explore gender differences in the relationships between HPA axis alterations and the panic-agoraphobic spectrum dimensions...|$|E

40|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} are prevalent in both adult and child populations, and {{are associated with}} significant economic and psychosocial costs. There are clearly familial patterns of transmission within the anxiety disorders, and the inherited risk is likely a non-specific vulnerability toward negative affect, with a biological-environmental interaction leading to specific manifestations within the anxiety disorders. Among the vulnerabilities toward anxiety may be information processing biases that predispose individuals to be more vigilant to novelty, processes that may be specifically associated with the right cerebral hemisphere. The current study utilized auditory event related potentials (ERPs) to explore {{the degree to which}} such processes may be related to risk toward anxiety disorders in a neonatal population (n= 30). Findings supported the growing evidence that predispositions toward anxious patterns of responding are associated with greater activation of the right cerebral hemisphere, as neonates of more highly anxious mothers displayed more positive right hemisphere responses overall.

40|$|Anxiety {{is defined}} as an {{emotional}} and physical reaction that prepares us to confront a feared stimulus. Among the many measureable changes induced by anxiety are changes in facial electromyography (EMG), heart rate (HR), and sweat gland activity (EDG). At a <b>pathological</b> level <b>anxiety</b> interferes with cognitive processes. Currently, when anxiety crosses into the pathological level, it is treated {{with a variety of}} therapies that share in their use of periods of exposure to anxiety-inducing stimuli. Several devices have been developed to alter brain activity by transcranial electrical stimulation (TCES). One such device, Alpha-Stim®, has been shown to reduce anxiety in clinical samples. This suggests that the device might be useful in therapeutic exposure sessions, though no research to date has examined its use in such settings. In a double-blind, placebo controlled study participants were exposed to stimuli derived from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database that were chosen for their ability to elicit anxiety. A repeated measures analysis of variance was performed on recorded physiological data (EDG, HR, EMG) and subjective experience of anxiety as measured with Subjective Units of Distress Scale. Analysis of subjective units of distress scores showed that repeated exposure to anxiety eliciting pictures produced decreasing levels of distress over time (F (1, 13) = 5. 831, p =. 031). EDG analysis revealed no statistically significant results. HR analysis revealed that TCES produced lower heart rates throughout the exposure (main effect of treatment; F (1, 12) = 120. 907 p 3 ̆c. 001), and a trend toward increased heart rate during the exposure (treatment by time interaction; F (1, 12) = 3. 514, p =. 085). Frontalis EMG analysis revealed a trend for the treatment groups to differ in their experience of negative emotional valence {{over the course of the}} exposure (F (1, 12) = 3. 209, p =. 098) ...|$|R
40|$|Serotonin {{receptor}} 1 A gene (HTR 1 A) knockout mice show pronounced defensive behaviour {{and increased}} fear conditioning to ambiguous conditioned stimuli. Such behaviour is {{a hallmark of}} <b>pathological</b> human <b>anxiety,</b> as observed in panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). Thus, variations in HTR 1 A might contribute to neurophysiological differences within subgroups of PD/AG patients. Here, we tested this hypothesis by combining genetic with behavioural techniques and neuroimaging. In a clinical multicentre trial, patients with PD/AG received 12 sessions of manualized cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and were genotyped for HTR 1 A rs 6295. In four subsamples of this multicentre trial, exposure behaviour (n = 185), defensive reactivity measured using a behavioural avoidance test (BAT; before CBT: n = 245; after CBT: n = 171) and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data during fear conditioning were acquired before and after CBT (n = 39). HTR 1 A risk genotype (GG) carriers more often escaped during the BAT before treatment. Exploratory fMRI results suggest increased activation of the amygdala in response to threat as well as safety cues before and after treatment in GG carriers. Furthermore, GG carriers demonstrated reduced effects of CBT on differential conditioning in regions including the bilateral insulae and the anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, risk genotype carriers demonstrated reduced self-initiated exposure behaviour to aversive situations. This study demonstrates the effect of HTR 1 A variation on defensive behaviour, amygdala activity, CBT-induced neural plasticity and normalization of defence behaviour in PD/AG. Our results, therefore, translate evidence from animal studies to humans and suggest a central role for HTR 1 A in differentiating subgroups of patients with anxiety disorders.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{find the}} {{effectiveness}} of diagnoses of acute precordial pain seen as an emergency at our centre. DesignObservational, descriptive and retrospective study. SettingUrban primary care centre. PatientsThe 100 most recent patients who attended as an emergency with their first episode of acute precordial pain were included. Study period: December 1994 to March 1998. Home visits, patients without medical records and those seen on repeated attendance for precordialgia were excluded. Measurements and main resultsThe emergency diagnosis and the diagnosis recorded afterwards in the clinical history of 100 people with acute precordialgia, aged 54. 9 (16. 7 years; 56 % [n = 56] women), were gathered. Ischaemic cardiopathy (41 %, n = 41) and mechanical precordialgia (36 %, n = 36) were the most common initial diagnoses. We found 66. 6 % sensitivity and 81. 4 % specificity in the detection of ischaemic cardiopathy. The proportion of diagnostic errors was not linked to the <b>pathological</b> history of <b>anxiety,</b> ischaemic cardiopathy or oesophageal disease. Conclusions 41 % of precordialgias are diagnosed as presumably ischaemic and are potentially serious, although only 50 % of them are confirmed as such. Our sensitivity in their diagnosis is {{comparable to that of}} other studies...|$|R
