50|$|The <b>preferred</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> of {{the split}} {{corporation}} are issued in some fixed ratio. Often the <b>preferred</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> are issued in precisely equal numbers. In such a case, {{each pair of}} <b>preferred</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> is sometimes called a unit. However, the proportion of <b>preferred</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> does not necessarily have to be one-to-one. Reducing the ratio of issued <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> to <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> (e.g., one <b>preferred</b> <b>share</b> for every two <b>capital</b> <b>shares)</b> would reduce the risk and safely support higher yield for the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{at the cost of}} making the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> less attractive to investors due to increased risk, lower sustainable yield payout and smaller capital gain leverage.|$|R
50|$|The {{dividend}} {{income from the}} underlying shares may be insufficient to pay out the {{dividend income}} for both the <b>preferred</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>shares.</b> In order to produce more income, split share corporations will sometimes employ covered call writing and cash-covered put writing.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>preferred</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> of a {{split share}} {{corporation}} are independently tradeable securities, and hence their value {{is subject to}} market forces. If the volume of traded shares is relatively small, then the price of split share corporations can be volatile as with any other thinly traded security. Close to the expiration date, however, {{the value of the}} <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> will tend to converge on the initial issue price if the split share corporation is judged by the market to have sufficient equity to fully pay back the preferred shareholders.|$|R
50|$|The <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> of a {{split share}} {{corporation}} {{are intended to}} be a more aggressive investment vehicle, one that can provide both high income and the promise of amplified capital gains compared to the capital gains of the underlying basket of shares. In effect, the holders of <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> are borrowing money from the holders of the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> at the dividend rate of the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares,</b> and investing that money in a greater number of shares in the underlying basket of <b>shares.</b> <b>Capital</b> gains (or losses) are amplified in the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> because the value of the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> is held relatively constant, and the resulting increased volatility of the equity in the underlying basket of shares is borne mostly by the <b>capital</b> <b>shares.</b> Holders of the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> take on their obligation to guarantee dividend payments to the holders of the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> in exchange for amplified returns. In addition, the income from the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> can be structured to be treatable, for tax purposes, as mostly or even entirely capital gain. In many jurisdictions, such as Canada, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than either dividend income or interest income.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 Banca CR Firenze {{purchased}} {{an additional}} 9% ordinary shares from {{the foundation for}} €32,533,751.25. The foundation retained 74,151,005 ordinary shares (40% of all ordinary <b>shares)</b> and 15,200,000 <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> (38% of all <b>preferred</b> <b>shares)</b> as at 31 December 2006 for €0.63 par value (increased from €0.52 in 2005), which equivalent to 39.65% total <b>share</b> <b>capitals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{split share}} {{corporations}} provide an exchange mechanism, in which {{units of the}} split share corporation can be converted into shares of the underlying basket of shares, and vice versa. This mechanism would allow arbitrage trading to keep the aggregate value of the units close {{to the value of}} the underlying basket of shares, hence reducing the tracking error between the market value of the underlying shares and the risk-adjusted present value of the <b>preferred</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Sanpaolo IMI {{acquired}} the bank minority rights {{to serve as}} a strategic partner. Banca CR Firenze also acquired a minority interests on the bank. On 31 December 2006, Sanpaolo IMI held 38.25% voting rights and <b>share</b> <b>capitals,</b> while Banca CR Firenze held 11.614% ordinary <b>shares</b> and <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> worth 1.136% of the <b>shares</b> <b>capital.</b> The banking foundation only retained 28.38% as the second largest shareholders. Private citizens owned 20.62%.|$|R
50|$|The {{total market}} value of the shares of the split share {{corporation}} is backed by the value of the underlying basket of shares. The value of the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> is further reinforced by the priority given to those <b>shares</b> over the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> in the payment of dividend income and in the eventual return of the full initial price of the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> bear {{greater risk}} than the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{in the event}} that the value of the {{underlying}} basket of conventional shares falls in value. Dividend payments to the holders of <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> may be reduced or even suspended entirely before reductions can be considered in the dividends paid to the holders of the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares.</b> The value of the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> on the secondary markets may fluctuate considerably and may be reduced to zero. Over the longer term, the risk to the holders of <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> should be moderated by the usually high quality of the underlying dividend-paying shares, typically blue-chip, in the basket.|$|R
50|$|In March 1998 Pistoia-Pescia and San Miniato were demerged from Casse Toscane as Finanziaria CRPT and Finanziaria CRSM respectively. In November Finanziaria CRPT, which hold 11,357,012 {{ordinary}} shares (about 50.39% <b>share</b> <b>capitals</b> or 61.26% {{ordinary shares}}; 10,000 lire each) of the bank, was merged back to CR Pistoia-Pescia. In December 1999 Florence Saving Bank purchased 51% {{of the ordinary}} shares, with the foundation retained a minority interests only (9,083,498 of 10,000 lire par value; 49% of the ordinary shares equivalent to 40.3% <b>share</b> <b>capitals</b> as at 31 December 2001. plus <b>preferred</b> <b>shares).</b> The foundation also owned 3.95% shares of Banca CR Firenze (as of 31 December 2000), due to the acquisition.|$|R
5000|$|Entities with share {{voting rights}} {{that depend on}} {{financial}} capital distribute surplus among shareholders without regard to any other contribution to the entity. Depending on internal rules and regulations, certain classes of shares {{have the right to}} receive increases in financial [...] "dividends" [...] while other classes do not. After many years the increase over time is substantial if the business is profitable. Examples of this are common <b>shares</b> and <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> in private or publicly listed <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> corporations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> of a {{split share}} {{corporation}} {{are intended to}} provide an investment vehicle for more conservative investors, one that provides a relatively high income stream and safety in the original investment that is secured by {{the value of the}} underlying basket of shares. Greater safety is provided since the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> are given priority over the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> both when income is paid out and when the corporation is wrapped up. The income from the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> is usually declared as dividend income, which in some jurisdictions (e.g. Canada) has favorable tax rates compared to the tax rates that apply to the interest income that is produced by bonds or commercial paper. The <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> of a split share corporation can offer greater diversification than the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> of a single conventional corporation.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{have special}} voting rights to approve {{extraordinary}} events (such as {{the issuance of}} new shares or approval of the acquisition of a company) or to elect directors, but most <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> have no voting rights associated with them; some <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> gain voting rights when the preferred dividends are in arrears for a substantial time. This is all variable on the rights assigned to the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{at the time of}} incorporation.|$|R

50|$|<b>Preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{are often}} used by private {{corporations}} to achieve Canadian tax objectives. For instance, the use of <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> can allow a business to accomplish an estate freeze.

50|$|A {{split share}} {{corporation}} is a corporation that exists for a defined {{period of time}} to transform the risk and investment return (capital gains, dividends, and possibly also profits from the writing of covered options) of a basket of shares of conventional dividend-paying corporations into the risk and return of the two or more classes of publicly traded shares in the split share corporation. Most commonly a split share corporation issues equal numbers of shares from a class of <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> and a class of capital or class A shares. The proceeds of the share offering are invested in conventional dividend-paying shares according to the regulations of the split <b>share</b> corporation. The <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> typically offer relatively high and secure dividend yield at a fixed coupon rate but with no expectation of capital gain by the time that the split share corporation is wound up. The <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> often (but not in every corporation) pay a dividend like the preferred shares; in addition, the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> offer participation in the leveraged capital gains (or losses) of the underlying basket of conventional shares.|$|R

5000|$|When a {{corporation}} goes bankrupt, {{there may be}} enough money to repay holders of preferred issues known as [...] "senior" [...] but not enough money for [...] "junior" [...] issues.
