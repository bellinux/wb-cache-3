5|$|The {{riots in}} which Blakelock died took place within {{a wave of}} social unrest across England. Since the 1980 St. Pauls riot in Bristol, and <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> the 1981 Brixton riot in south London, a series of {{incidents}} had sparked violent confrontations between black youths and largely white police officers.|$|E

5|$|C.mutica closely {{resemble}} Caprella acanthogaster, also {{a native of}} East Asian waters. It {{may be difficult to}} distinguish the two species, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> Caprellamutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males. C.mutica can only be reliably differentiated by their setose first and second pereonites (smooth in C.acanthogaster), as well as the elongated oval shape of their gills (linear in C.acanthogaster).|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Gillan {{formed the}} Ian Gillan Band with guitarist Ray Fenwick, keyboardist Mike Moran, quickly {{replaced}} with Mickey Lee Soule and then Colin Towns on keyboards, Mark Nauseef on drums and John Gustafson on bass. Their first album, Child in Time {{was released in}} July 1976, followed by Clear Air Turbulence in April 1977 and Scarabus in October. The sound of the band had a distinct jazz-rock aspect which, although interesting to Gillan, proved unpopular, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> punk rock was in vogue at that time.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Mendips is open {{calcareous}} grassland, {{supporting a}} wide variety of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, and some have been used intensively for arable agriculture, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> World WarI. As the demand for arable land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced its biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) maintains the grassland habitat.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, friends were {{concerned}} about the Marquess's addiction to drugs, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> multiple prison sentences had done nothing to alleviate it. He was deported from Australia in April 1990 and charged with drug possession in November 1991 and March 1992. That October, his estate company was liquidated with debts over £650,000. In June 1993, he avoided a jail sentence by being ordered to attend a rehabilitation clinic, but travelled to the South of France instead and was sentenced to 10 months in an open prison, where he was released after five. He was arrested again in September 1994 for possession.|$|E
5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{continue}} to give Lisa {{a hard time}} at home, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> Homer is ready to host a barbecue, complete with roast pig. On {{the day of the}} barbecue, Lisa makes gazpacho for all the guests as an alternative to meat, but the partygoers laugh in her face. Enraged and deeply hurt, she climbs aboard a riding mower and drives away with the roast pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase her, but she pushes the pig off a slope and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into the air by a dam spillway's suction.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the Tour de France, Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; chief among these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 Tour de France. The team reacted with surprise and disappointment, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> the ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed, and as a result Contador {{would not be able to}} defend his Tour de France championship.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder {{was built}} for {{commercial}} freight, and although the volume carried has dropped significantly, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> coal deliveries to Ferrybridge power station by canal stopped, the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007, down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000. The Leeds to Castleford section {{and much of the}} Wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes, but below Castleford, the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious, and pleasure boats must give way to commercial vessels. 600 tonne vessels, designed to make maximum use of the locks, produce considerable wash, and are not as manoeuvrable as a narrow boat.|$|E
5|$|The city of Poznań {{was one of}} {{the largest}} urban and {{industrial}} centers of the People's Republic of Poland. Tensions were growing there, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> autumn of 1955. Workers in the largest factory in the city, Joseph Stalin's (or 'Cegielski's) Metal Industries, were complaining about higher taxes for most productive workers (udarnik), which affected several thousands of workers. Local directors were unable to make any significant decisions due to micromanagement by the higher officials; over several months, petitions, letters and delegations were sent to the Polish Ministry of Machine Industry and Central Committee of Polish United Workers' Party, to no avail.|$|E

5|$|The {{floral emblem}} for its {{home state of}} New South Wales, Telopea speciosissima has {{featured}} prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> Australian federation. Commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but is vulnerable to various fungal diseases and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. Horticulturists have also developed hybrids with T.oreades and T.mongaensis which are more tolerant of cold, shade, and heavier soils.|$|E
5|$|The kibbutz was {{established}} in 1926 by pioneers from the Hashomer Hatzair movement, who moved to Mandatory Palestine during the Third Aliyah from Poland. It was the first Jewish settlement {{in the southern part}} of the Jezreel Valley. It soon became a center of the Hashomer Hatzair, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> the first regional school of the Kibbutz Arzi network was set up there. In April 1948 the kibbutz was the epicenter of an important battle when it successfully resisted the first large-scale attack of the Arab Liberation Army commanded by Fawzi al-Qawuqji.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> the sequencing {{of the human genome}} in 2003, as he started to realise how it could be related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the Dawn was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E

5|$|Călinescu viewed such {{intellectual}} traits as {{shared by}} Creangă with his Wallachian counterpart Anton Pann, in turn linking both writers to the satirical component of Renaissance literature, and specifically to François Rabelais. Within local tradition, the literary historian saw a symbolic connection between Creangă {{and the early}} 18th century figure, Ion Neculce, one of Moldavia's leading chroniclers. While he made his own comparison between Creangă and Pann, Tudor Vianu concluded that the Moldavian writer was in fact superior, {{as well as being}} more relevant to literature than Petre Ispirescu, the prime collector of tales in 19th-century Wallachia. Also making use of the Rabelais analogy, literary chronicler Gabriela Ursachi found another analogy in local letters: Ion Budai-Deleanu, an early 19th-century representative of the Transylvanian School, whose style mixes erudite playfulness with popular tastes. These contextual traits, researchers assess, did not prevent Creangă's overall work from acquiring a universal aspect, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> various of his writings use narrative sequences common throughout world literature.|$|E
5|$|In 1831 slate {{duty was}} abolished, and this helped {{to produce a}} rapid {{expansion}} in the industry, <b>particularly</b> <b>since</b> the duty on tiles was not abolished until 1833. The Ffestiniog Railway line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport slate from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog, where it was loaded onto ships. The railway was graded so that loaded slate waggons could be run by gravity downhill {{all the way from}} Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The empty waggons were hauled back up by horses, which travelled down in 'dandy' waggons. This helped expansion at the Blaenau Ffestiniog quarries, which had previously had to cart the slate to Maentwrog to be loaded onto small boats and taken down the River Dwyryd to the estuary, where it was transferred to larger vessels. There was further expansion at Blaenau when John Whitehead Greaves, who had been running the Votty quarry since 1833, took a lease on the land between this quarry and the main Ffestiniog to Betws-y-Coed road. After years of digging he struck the famous Old Vein in 1846 in what became the Llechwedd quarry. A fire which destroyed a large part of Hamburg in 1842 led to a demand for slate for rebuilding, and Germany became an important market, particularly for Ffestiniog slate.|$|E
