5000|$|In 1988, Gretzky {{was traded}} to the Los Angeles Kings. With Barnett's {{relocation}} to Los Angeles, Gretzky's arrival in a major US market took his profile to another level. Hockey itself established a whole new foothold in Southern California. Barnett recognized this growing popularity, along with an absence of ice arenas. Soon, multimillion-dollar Wayne Gretzky Roller Hockey Center's began to spring up in California, with youngsters wearing Wayne Gretzky's Ultra <b>Wheels</b> <b>roller</b> hockey equipment.|$|R

50|$|The Halifax Bruising Banditas {{was founded}} in June 2011. The league's {{founding}} was led by Lauren Artington who had already been skating with another team for two-and-a-half year. She brought together other skaters who had begun to learn the sport from Hot <b>Wheel</b> <b>Roller</b> Derby and Leeds Roller Dolls and spread sport to the wider West Yorkshire area. The league was originally called Bruising Banditas. The name was changed to Halifax Bruising Banditas in 2012 to draw a link to its home town.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{not long}} after the {{creation}} of the first <b>wheeled</b> <b>roller</b> coasters in the late 18th century or the early 19th century that the first roller coaster inversion was designed. This first design was created in 1833 by an engineer named Clavieres, but it was not implemented into a functioning ride until more than a decade later. In 1843, designers Hutchinson and Higgins registered a design and exhibited a [...] "Centrifugal Iron Railway" [...] at theaters in various British cities including London, Manchester, and Liverpool.|$|R
50|$|Bitelli was an {{engineering}} company located in Bologna, Italy - the largest and, perhaps best known, Italian construction machinery firm. Beppino Bitelli produced {{his first three}} <b>wheel</b> <b>roller</b> in 1933 {{although it was not}} until 1957 that the Bitelli Road Mechanics company was formed. Tandem rollers were soon added and In 1969 the first single drum rollers were manufactured. In 1978 Bitelli built its first paving machine and, during the 1980s, road profilers and soil stabilizers were added to the line of road machines.|$|R

Through this site commercial ships had been hauled across on <b>wheels,</b> <b>rollers,</b> or skids from the Yauza River to the Klyazma River. Merchants had to pay a duty for this.

50|$|Elevator: In {{traction}} (non-hydraulic) elevators, a heavy counterweight counterbalances {{the load}} {{of the elevator}} carriage, so the motor lifts much less of the carriage's weight (specifically, the counterweight is {{the weight of the}} carriage plus 40-50% of its rated capacity). The counterweight also increases the ascending acceleration force and decreases the descending acceleration force {{to reduce the amount of}} power needed by the motor. The elevator carriage and the counterweights both have <b>wheel</b> <b>roller</b> guides attached to them to prevent irregular movement and provide a smoother ride for the passengers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1730, Harrison {{designed}} a marine clock {{to compete for}} the Longitude Prize and travelled to London, seeking financial assistance. He presented his ideas to Edmond Halley, the Astronomer Royal, who in turn referred him to George Graham, the country's foremost clockmaker. Graham must have been impressed by Harrison's ideas, for he loaned him money to build a model of his [...] "Sea clock". As the clock was an attempt to make a seagoing version of his wooden pendulum clocks, which performed exceptionally well, he used wooden <b>wheels,</b> <b>roller</b> pinions and a version of the 'grasshopper' escapement. Instead of a pendulum, he used two dumbbell balances, linked together.|$|R

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} is {{presented}} for omnidirectional wheeled mobile robots, including wheel/motion surface slip. We derive the dynamics model, experimentally measure friction coefficients, {{and measure the}} force to cause slip (to validate our friction model). Dynamic simulation examples are presented to demonstrate omnidirectional motion with slip. After developing an improved friction model, compared to our initial model, the simulation results agree well with experimentally-measured trajectory data with slip. Initially, we thought that only high robot velocity and acceleration governed the resulting slipping motion. However, {{we learned that the}} rigid material existing in the discontinuities between omnidirectional <b>wheel</b> <b>rollers</b> plays an equally important role in determining omnidirectional mobile robot dynamic slip motion, even at low rates and accelerations...|$|R
30|$|Two effects {{influence}} {{the transition of}} the damage form mechanism upon changing the test rotation speed. On one hand, the increasing test rotation speed reduces the wear loss of the <b>wheel</b> <b>roller</b> so that {{the influence of the}} wear mechanism in specimen F is less. On the other hand, increasing the test rotation speed can increase the vibration of the simulated rollers, which can increase the dynamic load coefficient of the contact load between the simulated rollers. This effect can increase the fatigue damage and hardening of the contact surface, and the results in Figs.  8 b, 10, and 13 all show evidence of this. Both of these effects transition the damage mechanism from wear-dominant into fatigue-dominant as the rotation speed increases.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, trolley parks, {{which started}} in the 19th century, were picnic and {{recreation}} areas along or {{at the ends of}} streetcar lines in most of the larger cities. These were precursors to amusement parks. These trolley parks were created by the streetcar companies to give people a reason to use their services on weekends. These parks originally consisted of picnic groves and pavilions, and often held events such as dances, concerts and fireworks. Many eventually added features such as swimming pools, carousels, Ferris <b>wheels,</b> <b>roller</b> coasters, sports fields, boats rides, restaurants and other resort facilities to become amusement parks. Various sources report the existence of between 1,500 and 2,000 amusement parks in the United States by 1919.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Skateboard wheels {{owe their}} {{existence}} to William Bown and Joseph Henry Hughes, who patented a {{design for the}} <b>wheels</b> of <b>roller</b> skates that kept the two bearing surfaces of an axle, fixed and moving, apart.

50|$|The fair is held {{annually}} {{for a period}} of 10 days from the first Friday in August. Visitor attractions include Ferris <b>wheels,</b> carousels, <b>roller</b> coasters, ghost trains, carnival games, food stalls, raffles and beer halls and gardens. On opening and closing day a fireworks show is presented.|$|R
5000|$|Wheel bearings: Most caster {{applications}} {{require the}} wheel to function with a bearing. There are numerous bearing options depending on the wheel design and the application being considered. Common bearings used for caster <b>wheels</b> include: <b>roller</b> bearings, tapered roller bearings, ball bearings, precision ball bearings, Delrin and self-lubricating sleeves.|$|R
5000|$|Hunt's Pier {{dates back}} to the early 1900s when it was known as Ocean Pier, the first major pier on the boardwalk.

The Duxbury pier was damaged, beaches were badly eroded, and dozens of ships and boats were wrecked on the beaches.|$|R
