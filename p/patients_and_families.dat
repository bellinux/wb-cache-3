5|$|Social Worker: Every {{patient is}} {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>families</b> to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E
5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>families.</b> Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the structure of}} nursing care on the first consultation brought by the third person. The third person is the person such as a neighbor, except for the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members Data was collected from nursing practice on new 21 cases at a Home Care Support Center (HCSC). Nursing intentions were taken out from the nursing records and interviews with nurses on the first consultation to the third person who brought the consultation, and investigated the content and the construction. Nursing care for the third person had intention to identify the demand of the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members with them, and also to grow the third person into a good support deliverer. Nursing care for the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members included planning to deliver a immediate care by the nurse of the HCSC, and supporting the third person to deliver a good support to the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members. The judgment on {{a connection between the}} third person <b>and</b> the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members was done primarily. In conclusion, the structure of nursing care show that nurses consider the third person <b>and</b> the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members as a unit. Nurses respect the autonomy of the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members. On the other hand, nurses also support the third person to deliver good support autonomously. 当事者以外の者が持ち込んだ相談における看護援助の構造を明らかにすることにより,プライマリーレベルで対応する看護援助の特質を追究した。ひとつの在宅介護支援センターに当事者以外の住民が持ち込んだ相談 21 事例について,看護職による対応実績を,来談者に向けた対応意図及び当事者に向けた意図に分けて抽出し,内容・構成を検討した。来談者に向けた援助では,当事者の求めているものを共に確認することにより,支え手としての成長を助けていた。当事者に向けた援助は,看護職自らが当事者に会うことを計画する直接的方法と,来談者による適切な手助けを実現させる間接的方法があった。以上は,いずれも来談者・当事者間の関係の判断を起点としていた。以上から,来談者と当事者の双方を一組と捉えて対応し,当事者の主体性を確保した援助を第一に考えると同時に,来談者自身も主体性を持った支え手と捉えて働きかけるという,看護援助の構造的特質を明らかにした...|$|R

25|$|To work in {{the nursing}} profession, all nurses hold one or more {{credentials}} depending on their scope of practice and education. A licensed practical nurse (LPN) (also {{referred to as a}} licensed vocational nurse, registered practical nurse, enrolled nurse, and state enrolled nurse) works independently or with a registered nurse (RN). The most significant differentiation between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. For example, Canada requires a bachelor's degree for the RN and a two-year diploma for the LPN. A registered nurse provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>families</b> in many health care settings. Registered nurses may earn additional credentials or degrees.|$|E
25|$|A {{mental health}} care {{navigator}} is an individual who assists <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>families</b> to find appropriate {{mental health care}}givers, facilities and services. Individuals who are care navigators are often also trained therapists and doctors. The need for mental health care navigators arises from the fragmentation of the mental health industry, which can often leave those in need with more questions than answers. Care navigators work closely with patients through discussion and collaboration to provide information on options and referrals to healthcare professionals, facilities, and organizations specializing in the patients’ needs. The difference between other mental health professionals and a care navigator is that a care navigator provides information and directs a patient to the best help rather than offering diagnosis, prescription of medications or treatment.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, adverse events and medical errors {{have become a}} main focus of {{interest}} for the standards of quality and safety in the U. S. healthcare system (Weinstein 2 ̆ 6 Henderson, 2009). Particularly when a medical error occurs, the disclosure of medical errors and its practices have become a {{focal point of the}} healthcare process. <b>Patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members who have experienced a medical error might be able to provide knowledge and insight on how to improve the disclose process. However, <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> member are not typically involved in the disclosure process, thus their experiences go unnoticed. ^ The purpose of this research was to explore how best to include <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members in the disclosure process regarding a medical error. The research consisted of 28 qualitative interviews from three stakeholder groups: Hospital Administrators, Clinical Service Providers, <b>and</b> <b>Patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>Family</b> Members. They were asked for their ideas and suggestions on how best to include <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members in the disclosure process. Framework Analysis was used to analyze this data and find prevalent themes based on the primary research question. A secondary aim was to index categories created based on the interviews that were collected. Data was used from the Texas Disclosure and Compensation Study with Dr. Eric Thomas as the Principal Investigator. Full acknowledgement of access to this data is given to Dr. Thomas. ^ The themes from the research revealed that each stakeholder group was interested and open to including <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members in the disclosure process and that the disclosure process should not be a 2 ̆ 2 one-way 2 ̆ 2 avenue. The themes gave many suggestions regarding how to best include <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members in the disclosure process of a medical error. Secondary aims revealed several ways to assess the ideas and suggestion given by the stakeholders. Overall, acceptability of getting the perspective of <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members was the most common theme. Comparison of each stakeholder group revealed that including <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members would be beneficial to improving hospital disclosure practices. ^ Conclusions included a list of recommendations and measureable appropriate strategies that could provide hospital with key stakeholders insights on how to improve their disclosure process. Sharing <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> members experience with healthcare providers can encourage a shift in culture where <b>patients</b> are valued <b>and</b> active in participating in hospital practices. To my knowledge, this research is the very first of its kind and moves the disclosure process conversation forward in a patient-family member inclusion direction that will assist in improving disclosure practices. Future research should implement and evaluate the success of the various inclusion strategies. ...|$|R

2500|$|The ICD and DSM {{classification}} schemes {{have achieved}} widespread acceptance in psychiatry.

2500|$|Ethical {{standards}} of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the American Medical Association (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, and the American College of Physicians Ethics Manual require disclosure {{of the most serious}} adverse events. However, many doctors and hospitals do not report errors under the current system because of concerns about malpractice lawsuits; this prevents collection of information needed to find and correct the conditions that lead to mistakes. , 35 US states have statutes allowing doctors and health care providers to apologize and offer expressions of regret without their words being used against them in court, and 7 states have also passed laws mandating written disclosure of adverse events and bad outcomes to <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>families.</b> In September 2005, US Senators Clinton and Obama introduced the National Medical Error Disclosure and Compensation (MEDiC) Bill, providing physicians protection from liability and a safe environment for disclosure, as part of a program to notify and compensate patients harmed by medical errors. It is now the policy of several academic medical centers, including Johns Hopkins, University of Illinois and Stanford, to promptly disclose medical errors, offering apologies and compensation. This national initiative, hoping to restore integrity to dealings with patients, make it easier to learn from mistakes and avoid angry lawsuits, was modeled after a University of Michigan Hospital System program that has reduced the number of lawsuits against the hospital by 75% and has decreased the average litigation cost. The Veterans Health Administration requires the disclosure of all adverse events to patients, even those that are not obvious. However, [...] these initiatives have only included hospitals that are self-insured and that employ their staffs, thus limiting the number of parties involved. Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US, after heart disease and cancer, according to research by Johns Hopkins University. Their study published in May 2016 concludes that more than 250,000 people die every year due to medical mix-ups. Other countries report similar results.|$|E
