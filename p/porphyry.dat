The Gyeongsang Basin areas consist of Bulguksa {{intrusive}} rock penetrating layers of sedimentary rocks, mainly granite and <b>porphyry.</b> By contrast, the Pohang Basin areas are made up of stratum that formed in the Tertiary period of the Cenozoic era, which consist of igneous rock, aqueous rock, <b>porphyry,</b> sandstone, and tuff.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Porphyry's</b> Isagoge was {{originally}} written in Greek, but {{was translated into}} Latin in the early 6th century CE by Boethius. Boethius's translation became the standard philosophical logic textbook in the Middle Ages.

5|$|The serekh for Peribsen {{was found}} pressed in earthen jar seals made of clay and mud and in {{inscriptions}} on alabaster, sandstone, <b>porphyry</b> and black schist vessels. These seals and vessels were excavated from Peribsen's tomb and at an excavation site in Elephantine. One clay seal with Peribsen's name was found inside the mastaba tomb K1 at Beit Khallaf.|$|E
5|$|The {{works are}} {{displayed}} on the Richelieu Wing's first floor and in the Apollo Gallery, named by the painter Charles Le Brun, who was commissioned by LouisXIV (the Sun King) to decorate the space in a solar theme. The medieval collection contains the coronation crown of LouisXIV, CharlesV's sceptre, and the 12thcentury <b>porphyry</b> vase. The Renaissance art holdings include Giambologna's bronze Nessus and Deianira and the tapestry Maximillian's Hunt. From later periods, highlights include Madame de Pompadour's Sèvres vase collection and NapoleonIII's apartments.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned to labor in state-owned mines. Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the <b>porphyry</b> mines in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and sent them to the mines of Palestine. On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>Porphyry's</b> most {{influential}} contribution to philosophy, the Introduction to Categories incorporated Aristotle's logic into Neoplatonism, {{in particular the}} doctrine of the categories of being interpreted in terms of entities (in later philosophy, [...] "universal"). Boethius' Isagoge, a Latin translation of <b>Porphyry's</b> [...] "Introduction", became a standard medieval textbook in European schools and universities, which set the stage for medieval philosophical-theological developments of logic and the problem of universals. In medieval textbooks, the all-important Arbor porphyriana ("Porphyrian Tree") illustrates his logical classification of substance. To this day, taxonomy benefits from concepts in <b>Porphyry's</b> Tree, in classifying living organisms (see cladistics).|$|R

5|$|Most copper is mined or {{extracted}} as copper sulfides {{from large}} open pit mines in <b>porphyry</b> copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Sites include Chuquicamata in Chile, Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, United States and El Chino Mine in New Mexico, United States. According to the British Geological Survey in 2005, Chile {{was the top}} producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites {{in the state of}} Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians worked {{deposits}} {{of the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper {{was the most important}} metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as <b>porphyry,</b> greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked {{deposits of}} emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.|$|E
5|$|The church {{featured}} ample {{exterior and}} interior decoration. While the facades were decorated with arches and ceramic tiles, the interior floor mosaics were made of white, yellow and pink marble as well as semi-precious gemstones like sapphire and <b>porphyry.</b> The interior walls were covered with frescoes and mosaics. However, none of the interior decoration has survived. During the church's 20th-century reconstruction, its interior was repainted by artist Teofan Sokerov, who depicted important moments of medieval Bulgarian history in a modernist style. Due to these murals, the church has never been reconsecrated and remains inactive. The facade of the cathedral also includes a stone with a donor's inscription of a Bulgarian ruler, which ended up {{as part of the}} building material.|$|E

5|$|Sicilian church exteriors {{had been}} {{decorated}} in elaborate styles {{from the first}} quarter of the 17th century, with profuse use of sculpture, stucco, frescoes, and marble (Illustration 14). As the post-earthquake churches were becoming completed in the late 1720s, interiors also began to reflect this external decoration, becoming lighter and less intense (compare illustration 14 to the later interior of illustration 15), with profuse sculpted ornamentation of pillars, cornices, and pediments, often in the form of putti, flora, and fauna. Inlaid coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one of the most defining features of the style. These patterns with their roundels of <b>porphyry</b> are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of Europe, again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture. The high altar is usually the pièce de resistance: in many instances a single block of coloured marble, decorated with gilt scrolls and swags, and frequently inset with other stones such as lapis lazuli and agate. Steps leading to the altar dais are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many cases decorated with inlaid coloured marbles. One of the finest examples of this is in the church of St Zita in Palermo.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the Arno River {{spread across the}} entire plain of San Salvi. He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall {{of the city that}} was damming the water became damaged and then washed away in the flood, {{allowing}} the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets. He claims that the water rose above the altar in the Florence Baptistry, reaching over half the height of the <b>porphyry</b> columns. Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333. Villani further claims that the height of the flood water in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podestà) reached 3m (10ft). The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità. The Ponte Vecchio—save the two central piers—was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani. There was an old statue of Mars that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno.|$|E
25|$|The McDougall Brook Granite {{formation}} consists {{mostly of}} porphyritic granite, a borderline feldspar (sometimes quartz) <b>porphyry,</b> and minor amounts of fine-grained quartz monzonite. The grain {{size of the}} <b>porphyry</b> and the size and abundance of feldspar increases inward. Amphibole with apatite is the main mineral phase in {{all three of the}} flows. Parts of the feldspar <b>porphyry</b> are hydrothermally altered. The deposit is extensively exposed, and is colored red on the map.|$|E

40|$|<b>Porphyry’s</b> {{treatise}} On Statues {{has been}} transmitted in fragments deriving almost entirely from Eusebius’ Praeparatio Evangelica. This work, or rather {{what remains of}} it, offers allegorical interpretations of the iconographical features of numerous Greek and Egyptian deities. Throughout the extant fragments, the latter are identified with the incorporeal powers of various entities within the sensible realm. The role of powers (dunameis) in <b>Porphyry’s</b> On Statues has so far remained unnoticed in modern research literature. This chapter intends to contribute to start filling this gap. It first examines the role and status of powers in the surviving fragments. Subsequently, it argues that, in the philosopher’s original project, powers {{are likely to have}} played a core role, which is most probably to be considered in connection with <b>Porphyry’s</b> doctrines of twofold power and of spiritual ascent. info:eu-repo/semantics/submittedForPublicatio...|$|R

The focus of exploration over the years has shifted from tin-base metals to <b>porphyry</b> tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth deposits, and then to <b>porphyry</b> tin deposits, and now indium, a rare element that is important to new technologies such as LCD screens and solar cells, computers and smart phones.|$|E
25|$|Possibly a {{daughter}} named Cleopatra Tryphaena. <b>Porphyry</b> mentions {{a daughter}} Cleopatra Tryphaena who ruled {{with her sister}} Berenice. Strabo however states that Ptolemy had only three daughters of whom the eldest {{has been referred to}} Berenice IV. Suggesting that the Cleopatra Tryphaena referred to by <b>Porphyry</b> may have been Ptolemy's wife, not his daughter. Many experts now identify Cleopatra VI with Cleopatra V of Egypt, Ptolemy's wife.|$|E
25|$|In the Platonic Academy the scholarchs (school heads) Xenocrates and (probably) Polemon {{pleaded for}} vegetarianism.

Some of the prominent Platonists and Neo-Platonists {{in the age}} of the Roman Empire lived on a vegetarian diet. These included Apollonius of Tyana, Plotinus, and <b>Porphyry.</b> <b>Porphyry</b> wrote a treatise On abstinence from beings with a soul, the most elaborate ancient pro-vegetarian text known to us.|$|E
