40|$|Enamel {{plays an}} {{important}} role in tooth function. Optimal combinations of composition and structure endow enamel with unique mechanical properties that remain largely unexplored. Specifically, more detailed understanding of the loadbearing ability of enamel is needed to mimic it synthetically and to design next generation biocomposite materials. This research investigates the variables that influence deformation behaviour of tooth enamel in relation to its hierarchical structure. Initially, a new method was developed for preparing flat, finely polished tooth samples that were maintained in their normal hydrated state for nanoindentation testing. In contrast to conventional methods, which commonly utilise either inappropriate or excessive drying and/or chemically based embedding media (i. e., resins, glues), a novel embedding process was developed using an aqueous <b>putty</b> <b>compound.</b> Additionally, a custom-designed holder was manufactured for mounting wet tooth specimens on the nanoindentation stage that eliminated the need for hot wax or glue during testing. Considering that enamel is a functionally graded material that has different values of Young’s modulus (E) and hardness (H) over the enamel thickness, a new approach of data analysis was developed for interpreting the mechanical properties of enamel at a range of fixed constant indentation depths. Resultant functions were used for predictive purposes. The values of E and H obtained from the nanoindentation instrument demonstrated a well-known decreasing gradient from the enamel occlusal surface towards the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ). In contrast to studies using conventional methods, this research showed that both properties also decreased with increasing depths at fixed locations. Furthermore, experimental results showed that resin embedding had detrimental effects on the E and H of enamel (i. e., both properties decreased with increasing depth), but had positive effects on both mild and severe wear resistance parameters (i. e., both parameters increased with increasing depth). When contrasted against the mechanical properties of enamel samples prepared using conventional protocols, this study postulates that the new hydrated method has, for the first time, revealed the genuine E and H properties of this tissue. The effects of sample preparation methods on tooth microstructure, especially along the EDJ, were investigated with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The new method of sample preparation combined with a careful dehydration process maintained the integrity of the EDJ interface even after applying multiple Berkovich indents up to maximum load of 400 mN. In contrast, the EDJ and the enamel surface were commonly separated and fractured in teeth that had been resin-embedded. Accordingly, the new method of sample preparation proved to be reliable for investigating the genuine microstructural characteristics of teeth. The behaviour of the elastic region in tooth enamel was investigated with analytical and finite element models. The models were fitted into experimental values of E obtained from nanoindentation tests with a Berkovich indenter to identify a relationship between the mechanical responses of enamel under different loading conditions and microstructure. The decrease in E for enamel with increasing indentation depth was related to its enhanced load-bearing ability. The change of E was directly linked to the microstructural evolution (i. e., the rotation of mineral crystals) of enamel. The effective crystal orientation angle was found to be between 44 o and 48 o for indentation depths from 0. 8 and 2. 4 μm below according to the analytical model. The range of angles facilitated the shear sliding of mineral crystals and reduced the stress level as well as the volume of material under higher loads. The behaviour of the plastic region in healthy enamel was investigated with finite element models fitted to nanoindentation data obtained with a Berkovich indenter to determine deformation mechanisms that result in excellent mechanical responses for tooth enamel during loading. When nanoindentation was conducted with increasingly applied loads but at a fixed location, the values of H decreased with increasing indentation depth. The decreasing trend in H was simulated by finite element models and showed a reduction in stress level and yield strength with increasing load. This key mechanism of the loading dependence of mechanical properties resulted in remarkable enamel resilience and was related to the change of effective crystal orientation angle within the enamel microstructure. The mechanical behaviour of enamel with respect to its microstructure was also investigated on teeth exposed to commercially available whitening treatments (tooth bleaching). Enamels exposed to a 6 % bleaching treatment exhibited degraded mechanical properties (E and H) compared to unbleached controls. Furthermore, the creep and recovery responses of bleached enamel were also significantly reduced compared to controls. To determine the variables regulating tooth enamel deformation mechanisms during whitening treatments, analytical models were fitted to stress-strain curves. The effective crystal orientation angle of healthy enamel and the protein shear stress, τc, were identified as 50 o and 2. 5 % of the transverse stiffness of a staggered composite (E 2), respectively. After the bleaching treatment, the effective crystal orientation angle of enamel increased to 54 o for τc = 1. 5 % of E 2. Notably, bleaching reduced shear (τc) by 40 % compared to normal readings for unbleached controls. The changes in mechanical responses of bleached enamel were linked to the decrease of the shear bearing ability of protein components in the enamel microstructure. It is envisaged that these findings will provide new perspectives on applications of bleaching treatments and lead to the development of bleaching agents with less damaging effects to healthy enamel. This work should stimulate new interest in understanding the deformation behaviour of tooth enamel at small scales, and offer new methods for the collection and analysis of data from samples prepared close to their native state, upon which novel and biologically relevant high-performance biocomposite materials can be engineered...|$|E

50|$|Halmeg Linseed oil was {{manufactured}} on a 5-acre Mill {{located at}} the end of Punt Road, overlooking Looking Glass Bay. The linseed oil was used in the manufacture of lead paint and varnish, as well as <b>putties,</b> caulking <b>compounds,</b> printing inks and linoleum. The production plant was established in 1923. The revolutionary extraction process did not work at first. Despite this, one hundred guests toured the new mill at its official opening. Harold Meggit, owner of the plant, increased employees wages, also advising {{that there would be no}} jobs, no wages if a new solution to distil the oil could not be found. The employees put forward hundreds of suggestions, and two were implemented, producing the finest linseed oil in the industry. In later years, Halmeg was the first to produce Safflower Oil in Australia. It also introduced a profit sharing scheme for its employees. The site closed in 1974.|$|R
40|$|Sealing {{materials}} {{that can be}} applied and left in place in vacuum over a wide range of temperatures (especially temperatures of a few thousand degrees Celsius) have been conceived and investigated for potential utility in repairing thermal-protection tiles on the space shuttles in orbit before returning to Earth. These materials are also adaptable to numerous terrestrial applications that involve vacuum processing and/or repair of structures that must withstand high temperatures. These materials can be formulated to have mechanical handling characteristics ranging from almost freely flowing liquid-like consistency through paste-like consistency to stiff puttylike consistency, and to retain these characteristics in vacuum until heated to high curing temperatures. A sealing material of this type can be formulated to be used in any of several different ways for example, to be impregnated into a high-temperature-fabric patch, impregnated into a high-temperature-fabric gasket for sealing a patch, applied under a patch, or applied alone in the manner of <b>putty</b> or wallboard <b>compound.</b> The sealing material must be formulated to be compatible with, and adhere to, the structural material(s) to be repaired. In general, the material consists of a vacuum-compatible liquid containing one or more dissolved compound(s) and/or mixed with suspended solid particles. Depending on the intended application, the liquid can be chosen to be of a compound that can remain in place in vacuum for a time long enough to be useful, and/or to evaporate or decompose in a controlled way to leave a useful solid residue behind. The evaporation rate is determined by proper choice of vapor pressure, application of heat, and/or application of ultraviolet light or other optical radiation. The liquid chosen for the original space shuttle application is a commercial silicone vacuum-pump oil...|$|R
