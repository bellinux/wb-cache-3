The estimation of <b>price</b> <b>relatives</b> for new and disappearing goods using hedonic imputation methods involves taking ratios of hedonic models.

This study finds that the single imputation hedonic method estimates inconsistent <b>price</b> <b>relatives,</b> while the double imputation method may produce consistent <b>price</b> <b>relatives</b> depending on the behavior of unobserved characteristics in the comparison periods. The study outlines a methodology to test whether double imputation <b>price</b> <b>relatives</b> are consistent.

[...] When a country is importing more than it exports, the supply of its own currency on the international market tends to increase as it tries to exchange it for foreign currency to pay for its imports, and this extra supply tends to cause the price to fall.

The results indicate that average <b>relative</b> <b>price</b> variability is significantly lower if the city pairs associated with a <b>relative</b> <b>price</b> series belong to the same region. However, after controlling for the effect of distance, <b>relative</b> <b>price</b> variability (measured by standard deviation of <b>relative</b> <b>prices)</b> increases significantly if both cities are in the West and <b>relative</b> <b>price</b> variability (measured by standard deviation of <b>relative</b> <b>price</b> changes) decreases if they both are in the Northeast. Further, <b>relative</b> <b>price</b> variability increases significantly if at least one city is located either in the South or in the West. We find that the likelihood of <b>relative</b> <b>price</b> convergence increases if both cities belong to the South and this result is robust irrespective of whether we control for distance or not. It, however, decreases if at least one city belongs to the West. Finally, distance appears to increase <b>relative</b> <b>price</b> variability and to lower the likelihood of <b>relative</b> <b>price</b> convergence if at least one city is located in the South. ...|$|R
