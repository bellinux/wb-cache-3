5|$|<b>Photo{{synthesis}}</b> is {{the synthesis}} of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic <b>photosynthesis</b> splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvinâ€“ Benson cycle. Three types of <b>photosynthesis</b> occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM <b>photosynthesis.</b> These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM <b>photosynthesis</b> incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.|$|E
5|$|Research is also {{undertaken}} {{in this field}} of artificial <b>photosynthesis.</b> It {{involves the use of}} nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial <b>photosynthesis</b> are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial <b>Photosynthesis</b> to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to complex structures and systems, among the phenomena that critics variously claim evolution cannot explain are consciousness, hominid intelligence, instincts, emotions, metamorphosis, <b>photosynthesis,</b> homosexuality, music, language, religion, morality, and altruism (see altruism in animals). Most of these, such as hominid intelligence, instinct, emotion, <b>photosynthesis,</b> language, and altruism, have been well-explained by evolution, while others remain mysterious, or only have preliminary explanations. Supporters of evolution further contend that no alternative explanation {{has been able}} to adequately explain the biological origin of these phenomena either.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fixing {{carbon dioxide in}} <b>photosynthesis,</b> some bacteria also fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait {{can be found in}} most bacteria of the metabolic types listed above.|$|E
5|$|Many {{instances}} of convergent evolution are known in plants, including the repeated development of C4 <b>photosynthesis,</b> seed dispersal by fleshy fruits adapted {{to be eaten}} by animals, and carnivory.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{physiology}} encompasses all {{the internal}} chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life. Chemicals {{obtained from the}} air, soil and water {{form the basis of}} all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic <b>photosynthesis</b> and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by <b>photosynthesis.</b> Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues. Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of <b>photosynthesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first cacti {{are thought}} to have been only {{slightly}} succulent shrubs or small trees whose leaves carried out <b>photosynthesis.</b> They lived in tropical areas that experienced periodic drought. If Pereskia clade A is a good model of these early cacti, then, although they would have appeared superficially similar to other trees growing nearby, they had already evolved strategies to conserve water (some of which are present in members of other families in the order Caryophyllales). These strategies included being able to respond rapidly to periods of rain, and keeping transpiration low by using water very efficiently during <b>photosynthesis.</b> The latter was achieved by tightly controlling the opening of stomata. Like Pereskia species today, early ancestors may have been able to switch from the normal C3 mechanism, where carbon dioxide is used continuously in <b>photosynthesis,</b> to CAM cycling, in which when the stomata are closed, carbon dioxide produced by respiration is stored for later use in <b>photosynthesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The primary {{function}} of pigments in plants is <b>photosynthesis,</b> which uses the green pigment chlorophyll {{along with several}} red and yellow pigments including porphyrins, carotenoids, anthocyanins and betalains.|$|E
5|$|The {{stems of}} most cacti have adaptations {{to allow them}} to conduct <b>photosynthesis</b> in the absence of leaves. This is {{discussed}} further below under Metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of oxygen gas on Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is <b>photosynthesis,</b> which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. <b>Photosynthesis</b> releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{plants and}} {{therefore}} incapable of <b>photosynthesis</b> themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single-celled algae species that {{reside in the}} animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from {{the products of the}} algae's <b>photosynthesis,</b> namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The algae also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the anemone is largely dependent on the proportions and identities of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden anemone (Lebrunia coralligens) has a whorl of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner whorl of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for <b>photosynthesis,</b> but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the idea that plants could {{synthesise}} almost all their tissues from atmospheric gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of <b>photosynthesis,</b> the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would take many more years. Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of <b>photosynthesis</b> remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between the pigment chlorophyll and starch production was finally made in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in <b>photosynthesis.</b> Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting <b>photosynthesis.</b> Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria are organelles {{vital in}} {{metabolism}} {{as they are}} {{the site of the}} citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. They evolved from symbiotic bacteria and retain a remnant genome. Like bacteria, plant cells have cell walls, and contain organelles such as chloroplasts in addition to the organelles in other eukaryotes. Chloroplasts produce energy from light by <b>photosynthesis,</b> and were also originally symbiotic bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{energy is}} radiant light and {{heat from the}} Sun that is {{harnessed}} using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, solar architecture, molten salt power plants and artificial <b>photosynthesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Solar energy {{may be used}} in a water {{stabilization}} pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity. A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in <b>photosynthesis,</b> although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable.|$|E
5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced <b>photosynthesis</b> in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{herbicide}} glyphosate is an inhibitor of 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase, other herbicides, {{such as the}} sulfonylureas {{inhibit the}} enzyme acetolactate synthase. Both these enzymes are needed for plants to make branched-chain amino acids. Many other enzymes are inhibited by herbicides, including enzymes needed for the biosynthesis of lipids and carotenoids and the processes of <b>photosynthesis</b> and oxidative phosphorylation.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{relationship}} between light, primary production, and ecological energy budgets. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of electromagnetic energy of different wavelengths. Radiant energy from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts {{as a catalyst for}} genetic mutation. Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through <b>photosynthesis.</b> Organisms capable of assimilating energy by <b>photosynthesis</b> or through inorganic fixation of H2S are autotrophs. Autotrophs â€” responsible for primary production â€” assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical enthalpic bonds.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{spectroscopy}} has wide applicability in molecular biology, {{particularly the}} study of <b>photosynthesis.</b> It {{has been used to}} study a wide variety of flowering plants and ferns by researchers in departments of biology, plant physiology and agriculture science as well as molecular genetics.|$|E
5|$|After the NSDAP came {{to power}} in Germany in 1933, Franck {{resigned}} his post in protest against the dismissal of fellow academics. He assisted Frederick Lindemann in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, before he left Germany in November 1933. After a year at the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark, he moved to the United States, where he worked at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and then the University of Chicago. During this period he became interested in <b>photosynthesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in bacteria {{is either}} heterotrophic, where organic carbon compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through <b>photosynthesis,</b> or based on chemotrophy, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{wholesale}} destruction of plants at the Kâ€“Pg boundary, {{there was a}} proliferation of saprotrophic organisms, such as fungi, {{that do not require}} <b>photosynthesis</b> and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, such as ferns and other plants, returned.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for <b>photosynthesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Glucose, {{dextrose}} or grape sugar, occurs {{naturally in}} fruits and plant juices {{and is the}} primary product of <b>photosynthesis.</b> Most ingested carbohydrates are converted into glucose during digestion {{and it is the}} form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of animals in the bloodstream. It can be manufactured from starch by the addition of enzymes or in the presence of acids. Glucose syrup is a liquid form of glucose that is widely used in the manufacture of foodstuffs. It can be manufactured from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} GÃ¶ttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on <b>photosynthesis</b> had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic <b>photosynthesis.</b> According to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest {{is produced}} by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic <b>photosynthesis</b> by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is also {{important}} in photosynthetic oxygen evolution in chloroplasts in plants. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) {{is a part of}} photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for the terminal photooxidation of water during the light reactions of <b>photosynthesis,</b> and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese. To fulfill this requirement, most broad-spectrum plant fertilizers contain manganese.|$|E
5|$|Not all co-evolved {{interactions}} between species involve conflict. Many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved. For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between {{plants and the}} mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil. This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from <b>photosynthesis.</b> Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups of}} archaea use {{sunlight}} {{as a source}} of energy (they are phototrophs). However, oxygenâ€“generating <b>photosynthesis</b> does not occur in any of these organisms. Many basic metabolic pathways are shared between all forms of life; for example, archaea use a modified form of glycolysis (the Entnerâ€“Doudoroff pathway) and either a complete or partial citric acid cycle. These similarities to other organisms probably reflect both early origins in the history of life and their high level of efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Since {{both the}} {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and <b>photosynthesis.</b> Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{chemical}} processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial <b>photosynthesis.</b> The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing <b>photosynthesis</b> more efficiently than plants.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{emergence}} of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the Cambrian explosion. Here, the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record, as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct. Various triggers for the Cambrian explosion have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from <b>photosynthesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, a mutualistic relationship {{where the}} fungus forms a sheath {{on the surface}} of the root from which hyphae extend outward into the soil, and inwards between the cortical cells with which they interface to form a Hartig net. The main benefit for the fungus is constant access to a supply of carbohydrates produced by the plant's <b>photosynthesis,</b> while the plant benefits from an enhanced supply of mineral nutrients from the soil, taken up by the hyphae of the fungus. It grows in association with pines, particularly eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} <b>photosynthesis</b> in very basic forms of plant life {{worldwide}} allowed the sun's energy {{to be harvested}} to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and {{gave rise to the}} ozone layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.|$|E
