5000|$|In {{the court}} decision, the court stated the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 {{exempted}} from {{the minimum wage}} and maximum hours rules of the FSLA persons [...] "employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for individuals ... unable to care for themselves." [...] 29 U. S. C. §213(a)(15). The court found {{that the power of}} the Department of Labor (DOL) to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the making of rules to fill any 'gap' left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress, and when that agency fills that gap reasonably, it is binding. In this case, one of the gaps was whether to include workers paid by third parties in the exemption and the DOL had done that. Since the DOL followed <b>public</b> <b>notice</b> <b>procedure,</b> and since there was a gap left in the legislation, the DOLs regulation stood and home health care workers were not covered by either minimum wage or overtime pay requirements (but see below).|$|E

5000|$|Under the Commerce Clause in the United States Constitution, {{the federal}} {{government}} derives authority to regulate pollution of United States waters if interstate commerce is affected. The Clean Water Act (CWA), in particular §404, regulates discharge into [...] "waters of the United States". Permitting is required under the CWA §404 for activities that dredge or fill in this jurisdiction, which can include wetlands. Under this permitting program, environmental impacts are to be avoided if possible, reduced and mitigated if necessary. Permits are limited to a maximum period of five years and use <b>public</b> <b>notice</b> and comment <b>procedures.</b> While the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issues the permit, responsibility for enforcement is shared between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA. However, the scope {{of what constitutes a}} wetland and thus what falls under CWA command and control regulation has changed over time. Two recent Supreme Court decisions have impacted the definition of wetlands under the Clean Water Act: ...|$|R

40|$|This Symposium Essay compares current {{patterns}} and practices surrounding IRS utilization of IRB guidance (revenue rulings, revenue <b>procedures,</b> and <b>notices)</b> with administrative law doctrine concerning informal agency guidance documents. In administrative law jurisprudence, {{the distinction between}} legislative and interpretative rules (and thus whether the Administrative <b>Procedure</b> Act requires <b>public</b> <b>notice</b> and comment <b>procedures)</b> and the determination of whether Chevron or Skidmore provides the appropriate evaluative standard on judicial review both ultimately turn on whether the agency legal interpretation at issue carries the force and effect of law. The precise contours of the force of law concept are unclear, as is whether the force of law means {{the same thing for}} APA procedural challenges as it does for judicial deference. Although {{there seems to be an}} emerging consensus in the tax community that IRB guidance documents contain interpretative rules eligible only for Skidmore deference, this consensus seems premised on longstanding assumptions about IRB guidance that are not entirely consistent with the contemporary reality of IRB guidance. Current IRS practices, government litigating positions in tax cases, Code provisions and regulations imposing penalties for noncompliance, and retroactive application of regulations based on IRS notice publication individually and collectively situate IRB guidance squarely in the gray area of the force of law concept, raising important issues of whether IRB guidance is entitled to Chevron deference but also subject to APA notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements...|$|R
