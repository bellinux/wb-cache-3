Hovind's son Eric Hovind claims that evolution is responsible for tattoos, body piercing, <b>premarital</b> <b>sex,</b> unwed births, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), divorce, and child abuse.|$|E
5|$|The Elves {{view the}} sexual act as {{extremely}} special and intimate, for {{it leads to}} the conception and birth of children. Extra-marital and <b>premarital</b> <b>sex</b> are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Yet separation during pregnancy or {{during the early years}} of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E
5|$|Magdalena, a fourteen-year-old {{girl from}} a working-class Mexican American family in Echo Park, Los Angeles, attends her cousin Eileen's quinceañera, an extravagant coming-of-age {{ceremony}} to celebrate her fifteenth birthday. Eileen's older brother Carlos—who has been disowned {{by his family}} due to his homosexuality and now lives with his great-uncle Tomas—arrives at the celebrations but is forced to leave by his father. Magdalena herself is about to turn fifteen but her parents cannot afford to host a quinceañera as lavish as Eileen's, and they deny her repeated requests to hire a Hummer limousine for the occasion. While preparing for her quinceañera, Magdalena learns that she is pregnant by her friend Herman although they had only once engaged in non-penetrative intercourse. Her Christian father is furious, believing that Magdalena has had <b>premarital</b> <b>sex</b> despite her protestations that she is still a virgin. She leaves her family {{to move in with}} Tomas and Carlos and continues to see Herman until she discovers that his mother has sent him away to live with relatives to prevent him from seeing Magdalena.|$|E

50|$|While {{conservative}} sexual ethics {{focus on}} preventing <b>premarital</b> or non-procreative <b>sex,</b> liberal sexual ethics are typically directed rather towards consent, {{regardless of whether}} or not the partners are married.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of <b>premarital</b> <b>sex,</b> extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform <b>premarital</b> <b>sex,</b> rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E
25|$|Some {{claim that}} certain sex {{education}} curricula break down pre-existing notions of modesty or encourage acceptance {{of what they}} consider immoral practices, such as homosexuality or <b>premarital</b> <b>sex.</b> A website which supports that view is the Coalition for Positive Sexuality. Naturally, those that believe that homosexuality and <b>premarital</b> <b>sex</b> are {{a normal part of}} the range of human sexuality disagree with them.|$|E

25|$|Sumerian myths {{suggest a}} {{prohibition}} against <b>premarital</b> <b>sex.</b> Marriages were often arranged {{by the parents}} of the bride and groom; engagements were usually completed through the approval of contracts recorded on clay tablets. These marriages became legal as soon as the groom delivered a bridal gift to his bride's father. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that <b>premarital</b> <b>sex</b> was a common, but surreptitious, occurrence.|$|E

5000|$|In Latin America, more {{commonly}} in Brazil, youths' relaxation of taboos goes a step further, especially in rural areas, in more liberal {{cities such as}} Rio de Janeiro, and among older generations when <b>premarital</b> heterosexual <b>sex</b> was less available. Bromance among youths is viewed with less suspicion than would be expected {{in a society where}} machismo is prevalent, compared to bromance among older males. Homosexual contact among otherwise heterosexual young males in Portuguese is called meinha (literally [...] "a little sock") or troca-troca (literally [...] "bartering"), which is analogous to the circle jerk of English-speaking countries.|$|R
50|$|No {{mention of}} stoning/Rajm or capital {{punishment}} for adultery {{is found in}} the Qur'an, which (in Surah an-Nur) prescribes lashing as punishment for <b>premarital</b> and extramarital <b>sex</b> (zina). For this reason some minority Muslim sects such as Kharijites found in Iraq, and Islamic Modernists such as the Quranists disagree with the legality of rajm.|$|R
25|$|In some cultures, sexual {{activity}} is considered acceptable only within marriage, while <b>premarital</b> and extramarital <b>sex</b> are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally {{or in some}} countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the norms of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most jurisdictions are sexual assault and {{sexual activity}} with a person below the local age of consent.|$|R
25|$|On August 17, 1980, a United Church of Canada {{task force}} {{released}} In God's Image, its report on sexual ethics which recommended {{the admission of}} homosexuals into the ministry and tolerance of <b>premarital</b> <b>sex.</b> Although the report accepted abortion under qualified circumstances, it rejected abortion on demand.|$|E

50|$|In Sikhism, <b>premarital</b> or extra-marital <b>sex</b> is {{strictly}} forbidden.

A Sikh is encouraged not to live as a recluse, beggar, monk, nun, celibate, or in any similar vein.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Kama Sutra, {{which is}} an ancient sex manual related to Hindu literature, Ratirahasya deals with medieval Indian society. During the medieval age, India became more {{conservative}} compared to ancient India, freedom of women decreased, and <b>premarital</b> and extramarital <b>sex</b> were frowned upon. A sex manual was needed that would be suitable for the medieval cultural climate, and Ratirahasya was written, {{quite different from the}} ancient text Kama Sutra.|$|R
50|$|Various jurisdictions {{have placed}} {{restrictive}} laws against certain sexual acts, such as incest, sexual activity with minors, prostitution, rape, zoophilia, sodomy, <b>premarital</b> and extramarital <b>sex.</b> Religious beliefs {{also play a}} role in personal decisions about sexual intercourse or other sexual activity, such as decisions about virginity, or legal and public policy matters. Religious views on sexuality vary significantly between different religions and sects of the same religion, though there are common themes, such as prohibition of adultery.|$|R
25|$|Flogging is a {{punishment}} for criminal offences such as adultery, <b>premarital</b> <b>sex</b> and alcohol consumption. According to Sharia court rulings, flogging ranges from 80 to 200 lashes. Verbal abuse pertaining to a person's honour is illegal and punishable by 80 lashes. Between 2007 and 2014, {{many people in}} the UAE were sentenced to 100 lashes. More recently in 2015, two men were sentenced to 80 lashes for hitting and insulting a woman. In 2014, an expatriate in Abu Dhabi was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 80 lashes after alcohol consumption and raping a toddler. Alcohol consumption for Muslims is illegal and punishable by 80 lashes; many Muslims have been sentenced to 80 lashes for alcohol consumption. Sometimes 40 lashes are given. Illicit sex is sometimes penalized by 60 lashes. 80 lashes is the standard number for anyone sentenced to flogging in several emirates. Sharia courts have penalized domestic workers with floggings. In October 2013, a Filipino housemaid was sentenced to 100 lashes for illegitimate pregnancy. Drunk-driving is strictly illegal and punishable by 80 lashes; many expatriates have been sentenced to 80 lashes for drunk-driving.

25|$|Sometimes formal sex {{education}} is taught {{as a full}} course {{as part of the}} curriculum in junior high school or high school. Other times it is only one unit within a more broad biology, health, home economics, or physical education class. Some schools offer no {{sex education}}, since it remains a controversial issue in several countries, particularly the United States (especially with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, including LGBT sex education, and topics dealing with human sexual behavior, e.g. safe sex practices, masturbation, <b>premarital</b> <b>sex,</b> and sexual ethics).|$|E
50|$|Though {{adoption}} {{is an ancient}} practice, the notion of formal laws intended to solidify the adoption by restricting information exchange is comparatively young. In most Western countries until the 1960s and 1970s, adoption bore with it a certain stigma as it was associated in the popular mind with illegitimacy, orphanhood, and <b>premarital</b> or extramarital <b>sex.</b> Unmarried pregnant women were often sent elsewhere from the latter stages of pregnancy until birth, {{with the intent of}} concealing the pregnancy from family and neighbours.|$|R
2500|$|Jehovah's Witnesses {{endeavor}} to remain [...] "separate from the world", which {{is regarded as}} a place of moral contamination and under the control of Satan, refusing any political and military activity and limiting social contact with non-Witnesses. Members practice a strict moral code, which forbids <b>premarital</b> and homosexual <b>sex,</b> adultery, smoking, drunkenness and drug abuse, and blood transfusions. Discipline within congregations is maintained by a system of judicial committees, which have the power to expel members who breach organizational rules and demand their shunning by other Witnesses. The threat of shunning also serves to deter other members from dissident behavior.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{the word}} “revolution” typifies much of the {{research}} and media coverage of contemporary shifts in Chinese sexual attitudes and behaviors. I argue that this language, while useful in intimating the extent of social transformation, remains clumsy due to the historical backdrop of Western sexual liberation and China’s own cultural history. While the PRC government continues to disapprove and outlaw the proliferation of pornography, rising rates of <b>premarital</b> and extramarital <b>sex</b> and the spread of HIV/AIDS and other developments demonstrate ongoing shifts in Chinese society. Yet, the government’s domination of politics and the Chinese people’s desire for continued economic and political stability have ensured that China’s current de facto sexual “revolution” is more limited in scope than Western sexual liberation...|$|R
25|$|Zina is an Islamic law, both in {{the four}} schools of Sunni fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and the two schools of Shi'a fiqh, {{concerning}} unlawful sexual relations between Muslims who are not married to one another through a Nikah. It includes extramarital sex and <b>premarital</b> <b>sex,</b> such as adultery (consensual sexual relations outside marriage), fornication (consensual sexual intercourse between two unmarried persons), illegal sex by a slave girl, and homosexuality (consensual sexual relations between same-sex partners). Traditionally, a married or unmarried Muslim male could have sex outside marriage with a non-Muslim slave girl, with or without her consent, and such sex was not considered zina.|$|E
25|$|Oppositely, {{there are}} myths {{with a similar}} plot, but a {{different}} role for the characters.

However, in the Danggeum Aegi myth, Danggeum Aegi becomes the goddess of childbirth, and her sons become the gods of life. In the Nogadanpungjajimyeong myth, Queen Nogadanpungjajimyeong becomes the goddess of luck, and her sons become the Underworld gods.|$|E

25|$|Although most HIV-infected {{individuals}} in China are drug users, patients infected through sexual transmission are {{the fastest growing}} group, accounting for close to 50% of new infections in 2005. Overall, they represent 43.6% of total HIV/AIDS cases, including commercial sex workers or their clients (19.6%), partners of HIV-infected individuals (16.7%), and {{men who have sex}} with men (7.3%). As with drug use, sexuality is not openly discussed in Chinese society and is therefore neither easily targeted by health promotion campaigns, nor has it traditionally been taught in schools. Even among university students, levels of AIDS knowledge and risk perception are alarmingly low. On the other hand, attitudes towards sex are becoming increasingly more liberal and, as a result, <b>premarital</b> and extramarital <b>sex</b> are more commonly practiced. Although they are widely available, condoms are rarely used.|$|R
50|$|Pre-Soviet Central Asian {{culture and}} {{religion}} promoted female seclusion. Cultural mores strongly condemned unveiling {{as it was}} thought to lead to <b>premarital</b> or adulterous <b>sex,</b> a deep threat to Central Asian conceptions of family honor. Many mullahs also considered the full body veil Islamic, and strongly protested any attempts to alter it. Female seclusion in homes was encouraged {{for the same reasons}} although home seclusion was far more oppressive. Female quarters and male quarters existed separately, and women were not allowed in the presence of male non-relatives. Women from rich families were the most isolated as the family could afford to build numerous rooms and hire servants, removing the need for leaving the home. Traditional settled society encouraged seclusion as a way to protect family honor, as religiously necessary, and as a way of asserting male superiority over women.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{criticism}} from scholars is that the dehumanization of women in sexual explicit materials. Men rated their own partners as being less physically endowed after seeing beautiful female nudes engaged in sexual activity. It seems that the voluptuous model has become the norm or anchor to which real people are compared. Zillmann and Bryant also found that such effects {{are not limited to}} men. Compared with control groups, both men and women who watched weekly pornographic films later reported that they are less satisfied with their partners' affection, appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performances. They also sex with less emotional involvement and showed greater acceptance of <b>premarital</b> and extramarital <b>sex.</b> They placed less values on monogamy and marriage. Teenagers who have watched a whole day of talk shows discussing about sexual topics later overestimated the frequency of such behaviors.|$|R
