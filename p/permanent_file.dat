5|$|Mac {{shows her}} work to Beaver, which {{involves}} his new business project. Veronica, under a disguise, meets with the prom baby's temporary foster mom. Veronica learns that the baby's foster mother committed suicide {{and her father}} was in jail, hinting that the baby is Trina Echolls. Veronica talks to Trina and tells her the news of her parentage. Trina actually wants her story {{to go to the}} tabloids. However, a deaf lunch lady storms in and says that she's actually Trina's mother. The lunch lady says that Lianne was a friend who covered up her pregnancy to protect her. Trina's father is Principal Moorehead, and Trina confronts him about leaving her at the prom in front of many faculty. Veronica finds the dead rat that Keith picked up at the bus. Veronica finds out that Principal Clemmons deliberately gave Veronica her detention task so that she would find her mother's <b>permanent</b> <b>file</b> and frame Principal Moorehead. Veronica picks up Abel Koontz's (Christian Clemenson) belongings and walks into Meg's (Alona Tal) room and discovers that Meg is pregnant.|$|E
500|$|In health class, {{the whole}} class starts taking care of fake babies. Vice Principal Clemmons (Duane Daniels) calls Veronica {{into his office and}} gives her {{detention}} for having keys to his file cabinet. Beaver walks up to Mac (Tina Majorino) and asks her for a few favors. For Veronica's detention, she has to alphabetize files and put them in cabinets. Veronica finds her mother's <b>permanent</b> <b>file</b> and figures out that she was troubled in high school. Logan (Jason Dohring) punches Weevil (Francis Capra) and Logan's cronies beat up on him. Veronica talks to a teacher and finds out that Lianne and that teacher spread false rumors around the school and got suspended because of it. Weevil gets duct-taped to the flagpole. Veronica asks Vice Principal Clemmons about who might have known her mom in high school. Veronica talks to Principal Moorhead, who tells her that her mom was [...] "vicious". Trina (Alyson Hannigan) is coming back to perform in a play at Neptune High. Kendall tries to seduce Duncan (Teddy Dunn) again. Trina meets Kendall, and the interaction is rife with sarcasm. Veronica looks through her mom's yearbook and eventually tracks down one of her mother's old friends, who provides more information on the love triangle between Celeste (Lisa Thornhill), Jake (Kyle Secor), and Lianne.|$|E

50|$|The {{results of}} this work are defended in an oral {{examination}} before two Marlboro professors, and one outside evaluator who has expertise in the student's field of study but is not connected with the college.

50|$|The {{unofficial}} MACE {{software was}} later chosen over the official SCOPE product {{as the basis}} of the next CDC operating system, Kronos, named after the Greek god of time. The main marketing reason for its adoption was the development of its TELEX time sharing feature and its BATCHIO remote batch feature. Kronos continued to use the COS/SCOPE 1 file system {{with the addition of a}} <b>permanent</b> <b>file</b> feature.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, in {{response}} to requests {{from some of the}} veterans of the 477th, the Air Force officially removed General Hunter's letters of reprimand from the <b>permanent</b> <b>files</b> of 15 of the 104 officers charged in the Freeman Field protest and promised to remove the remaining 89 letters when requests were filed. Roger Terry received a full pardon, restoration of rank and a refund of his fine.|$|R

5000|$|Operating system {{development}} then {{split into two}} camps. The CDC-sanctioned evolution of COS was undertaken at the Sunnyvale, California software development lab. Many customers eventually took delivery of their systems with this software, then known as SCOPE (Supervisory Control Of Program Execution). SCOPE version 1 was, essentially, dis-assembled COS; SCOPE version 2 included new device and file system support; SCOPE version 3 included <b>permanent</b> <b>file</b> support, EI/200 remote batch support, and INTERCOM time sharing support. SCOPE always had significant reliability and maintainability issues.|$|E
50|$|In later years, DECtape drives {{were added}} to some PDP-1 systems, as a more {{convenient}} method of backing up programs and data, and to enable early time-sharing. This latter application usually requires a secondary storage medium for swapping programs and data {{in and out of}} core memory, without requiring manual intervention. For this purpose, DECtapes are far superior to paper tapes, in terms of reliability, durability, and speed. Early hard disks were expensive and notoriously unreliable; if available and working, they are used primarily for speed of swapping, and not for <b>permanent</b> <b>file</b> storage.|$|E

[...] A soldier’s qualification card (WD AGO Form 20), which occupied a central place {{in the scheme of}} classifying and assigning enlisted men, was filled out partly at the AAF reception center prior to entering training and more fully later at the BTC. This form was kept current throughout their career by the addition of pertinent information; it followed him wherever he went until he died in the service or was discharged, at which time the form was forwarded to The Adjutant General for <b>permanent</b> <b>filing.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{embryonic}} dang'an {{is created}} when individuals enter the school system. This {{is similar to}} the <b>permanent</b> <b>file</b> of a school student in some Western school systems, and is transferred from school to school, but in China it is required for entry to university or a work unit, to which the file is then transferred. Millions of peasants, who work on family farms or in small businesses, never acquire a dang'an. Those who do are classified as either cadres (Chinese: ganbu) or workers (Chinese: gōngrén). It is difficult to cross this boundary.|$|E
5000|$|During treatment, conservators also {{document}} the materials they used, reactions that occurred, information on reversibility, etc. Much {{of this information}} can also be summarized in a laboratory master report, which records information {{that may not be}} included in final reports, such as reasoning for methods, factors that determine choice of treatment and changes in methodology, material safety data sheets, etc. [...] Final reports can contain this information as well but in less technical detail. A final report consists of [...] "after" [...] photographs, a summary of the work completed compared to the goals of treatment, and the conservator's contact information in case future conservators working on the object have questions about the previous work completed. Any documentation of conservation treatments is also stored in the object's <b>permanent</b> <b>file</b> for ease of accessibility and retrievability.|$|E
50|$|Mike's {{address in}} his <b>permanent</b> <b>file</b> {{is on the}} {{eleventh}} floor of a ten-story building. The pair track him and locate his real address. Eavesdropping, they discover that {{he is about to}} fail a course. They seize on the chance to increase student participation even more, as {{a large part of the}} student body now idolize him. They collaborate to produce a project for him. The project is of such quality that it is entered in a science fair. It is disqualified when the judges discover that the work is not his. The students react badly, resulting in the schools banning from the event. Next they turn to sports. An announcement that Mike likes basketball results in full-on participation in the game. They play an away game and win (63-62). This results in a joyous riot and much destruction.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} goal for Intranet applications development is quick response time.

50|$|The {{absence of}} {{popular support for}} the Husák {{leadership}} was an inevitable reaction to the repressive policies instituted during the normalization process. Early post-invasion efforts to keep alive {{the spirit of the}} Prague Spring were quashed through a series of subversion trials in 1972 that led to jail sentences ranging from nine months to six and one-half years for the opposition leaders. Czechoslovak citizens over the age of fifteen were required to carry a small red identification book, containing an array of information about the individual and a number of pages to be stamped by employers, health officials, and other authorities. All citizens also had <b>permanent</b> <b>files</b> at the office of their local KSČ neighborhood committee, another at their place of employment, and another at the Ministry of Interior.|$|R
50|$|When {{considering}} outgoing loans, {{institutions can}} also request a General Facility Report form {{to verify that}} the borrowing museum meets the lending institution's minimum standards of climate control and security. Once a loan is approved, a loan agreement is drafted, which is a binding legal document detailing the minimum requirements of care while the object is in the borrower's possession, packing and transportation arrangements, insurance requirements, guidelines for reproduction and credit, and any other special provisions agreed upon by both institutions. Additional documentation that can accompany travelling objects could also include specific packing instructions with diagrams and an itemized shipping receipt or bill of lading. Copies {{of all of these}} documents are stored in the exhibition files, as well as the object's <b>permanent</b> <b>file.</b> An exhibition file could also contain checklists, gallery layouts and lists of object locations, conservation records, computer reports, installation photographs, gallery climate and pest-monitoring records, purchase requisitions, and correspondence relating to the exhibition.|$|E

2500|$|The Freeman Field mutiny was {{a series}} of {{incidents}} at Freeman Army Airfield, a United States Army Air Forces base near Seymour, Indiana, in 1945 in which African American members of the 477th Bombardment Group attempted to integrate an all-white officers' club. [...] The mutiny resulted in 162 separate arrests of black officers, some of them twice. [...] Three were court-martialed on [...] relatively minor charges. [...] One was convicted. [...] In 1995, the Air Force officially vindicated the actions of the African-American officers, set aside the single court-martial conviction and removed letters of reprimand from the <b>permanent</b> <b>files</b> of 15 of the officers. The mutiny is generally regarded by historians of the Civil Rights Movement as an important step toward full integration of the armed forces and as a model for later efforts to integrate public facilities through civil disobedience.|$|R

50|$|Following and {{supporting}} the activism of her mother she was obligated to acquire basic legal knowledge on local and international law, via self teaching and the methodology of scientific research {{as well as in}} vivo practice. In this research she discovered the capacity for average Citizens to file complaints to the ICC at the Hague when these crimes are committed by the citizens’ governments and are large scale. In October 2011, with her mother they {{filed a complaint with the}} ICC, against the G. A. Papandreou governments, reporting with substantiation crimes against humanity and genocide during times of peace at the expense of the Greek People, becoming along with her mother the first Greek Citizens and European non-ranked citizens to file against the Memorandum and any related policy.This action was received very positively and supported by the Greek People and the Greeks of the Diaspora, but was also fought against by the political circles in Greece.The result of this action was that the prosecutor at the ICC opened a <b>permanent</b> <b>file</b> for the gathering of additional evidence stating that when the evidence shows a full scale impact to the sum of the Greek People then the ICC will intervene, validating the admissibility of this move. Since, there have been two additional complaints to the ICC by other Greek Citizens.Aside legal activism, she also is attempting to spread the modern Greek spirit and culture but to also revive and teach the up to now unknown and forgotten to the international public Greek modern history and especially the actions of the Greeks during WWII, via the creation of webcomics and accompanying informative articles http://www.drunkduck.com/Brave_Resistance/.|$|E
