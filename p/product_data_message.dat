40|$|<b>Data</b> about <b>products</b> and {{services}} is {{of paramount importance}} in most inter-organizational business processes. For business-to-business (B 2 B) scenarios, a great number of XML-based message specifications are available, which cover various processes and types of transactions. These specifications support the respective data exchange tasks by providing a common representation for products {{and services}} in the form of syntactical conventions with some light-weight formal semantics. However, an analysis of the underlying models shows that technical <b>product</b> <b>data</b> and commercial <b>product</b> <b>data</b> are being represented in a fundamentally different manner. In particular show the commercial models both a higher syntactical complexity and more semantic heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose to align the representation of technical and commercial views on <b>product</b> <b>data</b> in <b>message</b> specifications. Our approach is based on the PLIB ontology, which was originally described in ISO 13584. We have evaluated our proposal by applying it to an industrial message specification for electronic catalogs, and can show that the novel approach reduces representational mismatches in B 2 B processes and simplifies systems integration in such scenarios...|$|R

It can be achieved when both the service consumer and service provider understand the exchanged <b>data</b> <b>message</b> in the same way. Therefore, the specification of the semantics of <b>data</b> <b>message</b> needs to be explicitly defined in the service specification. Six requirements for specifying the semantics of <b>data</b> <b>message</b> are formulated based on the data modeling approach. DEMO is selected to be the methodology for representing the semantics of <b>data</b> <b>message.</b> Since one of the requirements is not completely fulfilled by DEMO; DEMO is extended by using ORM.

40|$|Abstractâ€”For {{multimedia}} <b>data</b> <b>message</b> transmissions in wire-less multihop networks {{composed of}} wireless links with lower throughput, transmission capacity is reserved in wireless links included {{in one of}} wireless multihop transmission routes from a source node Ns to a destination node Nd. For reservation of transmission capacity required for applications, a method for achieving the maximum <b>data</b> <b>message</b> flow from N s to Nd is required. For wired multihop networks, the labeling method has been proposed. However, in wireless multihop networks, since message transmission between neighbor nodes is realized by broadcast transmission of wireless signal, capacity of a wireless link is effected by <b>data</b> <b>message</b> transmissions by neighbor nodes due to the hidden-terminal and exposed-terminal problems. Thus, this paper proposes an extended labeling method based on a novel wireless network model for the maximum <b>data</b> <b>message</b> flow in wireless multihop networks and according to novel conditions for a wireless multihop transmission route {{to increase the amount}} of <b>data</b> <b>message</b> flow from Ns to Nd...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{wireless}} sensor networks, sensor <b>data</b> <b>messages</b> {{are required}} to be transmitted along a wireless multihop transmission route with shorter delay. For avoidance of corruption of sensor <b>data</b> <b>messages,</b> the RTS/CTS control is introduced in wireless LAN protocols which solves the hidden terminal problem among 2 -hop neighbor wireless nodes. However, it causes additional transmission delay and various methods have been proposed to apply the RTS/CTS control conditionally. This paper proposes introduction of directional intermediate sensor nodes distributed sparsely in the sensor networks. Directional sensor nodes with directional antennas for space-division multiplexing reduces interferences among sensor nodes. It results in conditional omissions of the RTS/CTS control without collisions of <b>data</b> <b>message</b> transmissions among 1 - and 2 -hop neighbor nodes. Thus, it is expected for sensor <b>data</b> <b>message</b> transmissions to reduce transmission delay without additional losses of them. ...|$|R

In this paper, to improve the <b>data</b> <b>message</b> delay without degrading the voice packet loss probability, we propose the DRMA with multiple slots reservation as the proposed- 1 DRMA. We also propose the DRMA with multiple slots reservation and retransmission algorithm using exponential backoff scheme as the proposed- 2 DRMA to further improve the <b>data</b> <b>message</b> delay. By the performance evaluation using computer simulations, weshow that the proposed schemes reduce the <b>data</b> <b>message</b> delay without degrading the voice packet loss probability comparing to the conventional DRMA. 1.

A <b>product</b> <b>data</b> model is also proposed for the propagation procedure, which integrates base product definitions for product design, and <b>product</b> <b>data</b> views for other manufacturing or customer support. The <b>product</b> <b>data</b> view in the proposed model enables manufacturing or customer support engineers to define their own <b>product</b> <b>data</b> views, without copying the existing product definition. Integrated with other components, the engineering changes in the data model provide structure-oriented change history, effectivity management for production, and integration with product configurations. Based on the integrated <b>product</b> <b>data</b> model, the proposed procedure propagates engineering changes to <b>product</b> <b>data</b> views using the history of product structure changes. The propagation procedure maintains consistency of <b>product</b> <b>data</b> during collaboration between various design, manufacturing and customer support departments, who have different <b>product</b> <b>data</b> views.

30|$|All {{protocols}} {{considered in}} this evaluation require {{that a certain}} overhead is added into beacons or <b>data</b> <b>messages</b> in order to guarantee their proper functioning. Such overhead is generally translated into a fixed number of bytes which correspond to extra fields appended to either beacon or <b>data</b> <b>messages.</b> However, both AMD and UV-CAST resort to appending a message list with variable length to beacons {{in order to prevent}} that repeated messages are unnecessarily disseminated in the network. In particular, AMD also includes a small variable list in <b>data</b> <b>messages</b> to guarantee that the order of rebroadcast in the neighborhood is achieved. Therefore, in this last section, we measure the message overhead required by these two protocols when increasing network densities are considered.|$|R

At the same time, key middleware technologies supporting the application of <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing in the AEC industry have received limited testing. The research reported in this thesis addresses these two gaps in <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing research. It examines the application of key <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing technologies in practice in order to identify gaps in those technologies or provide further evidence of their suitability. It also assesses the use of <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing in improving the performance of construction organisations. A case study of the application of <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing in practice was conducted. It examined the use of <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing in improving the performance of a partnering arrangement in the development of wastewater treatment plants. It dealt with: (i) the documentation and analysis of the current practice followed by the arrangement; (ii) the use of <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing in improving the performance of the arrangement; and (iii) the assessment of the achieved improvement. The main contributions of the research reported in this thesis are: (i) it identifies shortcomings in the Industry Foundation Classes and the need for further research in distributed <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing architectures; (ii) it provides evidence for some business benefits of <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing, {{while at the same time}} finds conflicting evidence for benefits reported in the literature; (iii) it suggests a change notification/propagation scheme for <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing environments; and (iv) it examines and demonstrates the application of <b>product</b> <b>data</b> sharing in the wastewater treatment sector.
