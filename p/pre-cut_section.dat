25|$|The three INLA men {{rushed through}} the {{turnstile}} leading to A wing's exercise yard. Peeling away a <b>pre-cut</b> <b>section</b> of wire fence, they {{climbed onto the}} roof of A wing and dropped into the forecourt where the Renault van containing Wright had just started to move forward towards the exit gates. The van was ordered to stop by the armed INLA men, however, the driver, John Park, thinking {{that he and the}} other officer were about to be taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were automatically shut. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The van was ten feet away from the gates when it came to a halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the van was armed.|$|E
50|$|A log {{splitter}} {{is a piece}} of machinery or equipment used for splitting firewood from softwood or hardwood logs that have been <b>pre-cut</b> into <b>sections</b> (rounds), usually by chainsaw or on a saw bench. Many {{log splitter}}s consist of a hydraulic or electrical rod and piston assembly and these are often rated by the tons of force they can generate. The higher the pressure rating, the greater the thickness or length of the rounds that can be split. The log splitter consists of all four major hydraulic components.|$|R
50|$|Log {{splitting}} is {{the act of}} splitting firewood from logs {{that have}} been <b>pre-cut</b> into <b>sections</b> (rounds, bolts, billets). This {{can be done by}} hand, using an axe or maul, or by using a mechanical log splitter. When splitting a log by hand, it is best to aim for the cracks (called checks), if there are any visible. Some types of wood are harder to split than others, including extremely hard woods, as well as types like gum which an axe will often bounce off of, and cherry, which is typically so twisted it's near impossible to get a clean split, and elm. Any type of wood, being thick or tall, having large knots or twisted grain can make it difficult to split. In some cases, it is easiest to aim for the edges and split the log into multiple pieces. Batoning is splitting small pieces of wood for kindling or other purposes sometimes with a batoning chisel, a special chisel with one sharp side used for splitting.|$|R
