A major issue is how to manage productrelated information when it is created and stored on computer systems of multiple companies.

In this paper, we emphasize the similarities between OOP and product agent based information management models for handling product information. The well-known OOP concept of design patterns is shown to be applicable also to managing product information in supplier networks. The composite and observer design patterns are applied to two typical information management tasks using product agents.
