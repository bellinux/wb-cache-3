40|$|Objective: The goal of Critical Incident Reporting Systems (CIRS) is {{to reduce}} the sources for errors, before a real {{accident}} has happened. Each radiation therapy department should have such a system. Art. 27 of the Swiss ordinance for accelerators also demand to report such cases. The idea is to share the knowledge about weak points in the structure of radiation therapy within the Swiss radiation therapy community. Material and Methods: A combined working group from SASRO and SGSMP define in collaboration with the Federal Office of <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> <b>rules</b> and the minimal content of a national CIRS database for radiation therapy called ROSIS_CH. Results: A national CRIS with anonymous inputs will be available. The translation of free text in the different languages is a difficult but important task to avoid speculations about the source of data. Conclusion: Local expandable databases will be distributed to all Swiss radiation therapy institutes. Inputs should be possible in the local language Over internet {{it will be possible to}} synchronise ROSIS_CH with the local database...|$|E
40|$|Collective {{motion in}} animal groups {{manifests itself in}} the form of highly coordinated {{maneuvers}} determined by local interactions among individuals. A particularly critical question in understanding the mechanisms behind such interactions is to detect and classify leader–follower relationships within the group. In the technical literature of coupled dynamical systems, several methods have been proposed to reconstruct interaction networks, including linear correlation analysis, transfer entropy, and event synchronization. While these analyses have been helpful in reconstructing network models from neuroscience to <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> <b>rules</b> on the most appropriate method to use for a specific dataset are lacking. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of detecting leaders in a group from raw positional data in a model-free approach that combines multiple methods in a maximum likelihood sense. We test our framework on synthetic data of groups of self-propelled Vicsek particles, where a single agent acts as a leader and both the size of the interaction region and the level of inherent noise are systematically varied. To assess the feasibility of detecting leaders in real-world applications, we study a synthetic dataset of fish shoaling, generated by using a recent data-driven model for social behavior, and an experimental dataset of pharmacologically treated zebrafish. Not only does our approach offer a robust strategy to detect leaders in synthetic data but it also allows for exploring the role of psychoactive compounds on leader–follower relationships...|$|E
40|$|Most {{people think}} of {{preemption}} as a technical constitutional doctrine, but it is pivotally important to health and safety, while also {{opening the door to}} broad judicial discretion. The Rehnquist and Roberts Courts’ pro-business/pro-preemption jurisprudence is distinctly antiregulatory, invalidating major state <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>rules,</b> such as in occupational safety, tobacco control, and motor vehicle safety. Apart from the antiregulatory effects, there is maddening inconsistency. Consider three relatively recent Supreme Court cases. In Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc. (2008), the Court held that federal law bars injured consumers from challenging the safety or effectiveness of FDA-approved medical devices. A year later, in Wyeth v. Levine, the Court came to the opposite conclusion, ruling that injured consumers could sue pharmaceutical companies for failing to warn about the risks of taking brand-name drugs. On June 23, 2011 in PLIVA, Inc v. Mensing, the Court found that injured consumers could not bring failure-to-warn claims for injuries caused by FDA-approved generic pharmaceuticals. Thus, in less than four years, the Court barred state health and safety litigation for FDA-approved medical devices, allowed failure-to-warn claims for branded pharmaceuticals, and then barred those claims for generic pharmaceuticals. What is the rational basis for treating branded and generic medicines differently even though, by law, the products must be equivalent? Or treating branded drugs and medical devices differently even though they go through similar approval processes? As Justice Sotomayor (dissenting in PLIVA) put it, this “leads to so many absurd consequences that I cannot fathom that Congress would have intended to preempt state law,” while even Justice Thomas writing for the Court admitted this outcome “makes little sense. ” This article examines the Supreme Court’s perversion of the preemption doctrine, the newest ruling on generic medicines, and the public health value of litigation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In 2003, 11 <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists {{were placed}} in North Carolina's largest {{hospitals}} to enhance communication between <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies and healthcare systems for improved emergency preparedness. We describe the specific services <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists provide to local health departments, the North Carolina Division of <b>Public</b> <b>Health,</b> and the hospitals {{in which they are}} based, and assess the value of these services to stakeholders. Methods We surveyed and/or interviewed <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists, communicable disease nurses based at local health departments, North Carolina Division of <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> staff, and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists' hospital supervisors to 1) elicit the services provided by <b>public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists in daily practice and during emergencies and 2) examine the value of these services. Interviews were transcribed and imported into ATLAS. ti for coding and analysis. Descriptive analyses were performed on quantitative survey data. Results <b>Public</b> <b>health</b> epidemiologists conduct syndromic surveillance of community-acquired infections and potential bioterrorism events, assist local health departments and the North Carolina Division of <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> with <b>public</b> <b>health</b> investigations, educate clinicians on diseases of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> importance, and enhance communication between hospitals and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies.

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>health</b> {{workers have}} always been the most im-portant {{component}} of <b>public</b> <b>health’s</b> infrastructure, yet attention to the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workforce has seldom been a priority of policy makers, national <b>public</b> <b>health</b> organizations, academic institutions, or even federal, state, and local <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies.

National <b>public</b> <b>health</b> leadership development programs, including the Na-tional <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> Leadership Institute, serve top-level leaders of state and local <b>public</b> <b>health</b> agencies. 1 State and regional <b>public</b> <b>health</b> leadership efforts often replicate this approach by serving top- and midlevel professionals a little closer to home. Books that focus on <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workers generally, including two ex-cellent works recently produced by the Pfizer Pharma-ceutical Group, highlight the careers of leading pub-lic health figures, virtually all of whom have master’s and doctoral-level degrees. 2, 3 It is likely that the only national initiative to recognize <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workers through a <b>public</b> <b>health</b> credential will require comple-tion of master’s-level training in <b>public</b> <b>health</b> to sit for the examination. These examples argue that when the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workforce has been in the spotlight the bright lights have been directed toward workers in leadership and professional occupational categories, such as pub-lic health nurses, environmental health practitioners, health educators, and epidemiologists. While these are critical components of the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workforce, there are several hundred thousand other <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workers in less visible and celebrated occupational categories left in the shadows with little attention...|$|R
