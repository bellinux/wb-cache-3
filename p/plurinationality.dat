Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa defined plurinationalism as the coexistence of several different nationalities within a larger state where different peoples, cultures and worldviews exist and are recognized. [...] In plurinationalism, the idea of nationality is plural, meaning there are many nationals within an organized community or body of peoples. Derived from this concept, a plurinational state is the existence of multiple political communities and constitutional asymmetry. The usage of <b>plurinationality</b> assists in avoiding the division of societies within a state or country. Furthermore, a plurinational democracy recognizes the multiple demoi (common people or populace) within a polity.|$|E
50|$|Since 2005 CONAIE {{has been}} {{focusing}} less on drastic activism movements {{and more on}} policy making and attempting to reach a greater audience in order to educate and spread their platform of environmental use awareness, <b>plurinationality,</b> indigenismo, and multiculturalism. In 2009 CONAIE {{announced that it would}} be striking and putting up road blocks in order to protest laws that were to be passed by the government dealing with water management, but also to protest old laws dealing with environment. Unfortunately the protests were not as well organized as they had been previously and did not effectively change any laws or garner much attention in the media.|$|E
50|$|The Rights of Nature is {{significant}} {{as it is}} the first case where this concept has been evoked at the national level. The articles set out a rights-based system that recognizes Nature, or Pachamama, as a right-bearing entity that holds value in itself, apart from human use. This differs from traditional systems that see nature as property, giving landowners the right to damage or destroy ecosystems that depend on their land. The rights-based approach spelled out in the Rights of Nature expands on previous laws for regulation and conservation by recognizing that nature has fundamental and inalienable rights as a valuable entity in and of itself. The system also assigns liability for damage to the environment and holds the government responsible for the reparation of any damage. Additionally, if an ecosystem's rights are violated, it gives people the authority to petition on behalf of the ecosystem to ensure that its interests are not subverted to the interests of individuals or corporations. The inclusion of the Rights of Nature also makes the constitution more democratic and inclusive, as it reflects the indigenes' idea of Nature as a mother that must be respected and celebrated. This is the first constitution that has incorporated indigenous concepts of sumak kawsay and Pachamama, as well as recognized the <b>plurinationality</b> of Ecuador. This has broad significance for the recognition of indigenous groups and their right to preserve their land and culture. The combination of human rights with the rights of nature will allow for more effective protection of indigenous communities. The Rights of Nature also transforms the relationship between nature and humans by asserting that nature is not just an object. By putting ecosystems on an equal footing with humans, the conception of humans as masters or as separate from nature is dismissed. Instead, this system celebrates nature and recognizes that humans are a part of it. The Rights of Nature are further incorporated in the updated National Plan for Good Living, which states guaranteeing the Rights of Nature and promoting a healthy and sustainable environment as one of its twelve objectives. Policies under the objective include aims to preserve and manage biodiversity, diversify the national energy matrix with renewable sources, prevent, control and mitigate environmental damage, promote adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, and incorporate environmental approach in all public policies.|$|E
40|$|This article {{have tried}} to {{take a close look}} at the (re) {{construction}} of identity among the indigenous populations with regards to State discourses and practices in the Ecuadorian Buen Vivir and the Bolivian Vivir Bien. By way of methodology of discourse analysis, I attempt to shed light on the progressive homogenization of indigenous diversity within a model of the «ideal indigenous person», which serves economic development policies that, far from reaching true <b>plurinationality,</b> seem to continue with patterns of the tutelage and displacement that started with the era of colonization...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: Este artículo tiene como objetivo reflexionar sobre las relaciones políticas establecidas entre el Estado y los pueblos y las nacionalidades indígenas en el Ecuador durante el proceso de democratización del país, desde la transición a la democracia a finales de los años setenta hasta el reconocimiento de La plurinacionalidad en la nueva Constitución de 2008. El estudio se plantea en tres momentos diferentes: 1) el inicio del período democrático en la década de los ochenta; 2) la irrupción de los indígenas en los años noventa y la respuesta estatal en base al modelo {{multicultural}} de ciudadanía étnica; y 3) la contienda política entre la principal organización indígena del país, la CONAIE y el Gobierno de Rafael Correa en el marco de la constitucionalización del Estado plurinacional. Por último, se pretende problematizar sobre la plurinacionalidad y sobre el sentido que a tal término le dan los distintos actores. Abstract: The aim of {{this article}} is to reflect on the political relations established between the State and the indigenous peoples and nationalities in Ecuador during the process of democratization of the country, since the transition to democracy in the late 1970 s until the recognition of the <b>plurinationality</b> in the new Constitution of 2008. The study is structured in three different times: 1) the initiation of the democratic period in the 1980 s; (2) the emergence of indigenous people in the 1990 s and the state answer based on the multicultural model of ethnic citizenship; and (3) the political struggle between the main indigenous organization of the country, CONAIE, and the government of Rafael Correa as a result of the constitutionalization of the plurinational State. At last, we try to discuss about <b>plurinationality</b> and the meaning of this term for different actors. </p...|$|E
40|$|In 2008, the Republic of Ecuador {{created a}} new Constitution with a {{particularly}} salient feature: <b>Plurinationality.</b> Given the discursive trends across Latin America toward a politics of multiculturalism, this research {{is an attempt to}} understand the significance of cultural representations in relationship to multiculturalism. More specifically, this research focuses on ‘traditional’ Afro-Ecuadorian artists in Esmeraldas City, Ecuador, and their positionality in relationship to broader Ecuadoran society. The first section of the article focuses on the theoretical contextualization of the research: a discussion of the emergence of plurinationalism and the underlying assumptions of racial democracy that it evokes. The second half of the article incorporates the voices of many artists, musicians, academics, and activists to form an understanding {{of the ways in which}} they are part of the construction of Afro-descendant identity in Ecuador today...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} XX century, {{news and}} diffuse law speeches will {{pointing}} the emergence of innovative theoretical models self-proclaimed “critical”. In Brazil, in this context, is inaugurated an innovative and revolutionary face of constitutionalism which expands {{the power of the}} judiciary, for the preservation of democratic order and fundamental rights. On this track changes a new feature is the extensive social rights catalog that redefines the hermeneutic field, hitherto of modern formal legalistic tradition. However, the desire to consolidate and ensure both institutional and cultural fundamental rights, is being wit- nessing the first decade of XX century in Brazil as well as in some Latin American coun- tries, expanding the field of democratization and social policies. In this context, while it is being implemented a new constitutional paradigm from <b>plurinationality,</b> demodiversity and new rights linked to rationality, there is the expansion {{of the role of the}} judiciary which ultimately provoque a distortion of jurisdiction and hermeneutic fundamentals that serves as its legitimacy. It is from this unprecedented complexity that since Mark of the tradition of critical thinking, the juridical thinkers are forced to rethink hermeneutics from a new logic, new foundations and new epistemological elements, shifting the her- meneutical question to a different dimension than have been given by modern rationality and beyond what was bequeathed to the positivist tradition: the external field of norma- tive valuation. Challenge between oscillations and divergences can not be overlooked...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} years of the 21 st century, the Ecuadorian {{indigenous}} movement, classified as the most overwhelming social actor since its emergence in the mid 1980 s, finds itself in crises, with its principal organizations marked by tensions and conflicts. With a departure in the fragmentation of the indigenous movement, the context of the study is the impact of issues related to the concepts of class and ethnicity. In order to achieve a deeper understanding of the topic, the approach is based on a comparative study of different historical periods. The theoretical part of the study mainly focuses on analysing the concept of social movement in relation to indigenous movement. By comparing different periods, the study seeks to demonstrate that the inter-relationship between class and ethnicity has changed due to the context. For example, the revival of once-impotent leftist parties and movements has altered the relations of power and the incentives that strucktured past linkages between the indigenous movement and the political left. Thus, due to the meteoric rise of Rafael Correa and his radical political project, the indigenous movement is confronted with a new kind of challenge. In this context, the concepts of <b>plurinationality</b> and interculturality have emerged and further polarized the positions both between the left and the indigenous movement and between the two indigenous organizations: CONAIE and FENOCIN. In light of these aspects, the ambition of this study is to emphasize the importance of highlightning the concepts of class and ethnicity, when analysing the cause of the current fragmentation of the indigenous movement in Ecuador...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Since {{the late}} twentieth century, the "indigenous question" has conquered quotas of debate among the Mexican people never achieved. Both public opinion and state {{institutions}} began to be permeable {{to the demands of}} some indigenous peoples marginalized from economic, cultural and political forces since the Spanish Conquest. Thus, the Mexican-Indian duo that had been consecrated as an unfair and unequal relationship for centuries seems to react to a twenty-first century that has opened many opportunities for the understanding and the formation of a new, more equitable and plural Mexican state. The purpose of this work is the analysis of the issues considered "indigenous" in the Mexican nation, from the Spanish Conquest to the present day as well as the establishment of the great landmarks in the pro-indigenous struggle in the twentieth century. We´ll find three historical currents of thought about the indigenous, linked to historical periods: the pre-institutional indigenism, which rooted in the Spanish colonization, influenced by medieval Catholicism, paternalism, segregation, and the economic interests of Europeans; the post-revolutionary indigenism, from which emerges the modern Mexican state and the claim for social justice; and finally, the neoindigenism, more tolerant and democratic, that finally accepts the construction of a Mexican state that looks, understands and defends the diversity. We also expose an historical context divided in three stages: one from the colonization of Mexico {{to the end of the}} “Porfiriato”; one from the Mexican Revolution to 1970, with the celebration of the “Patzcuaro” Congress and the birth of the National Indian Institute; and finally, the last 40 years, including the creation of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, the Law for Dialogue and Reconciliation in Chiapas, the Commission of Concord and peacemaking and the San Andres Accords, keys to understanding the indigenous question today. Most of the sources i have consulted agree in one thing: there is a lot of work ahead to make a new mexican state, one who undertakes and protects his <b>plurinationality.</b> Finally, I would like to mention the assistance of Eloy Gomez Pellón, director of this work, without whose supervision this work would not have been possible.
