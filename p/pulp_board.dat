40|$|A {{new type}} of bamboo fiber-reinforced {{polypropylene}} (PP) composite was prepared and its mechanical properties were tested. To enhance the adhesion between the bamboo fiber and the polypropylene matrix, maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene (MAPP) was prepared and used as a compatibilizer for the composite. The maleic anhydride content of the MAPP was 0. 5 wt %. It was found that with 24 wt % of such MAPP {{being used in the}} composite formulation, the mechanical properties of the composite such as the tensile modulus, the tensile strength, and the impact strength all increased significantly.

40|$|A {{new type}} of natural fiber {{reinforced}} composite was prepared and characterized. The reinforcement was bamboo fiber and the polymer matrix was polypropylene (PP). The bamboo tube was first machined into culms, then milled, and finally separated by Endecotts test sieves. In order to enhance the bonding between the bamboo fiber and the matrix, maleated polypropylene (MAPP) was prepared by a grafting reaction between maleic anhydride and PP in solution. The composites were prepared with the dried bamboo fiber, the control PP, and MAPP. The composition of MAPP varied from 10 - 50 wt. % while the total ratio of bamboo and polymer, both control PP and MAPP, was kept to about 50 : 50. It {{was found that the}} tensile strength of MAPP enhanced composites was about 26 - 36 MPa, whereas the tensile strength of the composites without MAPP was found around 15 MPa. Other effects on the mechanical properties were also discussed in this thesis, such effects are bamboo fraction, the size of bamboo fiber, the content of maleic anhydride, and the mixing condition. It is always the most important factor to a successful design of any engineering composite materials that adhesion between the reinforcement and the polymer matrix should be enhanced. In this study, the maleated PP was adopted as the compatibilizer. In order to understand better the enhancement mechanism, the morphology of the bamboo fiber reinforced composite was also studied. The crystallization behavior of the control PP and MAPP on the bamboo fiber was studied by means of polarized optical microscope. The bamboo induced MAPP transcrystalline was found on the bamboo fiber surface, whereas such effect for pure PP is not significant. The interfacial morphology of the bamboo fiber reinforced polypropylene (BFRP) composites was studied by using scanning electron microscope, x-ray diffractometer, and optical microscrope. Furthermore, the crystallization kinetics was studied by DSC. β-crystalline phase was found in all the BFRP composites, however, such crystalline phase was not found in the pure PP and maleated PP. The crystallization temperature increased with the addition of bamboo fiber. The composites were prepared by means of hot press. The BFRP composites were compared to the commercial wood <b>pulp</b> <b>board</b> produced by compounding, and it is found that the tensile strength of the new composites is four times higher than that of the commercial product, while other mechanical properties, such as the modulus, the yield strength, the impact strength are all comparable to those of commercial product...|$|E

This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the production of <b>pulp,</b> paper and <b>board</b> covers the activities specified in Sections 6. 1 (a) and 6. 1 (b) of Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU, i. e. the integrated and non-integrated production in industrial installations of: (a) pulp from timber or other fibrous materials; (b) paper or cardboard with a production capacity exceeding 20 tonnes per day. In particular, this document covers the following processes and activities: -	chemical pulping: (a) kraft (sulphate) pulping process (b) sulphite pulping process -	mechanical and chemimechanical pulping -	processing paper for recycling with and without deinking -	papermaking and related processes -	all recovery boilers and lime kilns operated in pulp and paper mills. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the <b>pulp,</b> paper and <b>board</b> industry are the emissions to air of nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, dust, total reduced sulphur and ammonia; emissions to water of organic carbon, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus and adsorbable organically bound halogens. The BREF contains nine chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the <b>pulp,</b> paper and <b>board</b> industry and on the common industrial processes and techniques used within the whole sector. Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 correspond to the following specific sectors: kraft (sulphate) pulping process, sulphite pulping process, mechanical and chemimechanical pulping, processing of paper for recycling with and without deinking, and papermaking and related processes. For each sector, these five chapters provide information and data concerning the applied processes and techniques; the environmental performance of installations in terms of current emissions, consumption of raw materials, water and energy, and generation of waste; the techniques to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of installations; and the emerging techniques.

30|$|The {{share of}} sea {{logistics}} rates is over 50 % {{of the total}} transport costs and when adding port-handling as sea bound costs, the maritime transport costs are between 70 and 80 % of total transport costs. Our study highlights the complexity of export logistic because there are several critical and moving components. These separate logistics sections must be integrated seamlessly to avoid disruption in deliveries. As a summary, this paper reminds that at manufacturing sites located far from the markets, logistics is a daily concern. Paper industry (including <b>pulp</b> and <b>board)</b> is highly important for Nordic countries giving work {{for hundreds of thousands}} of people. Therefore, logistics, among other factors (Porter 1990), is an extremely important factor from the perspective of national competitive position. Obviously, Nordic paper mills have succeeded to solve this logistics puzzle in an excellent way, because the Nordic countries still produce and export a relatively large share of forest industry products consumed in Europe.|$|R

30|$|There {{are many}} methods {{to improve the}} use of woody biomass: firewood, wood chip, and pellet for energy use, <b>pulp,</b> and <b>board</b> {{manufacture}} for material use. Among these, wood chips are used in many ways such as paper, fuels, and board manufacture. Maniwa has been engaged in various efforts to promote woody biomass utilization since 2006. In particular, Maniwa wood chip collection facilities (wood chip facilities) have been constructed to promote wood chip industry using woody biomass resources in Maniwa in 2006 – 2009. Now, 2 wood chip facilities are operated: one by Maniwa lumber business cooperative association (lumber cooperation), and the other by Forestry cooperative association (forestry cooperation). The wood chip facility of lumber cooperation uses both logging residues and sawmills waste to manufacture paper chip and board chip, and logging residues for wood chip for fuel are produced by Forestry cooperation.

Especially, wood chips for fuel are used in public facilities, manufacturing factories, and general offices in the city as fuel of the boiler.|$|R
30|$|Lignocellulosic biomass, {{composed}} of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, represents a {{potential source of}} fermentable sugars {{for the production of}} fuels and bulk chemicals (Wyman and Goodman 1993; Hahn-Hägerdal et al. 2006). In ethanol plants, the heat pretreated biomass is hydrolysed and all sugars are potential substrates for ethanol production (recently reviewed by (Alvira et al. 2010)). In pulp and paper mills, however, the cellulose fraction can be used for the production of <b>pulp,</b> paper, <b>board</b> and cellulose-based products. This requires treating wood biomass with a cooking liquor to obtain the discrete fibres. During the process, the monomeric sugars from the hemicellulose fraction are also released into the cooking liquor during the delignification process (Biermann 1996). When the generated cellulose pulp is removed from the cooking liquor, the resulting by-product stream (e.g. spent sulfite liquor (SSL) when using sulfite-based liquor), that contains the remaining monomeric sugars, can be used for the production of ethanol as a co-product (see e.g. (Borregaard (2012); Domsjö Fabriker AB (2012))). In both types of industrial processes, baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is traditionally chosen for ethanol production due to its high tolerance towards high concentrations of sugars and ethanol (Rudolf et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate those economic considerations that may limit the ability of the Pacific Northwest's pulp and paper industry to compete with other regions producing <b>pulp,</b> paper and <b>board</b> for world markets. The share of the Pacific Northwest and the United States in world trade of <b>pulp,</b> paper and <b>board,</b> together with products exported and their destinations, are presented first. A review of the literature on demand analyses for paper and board provided a framework for specifying a demand equation. However, more insight into phenomena of substitution threatening export or domestic demand for paper and board was gained by gathering information of increased exports of chips from the Pacific Northwest, greater use of hardwood pulp, recycling of waste paper and the development of synthetic fibers and papers. The extent to which <b>pulp,</b> paper and <b>board</b> products from the Pacific Northwest are differentiated on the basis of the wood species used was also considered. Comparison of the competitive advantage of the Pacific Northwest, Finland, Sweden, the Southern United States and East and West Canada showed that the Pacific Northwest has a competitive advantage [...] defined as the difference between the C. I. F. price and total cost (production plus transportation costs) [...] in the shipment of kraft linerboard to Japan and, if economies of scale are achieved, to Europe also. The same results would be obtained for bleached kraft pulp and newsprint. Planned investments for the period 1969 to 1974 in several regions of the world were presented to see whether or not this additional information would confirm the results of the comparison of competitive advantage, assuming that investment will be attracted where competitive advantage is the greatest. It appears that in the immediate future the United States will have a lower rate of growth than other regions of the world, and that the Pacific Northwest will attract less investment than the rest of the United States. The discrepancy between the results of the study of competitive advantage and the location of planned investments was explained by the cost differential existing between the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia and the low profitability in the pulp and paper industry due to world excess capacity. This excess capacity was verified by comparing estimates of world consumption and production capacities for all pulp grades from 1971 to 1975, and for kraft linerboard from 1971 to 1973. In order to obtain a better framework for specifying an econometric model, and also to relate its implications to the existing behavior of the industry, a review of marketing practices was undertaken. This showed that the major producers have some ability to control price by reducing production, that product differentiation exists based on brands and that integration is frequent between producer and foreign customers through the purchase of foreign subsidiaries. A quarterly econometric model from 1961 to 1969 was developed explaining prices and exports of kraft linerboard from Sweden and the United States to Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as price and quantities demanded in the US market. This product and these countries were selected because kraft linerboard is the major US <b>pulp,</b> paper and <b>board</b> export commodity and the countries considered are the two largest exporters and the two largest importers of this product in the world. The model was useful from two standpoints: (1) it provided information for planning regional marketing strategies, such as investment planning in the Pacific Northwest, and for determining effects of tariff, cost factors and freight increases on price and quantities traded, and (2) it was able to forecast prices and quantities demanded in the US domestic market and international trade flows. Finally, implications of the study are summarized for the building of econometric models and for pulp and paper export prospects of the Pacific Northwest. Also, some important steps to consider in the planning of marketing strategy are pinpointed...|$|R

Copper {{is one of the}} most widely used heavy metals. Copper and its compounds are extensively used in various important industrial applications such as electrical wiring, plumbing, gear wheel, air conditioning tubing, and roofing (Chowdhury and Saha 2011). Its potential sources in industrial effluents include metal cleaning and plating baths, fertilizer, refineries, <b>pulp,</b> paper <b>board</b> mills, printed circuit <b>board</b> production, wood <b>pulp</b> production, wood preservatives, paints and pigments, municipal and storm water run-off, etc. (Chowdhury and Saha 2011). Intake of excessively large doses of copper by human beings leads to severe mucosal irritation and corrosion, stomach upset and ulcer, wide spread capillary damage, hepatic and renal damage, central nervous system irritation followed by depression, gastrointestinal irritation, and possible necrotic changes in the liver and kidney (Yao et al. 2010). Chronic copper poisoning can also result in Wilson’s disease leading to brain and liver damage (Jaman et al. 2009). Therefore, removal of copper from effluents is essential not only to protect the water sources but also for the protection of human health.|$|R
