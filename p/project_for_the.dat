5|$|Abrahams Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when the creek floods over Eighth Street.

The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E

Khondji shot Evita using Moviecam cameras, with Cooke anamorphic lenses. He used Eastman EXR 5245 film stock for exteriors in Argentina, 5293 for the Argentinean interiors, and 5248 for any scenes shot during overcast days and combat sequences.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, after Galveston {{was struck}} by a devastating hurricane, efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated. The {{following}} year, the discovery of oil at the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1-million improvement <b>project</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Houston Ship Channel. By 1910, the city's population had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a decade before.

5|$|After his {{graduation}} as {{an architect}} in 1878, Gaudí's first work was a set of lampposts for the Plaça Reial, the <b>project</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Girossi newsstands and the Mataró cooperative, which was his first important work. He received the request from the city council of Barcelona in February 1878, when he had graduated but not yet received his degree, which was sent from Madrid on 15 March of the same year. For this commission he designed two types of lampposts: one with six arms, of which two were installed in the Plaça Reial, and another with three, of which two were installed in the Pla del Palau, opposite the Civil Government. The lampposts were inaugurated during the Mercè festivities in 1879. Made of cast iron with a marble base, they have a decoration in which the caduceus of Mercury is prominent, symbol of commerce and emblem of Barcelona.|$|E

Ongoing negotiations with the Royal Moroccan Air Force for 20 F-20s were canceled; along with the small order by Bahrain. Later on, a bribery scandal would emerge from the attempts to market the F-20 to South Korea, leading to several Northrop managers resigning and the reprimanding of chief executive Thomas V. Jones, who retired in 1989.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a quarter}} of their funding went on {{repairing}} damage to Caltech buildings caused by their experiments, in June 1940 they submitted {{a report to the}} NAS in which they showed the feasibility of the <b>project</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of JATO and requested $100,000 to continue; they received $22,000. Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly irritated by their accidents and noise pollution, and were made to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It was here that JPL would be founded. Parsons and Forman's rocket experiments were the cover story of the August 1940 edition of Popular Mechanics, in which the pair discussed the prospect of rockets being able to ascend above Earth's atmosphere and orbit around it for research purposes, as well as reaching the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Antoni Gaudí {{started his}} {{professional}} career while still at university. To {{pay for his}} studies, {{he worked as a}} draughtsman for some of the most outstanding Barcelona architects of the time, such as Joan Martorell, Josep Fontserè, Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, Leandre Serrallach and Emili Sala Cortés. Gaudí had a long-standing relationship with Josep Fontserè, since his family was also from Riudoms and they had known each other for some time. Despite not having an architecture degree, Fontserè received the commission from the city council for the Parc de la Ciutadella development, carried out between 1873 and 1882. For this project, Gaudí {{was in charge of the}} design of the Park's entrance gate, the bandstand's balustrade and the water <b>project</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> monumental fountain, where he designed an artificial cave that showed his liking for nature and the organic touch he would give his architecture.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914, Beebe's {{pheasant}} monograph {{was essentially}} complete in manuscript. While the text was written by Beebe, the illustrations were provided by several artists: Robert Bruce Horsfall, who had accompanied Beebe on the expedition, painted the environmental scenes for the illustrations' backgrounds, while the pheasants themselves were painted by other artists including George Edward Lodge, Charles R. Knight, and Louis Agassiz Fuertes. Due to the elaborate nature of the book's color artwork, no American publisher was considered capable of reproducing it. The publisher which Beebe chose for his work was George Witherby and Sons of London, {{as a result of}} their success publishing the artwork of John James Audubon. The reproduction of the illustrations themselves was to be handled by several companies in Germany and Austria. Reproductions of the illustrations were in the process of being printed when World War I began, holding up the completion of the <b>project</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next four years.|$|E
