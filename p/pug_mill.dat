40|$|Many {{regional}} {{airports in}} Australia are constructed from marginal materials, which {{was appropriate for}} the aircraft operating {{at the time of}} their development. Since then, aircraft operating at regional airports across Australia has grown significantly. Also, the ability to close pavements for rehabilitation or upgrades works has significantly reduced across all airports. This has led to foamed bitumen stabilisation becoming a more attractive option for pavement improvement when compared to traditional methods of granular reconstruction, deep asphalt reconstruction or cement stabilisation. Three recent projects at Australian airports have utilised foamed bitumen stabilisation to achieve a range of goals. This technology has been employed insitu and exsitu. Exsitu works have utilised both on-and off-site <b>pug</b> <b>mills.</b> Foamed bitumen stabilisation has been employed to improve existing marginal pavement material as well as new fine crushed rock. The three recent projects have shown that almost any marginal material's properties can be significantly improved through foamed bitumen stabilisation and that foam stabilised layers make adequate temporary wearing surfaces for light aircraft traffic. Foamed bitumen stabilised material can be trafficked immediately after construction and is resistant to moisture during and after construction. In light of the significant regional airport upgrade demand in Australia in the coming years, foamed bitumen stabilisation is expected to gain popularity and may become the rehabilitation treatment of choice for Australian airports...|$|R
50|$|Thomas A. Bolling tried brickmaking from clay in the Farmville Basin in 1917. He used a <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> to make bricks {{from the}} clay. He had a plant on High Street.

50|$|The {{focus of}} the {{cultural}} centre is the pottery and {{it is for this}} that the centre has become best known. The clay for the pots is all acquired locally from different areas and until recently preparing the clay for use was a time consuming process, using only simple plaster beds. In 1994 the centre invested in a variety of new equipment such as a mixer, filter press and <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> which has reduced the preparation time from weeks to days.|$|E
5000|$|Ceramics pug mills, or {{commonly}} just [...] "pugs", are {{not used}} to grind or mix, rather they extrude clay bodies prior to shaping processes. Some can be fitted with a vacuum system that ensures the extruded clay bodies have no entrapped air. According to the 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary, a clay <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> typically consists of an upright shaft armed with projecting knives, which is caused to revolve in a hollow cylinder, tub, or vat, in which the clay body is placed.|$|E
40|$|Alumino-silicate {{fireclay}} material was {{found within the}} equatorial region of Ekiti state of Nigeria. From Ijero-Ekiti, fireclay samples were explored, exploited and developed into automobile brake pads. Eight samples were taken from 5 to 30 metres downward at various pits to prevent unwanted foreign materials. Specifically, these samples were examined and found to be characteristically homogeneous in physical, mechanical, mineralogical and chemical composition. 30 per cent of the unwanted foreign materials from the fireclay were technically removed with above 45 micron sieve using a wet sieving method. 70 per cent of the purified clay of less than 45 micron sieve was eventually used as beneficiated {{fireclay material}}. After the purification, sample clay obtained was finally calcined at 15000 C temperature for clay structural stability and prevention of excessive clay shrinkage. The refractory clay material was eventually made into various is batches using a mathematical model. Material composition fomula used was technically based on range of grain particle sizes (30 to 70 per cent) grog or calcined clay; and beneficiated clay {{range of particle sizes}} of 70 to 30 per cent as the binding agent respectively. Thereafter, batch material compositions were homogeneously mixed and properly wedge together in a <b>pugged</b> <b>mill</b> before they were hydraulically pressed with 1000 kg/mm 2 with a designed steel mould. Automobile brake pads made were characteristically tested and found suitable for light (Cars) vehicles usage 80 per cent efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} history of the brick-making {{industry}} along the Damariscotta River in coastal Maine and links that history to a vast industrial landscape that remains in evidence today. Although bricks had been made in this region since {{the time of the first}} European settlements, the scale of the industry did not achieve any significance until the second quarter of the nineteenth century. This corresponds precisely with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, a historical development that flooded eastern markets with cheap western foodstuffs and led to the increasing marginalization of struggling New England farmers. Unable to compete profitably with the rising agricultural behemoths in the west, these farmers diversified the sorts of incoming-generating activities that were practiced on farms. In the Damariscotta River region, this included the production of bricks for commercial sale. Although farmers in other parts of Maine and northern New England may have engaged in brick-making as a component of this same broad phenomenon, the practice has received very little scholarly attention to date. This intimate interrelationship with agriculture emerges in a close study of all aspects of the brickmaking industry. The technological means by which the bricks were made remained fairly technologically primitive throughout the nineteenth century, employing only a few simple "machines. " The low-technology aspect of Damariscotta River brick making ensured that it was also low-cost, a quality that made it particularly attractive to the farmers who would periodically adopt the activity as necessary as a means to supplement their incomes. Brick making as a regional business expanded and contracted regularly over the course of the nineteenth century, responding to the vicissitudes in the market and other external factors. At its peak, the Damariscotta River brick-making industry produced bricks that were shipped to ports up and down the eastern seaboard and into the Caribbean, although Boston always remained the principal destination. Throughout this period, Damariscotta River brick makers almost always identified themselves as farmers or had some other close relationship—usually familial—to farming. The industry disappeared around the turn of the twentieth century due to a number of converging factors, including the decline of shipping, the rising costs of raw materials, the growing mistrust between the brick makers and the agents who negotiated the sales, and the incompatibility of local clays with the more mechanized forms of brick making that produced a higher quality product. The existence of the historical Damariscotta River brick-making industry is most evident today in the form of a large, nearly contiguous industrial landscape that comprises dozens of former brickyard sites along the river banks. Although overgrown and somewhat difficult to distinguish from the seemingly pristine natural surroundings, each of these sites exhibits a range of landscape features that marks it as a former brickyard. These include former clay quarries, roads, imprints left by the <b>pug</b> <b>mills,</b> drying yards, log- or stone-lined wharves, and, most spectacularly, beaches lined with countless cast-off bricks. Some sites are even located adjacent to extant crop fields and pastures, and thereby illustrate spatially the industry's close relationship with agriculture. Such sites present an excellent potential for future efforts in preservation and interpretation. By providing the history for the industry and identifying the sites where its story can be told most effectively, this thesis can lead to the preservation of the memory of brick making in the Damariscotta River region...|$|R
50|$|Until the end {{of their}} useful life, the methods of {{production}} had not varied from Roman times, all the processes being carried out with no mechanisation or electrification. For example, the clay was always trodden by foot and not mixed in a <b>pug</b> <b>mill.</b> The wheel was turned by an assistant with a pole or handle, and the kilns were wood fired. For these reasons the Crossroads Pottery, then the last remaining in the area, attracted national and local newspaper attention in the early to mid 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Despite use of some modern {{equipment}} such as {{an electric}} kiln for firing some types of glazes and use of powered throwing wheels, he continued to use traditional methods such as digging his own clay, maintaining a mule to power his <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> and firing most of his work in a brick kiln. Other Brown family traditions {{include the use of}} a chicken feather to apply some of the glazing patterns, the use of broken pots for teeth in the face jugs, the practice of a two piece method for large vessels and the use of wheel and handshaping techniques for complex pieces instead of slip casting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stoneware}} clay that Norstad Pottery mixed {{was a combination}} of Kentucky ball clay, California fire clay, and grog- a sand like material. When fired the pieces vitrified into an extremely hard, dense, non-porous material. The mixture was thrown into an old commercial dough mixer with water and the finished batch turned out into plaster trays to age and lose moisture. The clay was then driven through a <b>pug</b> <b>mill,</b> which compresses it and extrudes long plugs of finished clay that is thrown into pots on a wheel. Some clay is rolled into slabs and draped over plaster molds. This treatment, called [...] "jiggering" [...] is a time honored method of producing many pots that are identical.|$|E
50|$|A pugmill or <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> is {{a machine}} in which clay or other {{materials}} are mixed {{into a plastic}} state or a similar machine for the trituration of ore. Industrial applications are found in pottery, bricks, cement and {{some parts of the}} concrete and asphalt mixing processes. A pugmill may be a fast continuous mixer. A continuous pugmill can achieve a thoroughly mixed, homogeneous mixture in a few seconds, and the right machines can be matched to the right application by taking into account the factors of agitation, drive assembly, inlet, discharge, cost and maintenance. Mixing materials at optimum moisture content requires the forced mixing action of the pugmill paddles, while soupy materials might be mixed in a drum mixer. A typical pugmill consists of a horizontal boxlike chamber with a top inlet and a bottom discharge at the other end, 2 shafts with opposing paddles, and a drive assembly. Some of the factors affecting mixing and residence time are the number {{and the size of the}} paddles, paddle swing arc, overlap of left and right swing arc, size of mixing chamber, length of pugmill floor, and material being mixed.|$|E
40|$|Research {{was done}} into {{identifying}} and sourcing the mechanical equipment required for manufacturing ceramic pot filters, specifically {{for use in}} the Pure Home Water factory in Northern Ghana. The pieces of equipment identified were a hammer mill, a mixer, a <b>pug</b> <b>mill,</b> and a mechanical press with molds for pressing the filters. Evaluative criteria for each machine were developed, and machines available from manufacturers and machines produced locally were evaluated based on these criteria. Several machines fit the evaluative criteria and were recommended for the Pure Home Water facility. The Meadows Model 5 hammer mill was recommended for purchase from the manufacturer. Of the mixers researched, the mixer made by RDI-C, the Bluebird 24 S mixer, and the mixer designed by Prof. Manny Hernandez all satisfy the requirements of Pure Home Water. The <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> recommended for Pure Home Water was the Venco 75 mm <b>pug</b> <b>mill.</b> The Mani Press and the paraboloid molds were also recommended for the Pure Home Water facility. by Julian Getachew.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} of this work is {{to evaluate the use}} of two mix design procedures for designing bituminous pavement mixes with foamed bitumen. Mix design was carried out following the South African and Caltrans guidelines. The RAP materials used for mix design were collected from the NH- 5, Chennai-Tada section. Using foamed bitumen produced from Wirtgen WLB 10 foaming equipment, a mix with RAP material, virgin aggregate and active filler were produced in the <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> mixer. Marshall compaction effort was used for fabricating the samples. Using the indirect tensile strength test on dry and wet specimens, the optimum binder content was determined. It was seen that the two mix design procedure adopted showed different mix constituents despite using the same RAP source...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. At present, {{the dynamic}} {{analysis}} for non-stationary stochastic noise of ceramic paste inner stress {{is a difficult}} problem because a non-stationary stochastic noise has a time variant model and dynamic characteristics. In this paper, dynamic analysis ability of Short Time Power Spectrum (STPS) was systematically studied and improved in accordance with theoretical research and simulation analysis. The pressure signals between ceramic paste and head inwall of vacuum <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> were studied so as to obtain {{the distribution of the}} ceramic paste inner stress. Experiments about the pressure signals had been carried out to verify the research result. Theoretical analysis and experimental result shows that: STPS with filtering performs well in analyzing non-stationary stochastic noise of ceramic paste inner stress in mutation situation. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study evaluates {{maintenance}} treatment followed by different Districts of New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT). In addition, two case {{studies on the}} use of old pavement materials, called the “millings”, in maintenance projects are reported. Based on this study, it is observed that none of the Districts have a written procedure for maintenance work. Rather Districts rely on the experience of the maintenance crew for conducting maintenance projects. All Districts prefer to use chip seal for maintenance irrespective of distress conditions of the pavements. Patching and crack sealing are usually done before chip sealing to extend the life of the chip seals. Sand seal, scrub seal, and slurry seal projects are not done by District maintenance crews but by outside contractors. It is also observed that all Districts are interested in using millings in maintenance projects and most have already used millings in at least one maintenance project with some success and failure. Most of the Districts have used coarse fraction of millings in chip seal projects successfully. However, they failed to find a proper way to process the fine fractions of millings. Case Study I shows that fine millings can be used to construct thin overlay when mixed with emulsion in <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> or hot drums. Case Study II concludes that fine millings can be used as fine/sand seal successfully following the same procedure and using the same equipment as chip seal...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} program {{was based on}} laboratory and field studies. All work {{was limited to the}} use of a 10 -mesh crumb rubber in the dry process. An evaluation of the asphalt-rubber interactions indicated {{that there should be a}} reasonable level of interaction between the crumb rubber and the asphalt cement selected for the project. A suggested criterion for defining an acceptable level of interaction would be to establish a minimum viscosity of 15 Poise (Brookfield viscosity) for a neat asphalt cement modified with 20 percent crumb rubber. When designing a crumb rubber modified mixture, the aggregate gradation should be substantially gapped. The target gradation used in the construction of the Babbit, Minnesota test sections should be considered as a guideline for an acceptable gapped gradation. Stockpile gradations should be adjusted for crumb rubber gradations volumetrically; generally, 1 gram of crumb rubber occupies the same volume as 3 grams of aggregate for a given sieve size. The optimum asphalt content for CRM mixtures should be based on air voids from 1. 5 to 3 percent. During construction, the crumb rubber (supplied in 50 Ibs. bags) should be added through the recycled asphalt (RAP) hopper (drum plant) or directly into the <b>pug</b> <b>mill</b> (batch plant). Laydown and compaction procedures should proceed as usual. Use of vibration on the rollers should be used at the discretion of the field engineer. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E
40|$|The Mulled Coal {{process is}} a {{technology}} which has evolved from a line of investigations {{which began in the}} 1970 `s. There was a major breakthrough in 1990, and since then, with significant support from DOE-PETC, the technology has progressed from the conceptual stage to a proven laboratory process. It is a simple process which involves the addition of a low cost specifically formulated reagent to wet fine coal by mixing the two in a <b>pug</b> <b>mill.</b> Although the converted material (Mulled Coal) retains some of its original surface moisture, it handles, transports, and stores like dry coal. But, unlike thermally dried fine coal Mulled Coal is not dusty, it will not rewet, and it causes no fugitive dust problems. This project was designed to advance the technology from the status of a process which works well in the laboratory to the status of a technology which is fully ready for commercialization. Project objectives were to: 1. Prove the concept that the technology can be used to produce Mulled Coal of a consistent quality, on a continuous basis, at a convincing rate of production, and at a major preparation plant which produces fine clean coal on a commercial basis. 2. Prove the concept that Mulled Coal, either as a blend with coarser clean coal or as a stand-alone fuel will successfully pass through a representative cross section of conventional coal storage, handling and transportation environments without causing any of the problems normally associated with wet fine coal. 3 Test the design and reliability of Mulled Coal circuit equipment and controls. 4. Test the circuit over a wide range of operating conditions. 5. Project scale-up designs for major equipment components and control circuits. 6. Forecast capital and operating costs for commercial circuits ranging from 25 TPH to 75 TPH. This report describes the work, the test results, and conclusions at each step along the way...|$|E
40|$|Life {{stock is}} the major sector of {{agriculture}} which is of great importance for Pakistan. It has a major contribution towards the economy of Pakistan with a 55. 9 participation in agriculture sector. Pakistan is fourth largest country in milk production with 50. 9 Billion tons per annum out of which only 5 is processed and pasteurized hardly and remaining milk is handled by milk men under non-hygienic conditions which causes milk borne diseases. Milk is perishable food having shelf life of few hours therefore milk processing is done to deactivate the microorganisms in the milk and increase its shelf life for future use. It is an energy intensive process and mostly conventional form of energy is used for this purpose. Solar power is the sustainable source of energy {{and there is an}} average solar global radiation of 5. 3 kWhm 2 day persist in the country with more than 300 sunny days in a year. The objective {{of the study was to}} design and develop a solar assisted milk pasteurizer and to evaluate its performance. The developed solar assisted milk pasteurizer consisted of heating and cooling unit. Heating unit made of shell and tube type coil to heat up the milk up-to 730 C for 15 seconds. Cooling unit has a chiller for sudden cool down the milk from 350 C to 40 C within 2 hours.
