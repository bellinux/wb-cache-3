We investigate protocols that incorporate the opportunistic relaying technique, which selects the best relay among the M available relays. We evaluate the asymptotic outage performance of incremental amplify-and-forward (IAF) {{when it is}} extended to the opportunistic relaying scenario. Moreover, we propose two new protocols, namely opportunistic incremental selection AF and opportunistic joint incremental selection relaying, and derive the corresponding asymptotic outage probabilities. Finally, we compare the analytical asymptotic outage probabilities and the simulated ones.

40|$|Routing {{protocols}} for mobile ad hoc networks can {{be classified}} into two categories: topological routing and geographic routing. Hybrid routing protocols that take advantage of both schemes have attracted {{a lot of attention}} recently. This article provides a systematic survey of these hybrid routing protocols. We first analyze the three types of routing information used in the hybrid routing protocols, namely, topological information, geographic information, and hierarchy information. Then, based on a review of the representative hybrid routing protocols, we summarize the three design options for hybrid routing protocols, namely, radius of the routing zone (1, k, or D), geographic information (position or position plus partition), and routing structure (flat or hierarchical). Finally, we propose a three-dimensional design framework that can accommodate well all of the existing hybrid routing protocols. The framework also helps find the unexplored design space, motivating the design of new hybrid routing <b>protocols.</b> <b>Department</b> of Computin...|$|R
40|$|Many {{athletes and}} spectators believe that {{experiencing}} and controlling psychological momentum {{is a critical}} component to achieving success in sport (Perreault, Vallerand, Montgomery, & Provencher, 1998; Stanimirovic & Hanrahan, 2004). Despite this, little is known regarding why some individuals perceive momentum differently than others. This {{study was designed to}} determine if optimistic thinking has a relationship with psychological momentum perceptions. Female Division I NCAA volleyball players (N = 68) completed the Life Orientation Test – Revised (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), the Sport Attributional Style Scale - Short (Hanrahan & Grove, 1990 b), and a psychological momentum survey. The results indicated that attributional style constructs intentionality and globality were significant predictors of psychological momentum perceptions. Also, participants had greater disagreement regarding the momentum value of early and late points in a set than those in between. Neither dispositional optimism nor sport-specific optimistic attributional style were correlated with psychological momentum perceptions. Future attempts to measure psychological momentum perceptions should consider a mixed methods approach along with more ecologically valid assessment <b>protocols.</b> <b>Department</b> of Psychological ScienceThesis (M.

40|$|Gossiping {{has been}} widely used for {{disseminating}} data in large scale networks. Existing works have mainly focused {{on the design of}} gossip-based protocols but few have been reported on developing models for analyzing the fault tolerance property of these protocols. In this paper, we propose a general gossiping algorithm and develop a mathematical model based on generalized random graphs for evaluating the reliability of gossiping, i. e., to what extent gossip-based protocols can tolerate node failures, yet guarantee the specified message delivery. We analytically derive the maximum ratio of failed nodes that can be tolerated without reducing the required degree of reliability. We also investigate the impact of the parameters, namely the fanout distribution and the nonfailed member ratio, on the protocol reliability. Simulations have been carried out to validate the effectiveness of our analytic model in terms of the reliability of gossiping and the success of gossiping. The results obtained can be used to guide the design of fault tolerant gossip-based <b>protocols.</b> <b>Department</b> of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|R

40|$|Target {{tracking}} is {{a typical}} and important application of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In consideration of the network scalability and energy efficiency for target tracking in large-scale WSNs, it has been employed as an effective solution by organizing the WSNs into clusters. However, tracking a moving target in cluster-based WSNs suffers a boundary problem when the target moves across or along the boundaries of clusters, as the static cluster membership prevents sensors in different clusters from sharing information. In this paper, we propose a novel mobility management protocol, called hybrid cluster-based target tracking (HCTT), which integrates on-demand dynamic clustering into a cluster-based WSN for target tracking. By constructing on-demand dynamic clusters at boundary regions, nodes from different static clusters that detect the target can temporarily share information, and the tracking task can be handed over smoothly from one static cluster to another. As the target moves, static clusters and on-demand dynamic clusters alternately manage the target tracking task. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed protocol performs better in tracking the moving target when compared with other typical target tracking <b>protocols.</b> <b>Department</b> of Computin...|$|R

40|$|Owing to its {{attractive}} {{features such}} as fast identification and relatively long interrogating range over the classical barcode systems, radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology possesses a promising prospect in many practical applications such as inventory control and supply chain management. However, unknown tags appear in RFID systems when the tagged objects are misplaced or unregistered tagged objects are moved in, which often causes huge economic losses. This paper addresses an important and challenging problem of unknown tag identification in large-scale RFID systems. The existing protocols leverage the Aloha-like schemes to distinguish the unknown tags from known tags at the slot level, which are of low time-efficiency, and thus can hardly satisfy the delay-sensitive applications. To fill in this gap, two filtering-based protocols (at the bit level) are proposed in this paper {{to address the problem}} of unknown tag identification efficiently. Theoretical analysis of the protocol parameters is performed to minimize the execution time of the proposed protocols. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the protocols. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocols significantly outperform the currently most promising <b>protocols.</b> <b>Department</b> of Computin...|$|R

40|$|Background: Acupuncture {{has been}} used as a {{treatment}} for cognitive impairment. Objective: This review assesses clinical evidence for or against acupuncture as a treatment for cognitive impairment. This review also discusses the proposed mechanism(s) that could link acupuncture to improved cognitive function. Methods: We searched the literature using PolyUone search from its inception to January 2013, with full text available and language limited to English. Levels of evidence were examined using Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine-Levels of Evidence (March, 2009). Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria: 3 human studies and 9 animal studies. Levels of evidence ranged from level 1 b to level 5. Conclusion: Most animal studies demonstrated a positive effect of acupuncture on cognitive impairment. However, the results of human studies were inconsistent. Further high-quality human studies with greater statistical power are needed to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture and an optimal protocol. Research Highlights (1) This is a systematic review on 12 selected papers out of 227 to study acupuncture for cognitive impairment in human and animals. (2) The results of acupuncture protocols are variable, although a number of individual studies reported positive effects on cognitive function.
