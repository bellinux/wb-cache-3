2500|$|Representatives from Telenor and Teleplan {{testified that}} Kristiansen's phone {{could not have}} been in the {{vicinity}} {{at the time of the}} murders. This gave Kristiansen an alibi since he was using the phone several times. Telenor found six other <b>cell</b> <b>sites</b> covering the area of the crime, but Kristiansen's phone was not connected to any of these. Instead, Kristiansen's phone was exclusively connected to a <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> called [...] "EG_A", a <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> Telenor was unable to make contact with even with the other <b>cell</b> <b>sites</b> disconnected.

40|$|Portable polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane (PEM) {{fuel cell}} power generator is a PEM fuel cell application {{that is used}} as an external charger to supply the demand for high energy. Different environments at various ambient temperatures and humidity levels affect the performance of PEM fuel cell power generators. Thermal and water management in <b>portable</b> PEM fuel <b>cells</b> are a critical technical barrier for the commercialization of this technology. The size and weight of the <b>portable</b> PEM fuel <b>cells</b> used for thermal and water management systems that determine the performance of <b>portable</b> PEM fuel <b>cells</b> {{also need to be}} considered. The main objective of this paper review was to determine the importance of water and thermal management systems in <b>portable</b> PEM fuel <b>cells.</b> Additionally, this review investigated heat transfer and water transport in PEM fuel <b>cells.</b> Given that <b>portable</b> PEM fuel <b>cells</b> with different powers require different thermal and water management systems, this review also discussed and compared management systems for low-, medium-, and high-power <b>portable</b> PEM fuel <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Can the Fourth Amendment protect an individual’s right privacy by {{preventing}} {{the disclosure of}} her location through <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> location information? Does it currently? Should it? Many court opinions answer these questions in both the affirmative and the negative. The rationale underlying each conclusion is disparate. Some rely on statutory regimes, others rely on the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of reasonableness. However, <b>Cell</b> <b>Site</b> Location Information is a technology that requires uniformity in its interpretation. This note investigates the different interpretations of the Fourth Amendment {{as it relates to}} <b>Cell</b> <b>Site</b> Location Information. It explains the technology behind <b>Cell</b> <b>Site</b> Location Information, and then proffers a framework to unify the analysis of whether there is an expectation in <b>Cell</b> <b>Site</b> Location Information by modifying the U. S. Supreme Court’s Katz test. This note does not seek to offer an opinion on whether <b>Cell</b> <b>Site</b> Location Information should be within the zone of reasonable privacy expectations. Instead, the analytical framework internalizes the privacy interests of the individual and the governmental interest in ferreting out crime. It is striking this balance when analyzing these issues that will help the courts to uniformly investigate the privacy implications of <b>Cell</b> <b>Site</b> Location Information...|$|R

Though this mechanism only takes the location of the <b>cell</b> <b>sites</b> into consideration, the HO positions can be estimated reasonably well, compared to the actual positions. In the course of our investigations, we recognized that Voronoi diagrams work best in urban areas, which naturally feature a high density of <b>cell</b> <b>sites.</b> In semi-rural regions, where less <b>cell</b> <b>sites</b> usually cover larger areas, the emerging Voronoi diagrams become fairly large, since their extent is only limited by the surrounding <b>cell</b> <b>sites,</b> which can lead to certain HO positions being estimated very inaccurately.|$|R

In areas with high demand there are additional GSM services operating in the 1800 MHz band, usually from existing 900 MHz <b>cell</b> <b>sites,</b> to provide more capacity. Areas with both 900 MHz and 1800 MHz service cover most major business districts and large shopping malls. In recent years Vodafone has also established some <b>cell</b> <b>sites</b> that only provide 1800 MHz service where {{it is difficult to}} release spectrum for more 900 MHz <b>cell</b> <b>sites.</b> Most phones sold since the mid-1990s support both bands.|$|R
5000|$|The {{court held}} that the Fourth Amendment is not implicated in the {{acquisition}} of historical <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> location data because of the application of the third party doctrine.

Local residents banded together and protested the <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> claiming that big business was trying to run rampant over the little community of Val Verde. As of early 2013, Verizon Wireless has not built the cell tower, and has decided build the tower on a hillside away from homes.|$|R
50|$|The {{most basic}} form of {{handover}} {{is when a}} phone call in progress is redirected from its current cell (called source) to a new cell (called target). In terrestrial networks the source and the target cells may be served from two different <b>cell</b> <b>sites</b> or from {{one and the same}} <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> (in the latter case the two cells are usually referred to as two sectors on that <b>cell</b> <b>site).</b> Such a handover, in which the source and the target are different cells (even if they are on the same <b>cell</b> <b>site)</b> is called inter-cell handover. The purpose of inter-cell handover is to maintain the call as the subscriber is moving out of the area covered by the source cell and entering the area of the target cell.|$|R

40|$|How do we {{deal with}} the risks of new technology? This {{research}} takes the mobile phone <b>cell</b> <b>sites</b> as case. The exponential growth of the wireless telecommunications network, materialized in the construction of <b>cell</b> <b>sites,</b> is raising concerns about its health risks for decades. Where do citizens’ worries about these possible health effects come from? How do local protests against <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> deployment emerge, and why are some <b>cell</b> <b>sites</b> hotly debated while others are constructed without raising a single complaint? This research answers these questions with a longitudinal, mixed method and multi-level analysis of politics and citizens’ experiences of this technology in the Netherlands and Southern California. It shows how politics affect our everyday understandings of mobile phone <b>cell</b> <b>sites.</b> Experienced risks and uncertainties are to a significant degree the outcome of the political attempt to contain risks. This research also shows that citizens’ protest feeds back into risk politics to a limited extend. Local interactions between policy makers, industry professionals and citizens explain why in some cases individual concerns grow into organized protest. However, over time governments and industry have learned how to depoliticize the technology. Paradoxically, the ways in which this happens further fuels citizens’ concerns. That is why many citizens continue to pose the question ‘should I be worried?’ when they are being confronted with a <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> in their neighborhood...|$|R
50|$|However, {{the signal}} {{coverage}} {{area of a}} given <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> may change according {{to the time of}} day, weather, and physical obstructions in relation to where a cellular device attempts to access service. The maps of <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> coverage areas used by law enforcement may also lack precision as a general matter. For these reasons, it is beneficial to use a StingRay and a test phone to map out the precise coverage areas of all <b>cell</b> <b>sites</b> appearing in the HCSLI records. This is typically done at the same time of day and under the same weather conditions that were in effect when the HCSLI was logged. Using a StingRay to conduct base station surveys in this manner allows for mapping out <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> coverage areas that more accurately match the coverage areas that were in effect when the cellular device was used.|$|R
