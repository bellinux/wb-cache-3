In this research, TLSC's structure was examined {{as well as its}} strategies on the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> migrant <b>workers.</b> There was the evaluation of those strategies {{in order to understand the}} impacts in different level. Data was collected from the in-dept interviews with 21 key representatives from the leading actors <b>of</b> TLSC, Thai <b>worker's</b> union, labor related and migrant related NGOs, migrant workers and Thai workers during October 2008 – April 2009. The research found that TLSC had used "Human Rights" as the leading concept for their movement. TLSC had the clear structure in the administrative level. The main strategies of TLSC on labor movement in Thailand included petition, campaign and education, capacity building, information dissemination in national and local level and networking. All of these strategies had been used for the movement on the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> migrant <b>workers</b> as well. The migrant related NGOs who were members of TLSC had played important roles and had influence towards TLSC's activities regarding the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> migrant <b>workers.</b> The strong capacity of migrant related NGOs who participated in TLSC and the sufficient database about migrant workers situation provided to TLSC leaders and members by NGOs were the main factors motivating TLSC movement on the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> migrant <b>workers.</b> The impacts <b>of</b> TLSC's strategies on the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> migrant <b>workers</b> were in three different levels; policy level, local level, and organization level...|$|R

[...] He later accused NATO of using chemical and radioactive weapons against Yugoslavia in breach of international conventions, adding that NATO's [...] "carpet-bombing" [...] of Kosovo and Metohija raised the question of whether the military alliance actually wanted Albanian refugees to return to the area as it claimed. At one press conference, Blažić accused NATO of violating international conventions pertaining to oil pollution, benzol poisoning, prevention of risk of cancer, cross-border air pollution, ozone layer protection, protection of the flora and fauna, and <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> from occupational hazards. Following the conclusion of the bombing campaign, he suggested that the smoke and toxic fumes caused by NATO's actions might have contributed to the heavy rainstorms and other bad weather affecting Serbia in the summer of 1999.|$|E

This {{study focused on}} Korean national fashion businesses and identified various types of CSR practices in addition to social contributions.

A total of 1054 cases of 147 brands, 86 corporations between 2000 and 2012 were collected from internet articles and brand home pages. Findings were as follows. First, the types of CSR activities were categorized into the following six: economic responsibility, legal responsibility, consumer <b>protection,</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>worker's</b> right, <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> environment, and social contribution.
