5|$|In the past, {{the human}} {{forecaster}} {{was responsible for}} generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any <b>particular</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> guidance are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user. Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast. While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans {{may no longer be}} needed in the forecast process {{at some point in the}} future, there is currently still a need for human intervention.|$|E

500|$|Focus constructions emphasise a <b>particular</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> new or salient {{information}} {{within a}} sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level {{stress on the}} focal constituent. For example, the girl was stung by a bee (emphasising it was a bee and not for example a wasp that stung her), or The girl was stung by a bee (contrasting with another possibility, for example {{that it was the}} boy). Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, That girl over there, she was stung by a bee, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, she was stung by a bee, that girl over there, where reference to the girl is established as an [...] "afterthought".|$|E

It was Serra's eighth collaboration with director Luc Besson, having composed soundtracks for seven of Besson's previous films including La Femme Nikita and [...] The album runs for about 64 minutes, and some form of music is playing during about 90 percent of the film. Commentators noted the change in Serra's work, which had traditionally relied heavily on synthesizer effects. The Messenger, on the other hand, is a primarily orchestral score as justified by the film's historical context, though synthesized effects are still used in some tracks. Writing in The Films of Luc Besson, Mark Brownrigg stated Serra's score completed his [...] "evolution" [...] from pop-score writer to orchestral film composer; Serra's previous score for The Fifth Element had also used orchestral elements. They gave a favourable review of the score, though criticised the music that is heard during Joan's death, describing it as an unimaginative paraphrasing of Carmina Burana. Heather Phares from Allmusic gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, stating it [...] "combines orchestral, rock, and electronic elements for a sweeping, cinematic experience."

500|$|There {{are three}} main events in Pilotwings 64 {{required}} to complete the game, {{each of which has}} its own objectives and unique flight controls centered around the Nintendo 64 controller's single analog stick.

The player's movement is affected by wind currents and altitude can be gained by flying through thermal columns. The second event is the [...] "Rocket Belt", a jet pack that allows the player to move and gain height as well as hover, tilt, and rotate in the air using the belt's equipped thrusters. Goals entail flying through rings or popping large balloons before landing. The third event, the gyrocopter, challenges the player to take off and land on a runway after completing objectives like navigating a path of rings or destroying targets with missiles. Pilotwings 64 also features several bonus events that are unlocked if the player performs well in the main missions. The player can also earn medals on many of these events. They include skydiving, a human cannonball event, and the [...] "Jumble Hopper", which grants the player special spring-loaded boots to be used in bouncing across the landscape to an end space.
