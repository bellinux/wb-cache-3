The main reason behind this growth is the increase in poultry production of almost 7.88 percent.|$|E

Due to competition with renewable energy and natural gas, coal production has been declining since 2008. Currently the U.S. occupies five major basins or regions where coal is produced. The U.S. Energy Information Administration released coal <b>production</b> <b>data</b> of 2016 in January, reporting a 17% decrease from 2015 levels.

We analyze responses from three roles within <b>data</b> <b>production</b> processes, <b>data</b> collectors, data custodians, and data consumers, to investigate the effects of different knowledge modes held by different work roles on data quality.

25|$|The decline curve method uses <b>production</b> <b>data</b> to fit {{a decline}} curve and {{estimate}} future oil production. The three most common forms of decline curves are exponential, hyperbolic, and harmonic.

The curve can be expressed mathematically or plotted on a graph to estimate future production. It {{has the advantage of}} (implicitly) including all reservoir characteristics. It requires a sufficient history to establish a statistically significant trend, ideally when production is not curtailed by regulatory or other artificial conditions.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to predict the oil peak in any given region, {{due to the lack}} of knowledge and/or transparency in accounting of global oil reserves. [...] Based on available <b>production</b> <b>data,</b> proponents have previously predicted the peak for the world to be in years 1989, 1995, or 1995–2000. Some of these predictions date from before the recession of the early 1980s, and the consequent reduction in global consumption, the effect of which was to delay the date of any peak by several years. Just as the 1971 U.S. peak in oil production was only clearly recognized after the fact, a peak in world production will be difficult to discern until production clearly drops off. The peak is also a moving target as it is now measured as [...] "liquids", which includes synthetic fuels, instead of just conventional oil.|$|E

2500|$|The {{livestock}} sector may be {{the largest}} source of water pollution (due to animal wastes, fertilizers, pesticides), and it contributes to [...] emergence of antibiotic resistance. It accounts for over 8% of global human water use. It {{is by far the}} biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for nearly 40% of the global land surface. It is a significant driver of biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, ocean dead zones, land degradation, pollution, and overfishing. It is reportedly responsible for 14.5% of the world's anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Although, a revised study of the environmental impact of livestock states that they account for 51% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.
