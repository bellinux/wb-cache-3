5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>permanent</b> <b>works</b> which {{are the subject of}} this article, the City of Westminster also hosts several temporary displays of sculpture. The most prominent of these is at the Fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, which has shown works by contemporary artists on rotation since 1999. Temporary outdoor displays of sculpture can also be seen at the Royal Academy and the Chelsea College of Arts. In 2010 Westminster City Council inaugurated the City of Sculpture project, which has seen contemporary sculpture installed in locations across the borough.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro's {{competition}} venues {{meet the}} International Federation's (IFs) technical requirements and both IOC and IPC standards, and align with the City Master Plan and legacy strategy. Most venues are already operational, recently developed or renovated. According to the Rio de Janeiro 2016 bid committee, there are ten (29%) existing venues with no <b>permanent</b> <b>works</b> required and eight (24%) venues requiring reforms, while nine (26%) new permanent venues and seven (21%) temporary venues will be built. In total {{there will be}} 34 competition venues alongside 29 training venues, {{as part of the}} training venues strategy. The most significant legacy project from the bid is the Olympic Training Center (OTC) program and facilities with its headquarters located in Barra zone. Furthermore, the Rio de Janeiro 2016 bid committee recognized the possibility of new sports being added to the Olympic Program and, following detailed analysis for each of the seven potential sports—baseball, golf, karate, roller sports, rugby, softball and squash—confirmed its capability to accommodate any of them in respect to venues, transport and other operational or logistical aspects. In addition, Rio de Janeiro and the four proposed cities to hold football (soccer) competitions—Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and São Paulo—were chosen to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the CTA and the City of Chicago Public Art Program {{installed}} nine <b>permanent</b> <b>works</b> of art {{at eight}} renovated rail stations on what {{is now known as}} the Pink Line. The CTA has since created an ongoing program to showcase <b>permanent</b> <b>works</b> of art in conjunction with the City of Chicago Public Art Program. The Arts in Transit Program is funded by the Federal Transit Administration, and created opportunities to develop original artwork for station reconstruction projects along the CTA Red and Brown Lines. Artists were selected for each of the stations included in the Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project and select renovated Red Line stations.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} casual work in shortening the time taken to move from unemployment into <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> using longitudinal data from the Survey of Employment and Unemployment Patterns. The analysis is based on comparison of the transition rate from unemployment to <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> with the combined transition rates of unemployment to casual work and casual <b>work</b> to <b>permanent</b> <b>work.</b> We use hazard rate models to estimate each of the transition rates. The models include observed and unobserved heterogeneity and allow for correlation between the transition rates. The evidence presented suggests that disadvantaged unemployed people can benefit from accepting casual work {{in their search for}} <b>permanent</b> <b>work,</b> although they are still less likely than others to obtain <b>permanent</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R

25|$|These {{methods of}} {{retaining}} wall construction employ bored piling techniques, normally CFA or rotary. They provide special advantages where available working space dictates that basement excavation faces be vertical. Both methods offer technically effective and cost efficient temporary or permanent means of retaining {{the sides of}} bulk excavations even in water bearing strata. When used in <b>permanent</b> <b>works,</b> these walls can be designed to accommodate vertical loads in addition to moments and horizontal forces. Construction of both methods {{is the same as}} for foundation bearing piles. Contiguous walls are constructed with small gaps between adjacent piles. The size of this space is determined {{by the nature of the}} soils.|$|E
25|$|Estuaire contemporary-art {{exhibitions}} {{were held}} along the Loire estuary in 2007, 2009 and 2012. They left several <b>permanent</b> <b>works</b> {{of art in}} Nantes and inspired the Voyage à Nantes, a series of contemporary-art exhibitions across the city which has been held every summer since 2012. A route (a green line painted on the pavement) helps visitors make the voyage between the exhibitions and the city's major landmarks. Some works of art are permanent, and others are used for a summer. Permanent sculptures include Daniel Buren's Anneaux (a series of 18 rings along the Loire reminiscent of Atlantic slave trade shackles) and works by François Morellet and Dan Graham.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{credibility}} and faking {{is essential in}} different areas of psychology {{and especially in the}} forensic field. The investigations performed by Arce and Farina are recognised as being among the most notable of all the existing investigations, with the development of the Global Evaluation System (GES) that {{has been found to be}} especially effective in assessing the credibility of testimony and malingering mental health cases. The application of this procedure to 20 people accused under the judicial system of Social Security fraud for malingering a <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> incapacity by way of a mental disorder, showed that the procedure described in the GES was effective for the correct classification of the malingers. Furthermore, data supported the categorising of malingers, consisting of whole malingers (those mentally healthy that effectively simulate a <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> incapacity), partial malingers (those with temporary or no mental work incapacity disease, who claim for a <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> incapacity), over malingers (those with <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> incapacity mental disorders who exaggerate the severity of their mental health) and incompetent malingers (those who claimed to have <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> incapacity but in their mental health assessment, were observed to have no mental health disorder.). Protocols for the forensic evaluation of malingering fitted to each categorization derived from the results obtained. The theoretical and practical implications of forensic assessment are discussed...|$|R

60|$|In {{the case}} of an {{altogether}} declining trade, in which it is necessary that the production should be, not occasionally varied, but greatly and permanently diminished, or perhaps stopped altogether, the process of extricating the capital is, no doubt, tardy and difficult, and almost always attended with considerable loss; much of the capital fixed in machinery, buildings, <b>permanent</b> <b>works,</b> etc., being either not applicable to any other purpose, or only applicable after expensive alterations; and time being seldom given for effecting the change in the mode in which it would be effected with least loss, namely, by not replacing the fixed capital as it wears out. There is besides, in totally changing the destination of a capital, so great a sacrifice of established connection, and of acquired skill and experience, that people are always very slow in resolving upon it, and hardly ever do so until long after a change of fortune has become hopeless.|$|E

Given that a large proportion of temporary employment is involuntary, an understanding of the factors associated with the transition to <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> may inform public policy. Factors associated with the transition, namely, human capital, household structures and labour market segmentation are analyzed using data from the Statistics Canada's Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) for the period 1999 - 2004, limited to paid workers aged 2 - 4 years, excluding students. Among the key factors associated with the transitions are younger age and low unemployment rates.
