Concerns that language differences would hamper U.S. film exports turned out to be largely unfounded.

The production of multiple versions of export-bound talkies in different languages (known as [...] "Foreign Language Version"), as well as the production of the cheaper [...] "International Sound Version", a common approach at first, largely ceased by mid-1931, replaced by post-dubbing and subtitling.
