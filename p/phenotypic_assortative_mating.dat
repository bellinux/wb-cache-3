40|$|<b>Phenotypic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> and within-pair sexual {{dimorphism}} and {{its influence}} on breeding success and offspring quality in Magellanic penguins M. G. Forero, J. L. Tella, J. A. Donázar, G. Blanco, M. Bertellotti, and O. Ceballos Abstract: We examined within-pair sexual dimorphism and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> in Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) breeding in six colonies located on the Patagonian coast (Argentina). All measured phenotypic traits except the number of pectoral spots differed between the sexes; bill depth and flipper length were the most and least dimorphic traits, respectively. We found assortative mating by bill depth and body mass. The similarity in body condition within pairs was close to significant. When we performed separate correlations for birds that bred successfully, i. e., raised one or two offsprings, and birds that {{did not attempt to}} breed or bred unsuccessfully, only the successful breeders showed assortative mating by body mass. In addition, we attempted to relate the body size of each member of the pair and the degree of sexual dimorphism within pairs to the breeding performance of individuals, which was measured as brood size, and body condition and immunocompetence of offspring. We found that pairs that were less dimorphic in flipper length raised more offspring. This effect was due to female flipper length per se and no...|$|E
40|$|First, {{this study}} {{examined}} genetic and environmental sources of variation in performance on a standardised test of academic achievement, the Queensland Core Skills Test (QCST) (Queensland Studies Authority, 2003 a). Second, it assessed the genetic correlation among the QCST score and Verbal and Performance IQ measures using the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery (MAB), [Jackson, D. N. (1984) Multidimensional Aptitude Battery manual. Port Huron, MI:Research Psychologist Press, Inc. ]. Participants were 256 monozygotic twin pairs and 326 dizygotic twin pairs aged from 15 to 18 years (mean 17 years +/- 0. 4 [SD]) when achievement tested, and from 15 to 22 years (mean 16 years +/- 0. 4 [SD]) when IQ tested. Univariate analysis indicated a heritability for the QCST of 0. 72. Adjustment to this estimate due to truncate selection (downward adjustment) and positive <b>phenotypic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> (upward adjustment) suggested a heritability of 0. 76 The phenotypic (0. 81) and genetic (0. 91) correlations between the QCST and Verbal IQ (VIQ) were significantly stronger than the phenotypic (0. 57) and genetic (0. 64) correlations between the QCST and Performance IQ (PIQ). The findings suggest that individual variation in QCST performance {{is largely due to}} genetic factors and that common environmental effects may be substantially accounted for by <b>phenotypic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> Covariance between academic achievement on the QCST and psychometric IQ (particularly VIQ) is to a large extent due to common genetic influences...|$|E

Pre-mating (behavior tactics, habitat or food divergence, <b>phenotypic</b> divergence and <b>assortative</b> <b>mating)</b> and post-mating, post-zygotic isolation barriers (selection against unfit hybrids) are well studied in numerous species, but little is known about what is happening between insemination and fertilization (post-mating, pre-zygotic isolation barriers). In this study, we chose the well-studied population of pied and collared flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca and F. albicollis) of the hybrid zone of Öland, Sweden, to investigate possible patterns of gamete divergence between these two closely related species. We compared sperm morphology between the two species and their hybrids, analyzing traits that are thought to play an important role in the fertilization success of the males.

The aim of the current study was to assess whether people’s preference in face attractiveness is influenced by resemblance to the opposite sex parent’s face (parental phenotype) or their own face (self-based phenotype or “self-imprinting”). We used computerized image manipulations of facial photographs of participants, their mothers and fathers. The original photographs were combined with 78 % of the participants’ opposite sex prototype face (i. e., male and female prototypes made from equal contributions of a hundred faces), creating morphs where the contribution from the familiar faces went unnoticed. Female and male participants ranked these images together with the opposite-sex prototype different familiar morphs. Each participant did the same for the morphs generated with other same-sex participants’ faces and of their parents. We found that the female participants preferred the self-based morphs to the prototype faces. Male participants showed a general tendency towards self-referential standard. Parental face morphs were ranked low in attractiveness, which may be accounted for by the age difference of the faces blended into the self-based versus parental face morphs, since we used present-time photographs of both the participants and their parents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{biological}} and social transmission {{of attitudes toward}} abortion and gay rights are analyzed in a large sample of adult twins, siblings, and their parents. We present a linear model for family resemblance allowing for both genetic and cultural transmission of attitudes from parents to offspring, as well as <b>phenotypic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> (the tendency to marry like) and other environmental sources of twin and sibling resemblance that do {{not depend on the}} attitudes of their parents. The model gives a close fit to the patterns of similarity between relatives for the two items. Results are consistent with a substantial role of genetic liability in the transmission of both attitudes. Contrary to the dominant paradigm of the social and political sciences, the kinship data are consistent with a relatively minor non-genetic impact of parental attitudes on the development of adult attitudes in their children. By contrast, the choice of mate is a social action that has a marked impact on the polarization of social attitudes and on the long-term influence that parents exert upon the next generation...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{effects of}} genetic and enviromnental factors in producing individual differ-ences in educational achievement are compared across {{women and men}} and over birth cohorts. In a large sample of Australian twin pairs, the heritability of self-reported edu-cational attainment did not vary among women and men born before and after 1950. In a "psychometric " model of twin resemblance, based on separate self-reports in 1981 and 1989, genetic factors explained 57 % of the stable variance in educational achieve-ment, while environmental factors shared by twins accounted for 24 % of the variance. Corrections for <b>phenotypic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> for educational level, however, suggested that estimated common-environmental effects could be entirely explained by the corre-lation between additive genetic values for mates. Taking this into account, heritability of "true " educational attainment in Australia may {{be as high as}} 82 % with the remaining variation being due to individual environments or experiences.

50|$|<b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> is a {{mating pattern}} and {{a form of}} sexual {{selection}} in which individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern. Examples of similar phenotypes include, {{but are not limited}} to, body size, skin coloration/pigmentation, and age. <b>Assortative</b> <b>mating,</b> also referred to as positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> or homogamy, may increase genetic relatedness within the family. <b>Assortative</b> <b>mating</b> can be contrasted with disassortative mating (also known as negative <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> or heterogamy) in which individuals with dissimilar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating. Disassortative mating reduces the genetic similarities within the family. Positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> occurs more frequently than negative <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> In both cases, due to the nonrandom mating pattern, there is a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg principle (which states that genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences).|$|R

40|$|Borderline {{personality}} disorder is a severe {{personality disorder}} for which genetic {{research has been}} limited to family studies and classical twin studies. These studies indicate that genetic effects explain 35 to 45 % {{of the variance in}} borderline personality disorder and borderline personality features. However, effects of non-additive (dominance) genetic factors, nonrandom mating and cultural transmission have generally not been explored. In the present study an extended twin-family design was applied to self-report data of twins (N = 5, 017) and their siblings (N = 1, 266), parents (N = 3, 064) and spouses (N = 939) from 4, 015 families, to estimate the effects of additive and non-additive genetic and environmental factors, cultural transmission and non-random mating on individual differences in borderline personality features. Results showed that resemblance among biological relatives could completely be attributed to genetic effects. Variation in borderline personality features was explained by additive genetic (21 %; 95 % CI 17 – 26 %) and dominant genetic (24 %; 95 % CI 17 – 31 %) factors.

These extensions allow for variable family structure and differences in parental influence due to separation, age or stage of development of the child, birth order, or type of relationship. Family structure is observed to have a marked effect on familial resemblance.

40|$|The {{transmission}} of social attitudes {{has been investigated}} as a possible model of cultural inheritance {{in a sample of}} 3810 twin pairs from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Twin Registry. Six social attitude factors were identified and univariate genetic models fitted to scores on each factor. A joint multivariate genetic analysis of the six attitude factors, church attendance, and education indicated that the attitudes were correlated [...] the same genes and shared environments in-fluenced more than one attitude factor. A current controversy regarding social attitudes is whether the significant loadings on this shared envi-ronmental component represent true cultural influences or are actually the genetic consequences of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> for church attendance and educational ttainment (Martin et ak, 1986). In our data, church attendance is almost entirely due to the impact of the shared environment. The large shared environmental component on church at-tendance also accounts for a substantial part of the family resemblance in social attitudes, suggesting that not all of the apparent cultural effects found in earlier studies can be ascribed to the genetic effects of assor-tative mating. However, church attendance and education do not com-pletely account for the cultural component. Therefore, effects in addition to church attendance, education, and assortative mating for church at-tendance and education must be involved in the cultural component of the inheritance of attitudes...|$|E

We found that pairs that were less dimorphic in flipper length raised more offspring. This effect was due to female flipper length per se and not to the relative difference in flipper length between members of the pair. Females with larger flippers had a higher probability of raising two chicks. No effects of body measurements or degree of sexual dimorphism on body condition or T-cell-mediated immune response of offspring were found.

40|$|In 1898, E. A. Fay {{published}} {{an analysis of}} nearly 5000 marriages among deaf individuals in America collected during the 19 th century.

We recently proposed that the intense <b>phenotypic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> among the deaf might have greatly accelerated the normally slow response to relaxed genetic selection against deafness that began in many Western countries {{with the introduction of}} sign language and the establishment of residential schools.

To test this prediction, we collected pedigree data on 311 contemporary marriages among deaf individuals that were comparable to those collected by Fay. Segregation analysis of the resulting data revealed that the estimated proportion of noncomplementary matings that can produce only deaf children has increased by a factor of more than five in the past 100 years. Additional analysis within our sample of contemporary pedigrees showed that there was a statistically significant linear increase in the prevalence of pathologic GJB 2 mutations when the data on 441 probands were partitioned into three 20 -year birth cohorts (1920 through 1980).

40|$|A general {{linear model}} of {{familial}} resemblance is described {{which allows for}} cultural transmission from parent to offspring, polygenic inheritance, <b>phenotypic</b> <b>assortative</b> <b>mating,</b> common environment, maternal and paternal effects, and threshold effects. Three special cases are described in detail which are particularly useful when data are only available about a few classes of relatives reared in intact families. The cultural model, the polygenic model, and the pseudopolygenic model share the common feature that all factors which are transmitted from parent to offspring may be represented by one parameter without any loss of information. We introduce a new model, termed the unitary model, which includes these models and is appropriate when combined genetic and cultural transmission is present and when data are available only for individuals reared in intact nuclear families. The basic properties of these models are explored using path analysis and computer simulation, including description {{of the relationship between}} parameters under random and assortative mating, rate of approach to equilibrium, and constraints on the magnitude of the parameters. General formulae for familial resemblance in extended pedigrees are given for any ancestor or descendant of either vertical or collateral relatives.

In addition, the amount of linkage disequilibrium was independent of the level of recombination. For two selective assortative models, the amount of linkage disequilibrium was a function of the amount of recombination. For these models, the linkage disequilibrium generated was negative mainly because repulsion heterozygotes were favored over coupling heterozygotes.

To these ends, we use rich data from the United States and Norway over the period 1980 - 2007. We find evidence of positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> at all levels of education in both countries. However, the time trends vary by the level of education: Among college graduates, <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> has been declining over time, whereas individuals with a low level of education are increasingly sorting into internally homogenous marriages.

We find that educational <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> accounts for a non-negligible part of the cross-sectional inequality in household income. However, changes in <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> over time barely move the time trends in household income inequality. The reason is that the decline in <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> among the highly educated is offset by an increase in <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> among the less educated.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> {{is a key}} component of the process of speciation with gene flow. Several recent theoretical studies have pointed out, however, that sexual selection which can result from <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> may cause it to plateau at an intermediate level; this is primarily owing to search costs of individuals with extreme phenotypes and to assortative preferences developed by individuals with intermediate phenotypes.

40|$|Divergence in {{the face}} of gene flow is perhaps the most wildly disputed subject among {{researchers}} through time. The debate is an old one and we find its origin {{as far back as the}} era of Darwin. The theories dealing with sympatric and parapatric speciation, its processes and ecological conditions, are numerous and the empirical data supporting the ideas is constantly growing. However, the reach of a consensus almost seem as distant as ever. Two fundamental prerequisites can be identified for the evolution of divergence with gene flow, the act of disruptive selection, and the development of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating.</b> A set of models in which speciation with gene flow seem particularly likely is when a shift occurs in host preference in phytophagous insects and mating takes place on the host. In the work behind this thesis, the role of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> in the initial stages of sympatric and parapatric speciation has been studied, as has the interaction between <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> and inbreeding and how it effects speciation in small sympatric populations, an aspect not much attended to earlier in the literature. My results show that <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> based on resource preference, can evolve rapidly upon secondary contact, and even in parapatric populations with a migration rate of 8 % (13 - 15 individuals) per generation. However for <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> to be maintained selection against hybrids is needed. My results also suggests that small inbred populations have a hard time coping with strong <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> an as a consequence tend to relax their mating preferences to avoid inbreeding depression. Based on these results, I advocate for the importance of considering not only <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> in itself, but also the joint effects of <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> and inbreeding when dealing with theories of speciation with gene flow...|$|R

This paper tries to calculate the earnings correlations for Turkey and consider {{the effect of the}} sample selection. Our results show that there is a weak positive <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> in Turkey, and the bias from the selection is small. In addition, we look at the <b>assortative</b> <b>mating</b> coefficients in different regions in Turkey. Akdeniz region has the biggest correlation coefficient. Karadeniz has the lowest coefficient which is almost zero. ...|$|R
