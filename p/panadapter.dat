5000|$|The company's well {{regarded}} [...] "K-Line" [...] {{consists of}} the K3 transceiver, the KPA500 500W power amplifier, the KAT500 automatic antenna tuner, and the P3 <b>panadapter.</b> [...] Also the P3SVGA add-on to the P3 to display the <b>panadapter</b> data on a large screen and the W2 HF/VHF/UHF wattmeter are sometimes {{considered part of the}} K-Line. Most recently Elecraft has introduced the [...] "KX-Line" [...] consisting of the KX2 and KX3 transceivers, the PX3 <b>panadapter,</b> and the KXPA100 100W power amplifier.|$|E
50|$|The radio {{spectrum}} scope (also radio panoramic receiver, panoramic adapter, pan receiver, pan adapter, <b>panadapter,</b> panoramic radio spectroscope, panoramoscope, panalyzor and band scope) {{was invented by}} Marcel Wallace and measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within one or more radio bands - e.g. shortwave bands. A spectrum scope is normally a lot cheaper than a spectrum analyzer, because the aim is not high quality frequency resolution - nor high quality signal strength measurements.|$|E
40|$|The upload {{contains}} an Eclipse Excel spreadsheet that is enhanced from a Reverse Beacon Network (RBN) export, and sorted by receiving callsign and Zulu PM {{time during the}} eclipse and 15 minutes before and for a period from 8 : 45 to 12 : 30, local Corvallis time. The experiment looked at the RBN sites who received CW signals from the callsign WG 0 R, which was transmitting test messages at 100 Watts using the below station resources. The transmission resources are: Elecraft KX 3, KXPA 100, and PX 3 transceiver, 100 Watt amplifier, and <b>Panadapter,</b> driving a Carolina Windom Antenna at 10 meterrs above ground level, strung at 150 to 330 degrees in two Oak trees...|$|E
