40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{checking}} and enforcing multi-contact stability based on the Zero-tilting Moment Point (ZMP). The key to our development is the generalization of ZMP support areas {{to take into account}} (a) frictional constraints and (b) multiple non-coplanar contacts. We introduce and investigate two kinds of ZMP support areas. First, we characterize and provide a fast geometric construction for the support area generated by valid contact forces, with no other constraint on the robot motion. We call this set the full support area. Next, we consider the control of humanoid robots using the Linear Pendulum Mode (LPM). We observe that the constraints stemming from the LPM induce a shrinking of the support area, even for walking on horizontal floors. We propose an algorithm to compute the new area, which we call <b>pendular</b> <b>support</b> area. We show that, in the LPM, having the ZMP in the <b>pendular</b> <b>support</b> area is a necessary and sufficient condition for contact stability. Based on these developments, we implement a whole-body controller and generate feasible multi-contact motions where an HRP- 4 humanoid locomotes in challenging multi-contact scenarios.

40|$|Passive tuned-mass dampers (TMDs) {{are a very}} {{efficient}} solution for the control of vibrations in structures subjected to long-duration, narrow-band excitations. In this study, a Bidirectional and Homogeneous Tuned Mass Damper (BH-TMD) is proposed. The <b>pendular</b> mass is <b>supported</b> by cables and linked to a unidirectional friction damper with its axis perpendicular to the direction of motion. Some advantages of the proposed BH-TMD are: (1) its bidirectional nature that allows control of vibrations in both principal directions; (2) the capacity to tune the device in each principal direction independently; (3) its energy dissipation capacity that {{is proportional to the}} square of the displacement amplitude, (4) its low maintenance cost. Numerical results show that, under either unidirectional or bidirectional seismic excitations, the level of response reduction achieved by the proposed BH-TMD is similar to that obtained from an “ideal” linear viscous device. Moreover, experimental shaking table tests performed using a scaled BH-TMD model confirm that the proposed device is homogeneous, and, hence, its equivalent oscillation period and damping ratio are independent of the motion amplitude...|$|R
