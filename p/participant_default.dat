40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive overview of Canada’s Large Value Transfer System (LVTS). The LVTS is a real-time electronic system for handling large-value payments {{and is an}} integral component of the country’s financial system. Each day, approximately Can$ 140 billion in payments is sent through the LVTS, including payments used to settle other important clearing and settlement systems in Canada. The paper explains how {{the design of the}} LVTS, including its risk-control framework, collateral arrangements, and loss-allocation procedures in the event of <b>participant</b> <b>default,</b> exceeds the risk-containment requirements of the international Core Principles for Systemically Important Payments Systems. At the same time, the LVTS offers a more cost-efficient means of sending payments relative to standard Real-time Gross Settlement arrangements. This is facilitated by the availability of several liquidity-saving features, each of which is described. The paper also discusses the linkage between the LVTS and the daily implementation of Canadian monetary policy. Details of LVTS ownership and participation are also outlined.

40|$|The Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) loss-sharing {{mechanism}} {{was designed}} to ensure that, {{in the event of}} a one-participant default, the collateral pledged by direct members of the system would be sufficient to cover the largest possible net debit position of a <b>defaulting</b> <b>participant.</b> However, the situation may not hold if the indirect effects of the defaults are taken into consideration, or if two <b>participants</b> <b>default</b> during the same payment cycle. The authors examine surviving participant total losses under both one clearungand two-participant default conditions, assuming the potential knock-on effects of the default. Their analysis includes the impact of a decline in value of LVTS collateral following an unexpected <b>default.</b> Simulations of <b>participant</b> <b>defaults</b> indicate that the impact on the LVTS is generally small; surviving participants do incur end-of-day collateral shortfalls, but only rarely and in small amounts. Under the two-participant default scenario, the likelihood of the Bank of Canada having to provide funds to ensure LVTS settlement is reasonably low, as is the average residual-coverage amount. The majority of LVTS participants pledge as collateral securities issued by other system members. However, the impact of an issuer of such collateral defaulting is generally not significant in the LVTS...|$|R
40|$|Canada's Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is {{designed}} to meet international risk-proofing standards at a minimum cost to participants in terms of collateral requirements. It does so, in part, through collateralized risk-sharing arrangements whereby participants may incur losses if another <b>participant</b> <b>defaults.</b> The LVTS {{is designed}} to be robust to defaults. Its rules, however, do not ensure that individual participants are robust to defaults. The author studies participants' robustness to default empirically by creating unanticipated defaults in LVTS, and finds that all participants are able to withstand their loss allocations that result from the largest defaults she can create using actual LVTS data.

40|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} against the potential losses {{in case of a}} <b>participant's</b> <b>default</b> and to contain systemic risk, central counterparties (CCPs) need to maintain sufficient financial resources. Typically, these financial resources consist of margin requirements and contributions to a collective default fund. Based on a stylized model of CCP risk management, this article analyzes the main factors affecting the trade-off between margins and default fund. The optimal balance between these two risk management instruments is found to depend on collateral costs, participants' default probability, {{and the extent to which}} margin requirements are associated with risk-mitigating incentives. Given the increasing role of CCPs in financial markets in general and for financial stability in particular, these considerations are not only important for CCPs themselves, but also for financial regulators. Central counterparty, margin requirements, default fund, financial stability, incentives...|$|R
40|$|The LVTS is an {{electronic}} network for sending and receiving large-value payments. It {{is expected to}} become operational {{in the first half}} of 1999. Major chartered banks and other large deposit-taking institutions will provide access to the system for their clients in the financial, corporate, and government sectors. Canada's LVTS exceeds world standards for risk control in large-value systems. The author explains how this is achieved through the netting, bilateral and multilateral credit limits, collateral, loss-sharing procedures used in the event of a default and, as a last resort, a guarantee by the Bank of Canada. The LVTS gives participating institutions certainty of settlement for their LVTS positions every day, even if one or more <b>participants</b> <b>default.</b> This greatly reduces systemic risk in the financial system. Moreover, the LVTS supports finality of payment; that is, it makes funds unconditionally and irrevocably available to the receiver. Finality is highly desirable when the amount of the payment is substantial, or when exact timing is critical. Since the LVTS will carry the great majority of the value of all payments in Canada, it should be considered the core of the national payments system. ...|$|R

40|$|How do {{observers}} perceptually {{organize the}} events of individual agents when observing interactions among them? Do they readily perceive all events? Do they selectively perceive some events but not others? Do they see events overlooked by observers {{focusing on the individual}} agents? To explore these questions, participants viewed the Heider and Simmel (1944) animation, which shows three moving figures and elicits strong impressions of interacting agents. <b>Participants</b> in the <b>default</b> condition segmented the animation into meaningful events. Those in focus conditions did likewise, but focusing on one of the figures. Results indicate that <b>participants</b> in the <b>default</b> condition disregarded many events identified in the focus conditions, but identified only one event missed by focus-condition participants. These findings suggest that observers of interactions do not encode all events or gain additional insight by “seeing the big picture”; rather, they selectively perceive some events at the cost of overlooking others...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{understanding}} in interaction {{is informed by}} temporality, and in particular, by the workings of retrospection. Understanding is a temporally extended, sequentially organized process. Temporality, namely, the sequential relationship of turn positions, equips <b>participants</b> with <b>default</b> mechanisms to display understandings and to expect such displays. These mechanisms require local management of turn-taking to be in order, i. e., the possibility and the expectation to respond locally and reciprocally to prior turns at talk. Sequential positions of turns in interaction provide an infrastructure for displaying understanding and accomplishing intersubjectivity. Linguistic practices specialized in displaying particular kinds of (not) understanding are adapted to the individual sequential positions with respect to an action-to-be-understood...|$|R

This article discusses the role of collateral and haircut policy in central bank lending, as well as the distinguishing features of the central bank’s policy relative to private sector practices. It presents a model that explicitly incorporates the unique role of central banks in the payments system and argues that central banks must consider how their haircut policies affect the relative price and liquidity of assets, the market’s asset allocation, and the likelihood of <b>participants</b> to <b>default.</b> Furthermore, under extraordinary circumstances, there is a rationale for the central bank to temporarily reduce haircuts or broaden the list of eligible collateral to mitigate the shortage of liquidity in the market. ...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring the {{trustworthiness}} {{of social}} interaction partners is a cornerstone of social cognition. However, the mechanics of learning about trust during online interactions {{as a result of}} a person’s behaviour can be difficult to explore. The current experiments use a gaze cueing paradigm where faces provide either valid (always shift their gaze towards the location of a subsequent target), or invalid cues (always shift their gaze to a different location). Following gaze cueing, participants rate valid faces as more trustworthy than invalid faces. We show that this incidental trust learning is sensitive to the emotional expression of the face, is specific to assessments of trust, occurs outside of conscious awareness, and is driven primarily by a decrease in trust for invalid faces (Chapter 2), perhaps reflecting a cheater detection module. Memory for incidentally learned trust is surprisingly durable, is affected by the familiarity of the cueing faces (Chapter 3), and does not affect memory for the faces’ physical features, nor does the trustworthiness of the face generalise to other stimuli (Chapter 4). Furthermore, learning is modulated by top-down knowledge of social group membership − when group identity is made experimentally salient, <b>participants</b> <b>default</b> to a group-level representation as a heuristic for social judgements (Chapter 5), while using naturally occurring group memberships (i. e. race) results in better learning for in-group members than out-group (Chapter 6). Finally, while there is evidence that trust learning is driven by learning about eye-gaze behaviour, this cannot be explained purely by disruptions to visuomotor fluency (Chapter 7), which suggests that this phenomenon is part of an active social monitoring framework that relies on physical changes or behaviours in a face to affect subsequent social judgements...|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} adaptive function sometimes posited for kin {{recognition is}} a role in kin selection. There is debate over this, since in strict theoretical terms kin recognition is not necessary for kin selection or the cooperation associated with it. Rather, social behaviour can emerge by kin selection in the demographic conditions of 'viscous populations' with organisms interacting in their natal context, without active kin discrimination, since social <b>participants</b> by <b>default</b> typically share recent common origin. Since kin selection theory emerged, much research has been produced investigating the possible role of kin recognition mechanisms in mediating altruism. Taken as a whole, this research suggests that active powers of recognition play a negligible role in mediating social cooperation relative to less elaborate cue-based and context-based mechanisms, such as familiarity, imprinting and phenotype matching.|$|R
30|$|Under the {{guidance}} of the advisory group, the process facilitators gather as much relevant data as possible prior to the first process workshop. Most critical public data include census data, tax assessor data, public utilities data, time series from past disasters (for example, electricity restoration durations), and damage/loss estimates. Initially, DESaster is parameterized using these data, as well as simulated data (for example, simulate household-level data from census block data). Process <b>participants</b> finalize <b>default</b> parameter distributions for process durations (for example, duration distribution for wood-frame house construction time) and resource magnitudes (for example, number of contractors to build a wood-frame house). This can be done by facilitating participants through a process to elicit parameter estimates or constraints—commonly referred to as expert elicitation. Process participants also finalize choices for data sources and input data, particularly to define resilience strategy scenarios to simulate and compare.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the default}} risks, {{systemic}} risk {{is of the}} biggest concern over the safety and effi-ciency of the payment and settlement system. When homogeneous financial institutions are linked with {{each other through the}} credit chain, a gridlock takes place as equilibrium in the payment and settlement system. A heterogeneous participant in the system could, however, have incentive to fulfill the obligation when otherwise homogenous <b>participants</b> strategically <b>default.</b> That is, fulfillment of obligation {{turns out to be a}} Nash equilibrium strategy for the heterogeneous participant whose level of investment return differs from those of remaining participants. The larger the benefit is, the stronger incentive a finan-cial institution has to keep the system working properly.

This strategy was introduced to Ethiopia in 1995 to reach full coverage in 2005; however, by 2009, treatment had not been as successful as expected. Objective: This {{study was conducted to}} determine treatment success rate and identify risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes in North Shoa Administrative Zone, Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all TB patients (739) who registered for TB treatment from September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2014 at public hospitals in North Shoa Administrative Zone, Ethiopia. Data were gathered by using a pretested structured medical record checklist. Four data collectors and two supervisors were involved in gathering the data. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression and were entered into Epi Info and analyzed by using the SPSS software package version 20. Results: This study revealed that the TB treatment success rate was 86. 1 % (169 [22. 9 %] cured and 467 [63. 2 %] completed). In addition, 22 (3 %) of the study <b>participants</b> <b>defaulted</b> their treatment of which 19 (86. 4 %) withdrew during the intensive phase. The multiple logistic regression model revealed that the study year of treatment, sputum smear positivity at the second-month follow-up, history of treatment default, and subsequent hospitalization were significantly associated with the TB treatment outcome. Conclusion: The TB treatment success rate in the study area was low compared to that estimated by World Health Organization to achieve by 2015. Therefore, Federal Ministry of Health and Regional and Zonal Health Office have to strengthen the interventions on minimizing anti-TB treatment default rate through well-organized documentation, follow-up on TB patients, and awareness-creation programs.

40|$|Abstract: The use of default {{options to}} {{influence}} retirement saving behavior is often {{portrayed as a}} Pareto improvement because it guides behavior without constraining individual choice. When defaults are irreversible, however, the welfare implications of defaults depend critically on why individuals default. We examine the active versus passive behavior of participants in a large public retirement plan {{when faced with a}} choice between defined benefit and defined contribution plans. We document substantial heterogeneity in the self-reported reasons for default, with substantial fractions of the population citing each of the major hypothesized reasons for defaults, including information problems, complexity, procrastination, endorsement effects, and deliberate defaults (i. e., those who consciously chose to default because the default plan was their preferred option). We show that <b>participants</b> who <b>default</b> are substantially more likely than active choosers to regret their plan selection, even relative to those who actively chose the same plan. We find that the extent of this regret varies significantly with the underlying reason for defaulting, with regret being significantly higher among those who defaulted due to information or procrastination, and significantly lower for those who defaulted deliberately...|$|R

We aimed to investigate the outcome {{of those who are}} eligible but do not start ART in the Malawi programme, factors associated with this dropout, and reasons for not starting treatment, in a prospective cohort study. Methods: Individuals having a first screening visit at the ART clinic at Karonga District Hospital, northern Malawi, between September 2005 and July 2006 were interviewed. Study follow-up to identify treatment outcomes was conducted at the clinic and in the community. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with dropout before ART initiation among participants identified as clinically eligible for ART. Results: 88 participants eligible for ART at their first screening visit (out of 633, 13. 9 %) defaulted before starting ART. Participants with less education, difficulties in dressing, a more delayed ART initiation appointment, and midupper arm circumference (MUAC) < 22 cm were significantly less likely to have visited the clinic subsequently. Thirty-five (58 %) of the 60 <b>participants</b> who <b>defaulted</b> and were tracked at home had died, 21 before their ART initiation appointment.

NEDCO is a Community Development Corporation and HUD approved Housing Counseling Agency, which serves two counties in Oregon. By tracking participant loan performance, specifically the occurrence of 90 -day default, the analysis aimed to draw inferences about the program’s impact. Demographic, mortgage and property information was gathered on both <b>defaulting</b> and non-defaulting <b>participants</b> in order to examine whether patterns of default are correlated with demographic or financial characteristics. These data were used to perform a logistic regression to determine whether certain indicators, such as annual income, are statistically significantly associated with default. The analysis also compared the annual percentage of NEDCO <b>participants</b> who <b>defaulted</b> to the annual percentage of Lane County homebuyers who defaulted on their loans in the same time period. Three research questions were examined: 1) Do homebuyer education participants have lower rates of default than the general population? 2) Among NEDCO participants, are there differences in demographic or mortgage characteristics between groups that did and did not default on their loans? 3) Are any demographic or mortgage characteristics significant predictors of default within the data of NEDCO participants...|$|R
30|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the haptic experiences highlighted unnecessary aspects {{of the situation and}} masked relevant aspects.

Without taking the time to compare the objects carefully, <b>participants</b> might have <b>defaulted</b> to the simplistic strategy of ignoring all but the most salient feature. However, this possibility also falls short on explaining the mistaken focus on heaviness. Differences in heaviness were likely to be less salient than differences in object size. In fact, the difference in mass between objects was very small and therefore relatively difficult - if not impossible - to be perceived haptically (cf., Weber, 1834 / 1978). And yet, the hands-on experience highlighted this feature of heaviness, not size.|$|R

International volunteers demonstrate that development practice {{is not the}} sole reserve of professional development workers. As actors conducting unofficial development work, defined as {{those who do not}} follow guidelines developed by the development industry and who do not have training in international development, international volunteers contribute to different understandings of development and foreign aid. Looking beyond volunteers' impact on the host country during the actual volunteer experience, this dissertation examines how international volunteers engage with the host country after completing their volunteer assignment and the development implications for the host country. Interview and survey data gathered from alumni of an international volunteer program in Vietnam operated by the nonprofit organization Volunteers in Asia (VIA) reveal four categories by which to classify former volunteers' engagement. These categories [...] committed contributors, <b>default</b> <b>participants,</b> potential contributors, and indifferent abstainers [...] -reflect the former volunteers' interest and their actual involvement in activities that contribute to Vietnam's socioeconomic development. Due to their continued linkages to people and processes in Vietnam, committed contributors and <b>default</b> <b>participants</b> represent a source of social capital for their former host country. Potential contributors, or those who are interested in contributing to Vietnam's development but have no record of involvement since their volunteer assignment, embody a potential source of social capital for Vietnam. The indifferent abstainers have little interest in partaking in Vietnam's development; consequently, they may not be considered an immediate source of social capital for Vietnam. The study reveals that the unofficial development practiced by international volunteers is centered on relationships, and through those connections between former volunteers and Vietnamese nationals flow goodwill, knowledge and skills, and money. Rather than manifesting as structural changes in Vietnam, the development undertaken by international volunteers brings personal transformations for the volunteers and the people with whom they interact...|$|R
40|$|The {{insights}} of choice architecture {{have led to}} expanded use of default settings in defined contribution (DC) plans in both the United States and Australia. The two countries have taken somewhat similar approaches {{to the content of}} default investment products. However, they differ significantly in how they allocate the legal responsibilities associated with those default investment products. This paper compares the two approaches, particularly regarding the role of disclosure and the assignment of fiduciary responsibility. It concludes that Australia’s approach offers two lessons for the U. S. First, disclosure to and education of <b>participants</b> who are <b>defaulted</b> into investment products is inadequate to negate conflicts of interest and investment risk.

40|$|A {{significant}} amount of research has proposed that power leads to heuristic and category based information processing, however, the evidence is often contradictory. We propose the novel idea that power magnifies chronically accessible information processing styles which can contribute to either systematic or heuristic processing. We examine heuristic (vs. systematic) processing {{in association with the}} need for closure. The results of three studies and a meta-analysis supported these claims. Power increased heuristic information processing, manifested in the recognition of schema consistent information, in the use of stereotypical information to form impressions and decreased the complexity of categorical representations, but only for those <b>participants</b> who, by <b>default,</b> processed information according to simplified heuristics, i. e., are high in need for closure. For those who prefer this processing style less, i. e., low in need for closure, power led to the opposite effects. These findings suggest that power licenses individuals to rely on their dominant information processing strategies, and that power increases interpersonal variability...|$|R

In three other treatments that are paired with the first three, they receive the same defaults, but are informed that defaults {{are thought to have}} an effect on their donation decisions. The emotional state of all individuals is monitored throughout the sessions using Facereading software, and some participants are required to report their emotional state after the donation decision. We find that the default level has no effect on donations, and informing individuals of the possible impact of defaults also has no effect. The decision to donate is independent of prior emotional state, unless specific subgroups of participants are considered. Donors experience a negative change in the valence of their emotional state subsequent to donating, when valence is measured with Facereading software. This contrasts with the selfreport data, in which donating correlates with a more positive reported subsequent emotional state...|$|R

40|$|Background: Early {{identification}} and intervention for infants {{and young children}} with developmental delays may negate or minimise the negative effect of a disability on a child's development. Poor follow-up on early detection referrals, however, undermines the effectiveness of early intervention programmes. Objectives: To identify factors, including text message reminders, that influence follow-up adherence for early intervention after developmental screening in primary health care. A secondary objective surveyed reasons for follow-up default. Methods: The PEDS Tools was used to screen 247 high-risk children. A risk assessment questionnaire was completed with caregivers whose children were referred for speech-language and/or occupational therapy (n= 106, 43 %). A quasi-experimental study was employed to identify risk factors for defaulting on appointments. A thematic analysis of telephonic interviews was also employed to determine reasons for follow-up defaults. Results: Follow-up adherence was 17 %. Participants who were divorced, widowed or never married were 2. 88 {{times more likely to}} attend a follow-up appointment than those who were married or living together (95 %, CI 0. 97 - 8. 63). Text message reminders did not significantly improve follow-up. More than half (58 %) of <b>participants</b> who <b>defaulted</b> on appointments could be reached for telephonic interviews. During the telephonic interviews 87 % of participants did not report concern about their child's development. Reasons for defaulting were employment, logistical issues, other responsibilities and forgetfulness.

Hence, {{this study is to}} report the long-term outcome of LSG as primary bariatric procedure and the result of revisional surgery. Methods: With retrospective analysis of a prospective bariatric database, <b>participants</b> who <b>defaulted</b> clinic follow-up were interviewed by telephone. A total of 667 LSG was performed as primary bariatric procedure (2006 – 2012) with mean age of 34. 5  ±  9. 7 years old, female 74. 7 %, mean body mass index (BMI) 37. 3  ±  8. 1  kg/m 2. A 36 -F bougie was used for all cases. Results: There were 61 patients available with long-term data. The weight loss outcome at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years showed a mean BMI 26. 3, 25. 2, 25. 3, 27. 1, and 26. 2 with mean excess weight loss (EWL) 76. 0 %, 79. 6 %, 77. 3 %, 73. 4 %, and 72. 6 % respectively. However, 17 % patients developed de novo gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Eighteen patients (2. 2 %) needed surgical revisions due to weight regain (n =  6), persistent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM; n =  2), stricture (n =  2), and GERD (n =  8). The revision resulted in an additional mean excess weight loss of 23. 8 % with mean BMI 24. 9  kg/m 2 at 6 months postoperatively. There was a 23. 7 % mean reduction of HbA 1 c with one patient who was in complete diabetic remission at 1 year.

One explanation for the perceived higher default risk in non-periphery countries is that market <b>participants</b> believed a <b>default</b> in the periphery might increase the risk of a future default in the core. To test for such dynamic contagion between credit related events in differing countries, we develop a procedure for tractably estimating high-dimensional Hawkes models using CDS prices. We escape the curse of dimensionality thanks to modelling the market portfolio of risk across countries, which serves as a sort of common factor. We further reduce dimensionality by taking a maximum-likelihood approach to estimation, avoiding having event intensities in the parameter set. Our approximation to the likelihood converges to the true likelihood as the sampling frequency goes to infinity; this ensures consistency even given non-stationarity, and permits tight identification.

While the use of defaults is sometimes portrayed as a Pareto improvement because it guides behavior without constraining individual choice, the welfare implications of defaults depends critically on why people default and whether the default is well-suited to those affected. In this paper, we use survey and administrative data on participants in a large public retirement system to explore who defaults on an important economic decision, why they default, and whether they subsequently regret their decision (or lack of decision). We find that information problems are an important contributor to the likelihood of default. We show that the likelihood of default increases with information problems, and that this holds true even after controlling for general and decision-specific knowledge, preferences and beliefs, {{and a variety of}} socioeconomic characteristics. We also find significant heterogeneity in the self-reported reasons for default, with sizable numbers of <b>participants</b> attributing their <b>default</b> to each of the commonly hypothesized reasons (e. g., endorsement effects, complexity, and procrastination), as well as to “deliberate defaulting ” by those who believe the default option represented the best choice, and to beliefs that the decisio...|$|R
40|$|We explore {{whether the}} known {{preference}} for default options in choice contexts-default effects-occur in altruistic contexts {{and the extent}} to which this can be explained through appeal to social norms. In four experiments, we found that (i) participants were more likely to donate money to charity when this was the default option in an altruistic choice context; (ii) <b>participants</b> perceived the <b>default</b> option to be the socially normative option; (iii) perceptions of social norms mediated the relationship between default status and charitable donations; and (iv) a transfer effect, whereby participants translated social norms they inferred from the default option in one domain into behavior in a second, related domain. Theoretically, our analysis situates default effects within a comprehensive body of social psychological research concerning social norms and the attitude-behavior relationship, providing novel empirical predictions. Practically, these findings highlight that the way donation policies are framed can have an important impact on donation behavior: in our third study, we found that 81 % donated half of their earnings for taking part in the experiment to charity when this was the default option, compared with only 19 % when keeping the money was the default. Our work suggests that making use of default effects could be an effective tool to increase altruistic behavior without compromising freedom...|$|R

Consequently, the failure of these systems may have a destabilising impact. Business continuity plans have thus been developed to ensure their robustness. However, their smooth functioning is also contingent on the capacity of participants to submit their payment orders. The Banque de France, in its role of overseer of the French payment systems, conducted a study with a view to enhancing its understanding of the consequences and the impact of the technical <b>default</b> of a <b>participant</b> in such systems. This study, carried out using a simulator of the functioning of the Paris Net Settlement (PNS) large-value payment system, operated by the CRI (Centrale des Règlements Interbancaires), shows that the technical <b>default</b> of a <b>participant</b> in this system has negative consequences on the smooth running of the system. Indeed, a situation in which a major participant, {{in the wake of a}} technical incident, is unable to submit its payment orders in a normal fashion to its counterparties in PNS, could further exacerbate congestion in the system and result in almost 10 % of payments being rejected among non-defaulting participants. The consequences of a technical default could nevertheless be greatly reduced if the participants set their bilateral sender limits at a lower level than that currently observed and if they reacted rapidly to information indicating a technical default by reducing their bilateral limits with the <b>defaulting</b> <b>participant</b> (defaulter). ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Rating {{systems are}} often used as design/decision tools to evaluate, grade, and reward {{infrastructure}} projects that meet sustain-ability criteria such as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, preservation of wildlife habitat, and accessibility to community cultural resources. Embedded within any such rating system is choice architecture, which refers to the way information is presented to a decision maker. This research examines the impact on design choices of changes to defaults in the choice architecture of the Envision rating system for sustainable infrastructure. Currently, the default score in each category of Envision is zero points. Points are earned by improving upon industry norms. To test the impact of changing these <b>defaults,</b> <b>participants</b> (senior-level and graduate students) randomly received either the current Envision version or a modified version with a higher <b>default</b> score, endowing <b>participants</b> with points in sustainability. All par-ticipants used their randomly assigned rating system to design an outdoor community center and stream restoration brownfield site. Simply modifying the default, by endowing points, led to setting significantly higher design goals. There {{were no significant differences}} in other variables measured, including student motivation or perceptions about Envision or sustainability. These findings suggest that how choices are presented to engineers influences their decision-making process and can lead to higher sustainability goals. The construction engineering and management community can use this understanding to encourage more desired infrastructure outcomes.

40|$|The {{volume of}} large-value funds {{transfers}} in the money, foreign exchange and securities markets has increased manifold {{during the last}} decade. This development has increased interbank debt positions and extensions of intraday credit resulting from payment transactions in the payment-intermediation sector. Systemic risk in these arrangements refers to the risk that one clearing system participant's failure to settle will cause one or more other <b>participants</b> to <b>default.</b> The danger of systemic failure exists in a clearing system in which payment messages are exchanged during the day but funds are transferred {{only at the end}} of the day. In this study, simulation with empirical data is used to measure the probability, extent and resulting effects of a systemic crisis in the Finnish payment system. The major finding of the study is that one participant's failure to settle in the Finnish payment system can cause serious problems for other participants but the danger of systemic failure is relatively small. On average the banks' largest counterparty risks are low and amount to less than 10 per cent of their own funds. However, on some days counterparty risk can amount to over 50 per cent of banks' own funds and thus constitute a systemic risk. Large counterparty risks however do not form long interbank chains that could lead to a domino effect. Even should a payment system participant suddenly be unable to settle, the other participants would probably manage to avoid serious problems. Although the simulation results indicate that presently the probability of systemic crisis in Finland is quite small, it is still important that payment system risk control be further developed. The environment in which the payment system operates is developing very rapidly, and risks are growing as volumes increase. As the system opens up to foreign credit institutions, Finnish payment system participants also find themselves dealing with more and more counterparties about whom they have no prior knowledge. System entry and risk control can no longer be based solely on trust; clear game rules are needed. As part of its task of overseeing payment systems, the central bank will need to closely monitor system developments, promote risk awareness in the markets and payment systems, and prevent the creation of systems in which it is possible for settlement failures to spread. This work should be done in cooperation with international organizations and the EU. systemic risk; clearing; settlement; Finland...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Chronic {{low back}} pain is a major health problem and one where pain, {{physical}} impairment and biological pathology are only very loosely correlated). It is considered {{that the experience of}} pain, its distress and disability is mediated by its meaning to the sufferer. The intention {{of this study was to}} explore the sufferers' personal experience of their pain. Design. Qualitative research is often recommended to complement the quantitative work on chronic pain that has been published to date. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was employed in an in-depth study of a small sample of chronic pain patients. Method. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with nine women pain patients. The verbatim transcripts of those interviews served as the data for an interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results. Four themes emerged which are described under the broad headings: searching for an explanation; comparing this self with other selves; not being believed; and withdrawing from others. Conclusions. The participants shared an inability to explain the persistent presence of their pain or to reconstruct any contemporary self-regard. While they used social comparisons to try and help them make sense of their situation, these comparisons proved equivocal in their outcome. Participants were unable to establish the legitimacy of the chronic nature of their pain and in certain situations felt obliged to appear ill to conform to the expectations of others. By <b>default,</b> <b>participants</b> treated their own pain as a stigma and tended to withdraw from social contact. They felt confused, afraid for their future and vulnerable to shame...|$|R
