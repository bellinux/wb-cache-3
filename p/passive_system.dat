25|$|Orange Harvest was an S {{band and}} X band radar warning receiver, capable of giving a {{directional}} bearing to surface ships or submarines that were transmitting radar emissions. Although less precise than the Shackleton's main ASV.21 search radar, it {{could give a}} greater detection range, provided that the target was emitting. As a <b>passive</b> <b>system,</b> it also had the advantage {{that it did not}} betray the aircraft's presence to its target.|$|E
25|$|Because {{thyristors}} {{can only}} be turned on (not off) by control action, and rely on the external AC system to effect the turn-off process, the control system only has one degree of freedom – when {{to turn on the}} thyristor. This limits the usefulness of HVDC in some circumstances because it means that the AC system to which the HVDC converter is connected must always contain synchronous machines in order to provide the commutating voltage – the HVDC converter cannot feed power into a <b>passive</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>systems</b> are {{embedded}} into the nuclear technology safety and design. In relation to safety, accumulators are {{one example of}} vital <b>passive</b> <b>systems</b> strictly needed to mitigate consequences of Large Break LOCA. In relation to design, the configurations of both PWR and BWR primary system is based on natural circulation: the mutual positions of core and steam generators {{in the case of}} PWR and the elevation of the feedwater nozzle in the BWR vessel are determined to ensure (at least) removal of decay heat when active systems – noticeably, centrifugal pumps – are not available. Immediately after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the <b>passive</b> <b>systems</b> received new attention by industry and scientists. Therefore, the importance of <b>passive</b> <b>systems</b> is well established in nuclear technology. Here one may add that <b>passive</b> <b>systems</b> include components like valves, pipes, heat exchangers and phenomena like draining of a tank, formation of incondensable gas bubbles, stratification and natural circulation. The discussion about reliability of <b>passive</b> <b>systems</b> shall include the components and the phenomena: a more detailed list of subjects {{can be found in the}} call for participation to the session. Special focus is given to the reliability of thermal-hydraulic phenomena expected during the operation of <b>passive</b> <b>systems.</b> The topic of reliability of phenomena occurring in <b>passive</b> <b>systems</b> was introduced before the year 2000, merging ideas from PSA and thermal-hydraulics...|$|R

50|$|Active {{systems will}} {{typically}} not focus through windows, since sound waves and infrared light are {{reflected by the}} glass. With <b>passive</b> <b>systems</b> this will generally not be a problem, unless the window is stained.

2500|$|In psychology, constructivism {{refers to}} many {{schools of thought}} that, though {{extraordinarily}} different in their techniques (applied in fields such as education and psychotherapy), are all connected by a common critique of previous standard approaches, and by shared assumptions about the active constructive nature of human knowledge. In particular, the critique is aimed at the [...] "associationist" [...] postulate of empiricism, [...] "by which the mind is conceived as a <b>passive</b> <b>system</b> that gathers its contents from its environment and, through the act of knowing, produces {{a copy of the}} order of reality." ...|$|E
50|$|There are two {{different}} systems associated with {{the mechanics of the}} cochlea: the classical <b>passive</b> <b>system</b> and an active process. The <b>passive</b> <b>system</b> works to stimulate the inner hair cells directly and works at levels above 40 dB. At stimulation levels that prevent the excitation of the <b>passive</b> <b>system,</b> prolonged noise exposure results in a decrease in the loudness heard over time, even when the actual intensity of the noise has not changed. This is caused by the exhaustion of the active process.|$|E

50|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>systems</b> are purely {{mechanical}} {{and rely on}} the “balanced beam” phenomena. The ‘beam’ will resist a “base” motion from affecting the camera positioned {{at the end of}} it because of the inherent inertia of the balanced beam.

50|$|The {{expense of}} a large concert active speaker system {{is less than the}} {{expense of a}}n {{equivalent}} <b>passive</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>passive</b> <b>system,</b> or integrated active system with external electronics, requires separate components such as crossovers, equalizers, limiters and amplifiers, all mounted in rolling racks. Cabling for passive concert systems is heavy, large-diameter speaker cable, more expensive than smaller diameter AC power cables and much smaller audio signal cables. For high-end home use, active speakers usually cost more than passive speakers because of the additional amplifier channels required.|$|E

50|$|A <b>passive</b> <b>system</b> is less {{expensive}} to install and is best suited for smaller buildings where one or possibly two MNOs need to be enhanced within the building and are not usually installed in spaces over 100000 sq ft. Passive systems require the RF power to be balanced among all the coverage antennas so there is uniform signal strength throughout the building. Expanding a <b>passive</b> <b>system</b> after the initial deployment could require a re-engineering of the entire system to ensure proper operation throughout the building. The number of in-building antennas and coverage area {{is dependent on the}} output power of the signal source.|$|E

5000|$|With a <b>passive</b> <b>system,</b> the {{pedestrian}} activates the device merely by {{walking up to}} the crosswalk. This is accomplished by using one of several motion detection devices. These include microwave, motion sensors, video detection, or a light trip beam. With an active system, the device is usually activated by a button that a pedestrian pushes in order to cross. These active systems are generally similar to lighted pedestrian signs at traffic intersections. Because many pedestrians may not realize {{that they need to}} press a button to activate the system, it is generally recommended to install a <b>passive</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

A digculty in a plying the passivity concept to electrohydraulic systems is iat they are not intnnsically passive. In a previous paper, passifica-tion techniques were developed to render single-stage di-rectional control valves as passive two-port devices with a supply rate related to the wer in ut at the hydraulic port. In this paper, we extend passiffcation technique to two stage pressure control servo-valves. The assified two-stage valve avoids the flow rate and bandwidthyimitations that ex-ist for single-stage valves. ...|$|R
50|$|General {{systems theory}} is about broadly {{applicable}} concepts and principles, {{as opposed to}} concepts and principles applicable to one domain of knowledge. It distinguishes, dynamic or active systems and static or <b>passive</b> <b>systems.</b> Active systems are activity structures or components that interact in behaviours and processes. <b>Passive</b> <b>systems</b> are structures and components that are being processed. E.g. a program is passive when it is a disc file and active when it runs in the RAM memory. The field is related to systems thinking and systems engineering.|$|R
