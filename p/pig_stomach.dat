5000|$|In the Pennsylvania Dutch {{region of}} the United States, the dish, known locally as seimaage, hogmal, stuffed hog maw ("maw" [...] is an old word for stomach), simply <b>pig</b> <b>stomach,</b> or Dutch goose (by {{those who are not}} Pennsylvania Dutch) is popular during the harvest season. Traditionally, <b>pig</b> <b>stomach,</b> not turkey, was the main course for Thanksgiving among Pennsylvania Dutch families. This {{tradition}} stems from the Old World, with the bulk of Pennsylvania Dutch settlers originating from the Palatinate. Unlike the German version, the dish is typically baked for several hours, rather than boiled.|$|E
50|$|Skilandis or Kindziukas is a Lithuanian sausage made of meat, fat, salt, {{pepper and}} garlic. The ground meat is {{traditionally}} pressed into a <b>pig's</b> <b>stomach</b> or bladder, but today may be contained in other skins. The sausage is dried and cold-smoked.|$|R

50|$|Czech Republic: In the Czech Republic, the huspenina or sulc (from German Sülze) is {{made from}} pig's heads and/or legs boiled together, chopped, mixed into their own broth, poured into a pan, and left in the cold to solidify. Other {{ingredients}} include onion, pepper, allspice, bayleaf, vinegar, salt, carrot, parsley, root celery, and sometimes eggs. A similar product, tlačenka, is basically huspenina with some more meat, chopped liver, and various offal, poured into a prepared <b>pig</b> <b>stomach</b> and left to solidify under the weight. Tlačenka is generally thicker than huspenina, and it is commonly eaten with chopped onions and sprinkled with vinegar.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the unique}} flavor of the legend, and the {{duration}} of its perpetuation, the story has appeared in many other forms of media and fiction. On the very first episode of MythBusters, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman put the Mikey rumor to the test by mixing six packs of Pop Rocks and a six-pack of cola inside a pig's stomach, complete with enough hydrochloric acid to simulate the acid inside a human stomach. Despite the <b>pig</b> <b>stomach</b> growing to three times its initial size, it did not blow up even after time was allotted for digestion, and the myth, unlike the pig's stomach, was therefore busted — in another stomach used as an experimental counterpart, only {{a large amount of}} sodium bicarbonate along with acid and soda (and without any Pop Rocks) was able to cause a gastric rupture. The broadcast included interview clips with Pop Rocks Inc. vice president Fernando Arguis explaining the candy and the myth, and Adam later alluded to the myth at a presentation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by showing that Pop Rocks and soda—albeit in a smaller amount—in his own stomach was not fatal.|$|E
5000|$|Meat was {{in rather}} scarce supply for most people, and was {{primarily}} eaten {{only on the}} main Christian holidays. Avid consumers of pork, Belarusians are less partial to mutton and beef. Most common was raw pork sausage - a pig intestine stuffed with minced or chopped meat seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic. Its common name - [...] "finger-stuffed sausage" [...] (каўбаса, «пальцам пханая» or in short пальцоўка) - provided a graphic description of the primitive production technology. Kishkа (кішка), or kryvyanka (крывянка), was a local blood sausage (крывяная каўбаса) made of pig’s blood and buckwheat grain. Škalondza (шкалондза), or kindziuk (кіндзюк), {{a particular kind of}} round sausage made of <b>pig</b> <b>stomach</b> filled with pork minced with spices - a relative of the Lithuanian skilandis - was known throughout the country. Borrowed from Italian cuisine by nobility in the 16th century, cold meat rolls, salcesons and balerons were common to all of society by the 19th century, and are still very popular. Smoked goose breast pauguski (паўгускі), a local Belarusian and Lithuanian delicacy, was once the pride of middle-class cuisine, but no longer exists today.|$|E

50|$|In Italy, {{regional}} {{varieties of}} blood sausage {{are known as}} 'sanguinaccio'. In Tuscany, buristo is a sausage made with pig's blood and fat cooked in a <b>pig's</b> <b>stomach.</b> It is not reheated and is often spread on bread. It is found only {{in the south of}} Tuscany in the winter months and even there {{it can be difficult to}} come by. Biroldo is another type of black pudding which can be found in Tuscany, while the version made in southern Lombardy is called Marsapan.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{forms of}} {{preparation}} existed for the dish. Outside of the fasting period, {{it was made}} from pork and chicken. The meat was finely chopped or ground and mixed with saffron, eggs, bread crumbs ,almonds and spices. It was then boiled in a saumagen (<b>pig's</b> <b>stomach),</b> after which the saumagen was removed, the meat mass was coated with an egg yolk and the dish was then baked until the egg and bread crumbs solidified. In its form, this dish may have been prepared to resemble a human head.|$|R

50|$|The mobile {{nature of}} Scots {{society in the}} past {{required}} food that should not spoil quickly. It was common to carry a small bag of oatmeal that could {{be transformed into a}} basic porridge or oatcakes using a girdle (griddle). It is thought that Scotland's national dish, haggis, originated in a similar way: A small amount of offal or low-quality meat, carried in the most inexpensive bag available, a sheep or <b>pig's</b> <b>stomach.</b> It has also been suggested that this dish was introduced by Norse invaders who were attempting to preserve their food during the long journey from Scandinavia.|$|R
40|$|A {{pathological}} {{study of}} Helicobacter spp. infection in pigs {{was performed to}} determine the incidence of Helicobacter spp. infection, and to define the relationship between Helicobacter spp. infection and the histopathological changes of gastric mucosa in pigs, using Warthin Starry stain and immunohistochemistry. A total of 115 biopsies of the cardia, fundus, body and pyloric antrum of swine (mean weight 150 kg) obtained from slaughterhouses in Nakornpathom province (Thailand) were investigated. Histopathological results of the cardia region showed thickening of mucosa 54. 78 % (63 / 115), vacuolated degeneration of the epithelium 83. 47 % (96 / 115), lymphoid aggregation 74. 78 % (86 / 115), inflammatory cells infiltration 38. 26 % (44 / 115) and neovascularized granulation tissue 10. 43 % (12 / 115). The presence of Helicobacter spp. by Warthin Starry stain and immunohistochemistry was 16. 52 % and 13. 91 % positive respectively. Helicobacter spp. was mostly seen in the epithelial surface of the pars esophageal region of stomach. There was no statistical difference in the mean histopathological scores of glandular regions (fundus, body and pyloric antrum) between Helicobacter spp. positive and Helicobacter spp. negative samples. The results showed no correlation between the histopathological changes in <b>pig</b> <b>stomachs</b> {{and the presence of}} Helicobacter spp. This study demonstrated the colonization of Helicobacter spp. in <b>pig</b> <b>stomachs</b> in Thailand. However, the bacteria seem not to be a major cause of gastritis or gastric ulcer in swine in Thailan...|$|R

40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody (2 B 3) {{directed against the}} calmodulin-binding (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) -dependent ATPase from <b>pig</b> <b>stomach</b> smooth muscle was prepared. This antibody reacts with a 130, 000 -Mr protein that co-migrates on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis with the calmodulin-binding (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) -ATPase purified from smooth muscle by calmodulin affinity chromatography. The antibody causes partial inhibition of the (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) -ATPase activity in plasma membranes from <b>pig</b> <b>stomach</b> smooth muscle, in pig erythrocytes and human erythrocytes. It appears to be directed against a specific functionally important site of the plasmalemmal Ca 2 +-transport ATPase and acts as a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding. Binding of the antibody {{does not change the}} Km of the ATPase for Ca 2 + and its inhibitory effect is not altered by the presence of calmodulin. No inhibition of (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) -ATPase activity or of the oxalate-stimulated Ca 2 + uptake was observed in a pig smooth-muscle vesicle preparation enriched in endoplasmic reticulum. These results confirm the existence in smooth muscle of two different types of Ca 2 +-transport ATPase: a calmodulin-binding (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) -ATPase located in the plasma membrane and a second one confined to the endoplasmic reticulum. status: publishe...|$|E
