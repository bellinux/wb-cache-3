As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti {{as part of}} the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti. Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar. These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both {{the quantity and quality of}} their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their <b>priority</b> <b>areas</b> are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E

A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada.

Normalized rank means (NRM) approach was selected in this priority analysis owing to a low compliance of water quality (WQ) {{in the study area}} with the government standard. With relatively poorer WQ, the downstream area of the basin has been identified as a <b>priority</b> <b>area</b> in which there has been a strong influence of rapid land use change of the basin's most urbanized area {{as well as that of}} industrial areas. By incorporating this priority analysis with allowable limit of load discharge inside this identified <b>priority</b> <b>area</b> as well as with proper land use management, overall BBWQM framework in the UCR Basin could be of prospective approach for future WQ improvement in the basin...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{subsidies}} were allocated to local authorities faced with acute areas of severe poverty (or other social problems). The Housing Act 1969 provided local authorities with {{the duty of}} working {{out what to do}} about 'unsatisfactory areas'. Local authorities could declare 'general improvement areas' in which {{they would be able to}} buy up land and houses, and spend environmental improvement grants. On the same basis, taking geographical areas of need, a package was developed by the government which resembled a miniature poverty programme. In July 1967, the government decided to pour money into what the Plowden Committee defined as Educational <b>Priority</b> <b>Areas,</b> poverty-stricken areas where children were environmentally deprived. A number of poor inner-city areas were subsequently granted EPA status (despite concerns that Local Education Authorities would be unable to finance Educational <b>Priority</b> <b>Areas).</b> From 1968 to 1970, 150 new schools were built under the educational priority programme.|$|E
