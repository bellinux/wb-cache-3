2500|$|Aluminium-tin alloys for <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> shells. Fulmer's {{researchers}} {{applied to}} the aluminum-tin alloy system the fundamental work of C S Smith {{on the relationship of}} interfacial energy and microstructure. [...] They established a process of cold work and recrystallization which converts the weak as-cast structure, in which aluminium grains are surrounded by tin, to one in which tin is dispersed in a strong aluminium matrix. [...] The aluminium provides the load-bearing required for a <b>plain</b> <b>bearing</b> while the tin gives the required bearing properties. [...] For many years these aluminium-tin bearings were used in most diesel engines and they are still in current use.|$|E

Much more noticeable were D5114â€“D5132 which were fitted with tablet catchers on the side of the drivers cab for use on the Far North Line from Inverness. Also very visible were the roof-mounted headcode boxes fitted from D5114 giving an outward appearance very similar to the later Class 25 but without horn grilles.|$|E

40|$|The {{major failure}} {{mechanism}} of typical spherical <b>plain</b> <b>bearings</b> with self-lubrication is the wear of the woven fabric liner, {{which is an}} orthotropic composite of different elastic properties in different directions. The elastic properties of the liner are required for studying the tribological properties of the spherical <b>plain</b> <b>bearings.</b> This paper aims to develop an elastic property analysis model suitable for three commonly used fabric liners through a theoretical analysis of the elastic properties {{in order to obtain}} the parameter expression of the compliance matrix.

A curious politeness, a soft and gracious manner, something effeminate and courtly, distinguishes the islanders of Apemama; it is talked of by all the traders, it was felt even by residents so little beloved as ourselves, and noticeable even in the cook, and even in that scoundrel's hours of insolence. The king, with his manly and <b>plain</b> <b>bearing,</b> stood out alone; you might say he was the only Gilbert Islander in Apemama. Violence, so common in Butaritari, seems unknown. So are theft and drunkenness. I am assured the experiment has been made of leaving sovereigns on the beach before the village: they lay there untouched. In all our time on the island I was but once asked for drink.
