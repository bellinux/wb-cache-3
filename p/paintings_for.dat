5|$|A pair {{of large}} canvases with hunting dogs by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1742), now {{hanging in the}} Salle du synode, once hung in the Parisian hôtel particulier of Samuel-Jacques Bernard. The three {{paintings}} in the chapel are copies of works by Antonio da Correggio: Adoration of the Shepherds, Virgin and Child with Sts Jerome and Madeleine, and The Rest on the Return from Egypt. They were made in 1724 in Modena and Parma by Robert deSéry (1686–1733) for Armand Gaston, whom he had met in Rome the same year. DeSéry would later provide many other <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> the cardinal's apartments, all of them copies of paintings by greater masters. Napoleon's green bed is an authentic work by Jacob-Desmalter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} {{more of her}} attention to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> the monastic chapels.|$|E

5|$|However, {{during the}} Song period, {{there were many}} {{acclaimed}} court painters and they were highly esteemed by emperors and the royal family. One of the greatest landscape painters given patronage by the Song court was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145), who painted the original Along the River During Qingming Festival scroll, {{one of the most}} well-known masterpieces of Chinese visual art. Emperor Gaozong of Song (1127–1162) once commissioned an art project of numerous <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute, based on the woman poet Cai Wenji (177–250 AD) of the earlier Han dynasty. The Southern Song dynasty court painters included Zhao Mengjian (趙孟堅, c.1199–1264), a member of the Imperial family, known for popularising the Three Friends of Winter.|$|E

His father died of malaria while working there. While in high school, Jarrell helped his mother tend the farm, but did not like the work. After graduating from high school, he joined the Army, was stationed at Fort Polk, Louisiana and served briefly in Korea. At Fort Polk he became company artist and made extra money designing shirts and making <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> fellow soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The De Beatis description, only rediscovered by Steppe in the 1960s, cast {{new light}} on the {{commissioning}} of a work that was previously thoughtsince it has no central religious imageto be an atypical altarpiece. Many Netherlandish diptychs intended for private use are known, and even a few triptychs, but the Bosch panels are unusually large compared with these and contain no donor portraits. Possibly they were commissioned to celebrate a wedding, as large Italian <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> private houses frequently were. Nevertheless, The Gardens bold depictions do not rule out a church commission, such was the contemporaneous fervor to warn against immorality. In 1566, the triptych served as the model for a tapestry that hangs at El Escorial monastery near Madrid.|$|E
5|$|Fuseli created {{two other}} works {{depicting}} the Three Witches for a Dublin art gallery in 1794. The first, entitled Macbeth, Banquo and the Three Witches was a frustration for him. His earlier paintings of Shakespearean scenes {{had been done}} on horizontal canvases, giving the viewer {{a picture of the}} scene that was similar to what would have been seen on stage. Woodmason requested vertical paintings, shrinking the space Fuseli had to work with. In this particular painting he uses lightning and other dramatic effects to separated Macbeth and Banquo from the witches more clearly and communicate how unnatural their meeting is. Macbeth and Banquo are both visibly terrified, while the witches are confidently perched atop a mound. Silhouettes of the victorious army of Macbeth can be seen celebrating in the background, but lack of space necessitates the removal of the barren, open landscape seen in Fuseli's earlier <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery of the same scene.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Bauer {{was asked}} by the Åhlén & Åkerlund {{publishing}} house (now Bonnier Group) to illustrate their new series of books, Among Gnomes and Trolls. The books would be published annually, and contain stories by prominent Swedish authors. The majority of Bauer's pictures for the book were full-page watercolor illustrations in a muted color scheme; he also contributed with covers, vignettes and other smaller illustrations. Bauer's most significant creatures, the trolls, were rendered in shades of gray, green, and brown, the colors of the forests, as if these beings had grown from the landscape itself. Due to the limitiations of the technology available to his printers, the 1907–10 editions were produced in just two colors: black and yellow. Some of Bauer's original <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> these prints were in full color.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to {{be integrated into the}} shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Academy {{exhibition}} brought Fuseli and {{his painting}} enduring fame. The exhibition included Shakespeare-themed works by Fuseli, which won him {{a commission to}} produce eight <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> publisher John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery. One version of The Nightmare hung {{in the home of}} Fuseli's close friend and publisher Joseph Johnson, gracing his weekly dinners for London thinkers and writers. The Nightmare was widely plagiarised, and parodies of it were commonly used for political caricature, by George Cruikshank, Thomas Rowlandson, and others. In these satirical scenes, the incubus afflicts subjects such as Napoleon Bonaparte, Louis XVIII, British politician Charles James Fox, and Prime Minister William Pitt. In another example, admiral Lord Nelson is the demon, and his mistress Emma, Lady Hamilton, the sleeper. While some observers have viewed the parodies as mocking Fuseli, {{it is more likely that}} The Nightmare was simply a vehicle for ridicule of the caricatured subject. The Danish painter, Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard, whom Fuseli had met in Rome, produced his own version of The Nightmare (Danish: Mareridt) which develops on the eroticism of Fuseli's work. Abildgaard's painting shows two naked women asleep in the bed; it is the woman in the foreground who is experiencing the nightmare and the incubus — which is crouched on the woman's stomach, facing her parted legs — has its tail nestling between her exposed breasts.|$|E

5|$|The {{sources of}} the two {{illustrations}} of Sydney Cove and the Aboriginal group are not known. The ceramic colouring bears a general resemblance to contemporary Sydney Cove images which implies that an original watercolour or hand coloured engraving was used for copying rather than black and white images. In {{the case of the}} Library punchbowl, the depiction of Sydney Cove is most likely done from an engraving after a now lost drawing by Lewin, which may date to 1814. This Sydney Cove engraving appeared as a full-page illustration in the second edition of A Statistical, Historical and Political Description of New South Wales and its dependent settlements in Van Diemen's Land etc (London, 1820) by Wentworth, with a later, smaller, version as one of ten Port Jackson harbour views illustrated on Map of Part of New South Wales (London, 1825) by publisher and engraver, Joseph Cross. As Australia's first professional artist, Lewin produced many <b>paintings</b> <b>for</b> Macquarie and his senior officers. He also made a number of commissions for Riley. Lewin had a close association with Antill and both were part of Governor Macquarie's 50-strong excursion party to inspect land and the new road over the Blue Mountains from 25April to 19May 1815. The road had been built by convicts in 1814, after the first European crossing by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and Wentworth in May 1813.|$|E
