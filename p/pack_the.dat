5|$|The adult {{wolves and}} their pups {{remained}} east of Medford in the Rogue River watershed, and in early 2015 officials named the group the Rogue <b>Pack,</b> <b>the</b> ninth contemporary wolf pack in Oregon. By July, wildlife biologists {{found evidence that}} OR-7 and his mate had produced a second litter of pups. A month later, trail cameras identified two new pups, bringing the known total of wolves in this pack to seven. By 2016, the pack size had grown to nine.|$|E

5|$|By the 2005–06 season, {{clubs in}} England were {{increasingly}} {{in favour of}} using the 4–5–1 system. Wenger, having earlier suggested he would never resort to a negative system, later adopted the formation for Champions League matches. The decision to <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> midfield and play a lone striker resulted in Arsenal reaching the final. With Fábregas breaking into the first team, Wenger chose to deviate from their counter-attacking style, to a more possession based one. In 2009–10, he instituted a fluid 4–3–3 formation to benefit from Fàbregas' creativity, and since the player's departure, had remodelled the system to 4–1–4–1 and 4–2–3–1. During {{the latter half of}} the 2016–17 Premier League season, Wenger switched to a 3-4-3 formation first used against Middlesbrough in a 1-2 win.|$|E

With New York deep at the centre position, his AHL assignment was predicated on him learning to play wing. He received numerous call-ups to New York and finished the 2000–01 campaign with 11 points over 28 games in the AHL and 12 points over 50 games in the NHL. The season also marked a management change as Glen Sather took over as general manager, marking the departure of Smith, who had drafted Malhotra and regarded him as untradeable during his tenure.|$|E
5|$|The sky-cycle airship {{continued}} {{to climb to}} about two thousand feet and then traveled north using the East River as a landmark and went to East Sixtieth Street. The reporter then steered the sky-cycle to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street. There he crossed the East River again and then hovered over Greenpoint. The reporter flew the sky-cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P. B. Gupther in Yonkers. Gupther helped the reporter deflate the balloon and <b>pack</b> <b>the</b> airship down {{to the size of}} a flat carpet bag. He then drove the reporter with his sky-cycle airship to the railroad station so he could get back to his place of origin.|$|E
5|$|Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, {{like its}} {{predecessor}} , is a third-person shooter. Players can control each transformer in both its robot and vehicle forms. Instead {{of a traditional}} health system, the game features a system similar to the Halo series of video games. The player character has both a regenerating shield and health, the latter {{of which can be}} replenished by a health <b>pack.</b> <b>The</b> weapon selection in Fall of Cybertron is expanded, with new weapons that can take on very significant upgrades, including one that allows a weapon to fire up to 75% faster. These are purchased through Teletran 1 kiosks found throughout the game.|$|E
50|$|Another {{factor in}} {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is liquid and vapor distribution entering <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed. <b>The</b> number of theoretical stages required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed, <b>the</b> liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed and <b>the</b> required separation will not be achieved. <b>The</b> <b>packing</b> will appear to not be working properly. The height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> itself but <b>the</b> mal-distribution of the fluids entering <b>the</b> <b>packed</b> bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> perform at maximum efficiency.

5|$|Wolf: The Journey Home, {{originally}} titled Hungry for Home: A Wolf Odyssey, is a 1997 American {{young adult}} novel written by 'Asta Bowen. Originally published by Simon & Schuster with line drawings by Jane Hart Meyer, it was retitled and reprinted without illustrations in 2006 by Bloomsbury Publishing. Based on true {{accounts of the}} Pleasant Valley, Montana, wolf <b>pack,</b> <b>the</b> novel traces {{the life of a}} female alpha wolf named Marta after the forced relocation of her pack in 1989 to an unfamiliar territory. Terrified, Marta abandons her pack and begins a journey in search of her home; she eventually arrives in Ninemile Valley, where she finds a new mate with whom she starts a new pack.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Gangstas in Space was released. In three missions, players {{continue}} the Saints Row: The Third {{story in a}} new arc about the Gangstas in Space film referenced in the main story. In the game, the film about the Saints is being directed by the self-interested Hollywood director Andy Zhen and the player is acting the final scenes of the film alongside a female co-star making her debut. In the first level, the player fights the military to save a female alien and controls the turret on the getaway vehicle. In the second, the player is in a shootout in a linear map. The last mission has the player in an aircraft fighting other aircraft while the co-star uploads viruses to transmitters. At the time of review, the player could not revisit the old missions to earn missed achievements, but was later patched. Costumes and vehicles are unlocked upon completing the <b>pack.</b> <b>The</b> pack was released in North America on February 21, 2012, and in Europe the next day.|$|E
5|$|Although OR-7 was {{the first}} gray wolf to visit California in nearly 100 years, other wolves have since {{migrated}} to Siskiyou County, {{just south of the}} Oregon–California border. In 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) released a photo of the Shasta Pack, consisting of two adults and five pups. The breeding pair came from the same pack as OR-7, making them his siblings. In 2017, the CDFW and the U.S. Forest Service determined that at least three wolf pups from a second <b>pack,</b> <b>the</b> Lassen Pack, can be traced to OR-7. One of OR-7s male offspring mated with another wolf to produce the pups, the birth of which made Journey a grandfather. The Lassen Pack, which lives in Lassen National Forest, is California's second pack since wolves were eradicated from the state in the 1920s. In June 2017, CDFW biologists fitted the female of the Lassen Pack breeding pair with a tracking collar.|$|E

5|$|An {{expansion}} <b>pack,</b> <b>The</b> Deeper Dungeons, {{was released}} on 30 November 1997. It features fifteen new levels each for single player and multiplayer, and an improved artificial intelligence for the enemies. The Avatar also reappears in the final level. A Direct3D version, which brought improved graphics and 3D acceleration support, and a level editor were released for the game. These add-ons, along with the Deeper Dungeons and a Dungeon Keeper-based desktop theme, were bundled with the game, re-released as Dungeon Keeper Gold Edition on 31 December 1998. Dungeon Keeper received a fan-made mod, called KeeperFX. This mod increases compatibility with later versions of Windows, fixes bugs, and adds features such as TCP/IP multiplayer support. A sequel, Dungeon Keeper 2 was released in 1999, and the series was rebooted by Mythic Entertainment {{with the release of}} a remake (also titled Dungeon Keeper) for iOS and Android on 30 January 2014.|$|E
5|$|By 2014, OR-7 {{had settled}} in the Rogue River {{watershed}} in the southern Cascade Range east of Medford, Oregon, with a mate. It is not known when the two wolves met, but DNA tests of fecal samples showed that she is related to wolves {{in two of the}} eight packs in northeastern Oregon. In early 2015, officials designated the two adult wolves and their offspring as the Rogue <b>Pack,</b> <b>the</b> first wolf pack in western Oregon and the state's ninth overall since wolves returned to Oregon from Idaho in the 1990s. The batteries in OR-7's tracking collar expired in October 2015, and monitoring the pack since then has depended on trail cameras and live sightings. Meanwhile, other wolves have migrated into the mountainous cross-border region, and relatives of OR–7 have formed two packs in northern California.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto III was {{released}} on 21 May 2002 for Microsoft Windows, supporting higher screen resolutions and draw distance, and featuring more detailed textures. The game was planned to be released on the GameCube and Xbox, though the version for the former was later cancelled. For its release on the Xbox in December 2003, Grand Theft Auto III was bundled with its sequel Vice City in a compilation titled Grand Theft Auto: Double <b>Pack.</b> <b>The</b> Xbox port features custom soundtrack support as well as improved audio, polygon models, and reflections over the previous ports. Double Pack was later bundled with San Andreas in a compilation titled , released in October 2005. The Trilogy was also released for OS X on 12 November 2010. For the game's tenth anniversary in December 2011, War Drum Studios ported Grand Theft Auto III to several iOS and Android devices. The port is almost identical to the Windows version of the game, in addition to enhanced textures and models and touchscreen controls. A PlayStation 3 version of Grand Theft Auto III {{was released}} on 25 September 2012 via the PlayStation Network.
