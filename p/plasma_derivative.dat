40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop methods for the rapid {{assessment}} of intimal quality of coronary bypass segments of venous origin, and to prevent endothelial damage by improved intraoperative handling of graft segments. Particular attention was paid to the influence of the composition of the preservation solution and the intravasal filling pressure on the degree of endothelialization. Intrava-sal exposure to Alcian blue at pH< 3 resulted in highly specific staining of intimal regions with functionally or structurally damaged endothelium. Standardization of preparation, staining and image acquisition of the intimal surface of graft remnants and subsequent computer-aided planimetry of these images made it possible for the first time to perform rapid serial investigations for quality control of bypass grafts. Using saline as the rinsing and intraoperative storage medium resulted in the loss of more than 50 % of the endothelium at intravasal pressures of 0 - 100 mmHg. Increasing the pressure resulted eventually in complete de-endothelialization. In contrast, grafts incubated in a customized <b>plasma</b> <b>derivative</b> tolerated pressures of up to 200 mmHg with no significant endothelial loss; and even after exposure to 1, 000 mmHg (10 times the average mean arterial pressure!) more than 70 % of the endothelium were intact and vital. These findings imply strongly that the quality of aortocoronary bypass grafts of venous origin can be improved substantially by the use of a <b>plasma</b> <b>derivative</b> solution for intraoperative preservation and by monitoring and controlling the intravasal pressures reached during sealing and storage...|$|E
40|$|This study investigated, by written survey, the {{perceived}} impact of recent technological {{changes on the}} American <b>plasma</b> <b>derivative</b> industry as they affected its two major products, serum albumin and antihemophilic factor (AHF). Those surveyed included product manufacturers, distributors, researchers and end-users. ^ Survey responses were analyzed to determine which factors were considered most likely to affect the <b>plasma</b> <b>derivative</b> industry, {{and the degree of}} consensus or divergence of opinion among and between the various sectors of the industry. ^ Two factors were viewed as most likely to have an immediate impact on the industry: production of albumin and AHF by genetic engineering, which is nearing reality; and, the realization that despite efforts aimed at viral inactivation, viral infections can be transmitted through transfusion of blood products. Furthermore, there is no industry wide consensus regarding how these changes will affect production, safety, availability, and pricing of plasma products. ^ Responses indicated that because of the possibility of viral transmission via plasma-derived AHF, there is a perceived need for a genetically engineered substitute for AHF (but not for albumin) and an expectation that such a product will be available soon. Price is viewed as the most important factor for Albumin while safety was the most important factor for AHF. Price was the third most important factor for this product. Respondents generally agreed that higher prices for antihemophilic factor will be accepted if there are improvements in safety, but also in packaging, and distribution systems. ^ The study concluded that because safety issues were moot with regard to albumin, it and AHF were not viewed as closely similar products although both are derived from human plasma, and each is used in treating serious medical disorders. ^ Additional changes appear imminent, and the results of the survey reveal that distribution channels for these products are changing. It does seem apparent that the industry will have to develop joint ventures with genetic research companies, and this process is underway. Finally, to remain viable and profitable, manufacturers will have to focus on producing additional products from human plasma. ...|$|E

Detection of infectious retrovirus in porcine {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and endothelial cells suggested {{to us that}} pig plasma is likely to contain PERV. Both PERV env sequences and viral reverse transcriptase (RT) activity were detected in all plasma samples isolated from four NIH minipigs. To detect infectious virus from plasma, we performed a culture assay using three cell lines of feline, swine, and human origin that had previously been shown to be permissive for PERV. Infectious virus was successfully cultured from all four NIH minipig plasmas on the swine cell line ST-IOWA. Using RT-PCR with env-specific primers, we could detect expression of PERV class C envelope in the supernatant of ST-IOWA cells that had been exposed to each pig plasma. We next examined a pig <b>plasma</b> <b>derivative,</b> Hyate:C (porcine factor VIII), and found evidence of PERV particles, since all six lots examined were positive for PERV RNA and RT activity. However, infectious virus could not be detected in clinical lots of Hyate:C, suggesting that the manufacturing process might reduce the load of infectious virus to levels below detectable limits of the assay. Detection of infectious virus in porcine plasma confirms and extends the previous findings that certain porcine cells express PERV when manipulated in vitro and clearly demonstrates that there are porcine cells that express infectious PERV constitutively in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{ensure the}} safety of <b>plasma</b> <b>derivatives,</b> {{screening}} for human parvovirus B 19 V genomic DNA in donated plasma using a pooling strategy is performed in some countries. We investigated the prevalence of B 19 V DNA and anti-B 19 V antibodies in Chinese <b>plasma</b> pools, <b>plasma</b> <b>derivatives</b> and <b>plasma</b> donations to evaluate the risk posed by B 19 V. Methods Using a Q-PCR assay developed in-house, we tested for B 19 V genomic DNA in 142 plasma pools collected between January 2009 and June 2011 from two Chinese blood products manufacturers. <b>Plasma</b> <b>derivatives</b> collected between 1993 – 1995 (10 batches of albumin, 155 batches of intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIG) and 2009 – 2011 (50 batches of albumin, 54 batches of IVIG, 35 batches of factor VIII, 7 batches of fibrinogen, and 17 batches of prothrombin complex concentrate, PCC) were also tested for B 19 V contamination. In addition, B 19 V genome prevalence in minipools(including 90 individual donations) of 49680 individual plasma samples collected between August 2011 and March 2012 by a single Chinese manufacturer was investigated. IgM/IgG was also investigated in plasma pools/derivatives and in minipools with B 19 V-DNA titers above 1 x 10 4 and 1 x 10 6 geq/mL using B 19 ELISA IgM/IgG assay(Virion-Serion, Würzburg, Germany), respectively. Results B 19 V-DNA was detected in 54. 2 % of plasma pools from two Chinese blood product manufacturers; among recently produced blood products, B 19 V was detected in 21 / 54 IVIG samples, 19 / 35 factor VIII samples, 6 / 7 fibrinogen samples, and 12 / 17 PCC samples, but not in albumin samples. The levels of B 19 V-DNA in these samples varied from 10 2 - 10 7 geq/mL. In samples with > 10 4 geq/mL genome DNA, B 19 V-specific IgG was also found in all corresponding plasma pools and IVIG, whereas none was detected in the majority of other <b>plasma</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Screening of <b>plasma</b> donations indicated that most minipools were contaminated with B 19 V-DNA (10 2 - 10 8 geq/mL) and one donation had 1. 09 [*]×[*] 10 10 geq/mL B 19 V genomic DNA along with a non-classical IgG/IgM profile. Conclusions Despite the implementation of some inactivation/removal methods designed to prevent viral contamination, B 19 V DNA was detectable in Chinese plasma pools and <b>plasma</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Thus, the introduction of B 19 V screening and discard donation with high viramic concentration for Chinese plasma donors would be desirable. </p...|$|R

The aim of this preliminary case-control study was to explore the efficacy of a dietary antioxidant supplement, in order to hamper the occurrences of ototoxicity in patients undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy.

Data on the inactivation of enveloped viruses by S/D treatment collected from seven Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association member companies demonstrate the robustness, reliability, and efficacy of this virus inactivation method. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The results from 308 studies reflecting production conditions as well as technical variables significantly beyond the product release specification were evaluated for virus inactivation, comprising different combinations of solvent and detergent (tri(n-butyl) phosphate [TNBP]/Tween 80, TNBP/Triton X- 100, TNBP/Na-cholate) and different products (Factor [F] VIII, F IX, and intravenous and intramuscular immunoglobulins). RESULTS: Neither product class, process temperature, protein concentration, nor pH value has a significant impact on virus inactivation. A variable that did appear to be critical was the concentration of solvent and detergent. CONCLUSION: The data presented here demonstrate the robustness of virus inactivation by S/D treatment for a broad spectrum of enveloped test viruses and process variables.

40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{parvovirus}} (PARV 4) and related variants in pooled human plasma {{used in the}} manufacture of plasma-derived medical products. Viral DNA was detected by using highly selective polymerase chain reaction assays; 5 % of pools tested positive, and amounts of DNA ranged from 10 6 copies/mL plasma. Using a sequence-independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification method, we recently identified a new parvovirus in plasma from a patient with exposures and symptoms consistent with acute HIV infection, but who was HIV RNA negative (1). Phylogenetic analyses of sequence data suggest that this virus, termed PARV 4, is only distantly related to previously known human or animal members of the family Parvoviridae, including members of the Erythrovirus genus known to infect humans, such as parvovirus B 19. Infection with parvovirus B 19, although frequently asymptomatic, may result in erythema infectiosum, arthropathy, pregnancy complications (e. g., hydrops fetalis), transient aplastic crisis, and disease in immunocompromised patients (2). Parvovirus B 19 is most frequently transmitted through the respiratory route or vertically from mother to fetus. However, blood- and plasma-derived medical products, particularly clotting factors, contaminated with parvovirus B 19 can also transmit the virus (3). Manufacturers of <b>plasma</b> <b>derivatives</b> screen minipools by using nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT), which has enabled levels of erythrovirus DNA to be substantially reduced in start pools; for certain products, screening is now a regulatory requirement (4).

We used a linked donor and recipient repository and a sensitive, quantitative B 19 V DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to assess such transmission in B 19 V-susceptible (ie, anti-B 19 V immunoglobulin G [IgG] negative) recipients. We assessed 112 B 19 V DNA–positive components from 105 donors (of 12 [*] 529 tested donations) transfused into a population of surgical patients with a pretransfusion B 19 V IgG seroprevalence of 78 %. We found no transmission to 24 susceptible recipients from transfusion of components with B 19 V DNA at concentrations less than 106 IU/mL (upper 95 % confidence interval, 11. 7 %). We found an anamnestic IgG response in one pretransfusion seropositive recipient transfused with a component containing greater than 1010 IU/mL B 19 V DNA.

Although minor evidence for a disturbance in coagulation was observed, there were no episodes of clinical bleeding. Four patients (20 %) had transient chills or fever. Based upon this experience, it can be concluded that reinfusion of cascade filtrated and concentrated ascitic fluid is a rapid, safe, and effective treatment for patients with tense ascites; it appears to have less side effects than more traditional methods and importantly does not require administration of heterologous <b>plasma</b> <b>derivatives...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives <b>Plasma</b> <b>derivatives</b> {{and blood}} {{components}} with {{low levels of}} parvovirus B 19 (B 19) seem not infectious, but recently infected, highly viraemic donors may transmit B 19. We studied the incidence of high-level B 19 viraemia (B 19 DNA > 106 IU/ml) in 6 center dot 5 million Dutch blood donations. Materials and Methods Between 2003 and 2009, all Dutch blood and plasma donations were screened for the presence of B 19 DNA, via pools of 480. Reactive pools were resolved and demographic parameters were obtained for all donors with B 19 viraemia > 106 IU/ml. In a subset, IgG and IgM antibodies to B 19 were determined. Results Four hundred and eleven donations (1 / 15815) were identified with B 19 DNA levels above 106 IU/ml, predominantly (83 %) occurring in donors aged 18 - 47 years. Each year infection rates were elevated between December and July, with April accounting for 16 % of infections. The years 2004 and 2009 were epidemic, with up to 1 / 4880 highly viraemic donations in May 2004. In a subset of 67 viraemic donations, 47 / 67 (70 %) tested negative for IgG and IgM antibodies to B 19; 16 / 67 (24 %) showed isolated IgM and 4 / 67 (6 %) contained IgG and IgM antibodies. The seasonal pattern of asymptomatic B 19 infection in blood donors followed the notification rate of clinical cases. Geographically, B 19 infection was randomly spread over the Netherlands. Conclusions In epidemic seasons, blood donations with high levels of parvovirus, without concurrent antibodies, are common. They may infect immunocompromised and parvovirus-naive recipients. The feasibility of preventive measures should be studie...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Hepatitis A {{virus is}} {{transmitted}} via the faecal-oral route {{and is the}} most common cause of acute viral hepatitis in the world. Anti-HAV seroprevalence is higher in less developed regions of the world. Transmission of HAV by transfusion is rare. It may occur if the blood is donated in the short time of viremia before the onset of symptoms. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of HAV IgG in Slovenian blood donors, and associated with that the susceptibility rate of donor population for HAV infection. Methods: The presence of HAV IgG antibodies was determined in 1000 blood donors from different regions in Slovenia. The testing was performed with CMIA assay on the Architect platform with HAVAb IgG reagents. The results were compared to the results obtained in 1995 on the AxSYM testing systemResults: In 1995 we got 55 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 52 % to 58 %) prevalence of HAV IgG in blood donors. In 2012, the prevalence was only 28 % (95 % CI: 25 % to 31 %). In older population, the prevalence was higer than in younger population, especially before 45 years of age (53 % (95 % CI: 47 % to 58 %) in individuals aged > 45, and 14 % (95 % CI: 11 % to 17 %) in individuals aged ≤ 45 years; p< 0. 0001). Conclusion: More than 80 % of Slovenian blood donors before 45 years of age are susceptible to HAV infection. The incidence of transfusion transmitted HAV infection can be prevented by vaccination of risk groups, careful donor selection procedures and efficient virus inactivation during manufacture of <b>plasma</b> <b>derivatives...</b>|$|R

40|$|Oxidative stress {{increases}} with advancing age {{and is a}} mediator of several diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Moreover, postmenopausal women have a lower estrogen concentration, which is associated with elevated oxidative stress. However, there is no definitive evidence regarding the relationship between daily physical activity and oxidative stress status in older adults, including postmenopausal women. Twenty-nine adults (age, 70. 1 ± 1. 0 years, mean ± SE; 12 women and 17 men) were examined in this cross-sectional study. Prior to blood collection, {{the participants were asked}} to wear a uniaxial accelerometer for 4 consecutive weeks to determine their level of physical activity. After a 48 -h period of physical activity avoidance and a 10 -h overnight fast, venous blood samples were obtained from each participant. Fasting <b>plasma</b> <b>derivatives</b> of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations of oxidative stress markers were negatively correlated with the amount of physical activity in women (d-ROMs; r = - 0. 708, p = 0. 002) (MDA; r = - 0. 549, p = 0. 028), but not in men. Fasting plasma biological antioxidant potential of antioxidant capacity marker was positively correlated with the amount of physical activity in women (BAP; r = 0. 657, p = 0. 006) (GSH; r = 0. 549, p = 0. 028), but not in men. Moreover, superoxide dismutase activity of antioxidant capacity marker was positively correlated with the amount of physical activity in men (r = 0. 627, p = 0. 039), but not in women. There were no associations between physical activity and other oxidative stress markers (reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione peroxidise, thioredoxin). These findings suggest that regular physical activity may have a protective effect against oxidative stress by increasing total antioxidant capacity, especially in postmenopausal wome...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Understanding of the {{pathophysiology}} {{of autism}} spectrum disorder (ASD) remains limited. Brain overgrowth has been hypothesized {{to be associated}} with the development of ASD. A derivative of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), secreted APPα (sAPPα), has neuroproliferative effects and has been shown to be elevated in the plasma of persons with ASD compared to control subjects. Reduction in sAPPα holds promise as a novel molecular target of treatment in ASD. Research into the neurochemistry of ASD has repeatedly implicated excessive glutamatergic and deficient GABAergic neurotransmission in the disorder. With this in mind, acamprosate, a novel modulator of glutamate and GABA function, has been studied in ASD. No data is available on the impact of glutamate or GABA modulation on sAPPα function. METHODS: <b>Plasma</b> APP <b>derivative</b> levels pre- and post-treatment with acamprosate were determined in two pilot studies involving youth with idiopathic and fragile X syndrome (FXS) -associated ASD. We additionally compared baseline APP derivative levels between youth with FXS-associated or idiopathic ASD. RESULTS: Acamprosate use was associated with a significant reduction in plasma sAPP(total) and sAPPα levels but no change occurred in Aβ 40 or Aβ 42 levels in 15 youth with ASD (mean age: 11. 1 years). Youth with FXS-associated ASD (n = 12) showed increased sAPPα processing compared to age-, gender- and IQ-match youth with idiopathic ASD (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Plasma</b> APP <b>derivative</b> analysis holds promise as a potential biomarker for use in ASD targeted treatment. Reduction in sAPP (total) and sAPPα may be a novel pharmacodynamic property of acamprosate. Future study is required to address limitations of the current study to determine if baseline APP derivative analysis may predict subgroups of persons with idiopathic or FXS-associated ASD who may respond best to acamprosate or to potentially other modulators of glutamate and/or GABA neurotransmission...|$|R

40|$|Background: Grape and {{blueberry}} extracts {{are known}} to protect against age-related cognitive decline. However, beneficial effects achieved by mixing grape and blueberry extracts {{have yet to be}} evaluated in dogs, or their bioavailability assessed. Of concern to us were cases of acute renal failure in dogs, after their ingestion of grapes or raisins. The European Pet Food Industry Federation (2013) considers only the grape or raisin itself to be potentially dangerous; grape-seed extracts per-se, are not considered to be a threat. Our aim was therefore to evaluate the renal and hepatic safety, and measure <b>plasma</b> <b>derivatives</b> of a polyphenol-rich extract from grape and blueberry (PEGB; from the Neurophenols Consortium) in dogs. Polyphenol expression was analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS over 8 hours, for dogs given PEGB at 4 mg/kg. Safety was evaluated using four groups of 6 dogs. These groups received capsules containing no PEGB (control), or PEGB at 4, 20, or 40 mg/kg BW/d, for 24 weeks. Blood and urine samples were taken the week prior to study commencement, then {{at the end of the}} 24 -wk study period. Routine markers of renal and liver damage, including creatinine (Creat), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, minerals, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and alanine transaminase (ALT) were measured. Biomarkers for early renal damage were also evaluated in plasma (cystatin C (CysC), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)), and urine (CysC, clusterin (Clu), and NGAL). Ratios of urinary biomarkers to Creat were calculated, and compared with acceptable maximal values obtained for healthy dogs, as reported in the literature. Results: While several PEGB-specific polyphenols and metabolites were detected in dog plasma, at the end of the PEGB consumption period, our biomarker analyses presented no evidence of either renal or liver damage (Creat, BUN, ionogram, albumin and ALT, ALP). Similarly, no indication of early renal damage could be detected. Plasma CysC, urinary CysC/Creat, Clu/Creat, and NGAL/Creat ratios were all beneath reported benchmarked maximums, with no evidence of PEGB toxicity. Conclusions: Long-term consumption of a pet specific blend of a polyphenol-rich extract from grape and blueberry (PEGB; from the Neurophenols Consortium), was not associated with renal or hepatic injury, and can therefore be considered safe...|$|R
