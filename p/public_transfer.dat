40|$|How {{effective}} are <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> {{in protecting}} households facing financial crisis-induced negative shocks? Existing studies {{have not yet}} carefully considered the inter-relationship between <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> and the existing private transfer network. In {{the context of the}} financial crisis in Korea, this paper investigates the possible crowding-out effect of <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> on private transfers by explicitly considering the endogenous responses of private <b>transfers</b> against <b>public</b> <b>transfers.</b> By using two Korean household-level panel data sets for the periods of 1995 - 1998 and 1998 - 2003, we found a post-crisis, but not pre-crisis crowding-out effect of public transfers; more importantly, a crowding-in effect is observed during the crisis. The results suggest that private transfer networks were strengthened under the initial phase of the financial crisis, which possibly complemented <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> {{due to the lack of}} effective formal safety nets, while <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> became effective after the crisis, thereby replacing private transfers. Our results suggest that particularly at the initial stage of the crisis, the government could have played an important role in assisting households to weather the negative impacts of the crisis. ...|$|R

Based on German data we find that the giving of private transfers is influenced by <b>public</b> <b>transfers.</b> The close link between <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> to the elderly and the financial support they give to others represents an inefficient backflow of pay-as-you-go financed pensions to the young generation.

40|$|Using {{household}} panel data from Korea for 1995 - 1998, this paper shows {{that during the}} Asian financial crisis, private and public trasfers well targeted the poor, although they excluded vulnerable groups {{before and after the}} crisis. Four key findings emerge from our econometric analysis. First, householed with unemployed heads were well supported by private and <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> before and during the crisis while households with heads engaged in agriculture, fisheries and part-time jobs were supported only by private transfers during the crisis. Second, lager housuholds that are poor but less vulnerable tended to receive more <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> and households with more elderly that are poor and more vulnerable tended to receive more private and <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> during the cirsis. Third, female-headed households that are poor but not vulnerable tended to receive more private and <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> while urban hoseholds that are not poor but more vulnerable received relatively less private and <b>public</b> <b>transfers.</b> Finally, we find that only poor Korean households were well protected by both inter-household transfers and bovernment transfers during the crisis and there had been a strong crowding-out relation between private and <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> throughout the period. This suggests that the Korean government should reconsider its targeting scheme in order to assist not only the poor but also the vulnerable and to prevent crowding-out effects of its social safety net programs.

40|$|The intergenerational {{impact of}} <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> on the {{economic}} and social outcome in a society is discussed ambiguously. A considerable amount of research generally found that parental welfare participation may encourage the welfare dependency of future generations and thus perpetuate generational poverty cycles (Gottschalk 1992, Vartanian 1999, Pepper 2000, Page 2004). <b>Public</b> <b>transfers</b> prevent persons from developing their resources or to take advantage of existing opportunities. Human capital such as education and work experience is not valued, and there is little motivation to pursue full-time employment (Hill and Duncan 1987, Mayer 1997, Corak and Heisz 1999). At the other side <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> are said to result in an overall improvement in the living standards of the poor (Ellwood and Summers 1986). In this view, <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> and redistributive taxes might be dedicated to narrow the gap between the income of the parents so that the incomes of the children converge to the mean more quickly (Corak 2006). The paper aims to analyze the implications of <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> on the intergenerational income inequality and poverty trends in Germany and the United States, two countries differing concerning welfare policy regimes, labor market settings and family role models.

Using government data during 1990 - 2003, we estimate that 1 $ of <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> displaces 30 - 50 cents of inter-household transfers. One {{explanation is that the}} old parents in this analysis were from poor families and they reacted strongly to allowances. However, the overall consumption, especially in luxury goods, of the poor individuals has substantially increased.

Since uses (future leases in land) had been limited by the Statute of Uses (and remain subject to disincentives in many jurisdictions), another instrument had to be found. That instrument was the lease for a year (lease for possession) followed on the following day by a release of the property, thus avoiding livery of seisin. The instrument thus consists of two parts: (i) a lease for one year on one day; (ii) a release on the following day. In the lease for a year, the consideration was nominal (usually 5s.) and the term of the lease one year. The release was executed the day after the lease, releasing the property to the 'lessee' in perpetuity; the full purchase price (consideration) is recited in the release; the release recites mentions the lease of the previous day; the release is executed 'according to the statute for converting uses into possession' (the Statute of Uses)." ...|$|E

A much larger urban to rural income gap {{in combination with}} a much smaller proportion {{of people living in}} urban areas in China are important reasons for this cross-country difference in inequality.

While Russian <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> reduce income inequality, Chinese <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> increase income inequality. Cross-country differences in the process of transition are also found to be significant. A relatively large non-agriculture self-employment sector is non-equalising in rural China, but is also narrowing the urban to rural income gap.

A model of individual retirement is set up where employers may influence worker retirement age through pay policy. A conventional dynamic structural model is extended to allow both individual and employer heterogeneity. Empirically, identification of the employer effects on income and retirement is achieved by exploiting a longitudinal sample of Danish small-to-medium sized private sector establishments matched together with all of their workers. Identification of the effect of <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> on income and retirement is through exogenous eligibility rules and reforms to a public early retirement programme.

Our data are drawn from a longitudinal sample of Danish citizens for the years 1981 - 2000. In practice, we work with a 10 per cent sample of the adult population. In particular, we have very full records for each person throughout the sample period. We can identify all persons who {{have been involved in}} a road accident in the data period if they were hospitalised subsequently. We use the method of 'matching on observables ' to estimate the counter-factual of what the disposable income, earnings, the number of working hours, and the amount of <b>public</b> <b>transfer</b> income would have been of a particular group of persons injured by road accidents if they had not in fact been injured. We find that road injuries have no significant overall effect on disposable income, but find significant effects on employment rates. In the long run (after 6 years) the employment rates for the injured are 7 and 5 percentage points lower for men and women, respectively than for non-injured persons. Besides, earnings are reduced in the long run for men where no significant effects are found for women. This indicates that people suffering from road inju-ries, on average, are compensated in terms of either the same wages during illness, or from other components of the disposable income.

In turn, non-Keynesian effects dominate in the case of public wages where cuts are expansionary and indirect taxation where raises are neutral. Accordingly, cuts in public wages and raises in indirect taxations are the two most desirable instruments for fiscal consolidation in Portugal. Finally, deficit-neutral policies that offset raises in <b>public</b> <b>transfers,</b> <b>public</b> consumption, and public investment, with raises in indirect taxes have long-term positive effects on output.
