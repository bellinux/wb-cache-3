25|$|Its age {{has been}} {{controversial}} since the 1870s, when many <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{was only a}} few decades old. Later, the cone and associated lava flows were thought to have formed about 1700 or during a 300-year- long series of eruptions ending in 1851. Recent studies by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists, working in cooperation with the National Park Service to better understand volcano hazards in the Lassen area, have firmly established that Cinder Cone was formed during two eruptions that occurred in the 1650s.|$|E
25|$|Television {{shows have}} and {{continue}} to aid the success and public opinion of the Body Farm. Before programs like , {{there was a great}} deal of protest and controversy that surrounded the Body Farm mainly because <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was grotesque, barbaric and an insult to the deceased, to let their bodies decompose for unnecessary scientific reasons. CSI, accompanied by scientific advances, has helped the public come to terms with this research. As a result, an increased number of citizens are willing to donate their bodies after passing to aid this research.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{previous}} experience in the navy, Every was promoted to first mate after joining the Spanish Expedition. The convoy's four ships were commanded by Admiral Sir Don Arturo O'Byrne, an Irish nobleman who had previously served in the Spanish Navy Marines. This was an odd occurrence at the time and many <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> boded ill for an Irishman to control an English fleet. Indeed, the voyage was soon in trouble, as the flag captain, John Strong, a career mariner who had previously served with Sir William Phips, died while the ship was still in port. Although he was replaced by Captain Charles Gibson, this would not be the last of the venture's misfortunes.|$|E
25|$|In {{that same}} year, {{by his own}} account, Samuel went to his {{employer}} and a More family friend, Lord Zouche, Lord President of the Council of Wales, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Privy Counselor, {{to draw up a}} plan for the disposition of the children. Zouche had been {{an active member of the}} Virginia Company and in 1617 he invested £100 in an expedition to the Colony of Virginia, which is where the Mayflower was supposed to have landed. It was his actions that were instrumental in putting the More children on the Mayflower. At that time, children were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as labourers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were over-ridden by the Privy Council, namely, Lord Zouche. Most <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> a death sentence and indeed, many did not survive either the voyage or the harsh climate, disease and scarcity of fresh food for which they were ill-prepared.|$|E
25|$|The Tale was {{immediately}} popular and controversial. Consequently, there were rumours of various people {{as the author}} of the work— Jonathan Swift then being not largely known except for his work in the House of Lords for the passage of the First Fruits and Fifths bill for tithing. Some people thought that William Temple wrote it. Francis Atterbury said people at Oxford thought it had been written by Edmund Smith and John Philips, though he thought it was by Jonathan Swift. Some <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> belonged to Lord Somers. However, Jonathan Swift had a cousin, also in the church, named Thomas Swift. Thomas and Jonathan were in correspondence {{during the time of the}} composition of the Tale, and Thomas Swift later claimed to have written the work. Jonathan responded by saying that Thomas had no hand in anything but the smallest of passages, and he would welcome hearing Thomas 'explain' the work, if he had written it. The controversy over authorship is aggravated by the choice of publisher. Not only did Swift use Tooke after the publication of the Tale, he had used Tooke before its publication as well, so the appearance of the work in John Nutt's shop was atypical.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the game}} had [...] "incredible {{role-playing}} potential", {{the concept of}} role-playing rabbits {{can be viewed as}} bizarre, and as such at least one commentator believes that [...] "most <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was stupid" [...] when it was first released. This view is mirrored by Lev Lafayette, who, when describing his first exposure to the game, says [...] "Oh, how we laughed. 'Who on earth would want to roleplay a rabbit?', we mocked. 'What's the point? You can't do anything!'".|$|E
500|$|In an April 2010 {{interview}} with South Yorkshire newspaper The Star, Grant expressed his disappointment with the side-project band's sudden increase in success and awareness, {{in which he}} claimed that he wanted the band to continue playing in clubs with a slower ascendency to the bigger venues. The tour promoter however suggested that Renegades should play slightly bigger venues for the second tour than of those seen on their debut. Looking back on {{this version of the}} band, Grant Nicholas explained in an {{interview with}} Culture Deluxe, that the project was not a big marketing plan, but announced it without saying exactly what was happening. Some <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a name change, Grant recording a solo album, while others got the idea from the start. He described problems with promoters printing [...] "Feeder" [...] on the tickets, leading to a misunderstanding that a more mainstream set was expected.|$|E
500|$|By October 1974, the Australia-only album High Voltage {{had been}} recorded. It took only ten days and {{was based on}} {{instrumental}} songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd. Later that year they released the single [...] "It's a Long Way to the Top", for which a well-known promotional video was made for the program Countdown, featuring the band miming the song {{on the back of}} a flatbed truck. The song is regarded as their perennial rock anthem. It was included on their second album, TNT (1975), which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand. T.N.T. featured the song [...] "High Voltage", which was the first song written and recorded for the album. Because [...] "High Voltage" [...] was released as a single before T.N.T. was released, some <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was the title track to AC/DC's debut album.|$|E
50|$|The fire, catastrophic {{though it}} was, {{presented}} {{the opportunity for}} some major new architectural work.

500|$|Since 2011, Genesis have {{expressed}} mixed opinions about a reunion. Collins {{retired from the}} music industry as an active musician that year in favour of family commitments and has stated {{he can no longer}} play the drums due to medical issues. Hackett has said [...] "I would say it's possible, but highly improbable. I've always been open to it. I'm not the guy who says no." [...] Gabriel addressed the possibility of a reunion: [...] "I never say never. It really didn't happen last time. I think there's a small chance, but I don't think it's very high." [...] In 2014, Collins reiterated, [...] "Have <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> through? It’s not as if you’re going to get Peter as the singer, me as the drummer. I can’t play any more, so it’s never going to happen," [...] adding it would not be likely for Gabriel to perform songs Collins originally sang lead on.|$|E
500|$|From {{his first}} National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college games for DePaul on, Mikan {{dominated}} his peers. He intimidated opponents with his size and strength, was unstoppable on offense with his hook shot, and soon established {{a reputation as}} one of the hardest and grittiest players in the league, often playing through injuries and punishing opposing centers with hard fouls. In addition, Mikan also surprised the basketball world with his unique ability of goaltending, i.e. jumping so high that he swatted the ball away before it could pass the hoop. In today's basketball, touching the ball after it reaches its apex is a violation, but in Mikan's time it was legal because <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was impossible anyone could reach that high. [...] "We would set up a zone defense that had four men around the key and I guarded the basket", Mikan later recalled his DePaul days. [...] "When the other team took a shot, I'd just go up and tap it out." [...] As a consequence, the NCAA and later the NBA, outlawed goaltending. One of the few opposing centers to have any success against Mikan was Bob Kurland, a seven-footer from Oklahoma A.|$|E
500|$|Elton John, the English {{singer and}} songwriter, {{appears as a}} guest vocalist for Chef's song, {{in one of the}} {{earliest}} celebrity spoof appearances on South Park; Trey Parker, who provided the voice for Elton John, said many <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was the actual John singing because his impression was so accurate. In another musical reference featured in the episode, several characters claim the real-life Canadian rock group Loverboy wrote a song {{about the fact that the}} DNA of an elephant and pig will not splice. [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] includes several pop cultural references to films and television shows. The last line in the episode, [...] "That'll do pig", spoken by Cartman, is a reference to the final line of the 1995 film Babe, a movie about a talking pig, which Stone has described as one of his favorite films. When the boys try to tell Officer Barbrady about the clone, he suggests that the boys have seen too many episodes of the X-Files. In the scene in which Pip is introduced, Stan asks Pip about his peculiar name, but Cartman interrupts Pip during his answer. Pip's reply – [...] "my father's family name being Pirrip and my Christian name Phillip, my infant tongue--" [...] – is identical to the opening line of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, which is narrated by its protagonist, Pip. The fourth season episode [...] "Pip" [...] is a parody and comedic retelling of the novel, and stars Pip, who assumes the role of his namesake.|$|E

At any rate since it happened every night, <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> as suspicious, and it was rumored to have perhaps been a fox or tanuki.|$|R
2500|$|The Red Dwarf episode [...] "Tikka to Ride" [...] {{features}} a recreation {{of the shooting}} which was shot meticulously using the Zapruder film as a reference.

2500|$|Haxey in Lincolnshire (the Haxey Hood, {{actually}} {{played on}} Epiphany). In 1752 the Julian calendar was {{changed for the}} Gregorian calendar. To achieve this the days between 2 and 14 September were omitted that year. In some villages <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{was not possible to}} remove 11 days from a year so refused to accept the new calendar. As a result, Christmas Day was celebrated on 5 January in those villages. The Haxey Hood is played the following day on what would have been the feast of Stephan or Boxing Day if 11 days had not been removed from the calendar.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the film}} was finally {{released}} and the reviews came in, they revealed that most critics never caught the differences in [...] accent, diction, and timbre between Scott and Bacall. Bacall's accent is pre-World War II, upper middle-class New York metropolitan, often mistaken for Mid-Atlantic due to the broad [...] "A" [...] and nonrhotic pronunciation of words containing [...] "R". Unlike Scott's inherited low tone, Bacall originally had a naturally high tone with a nasal timbre and fast tempo, but had trained herself to pitch her voice lower and slow down her delivery. Despite Bacall's [...] "mannered toughness" [...] and Scott's [...] "breathy theatricality", when Bacall did the voice-over for a 1990s cat-food commercial, some <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was Scott.|$|E

Torrey adopted the cause as his own and although tuberculosis caused him to suspend his studies for a year, he became an active worker for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, which was headed by William Lloyd Garrison. Garrison believed that slavery could best be abolished by “moral suasion,” i.e., changing the way <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> about <b>it</b> through lectures and pamphlets.|$|R

At that time, there weren't any two bands that sounded alike; these days everyone sounds exactly the same". Kenzi (Kamaitachi, The Dead Pop Stars, Anti Feminism) commented in 2009 that [...] "back in the day, there were bands, but people would try to do things differently. Nowadays, there's one band, and everyone copies off of them", with Free-Will founder and Color frontman Tommy concluding with [...] "I don't think our breed of visual kei exists anymore".|$|E

And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country." [...] In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, [...] "Some <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was racist—I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism." [...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that it was a horrible thing to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, The Exorcists {{critical}} reputation {{has grown}} considerably. The film currently has an 87% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 67 reviews the website collected. Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel {{placed it in}} the top five films released that year. BBC film critic Mark Kermode believes the film to be the best film ever made saying [...] "There's a theory that great films give back to you whatever it is you bring to them. It's absolutely true with The Exorcist—it reflects the anxieties of the audience. Some people think it's an outright horror-fest, but I don't. It was written by a devout Catholic who hoped it would make people think positively about the existence of God. William Peter Blatty, who wrote the book, thought that if there are demons then there are also angels and life after death. He couldn't see why <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was scary. I've seen it about 200 times and every time I see something I haven't seen before." ...|$|E
5000|$|Journey to the Center of the Moon {{was later}} renamed Voyage: Inspired by Jules Verne.

25|$|As the show's {{producers}} {{needed to}} ensure that plot details of the ending would be kept a secret until the airdate, the scripts given to the crew members had their final pages removed.
