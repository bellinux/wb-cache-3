This paper outlines a novel, non-invasive ultrasonic method that provides a direct means of mapping fluid penetration in threaded systems. An apparatus with piezoelectric elements was developed to pulse ultrasonic waves into a nut specimen where the waves reflected from the threaded interface. The reflected signal amplitude shifted as fluid penetrated the thread, allowing the fluid to be mapped to provide a measure of ingress rate. The results for three fluid samples are presented. Measurements suggest the fluid tracks helically down the unloaded side of the thread and radially into the loaded thread surfaces...|$|R

5000|$|Cosmoline that {{is fairly}} fresh, or {{that has been}} {{hermetically}} sealed {{in a plastic bag}} or shrink wrap, remains a grease-like viscous fluid, and mostly wipes off with a rag, leaving only a thin film behind. Cosmoline that is older and has had air exposure usually solidifies after a few years, as the volatile hydrocarbon fraction evaporates and leaves behind only the waxy hydrocarbon fraction. The solid wax does not readily wipe off. It can be scraped off, although the scraping is laborious and leaves crumbs to be swept or vacuumed away. One method that may help remove cosmoline is to apply gentle heat sufficient to melt the waxy hydrocarbons, the cosomoline may then be wiped off metal or allowed to drip off of wood. Another useful method of cleaning a tool of crusted cosmoline is to allow a <b>penetrating</b> <b>oil</b> (such as CRC 5-56, CLP, or equivalent) to soak into it for several minutes or hours, which typically restores it to a viscous-fluid state, allowing it to be wiped off. An additional method of cosmoline removal on new parts is to use a closed-cabinet parts washer that utilizes the power wash process. Removal of cosmoline with an aqueous parts washer requires high heat, the proper aqueous detergent, and the correct hydraulic impact pressure. All cleaning methods create waste that must be disposed of in the proper manner. Aqueous washing or solvent cleaning both have accepted methods to dispose of the [...] "sludge" [...] created. Cosmoline is mostly waxes and hydrocarbons and creates a regulated waste that is not difficult to dispose of properly.

40|$|Over {{the last}} years {{thousands}} of houses have been damaged by wood rot in the exterior wood panelling due to excessive moisture conditions. This thesis is about moisture conditions and the way moisture enters and exits painted wood panelling structures. The work started with a survey of damaged houses {{in order to obtain}} information on where the rot appeared and which parts of the panelling was most exposed to moisture. The existing test methods for measuring moisture protection of paints were found to be insufficient and a new full-scale method was developed. It provided reliable and more revealing information about the moisture protection ability of different paints etc. A large number of paint systems have been studied and coatings that consist of several paints (<b>penetrating</b> <b>oil,</b> primer and top paint) gave the best results. It was also found that treatment of the end grain is crucial. The full-scale test method is cumbersome and time consuming to carry out and therefore more sophisticated tools were developed. These tools provide a means of simulating the moisture balance by using accurate material properties and knowledge of the boundary conditions. A numerical computer program, designed especially for painted wood structures, has been developed for calculating moisture transport in two dimensions. Moisture flow is based on the fundamental flow potential, which has advantages for this specific application because it makes the calculation faster and more reliable. A qualitative model for the way moisture enters and exits a painted structure provided information on the boundary conditions. A new technique is proposed to evaluate the transport properties of the wood (spruce) and paint under steady state conditions. A slicing technique provides a moisture profile through the specimen and the transport properties are evaluated according to Fick's law. This provides not only the material property for the paint film but also 1. 5 mm of wood behind the paint film. This is more realistic because the penetration of paint into the wood is taken into consideration. The last part of the thesis deals with simulations of moisture conditions in both single boards and panelling structures. The calculated and measured results are compared...|$|E

40|$|Microgel covered interfaces, e. g., in emulsions, have {{attracted}} much interest lately.

Techniques such as cryogenic scanning electron microscopy cryo SEM and confocal microscopy have provided valuable insight into microgelcovered systems but still have some disadvantages such as part of the microgels being trapped in vitrified liquid or the need for fluorescent markers. Some of these disadvantages can be overcome by using transmission X ray microscopy TXM, which has the advantage of allowing the investigation of adsorbed and free microgels simultaneously.
