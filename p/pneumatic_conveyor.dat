40|$|Abstract- The {{control of}} dense-phase {{pneumatic}} conveying systems is notoriously difficult. Specifically, achieving sufficiently low air velocity to ensure efficient power utilisation, low product degradation and plant wear, whilst ensuring that blockage {{of the pipeline}} does not occur, is the greatest challenge. ECT could potentially offer a cheap, durable and potentially effective method of visualising solids movement within conveying pipelines and ultimately act as a primary sensory input to an opti-mal control system. A pneumatic conveying rig has been designed and constructed in order to simulate the slug flow of plastic pellets when using air as a transportation media. Twelve electrode ECT sensors have been placed on a test section of the rig to measure variations of slug flow and to further investigate any potential for control. A pre-requisite paper [1] details the successful time-based “animation ” of solids flow through the pipeline, the analysis of these flow patterns and the potential of this work for the control of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>conveyors.</b> This “bolt-on ” paper will describe two parallel control strategies, which may be employed in association with an ECT system for the optimisation of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>conveyors.</b> One technique will utilise parametric modelling of conveying systems, while the other {{will be based on}} a fuzzy logic approach, where the membership functions will be optimised by the use of genetic algorithms...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} options for moving grain from one {{location}} to another. Some of these options include conveyors such as belt conveyors, drag conveyors, screw <b>conveyors,</b> and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>conveyors.</b> Belt conveyors cause the least damage to grain {{due to the}} lack of contact forces, however, they cannot be used for steep inclines. Another commonly used conveyor is screw conveyors. Screw conveyors, also known as augers, are conveyors made from a helical blade with rotational motion to move grain. They are on many types of farm equipment, including combines and grain carts for example. Augers generally have a high power requirements, but are portable and low cost. In addition, augers tend to cause high levels of mechanical damage to the grain. Much research has been completed to quantify the amount of grain damage caused by various screw conveyors. The percentage of grain damage is decreased when the auger is operated at capacity because the grain cannot bounce around and strike surfaces as easily. In addition, grain damage increases with increased rotational speed. For this research with screw conveyors, the angle of the incline was found to have no significant effect on the grain damage.Pneumatic conveyors use a moving air-stream to propel grain, and are used in situations when the path of the grain is complex. Grain damage can occur especially at any changes in the tube path, but can be minimized when air speeds are kept below 25 meters per second. [...] It is shown that grain damage increases exponentially above air velociities of 20 meters per second. [...] In research by Baker et al. breakage levels of maize in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>conveyors</b> were found to be similar to those of bucket or drag conveyors.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a {{programme of work}} which has been undertaken {{with the objective of}} investigating means of using a laboratory erosion tester to predict the life of a bend in a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>conveyor.</b> Providing a link between a laboratory erosion tester and erosion tests on a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>conveyor</b> would lead to the development of an inexpensive way of predicting the life of a pipe bend operating under any given set of conveying conditions. An extensive literature review was carried out. From this it was concluded that very little work of an experimental corroborative nature had been out to substantiate whether erosion test results from a laboratory tester could be used to predict the life of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>conveyor</b> bend. Two test facilities were constructed to carry out tests under accurately controlled conditions. The first of these was a laboratory 'rotating disc accelerator' erosion tester, and the second an industrially scaled pneumatic conveying test facility. Both test facilities yielded results that followed previously reported trends but also illustrated some trends that have been unreported in earlier work. It was found that the 'rotating disc accelerator' simulated erosion with minimal interference from inter-particulate collisions. For the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>conveyor</b> test bend used it was found that puncture of the bend wall occurred in the region where secondary particle impacts occurred, rather than in the region of primary impacts as reported in earlier work. Explanations for both these observations are given. An optically based construction for a cylindrical mirror was used to predict the location of the puncture point in the bend, and the intensification of particle impacts in the region of the pipe bend due to the geometry of the bend. When this was combined with an empirical erosion model derived from results obtained from the rotating disc accelerator, an accurate estimate {{of the life of the}} bend could be made. Further development of this model is discussed. An extensive series of recommendations for further work to address some of the findings discovered during this work are given...|$|E

40|$|There are {{two major}} types of erosion testing devices that are used {{throughout}} the world for quantifying particle impact erosion against a solid surface. The first of these uses pressurised air to accelerate abrasive particles through a nozzle so that they impinge upon a target specimen.

This paper reports the findings of a collaborative project that was designed to compare the performance and results obtained from a rig of each of the two types mentioned above. The sand blast type rig was provided by The Department of Powder Science Technology (POSTEC) at The Telemark Technological Research and Development Centre (TEL-TEK), Porsgrunn, Norway while the centripetal effect accelerator was provided by The Wolfson Centre for Bulk Solids Handling Technology, University of Greenwich, London, UK.
