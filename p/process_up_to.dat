5|$|Although the {{architect}} Robert Smirke was appointed in December 1834 {{to design a}} replacement palace, pressure from the former MP Lieutenant Colonel Sir Edward Cust to open the <b>process</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a competition gained popularity {{in the press and}} led to the formation in 1835 of a Royal Commission. This body determined in which style the new construction should be built, and in June they decided that either Elizabethan or gothic styles should be used. The commission also decided that although competitors would not be required to follow the outline of the original palace, the surviving buildings of Westminster Hall, the Undercroft Chapel and the Cloisters of St Stephen's should all be incorporated into the new complex.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{drinking}} water is {{supplied by the}} R.C. Harris Filtration Plant {{at the foot of}} Victoria Park Avenue and the F.J. Horgan Filtration Plant. The F.J Horgan Filtration Plant was built in 1979 and was formerly known as the 'Easterly Plant'. Upgrades completed in 2011 allows it to <b>process</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 800 Megalitres/day and it will also be the first plant to replace chlorine with ozone as its primary cleansing method. Wastewater for Scarborough is treated at the Highland Creek Water Pollution Control Plant. This plant was constructed in 1954 and started processing in 1956. It has undergone continual expansion to meet ongoing demand. Electricity is mainly provided in Scarborough by Toronto Hydro.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeated}} army suffered greatly, {{not only}} from the Byzantine pursuit, but also due to lack of water: before the battle, Kardarigan had ordered the water supplies poured to the ground, trying to make his men fight harder to break through the Byzantine army and reach the Arzamon. In addition, the surviving Persians were refused entry into Dara since, according to Simocatta, Persian custom forbade entrance to fugitives. Simocatta also narrates that many Persians died of thirst or from water poisoning when they drank too much water from wells after their ordeal. Kardarigan himself had managed to find refuge on a nearby hilltop with a small detachment and withstood several Byzantine attacks. Finally, after three or four days, the Byzantines, not aware that the enemy commander was there, abandoned the effort. Kardarigan thus escaped, although his men suffered further casualties in the <b>process,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a thousand according to Simocatta, from Byzantine patrols.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that {{vision of the}} body-part that happens to receive a tactile event enhances the processing of this stimulus. However, {{it would appear that}} only tactile distractors delivered to visible body-parts are <b>processed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the level of response selection. Here, we analyze whether vision or higher order cognitive processes influence the processing of tactile distractors. We compared the processing of distractors in a tactile variant of the Eriksen flanker task when the body-parts receiving target and distractor stimuli were separated by different types of barriers. Surprisingly, an impermeable barrier prevented tactile distractors from being <b>processed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the response level, irrespective of whether the barrier was transparent or opaque. By contrast, when an empty frame was placed between the participant's hands, distractors were <b>processed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the level of response selection. Hence, higher order cognition (here the visually induced representation of the target-distractor separation) influences the processing of tactile distractors. We discuss these results in the light of related findings from selective reaching experiments as well as in terms of Gestalt grouping...|$|R

Indeed, the first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all markets and thereby get the maximum quantity efficiency on the print run for all.|$|E
