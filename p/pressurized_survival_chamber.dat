40|$|The {{portable}} {{life support}} system described in this paper represents a potential increase in the probability of survival for miners who are trapped underground by a fire or explosion. The habitability and life support capability of the prototype shelter have proved excellent.

40|$|A {{large scale}} <b>survival</b> <b>chamber</b> was {{developed}} as a screen for detecting chemical treatments that extend the survival time of illuminated soybean seedlings at CO 2 concentrations below the compensation point. In theory, extended survival should indicate potential for improved crop performance via decreased photorespiration and increased photosynthetic efficiency. An automated control system regulated CO 2 concentrations, temperature and plant watering during a continuous CO 2 -removal photoperiod of 72 hours. An endogenously controlled circadian rhythm of net photosynthesis occurred throughout the continuous light treatment...|$|R
40|$|A {{microbiological}} <b>survival</b> <b>chamber</b> for in situ {{environmental studies}} involving microorganisms {{of public health}} significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate {{the usefulness of the}} chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment...|$|R
5000|$|Then the [...] "Miracle of Lassing" [...] occurred. The first miner to be buried, Georg Hainzl, {{was rescued}} after ten days {{and was found}} in {{surprisingly}} good health. His rescue was achieved by a German company that had previously worked with OMV and had a suitable drill rig available that, unlike the OMV equipment, was suitable for large diameters and rather shallow depths. With the help of logistics and other departments of the OMV the hole was drilled. The decompression chamber specially made to measure by the OMV was not needed, as no overpressure existed in the <b>survival</b> <b>chamber</b> in which Georg Hainzl found himself, something {{that could only be}} ascertained after the drilling. The man who subsequently became Lower Austria's fire chief, Josef Buchta, was heavily involved in the construction of this decompression chamber.|$|R
5000|$|With Stoner {{as chief}} design engineer, Armalite quickly {{released}} {{a number of}} interesting rifle concepts. [...] The first Armalite concept to be adopted for production was the AR-5, a <b>survival</b> rifle <b>chambered</b> for the [...]22 Hornet cartridge. The AR-5 {{was adopted by the}} U.S. Air Force as the MA-1 Survival Rifle.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory-contained microcosms are {{important}} for studying the fate and survival of genetically engineered microorganisms. In this study, we describe a simple aquatic microcosm that utilizes <b>survival</b> <b>chambers</b> in a flowthrough or static renewal system. The model was used to study the survival of genetically engineered and wild-type strains of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida in the lake water environment. Temperature-dependent studies indicated that the genetically engineered microorganisms survived better {{or at least as}} well as their wild-type counterparts at 15, 25, and 30 degrees C. The genetic determinants of the genetically engineered microorganisms also remained fairly stable within the host cell under the tested conditions. In the presence of organisms indigenous to lake water, E. coli was eliminated after 20 days, whereas P. putida showed an initial decline but was able to stabilize its population after 5 days. A herbicide, Hydrothol- 191, caused a significant decline in numbers of P. putida, but no significant difference was observed between the genetically engineered microorganisms and the wild-type strain. The microcosm described is simple, can be easily adapted to study a variety of environmental variables, and has the advantage that the organisms tested are constantly exposed to test waters that are continuously renewed...|$|R
40|$|Sick sinus {{syndrome}} is {{an association of}} sinus node dysfunction with bradycardia, pauses, sino-atrial block, chronotropic insufficiency and atrial arrhythmias. The diagnosis is essentially clinical and electrocardiographic. Prolonged ECG recordings allow a better assessment {{of the severity of}} the condition whereas electrophysiological investigations only provide complementary information which is rarely decisive in the therapeutic indications. Cardiac pacing is the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients: significant improvement in symptoms may be expected but there is no significant change in <b>survival.</b> Single <b>chamber</b> atrial stimulation or dual chamber pacing is preferable to single chamber ventricular pacing, especially, with regards to the incidence of atrial fibrillation and the impact on quality of life...|$|R
5000|$|The SAR Rifle, [...]30-06 calibre, RUGER, Model M77 is a rifle {{designed}} for use by Canada's search and rescue technicians (SAR Techs) and aircrews. The SAR Rifle {{is designed to be}} a compact <b>survival</b> rifle <b>chambered</b> in [...]30-06 Springfield. The rifle is based on the standard Ruger M77 Mk II rifle but the barrel has been shortened to 14.5". The orange coloured buttstock has been modified so that it can fold along the left hand side of the stock and it also can hold six additional rounds of ammunition. The rifle is issued with a special case that has been designed to attach to the search and rescue technicians' parachute harnesses.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{chemical}} treatments upon photosynthesis, soluble leaf protein, CO 2 compensation point, and leaf light transmission in soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., seedlings were examined following varying response periods after application at 14 to 17 days postemergence. The compounds N 6 -benzyladenine (BA), 2 -(4 -chlorophenoxy) - 2 -methylpropanoic acid (CPMP), (4 -chlorophenoxy) acetic acid (CPA), rhodanine-N-acetic acid (RAA), and 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) significantly increased soluble protein and decreased senescence, measured by leaf light transmission, at CO 2 concentrations below the compensation {{point in a}} <b>survival</b> <b>chamber.</b> All compounds except BA significantly decreased transmission values under ambient atmospheric conditions. In statistically significant experiments, applications of 3. 49 millimolar CPMP increased net photosynthesis on a leaf area basis {{by an average of}} 14. 4 % at all trifoliolate positions with increases generally requiring response periods of 12 days or longer. RAA at 1. 31 and 2. 61 millimolar increased net photosynthesis by 19 to 36 % following 13 -day response periods. CPMP and other compounds tested had no effect upon the CO 2 compensation point after 4 - to 8 -day response periods. The effects of CPMP and RAA upon net photosynthesis and soluble protein appeared to involve a combined stimulation of protein synthesis and an antisenescent effect. There were no indications that any of the photosynthetic changes observed resulted from direct differential effects upon ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase. The assays for soluble protein and light transmission responded more consistently to the chemicals than did photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Test {{chambers}} {{for conducting}} in situ fish bioassays were constructed from 8 L polyethylene bottles. Yearling fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and young-of-the-year bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) demonstrated greater than 50 percent <b>survival</b> in the <b>chambers</b> after 65 days of exposure in a reservoir, river, and creek. Fathead minnow survival was substantially {{greater than that}} of bluegills. The chambers provide a simple, inexpensive, sensitive technique to screen effluents for toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Guinea-pig {{subcutaneous}} chambers {{were infected}} {{with a mixture}} of gonococcal variants of defined outer membrane protein profile. <b>Survival</b> within the <b>chambers</b> was a two-stage process. The initial advantage conferred by the lack of opacity-related outer membrane protein was transient and survivors were replaced by opaque colonial variants. Amongst these survivors were variants which produced opacity-related proteins (IId, IIe and IIf) not present in the initial inoculum. Thus, outer membrane protein composition {{is an important factor in}} survival in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Four human-associated bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella newport, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, {{were tested}} for {{survival}} in five freshwater sediments. Bacterial <b>survival</b> in continuous-flow <b>chambers</b> was monitored over 14 -day periods on sediments ranging from organically rich high-clay fractions to organically poor sandy fractions. Bacterial die-off ranged from 1 to 5 {{orders of magnitude}} in sediments. E. coli survived as long as or longer than S. newport. P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae tended to survive longer than E. coli. Survival of E. coli and S. newport was greater in sediments containing at least 25 % clay. Good reproducibility allowed the development of linear models to describe die-off rates...|$|R
40|$|Human fecal Escherichia coli {{isolates}} {{were exposed}} over a seasonal cycle to estuarine water in diffusion chambers filled with double-filtered (0. 45 and 0. 2 microns) and nonfiltered water. Laboratory manipulations of E. coli cultures before estuarine exposure {{were reduced to}} minimize sublethal stress, and nonselective or resuscitative enumeration techniques were employed to maximize recovery of stressed cells. E. coli was capable of extended survival during in situ exposure to estuarine water, provided eucaryotes were excluded from diffusion <b>chambers.</b> <b>Survival</b> was directly related to temperature in absence of the eucaryote component of the natural microbiota. Although {{it was not possible}} to prevent eventual bacterial contamination in double-filtered water, there was no direct evidence that such contamination affected E. coli survival. Conversely, E. coli disappearance was most pronounced at warmer temperatures in the presence of the natural microbiota, and decline coincided with increasing eucaryote densities. In contrast, the decline of E. coli during winter was similar in both filtered and nonfiltered seawater...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{diffusion}} <b>chamber,</b> <b>survival</b> of lymph node and bone marrow allograft was investigated. Mice used as donors and hosts were 2 -month-old mice of randomly bred ddT and ddY strains and of inbred strains Cb, Strong A, Db and C_ 57 BL. Pieces of the mesenteric lymph nodes or femoral bone marrows obtained from {{male and female}} donor mice were placed in {{the diffusion}} chambers, then were implanted into the peritoneal cavities of the allogeneic host mice of the comparative sex. The host mice were killed at intervals of 15, 21, 30 and 60 days following implantation. The chambers employed were a modification of that of Algire et al (1954, 1955). The construction of the chamber and histologic examination of their contents were described in detail elsewhere (Awaya, 1964). Many of the lymph node allografts in cell-impenetrable diffusion chamber (constructed of HA type millipore filters, pore size 0. 45 μ) survived from 15 to 60 days after implantation, although some of them were injured in varying degrees (Fig. 1 - 12; Table 2) ...|$|R
40|$|A major {{obstacle}} to 3 -dimensional tissue engineering is incorporation of a functional vascular supply to support the expanding new tissue. This is overcome in an in vivo intrinsic vascularization model where an arteriovenous loop (AVL) is placed in a noncollapsible space protected by a polycarbonate chamber. Vascular development and hypoxia were examined from 3 days to 112 days by vascular casting, morphometric, and morphological techniques to understand the model's vascular growth and remodeling parameters for tissue engineering purposes. At 3 days a fibrin exudate surrounded the AVL, providing a scaffold to migrating inflammatory, endothelial, and mesenchymal cells. Capillaries formed {{between 3 and 7}} days. Hypoxia and cell proliferation were maximal at 7 days, followed by a peak in percent vascular volume at 10 days (23. 20 +/- 3. 14 % compared with 3. 59 +/- 2. 68 % at 3 days, P < 0. 001). Maximal apoptosis was observed at 112 days. The protected space and spontaneous microcirculatory development in this model suggest it would be applicable for in vivo tissue engineering. A temporal window in a period of intense angiogenesis at 7 to 10 days is optimal for exogenous cell seeding and <b>survival</b> in the <b>chamber,</b> potentially enabling specific tissue outcomes to be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{enterotoxin}} B (SEB) {{has recently}} been postulated {{to be involved in}} the pathology of granulocyte-dominated disease. Studying the immunologic interaction between SEB and airway epithelial cells in immortalized cell lines or long-term epithelial cell cultures has obvious disadvantages. We used a novel technique of freshly isolated and purified human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) from healthy, nonallergic individuals, which were incubated for 24 h without/with SEB at different concentrations. Chemokine production was evaluated in the supernatant using Cytometric Bead Array. The chemotactic activity of the supernatant was studied in vitro using a Boyden <b>chamber.</b> <b>Survival</b> was evaluated with flow cytometry, using propidium iodide to identify dead cells. Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B showed a dose-dependent induction of interferon-inducible protein- 10, monokine induced by interferon-gamma, regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor production by epithelial cells in vitro. The supernatant of epithelial cells had chemotactic activity for granulocytes in vitro, which was enhanced in the supernatant of SEB-stimulated epithelial cells. Reduced number of propidium iodide positive granulocytes was found in the conditions where supernatant of SEB-stimulated epithelial cells was applied. Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B exerts a direct pro-inflammatory effect on HNEC, with induction of chemokine and growth factor release, resulting in the migration and prolonged survival of granulocytes in vitr...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTransient {{capture of}} cells or model {{microspheres}} from flow over substrates sparsely coated with adhesive ligands has provided significant {{insight into the}} unbinding kinetics of leukocyte:endothelium adhesion complexes under external force. Whenever a cell is stopped by a point attachment, the full hydrodynamic load {{is applied to the}} adhesion site within an exceptionally short time—less than the reciprocal of the hydrodynamic shear rate (e. g., typically < 0. 01 s). The decay in numbers of cells or beads that remain attached to a surface {{has been used as a}} measure of the kinetics of molecular bond dissociation under constant force, revealing a modest increase in detachment rate at growing applied shear stresses. On the other hand, when detached under steady ramps of force with mechanical probes (e. g., the atomic force microscope and biomembrane force probe), P-selectin:PSGL- 1 adhesion bonds break at rates that increase enormously under rising force, yielding 100 -fold faster off rates at force levels comparable to high shear. The comparatively weak effect of force on tether <b>survival</b> in flow <b>chamber</b> experiments could be explained by a possible partition of the load amongst several bonds. However, a comprehensive understanding of the difference in kinetic behavior requires us to also inspect other factors affecting the dynamics of attachment-force buildup, such as the interfacial compliance of all linkages supporting the adhesion complex. Here, combining the mechanical properties of the leukocyte interface measured in probe tests with single-bond kinetics and the kinetics of cytoskeletal dissociation, we show that for the leukocyte adhesion complex P-selectin:PSGL- 1, a detailed adhesive dynamics simulation accurately reproduces the tethering behavior of cells observed in flow chambers. Surprisingly, a mixture of 10 % single bonds and 90 % dimeric bonds is sufficient to fully match the data of the P-selectin:PSGL- 1 experiments, with the calculated decay in fraction of attached cells still appearing exponential...|$|R
40|$|Disease {{due to the}} {{consumption}} of food contaminated with enteric microorganisms has been well established. The first study described in this dissertation was designed {{to determine the effect}} of relative humidity on the pre-harvest survival of enteric pathogens on the surfaces of fresh produce. Additionally, Clostridium perfringens was evaluated as an indicator of fecal contamination on fresh produce. Pathogenic and surrogate microorganisms, including Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, Shigella sonnei, C. perfringens, coliphage PRD 1, feline calicivirus (FCV), and hepatitis A virus (HAV), were inoculated onto the surfaces of cantaloupe, iceberg lettuce, and bell peppers. Experiments were conducted in a controlled environment <b>chamber.</b> <b>Survival</b> of microorganisms on the produce surfaces was not uniformly affected by relative humidity. However, due to the survival of all microorganisms at least 14 days in at least one experiment, measures should be taken to lessen the exposure of produce to fecal contamination as harvest time approaches. C. perfringens survived longer than all other bacteria and feline calicivirus in all experiments, with the exception of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. enterica subsp. enterica on lettuce. This trend suggests that C. perfringens may be an acceptable indicator of bacterial contamination and survival in various environments and on different types of crops. The second study was conducted to determine the intake of heterotrophic bacteria by the average person in the United States from food and water. A literature review was conducted to determine the concentration of heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria in foods and water from the household tap. Food items from grocery stores and fast food restaurants in Tucson, AZ were also evaluated for HPC bacteria. It was determined that in the United States, 0. 048 to 4. 5 % of the typical consumer's HPC bacteria intake is derived from water consumed from the household tap. Therefore, HPC bacteria in tap water do not represent a significant source of the total HPC bacteria consumed in the average diet of individuals in the United States...|$|R
