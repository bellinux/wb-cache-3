Studies were undertaken on a continent-wide scale throughout Europe (including the Greenland-Norwegian basin), Africa, Arabia and parts of India, linking extensive, specially collected field data to satellite interpretation. The studies were subscribed to by most of the world’s major oil companies as well as mining companies and international organisations such as UNDP. These studies formed the foundation on which further interpretation has been made worldwide by NPA Satellite Mapping (now CGG) up to the present day.|$|E

Crookshank, who was at that time was the most senior scientist working. Immediately, H.L. Crookshank was appointed first director general of GSP which he remained until 1955. Under Crookshank, the technical staff was increased to 30 geoscientists in 1948. In its formative years, the GSP did the pioneering work in hydrogeology and engineering but the efforts were transfer to engineering units of the military. [...] In 1949-55, the GSP initiated a rigorous tradition of field investigations with the governmental support, and reconnaissance technology was transferred to GSP through the Colombo Plan. Due to these activities, it increased the operational, scientific capabilities, and expansion of facilities of the GSP by 1956; it became one of the pioneering scientific institution of the government. In 1955, English geologist, E.R. Gee, took over the GSP who initiated a massive expansion programme for GSP, including engineering, <b>photogeology</b> sections, as well as systematic publications journals were established. In 1959, the construction of new headquarters in Quetta was completed with Dr. N.M. Khan becoming first native GSP's director.|$|E

40|$|LOLA {{topography}} and LOLA-derived crustal thickness data {{provide evidence}} for a population of impact basins on the Moon that is likely a factor 2 larger than the classical lists based on <b>photogeology.</b> Frey (2012) determined N(50) crater retention ages (CRAs) for 83 candidate basins > 300 km in diameter by counting LOLA-identified craters superimposed over the whole area of the basins. For some basins identified in topography or model crustal thickness {{it is not possible}} to unambiguously identify the crater rim as is traditionally done. Also, Quasi-Circular Depressions (QCDs) > 50 km in diameter are recognizable in the mare-filled centers of many basins. Even though these are not apparent in image data, they likely represent buried impact craters superimposed on the basin floor prior to mare infilling and so should be counted in determining the age of the basin. Including these as well as the entire area of the basins improves the statistics, though the error bars are still large when using only craters > 50 km in diameter. The distribution of N(50) CRAs had two distinct peaks which did not depend on whether the basins were named (based on <b>photogeology)</b> or recognized first in topography or crustal thickness data. It also did not depend on basin diameters (both larger and smaller basins made up both peaks) and both peaks persisted even when weaker candidates were excluded. Burgess (2012, unpublished data) redid the counts for 85 basins but improved on the earlier effort by adjusting the counting area where basins overlap. The two peak distribution of N(50) ages was confirmed, with a younger peak at N(50) ~ 40 - 50 and an older peak at N(50) ~ 80 - 90 (craters > 50 km diameter per million square km). We suggest this could represent two distinct populations of impactors on the Moon: one producing an Early Heavy Bombardment (EHB) that predates Nectaris and the second responsible for the more widely recognized Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) ...|$|E

The most abundant melt composition at Apollo 16 is an aluminous variety of LKFM basalt supplied by the Nectaris impact as ejected basin impact melt.

Previously, the only assessment of potential surface disruptions on Mars antipodal to large impacts was by Peterson (1978). Herein, the results give credence to Peterson's assertions. For Hellas, the computer model clearly suggests that antipodal pressures were probably strong enough to have fractured the crust and disrupted the surface, and may account for aspects of volcanism at Alba Patera. It is suggested that the Hellas impact produced sufficient focused energy at its antipode to produce deep fracture in the Martian crust centered below the current caldera for Alba Petera. With the generation and evolution of magma in the Tharsis area, the fracture system provided a ready conduit for early stage eruptions of Martians lavas derived from deep in the crust and/or upper mantle, perhaps of komatiitic composition...|$|E

40|$|Among many {{indications}} of possible ancient Martian galciation are sinuous eskerlike ridges in southern Argyre Planitia and the Dorsa Argentea region. But, in <b>photogeology,</b> other interpretations are always possible, and what appears eskerlike to {{one set of}} eyes may appear quite different to another. Interpretations of these ridges are about as numerous as observers, who collectively have suggested nine distinct hypotheses.

The esker hypothesis will gain support if Mars Observer images show that the ridges contain boulders, that the ridges are layered and contain channel structures, that the ridges are modified by thermokarst, or that the ridges occur in close, logical associations with other glacial landforms such as flutes, oriented grooves, and moraines.

40|$|The South Pole-Aitken Basin (SPA) is the largest, deepest, and oldest {{identified}} basin on the Moon {{and as such}} contains surfaces {{that are}} unique due to their age, composition, and depth of origin in the lunar crust [1 - 5] (Figure 1).

In response to this interest there have been several efforts to estimate the likely provenance of regolith material within central SPA [9 - 12]. These model estimates suggest that, despite the formation of basins and craters following SPA, the regolith within SPA is dominated by locally derived material. An assumption of these models has been that the locally derived material is primarily SPA impact-melt as opposed to local basement material (e. g. unmelted lower crust). However, the definitive identification of SPA derived impact melt on the basin floor, either by remote sensing [5, 13] or via <b>photogeology</b> [2, 14] is extremely difficult due to the number of subsequent impacts and volcanic activity [4]...|$|E
40|$|The regions anitpodal to Mars' three largest impact basins, Hellas, Isidis, and Argyre, were {{assessed}} {{for evidence of}} impact-induced disrupted terrains. <b>Photogeology</b> and computer modeling using the Simplified Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (SALE) finite element code suggest that such terrains could have been found by the Hellas impact. Maximum antipodal pressures are 1100 MPa for Hellas, 520 MPa for Isidis, and 150 MPa for Argyre. The results suggest that if antipodal fracturing were associated with later volcanism, then Alba Patera {{may be related to}} the Hellas event, as proposed by Peterson (1978). Alba Patera is a unique volcano in the solar system, being a shield volcano which emitted large volume lava flows. This volcanism could be the result of the focusing of seismic energy which created a fractured region that served as a volcanic conduit for the future release of large volumes of magma. No disrupted terrain features are observed antipodal to the Isidis or Argyre basins, although some of the old fractures in Noctis Labyrinthus could have originated in response to the Isidis impact, and later have been reactivated by the Tharsis tectonics assumed to have produced Noctis. If the lower calculated antipodal pressures for Argyre were capable of producing disrupted terrains, then the terrains have been covered subsequently by volcanic or aeolian material, or modified beyond recognition...|$|E

Part of the thrill of those lunar missions is brought to schools by the lunar sample educational disks, which contain artifacts of six piloted trips to the Moon. Johnson Space Center (JSC) is preparing 100 new educational disks containing pieces of meteorites collected in Antarctica. These represent chunks of several different asteroids, that were collected {{in one of the}} most remote, forbidding environments on Earth. These pieces of the Moon and asteroids represent the products of basic planetary processes (solar nebular processes, initial differentiation, volcanism, and impact), and, in turn, these processes are controlled by basic physical and chemical processes (energy, energy transfer, melting, buoyancy, etc.). Thus, the lunar and meteorite sample disks have enormous educational potential. New educational materials are being developed to accompany the disks. Present materials are not as effective as they could be, especially in relating samples to processes and to other types of data such as spectral studies and <b>photogeology.</b> Furthermore, the materials are out of date.

40|$|A new {{interpretation}} {{of the evolution of}} El Chichón volcano is presented in this paper based on <b>photogeology,</b> fieldwork, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating and chemistry of juvenile products. El Chichón volcano belongs to a volcanic complex formed by craters and peripheral domes with a total estimated volume of ~ 26 km 3. Our data suggest that inception of magmatism began around 370 ka with the emission of lava domes buried by younger products. The activity continued with the formation of a large andesitic dome complex between 209 and 276 and associated block and ash flows and lahars. The dome complex was subsequently destroyed by a major eruption that left a 1. 5 -km wide Somma-type crater. The activity continued with the extrusion of the SW dome at 217 ka, that partially disrupted the southwestern Somma crater wall. Later on a series of dome extrusions occurred beyond the northwestern sector of the Somma crater at about 95 ka. Juvenile blocks found in 1982 products yielded ages of 44 and 29 ka attesting to heretofore unidentified late Pleistocene activity. The onset of Holocene activity occurred both outside the Somma crater with explosive eruptions that formed the Guayabal Tuff Cone and inside the Somma crater with the formation of a tuff cone that has been repeatedly reactivated during the Holocene, lastly during the 1982 eruption. All magmas produced during the past 370, 000 years are K-alkaline andesites that exhibit minor variation in their chemical composition. An average discharge rate of 0. 5 km 3 /ka is calculated during the past 8, 000 years (~ 4 km 3) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{case history}} {{discusses}} the exploration methods {{used at the}} Momotombo Geothermal Field in western Nicaragua, and evaluates {{their contributions to the}} development of the geothermal field models. Subsequent reservoir engineering has not been synthesized or evaluated. A geothermal exploration program was started in Nicaragua in 1966 to discover and delineate potential geothermal reservoirs in western Nicaragua. Exploration began at the Momotombo field in 1970 using geological, geochemical, and geophysical methods. A regional study of thermal manifestations was undertaken and the area on the southern flank of Volcan Momotombo was chosen for more detailed investigation. Subsequent exploration by various consultants produced a number of geotechnical reports on the geology, geophysics, and geochemistry of the field as well as describing production well drilling. Geological investigations at Momotombo included <b>photogeology,</b> field mapping, binocular microscope examination of cuttings, and drillhole correlations. Among the geophysical techniques used to investigate the field sub-structure were: Schlumberger and electromagnetic soundings, dipole mapping and audio-magnetotelluric surveys, gravity and magnetic measurements, frequency domain soundings, self-potential surveys, and subsurface temperature determinations. The geochemical program analyzed the thermal fluids of the surface and in the wells. This report presents the description and results of exploration methods used during the investigative stages of the Momotombo Geothermal Field. A conceptual model of the geothermal field was drawn from the information available at each exploration phase. The exploration methods have been evaluated with respect to their contributions to the understanding of the field and their utilization in planning further development. Our principal finding is that data developed at each stage were not sufficiently integrated to guide further work at the field, causing inefficient use of resources...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} goal in {{the study}} of mid-ocean ridges is to understand the relationship between the distribution of melt at depth and seafloor features. Building on geophysical information on subsurface melt at the 9 °N overlapping spreading center on the East Pacific Rise, we use terrain modeling (DSL- 120 A side scan and bathymetry), photo-geology (Jason II and WHOI TowCam), and geochemical data to explore this relationship. Terrain modeling identified four distinct geomorphic provinces with common seafloor characteristics that correspond well to changes in subsurface melt distribution. Visual observations were used to interpret terrain modeling results and to establish a relative seafloor age scale, calibrated with radiometric age dates, to identify areas of recent volcanism. On the east limb, recent eruptions in the north are localized over the margins of the 4 km wide asymmetric melt sill, forming a prominent off-axis pillow ridge. Along the southern east limb, recent eruptions occur along a neovolcanic ridge that hugs the overlap basin and lies several kilometers west of the plunging melt sill. Our results suggest that long-term southward migration of the east limb occurs through a series of diking events with a net southward propagation direction. Examining sites of recent eruptions in the context of geophysical data on melt distribution in the crust and upper mantle suggests melt may follow complex paths from depth to the surface. Overall, our findings emphasize the value of integrating information obtained from photo-geology, terrain modeling, lava geochemistry and petrography, and geophysics to constrain the nature of melt delivery at mid-ocean ridges.

40|$|Nevados de Chillán volcano {{is a large}} {{composite}} stratovolcanic {{complex in}} the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Chilean Andes. It {{is one of the}} highest-risk volcanoes in Chile due to high levels of historic activity and rapid development of economic activity in the area. High precision 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and 14 C geochronology, geochemistry and petrology have been employed in addition to <b>photogeology</b> and field mapping to elucidate the evolution of this volcano and assess its hazards. Nevados de Chillán has been active since at least 640 ka when a large group of subglacial andesite flows were erupted. Since 100 ka, sequences of andesite and dacite lavas have been erupted into both subaerial and subglacial environments. Ignimbrites were erupted at around 40 ka and may have been associated with caldera collapses. Two separate eruptive centres have evolved since 40 ka: the Cerro Blanco and Las Termas subcomplexes. The two centres are 6 km apart, yet have contemporaneously erupted geochemically distinct magmas. Subglacial lavas have been identified on the high flanks of the volcano and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating has confirmed their eruption during recent glaciations (isotope stages 4 and 2). Tephra fall deposits have been dated by 14 C analysis of interstratified organic material and indicate that no proximal tephra fallout deposits older than 9 ka remain. Tephra dispersal indicates that Holocene activity has involved vulcanian to subplinian eruptions. At least, 3 pyroclastic flow eruptions have occurred during the Holocene and lahar deposits are common in the valleys around the volcano. Historically, the Santa Gertrudis vent erupted during 1861 - 1865 and the dacite lava cone complexes Nuevo and Arrau were constructed during 1906 - 1943 and 1973 - 1986, respectively.

40|$|The SP Mountain {{area of the}} San Francisco Volcanic Field, AZ, {{has been}} used as an analog mission {{development}} site for NASA since 1998. This area consists of basaltic cinder cones, lava flows and maar craters that have been active since mid-Miocene, with the youngest events occurring within the last 10, 000 years. The area has been used because its geologic and topographic resemblance to lunar and Martian terrains provides an ideal venue for testing hardware and science operations practices that might be employed on planetary surfaces, as well as training astronauts in field geology. Analog operations have often led to insights that spurred new scientific investigations. Most recently, an investigation of the 7504 cone was initiated due to perceptions that Apollo-style traverse plans executed during the Desert RATS 2010 mission had characterized the area incorrectly, leading to concerns that the Apollo traverse planning process was scientifically flawed. This investigation revealed a complex history of fissure eruptions of lava and cinders, cinder cone development, a cone-fill-and-spill episode, extensive rheomorphic lava flow initiation and emplacement, and cone sector collapse that led to a final lava flow. This history was not discernible on pre-RATS mission <b>photogeology,</b> although independent analysis of RATS 2010 data and samples develped a " 75 % complete solution" that validated the pre-RATS mission planning and Apollo traverse planning and execution. The study also pointed out that the development of scientific knowledge with time in a given field area is not linear, but may follow a functional form that rises steeply in the early period of an investigation but flattens out in the later period, asymptotically approaching a theoretical "complete knowledge" point that probably cannot be achieved. This implies that future human missions must be prepared to shift geographic areas of investigation regularly if significant science returns are to be forthcoming...|$|E
40|$|The {{geologic}} {{history of}} Martian meteorite Allan Hills (ALH) 84001 {{is more complex}} than previously recognized, with evidence for four or five crater-forming impacts onto Mars. This history of repeated deformation and shock metamorphism appears to weaken some arguments that have been offered for and against the hypothesis of ancient Martian life in ALH 84001. Allan Hills 84001 formed originally from basaltic magma. Its first impact event (I 1) is inferred from the deformation (D 1) that produced the granular-textured bands ("crush zones") that transect the original igneous fabric. Deformation D 1 is characterized by intense shear and may represent excavation or rebound flow of rock beneath a large impact crater. An intense thermal metamorphism followed D 1 and may be related to it. The next impact (I 2) produced fractures, (Fr 2) in which carbonate "pancakes" were deposited and produced feldspathic glass from some of the igneous feldspars and silica. After I 2, carbonate pancakes and globules were deposited in Fr 2 fractures and replaced feldspathic glass and possibly crystalline silicates. Next, feldspars, feldspathic glass, and possibly some carbonates were mobilized and melted in the third impact (I 3). Microfaulting, intense fracturing, and shear are also associated with 13. In the fourth impact (I 4), the rock was fractured and deformed without significant heating, which permitted remnant magnetization directions to vary across fracture surfaces. Finally, ALH 84001 was ejected from Mars in event I 5, which could be identical to I 4. This history of multiple impacts is consistent with the <b>photogeology</b> of the Martian highlands and may help resolve some apparent contradictions among recent results on ALH 84001. For example, the submicron rounded magnetite grains in the carbonate globules could be contemporaneous with carbonate deposition, whereas the elongate magnetite grains, epitaxial on carbonates, could be ascribed to vapor-phase deposition during I 3...|$|E
40|$|Based on LOLA {{topography}} {{and a new}} crustal thickness model, {{the number}} of candidate lunar basins greater than 300 km in diameter {{is at least a}} factor 2 larger than the traditional number based on <b>photogeology</b> alone, and may be as high as 95. Preliminary N(50) crater retention ages for this population of candidate basins shows two distinct peaks. Frey [1] suggested, based on Clementine-era topography (ULCN 2005) and a crustal thickness model based on Lunar Prospector data [2], that there could be as many as 98 lunar basins greater than 300 km diameter. Many of the weaker cases have not stood up to recent testing [3, 4, 5] using LOLA data and a newer crustal thickness model based on Kaguya gravity data and LOLA topography data [6]. As described in companion abstracts [4, 5], we have deleted from the earlier inventory 1 more named feature (Sikorsky- Rittenhouse; LOLA data show that its diameter is actually less than 300 km), 11 Quasi-Circular Depressions (QCDs) identified in the ULCN topography, and 11 Circular Thin Areas (CTAs) found in the earlier crustal thickness model [2]. We did this by repeating the scoring exercise originally done in [1] but with the new data [4, 5]. Topographic Expression (TE) and Crustal Thickness Expression (CTE) scores were determined for each candidate on a scale of 0 to 5 (5 being a strong, circular signature, 0 for those with no discernible circular topographic or crustal thickness signature). These scores are added together to produce a Summary Score which has a range of 0 to 10. We eliminated all candidates with a Summary Score less than 3, as well as other cases where, for example, the TE went to zero because what looked like a single large circular QCD in the lower resolution ULCN data was in fact a cluster of smaller deep impacts readily apparent in the newer higher resolution LOLA data.

40|$|The {{application}} of vegetation to mineral exploration {{was investigated in}} the semi-desert mulga zone of Western Australia. Acacia aneura (mulga) dominated the vegetation and was employed in several biogeochemical surveys to locate subsurface copper and nickel mineralisation after successful orientation surveys over outcropping areas. Copper concentrations in A. aneura leaf were adequate for locating cupriferous zones in the Murchison Region. In the Kurrajong Region, A. aneura was employed to locate nickel sulphide mineralisation in a terrain of serpentinised and lateritised ultrabasics, characterised by high and variable nickel levels. It was possible to distinguish sulphide mineralisation from lateritic areas by consideration of coincident nickel and manganese biogeochemical anomalies. A nickel-accumulating variety of the shrub, Hybanthus floribundus, was discovered in the Kurrajong Region. Other Hybanthus varieties were also found to accumulate nickel, in more southern parts of Western Australia. Plant chemistry studies indicated thst nickel was concentrated in the leaf epidermis as a small, water-soluble positively-charged complex. The value of these nickel-accumulating shrubs in locating nickeliferous areas was demonstrated. Preliminary attempts to detect this shrub, from the air, using colour infrared photography were unsuccessful, although the potential of colour film {{to take advantage of}} the anomalous yellow colour during the summer season was realised. Three tree species, Acacia coolgardiensis, A. resinomarginea, and A. burkittii, exhibited pronounced geobotanical relationships. The first two species were restricted to metabasalt and metagabbro ridges, whilst A. burkittii characterised calcareous serpentinised pyroxenites. It was found that a usable colour infrared image could not be obtained by vertical aerial photography because of the infundibular growth-form exhibited by this xerophytic vegetation. However the {{application of}} this film to <b>photogeology</b> was confirmed. The possibility of using selenium as a path finder for sulphide mineralisation was investigated. A suitably-rapid instrumental method for the determination of selenium and tellurium was developed and a selenium accumulating tree, Acacia oswaldii, was subsequently discovered. A known toxic shrub, Swainsona canescens, also accumulated selenium, and the potential of this selenifereus flora in locating sulphides has yet to be demonstrated. It was concluded that the research embodied in this thesis has indicated the application of botanical methods to mineral exploration in the Eremean Province of Western Australia, and has outlined promising avenues for further investigations...|$|E

Two field campaigns were carried out on land {{within the framework of the}} Italian Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartid e (PNRA). The first, in 1991 concerned the sedimentology and geology of coastal Pleisto-Holocene deposits, while the second, carried out in 1994 once the cartographic and geomorphological data had been processed, was to check the maps of the old coastlines and postglacial, Quaternary and chiefly marine, deposits. The research also embraces two other projects, "International Geological Correlation Programme" TGCP 367 "Late Quaternary Coastal Records of Rapid Change" and "Coastal Geomorphology Laboratory at the Centro Austral Antartico" (RAS-PYS project) funded by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia within its "Developing Countries" programme. One of the objectives of the research is the publication of an Atlas of the mainly Holocene geological and geomorphological features of the Strait of Magellan coasts, which will be useful for formulating evolutionary hypothesis of the Strait in very recent times. The Atlas is currently being completed but its publication will depend on the retrieval of funds to print the maps in colour. The Atlas, that includes the colour map presented here (n. 5112) and three other published maps (De Muro el AI., 1996 a; Di Grande et al., 1996; DeMuro et al., 1996 b), will consist of 12 sections at the 1 : 50. 000 scale of the east coast of the Strait of Magellan. It will not only contain thematic maps of the evolutionary characteristics of the Late Pleistocene-Holocene sea, but is also intended as a cartographic document of the geomorphologic and evolutionary features of the continental and transitional deposits underlying the marine deposits. Three general thematic maps 1 : 200. 000 in scale of the eastern region of the Strait of Magellan have already been published (Brambati et al., 1995 a; DeMuro et al., 1995; Di Grande et al., 1995). In the main the preparation of these maps, at least as regards the cartographic basis, has been far from easy. At best we could refer to the 1 : 50. 000 scale maps compiled by the Chilean l. G. M., which, besides the drawback of not covering the whole area, had a contour spacing of 50 metres. This created even greater difficulties in evaluating minor height differences, which was not infrequent. For areas not covered by the 1 : 50. 000 scale sections, we resorted to the 1 : 100. 000 preliminary maps drawn up by the Chilean E. Na. P. (Empresa Nacional de Petroleo), the 1 : 250. 000 maps of the Chilean l. G. M. and at times also to other l. G. M maps in smaller scales. In some instances, in solving objective difficulties it was necessary to use different scales at the same time, in addition to the various scale nautical charts for near coastal regions. We also used approximately 1 : 60. 000 scale aerial photos provided by the Servicio Aerofotogrammetrico Fuerza Aerea de Cile (S. A. F.) as well as Landsat TM and MSS satellite images acquired with funds of the Italian Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antarticle (PNRA) and processed at Cagliari University's <b>Photogeology</b> and Remote Sensing Laboratory, using funds from the RAS-PVS Project for setting up a Remote Sensing Laboratory at the Centro Austral Antartico" (see satellite images on attached map). During surveying the attention was focused on those forms, processes and deposits associated with the action of the Holo-Pleistocene sea, and, for a better regional perspective of the problems, with zonation of old glaciation. Moreover, the extremely intense coastal and eolian dynamics in progress today have also been taken into account. For completenss the general features of the fluvial and lacustrine landforms and deposits have also been mapped. The mapping criterion follows the example of recent works by the National Group (Italy) of Physical Geography and Geomorphology for various themes (coastal, submarine, continental). Moreover, for certain graphic and explanatory aspects, the cartography of the Atlas of the Coasts of the Strait of Magellan is innovative and represents a new and modern contribution to thematic mapping...|$|E
