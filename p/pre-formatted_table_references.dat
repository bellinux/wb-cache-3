50|$|A <b>table</b> (called the <b>referencing</b> <b>table)</b> {{can refer}} to a column (or a group of columns) in another <b>table</b> (the <b>{{referenced}}</b> <b>table)</b> by using a foreign key. The referenced column(s) in the <b>referenced</b> <b>table</b> must be under a unique constraint, such as a primary key. Also, self-references are possible (not fully implemented in MS SQL Server though). On inserting a new row into the <b>referencing</b> <b>table,</b> the relational database management system (RDBMS) checks if the entered key value exists in the <b>referenced</b> <b>table.</b> If not, no insert is possible. It is also possible to specify DRI actions on UPDATE and DELETE, such as CASCADE (forwards a change/delete in the <b>referenced</b> <b>table</b> to the <b>referencing</b> <b>tables),</b> NO ACTION (if the specific row is referenced, changing the key is not allowed) or SET NULL / SET DEFAULT (a changed/deleted key in the <b>referenced</b> <b>table</b> results in setting the referencing values to NULL or to the DEFAULT value if one is specified).|$|R

40|$|A new {{elliptic}} curve scalar multiplication algorithm is proposed. The algorithm offers {{about twice the}} troughput of some conventional OEF-base algorithms because it combines the Frobenius map with the <b>table</b> <b>reference</b> method based on base-OE expansion. Furthermore, since this algorithm suits conventional computational units such as 16, 32 and 64 bits, its base field Fp m is expected to enhance {{elliptic curve}} operation efficiency more than Fq (q is a prime) or F 2 n.

40|$|Abstract — “When {{everything}} fails, ask {{for additional}} domain knowledge ” {{is the current}} motto of machine learning. Therefore, assessing the real added value of prior/domain knowledge is a both deep and practical question. Most commercial data mining programs accept data <b>pre-formatted</b> as a <b>table,</b> each example being encoded as a fixed set of features. Is it worth spending time engineering elaborate features incorporating domain knowledge and/or designing ad hoc algorithms? Or else, can off-the-shelf programs working on simple features encoding the raw data without much domain knowledge do as well or better than skilled data analysts? To answer these questions, we organized a challenge for IJCNN 2007. The participants were allowed to compete in two tracks: The “prior knowledge ” track, for which they {{had access to the}} original raw data representation and as much knowledge as possible about the data, and the “agnostic learning ” track for which they were forced to use data <b>pre-formatted</b> as a <b>table</b> with dummy features.
