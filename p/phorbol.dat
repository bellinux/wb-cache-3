While this synthesis will not replace natural isolation products, it will enable researchers to create <b>phorbol</b> analogues for use in research, especially creating <b>phorbol</b> derivatives {{that can be used}} for anti-cancer activity. [...] Previously, the difficulty with synthesizing <b>phorbol</b> had been creating C-C bonds, especially in the 6 membered ring at the top of the molecule.

5000|$|Because croton tiglium oil is cocarcinogenic, it {{has been}} used in tumor research. [...] Croton oil {{is the source of the}} {{chemical}} compound <b>phorbol.</b> [...] Tumor promotion activity was traced to <b>phorbol</b> esters present in croton oil. [...] Pure <b>phorbol</b> 12-myristate 13-acetate which is found in croton oil is now used widely in laboratory research to induce tumor development.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phorbol</b> {{derivatives}} work {{primarily by}} interacting with protein kinase C (PKC), although they can {{interact with other}} phospholipid membrane receptors. [...] The esters bind to PKC {{in a similar way}} to its natural ligand, diacylglycerol, and activate the kinase. [...] Diacylglycerol is degraded quickly by the body, allowing PKC to be reversibly activated. When <b>phorbol</b> esters bind to the receptor, they are not degraded as efficiently by the body, leading to constitutively active PK. [...] Protein kinase C is involved in a number of important cell signaling pathways. Thus, <b>phorbol</b> ester exposure can show a wide range of results. The main results of <b>phorbol</b> exposure are tumor promotion and inflammatory response. Although <b>phorbol</b> is not a carcinogen itself, it greatly enhances the action of other substances and promotes tumor proliferation. PKC is a key component in biological pathways controlling cell growth and differentiation. When <b>phorbol</b> esters bind to PKC, cell proliferation pathways are activated. This effect greatly promotes tumors when the cells are exposed to even a sub-carcinogenic amount of a substance. [...] Protein kinase C is also involved in activation of inflammation pathways such as the NF-KB pathway. Thus, exposure to <b>phorbol</b> products can induce an inflammatory response in tissues. [...] Symptoms can include edema and pain, especially to the skin and mucus membranes.While <b>phorbol</b> itself doesn’t have irritant activity, nearly all <b>phorbol</b> esters are highly irritant, {{with a wide range of}} ID50s. [...] The LD50 [...] <b>phorbol</b> esters for male mice was found to be about 27 mg/kg, with the mice showing hemorrhage and congestion of pulmonary blood vessels, as well as lesions throughout the body.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phorbol</b> is a natural, plant-derived organic compound. It is {{a member}} of the tigliane family of diterpenes. <b>Phorbol</b> was first {{isolated}} in 1934 as the hydrolysis product of croton oil, which is derived from the seeds of the purging croton, Croton tiglium. The structure of <b>phorbol</b> was determined in 1967. Various esters of <b>phorbol</b> have important biological properties, the most notable of which is the capacity to act as tumor promoters through activation of protein kinase C. They mimic diacylglycerols, glycerol derivatives in which two hydroxyl groups have reacted with fatty acids to form esters. The most common and potent <b>phorbol</b> ester is 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), also called phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), which is used as a biomedical research tool in models of carcinogenesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phorbol</b> 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) is a <b>phorbol</b> ester {{which is}} one of the {{constituents}} of croton oil. As an activator of protein kinase C, it is a weak tumor promoter compared to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phorbol</b> esters are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds found {{in a variety of}} plants, particularly in the Euphorbiaceae and Thymelaeaceae families. [...] Chemically, they are ester derivatives of the tetracyclic diterpenoid <b>phorbol.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Phorbol</b> esters (such as PMA) are analogues of DAG and potent tumor {{promoters}} {{that cause}} {{a variety of}} physiological changes when administered to both cells and tissues.

5000|$|Because {{of their}} {{mechanism}} of action, <b>phorbol</b> esters {{can be used}} to study tumor proliferation and pain response. TPA is most commonly used in the laboratory to induce a cellular response. For example, TPA {{can be used to}} measure response to pain and test compounds that may mitigate the inflammatory response. [...] TPA and other <b>phorbol</b> esters {{can also be used to}} induce tumor formation and elucidate its mechanism. [...] Some <b>phorbol</b> esters have shown anti-cancer activities and can potentially be used as a defense against certain viruses and bacteria. [...] TPA, together with ionomycin, can also be used to stimulate T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production, and is used in protocols for intracellular staining of these cytokines. [...] <b>Phorbol,</b> in the form of croton oil, is also in folk medicine as a purgative, counter irritant, or anthelmintic.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Phorbol</b> is {{a natural}} product found in many plants, {{especially}} those of the Euphorbiaceae and Thymelaeaceae families. [...] <b>Phorbol</b> is identified as the active constituent of the highly toxic New World tropical manchineel or 'beach apple' Hippomane mancinella. It is very soluble in most polar organic solvents, {{as well as in}} water. In the manchineel, this leads to an additional exposure risk during rain, where liquid splashing from an undamaged tree may also be injurious. Contact with the tree or consumption of its fruit can lead to symptoms such as severe pain and swelling. [...] Another plant of particular note is Croton Tiglium, the source of croton oil from which <b>phorbol</b> was initially isolated. The seeds and oil of C. Tiglium have been used for hundreds of years in traditional medicine, generally as a purgative. The seeds have been mentioned in Chinese herbal texts as early as 2000 years ago and have since been used for the treatment of a variety of conditions from headache to intestinal disorders. [...] The purgative effects of the oil are largely attributed to the high percentage of <b>phorbol</b> esters contained in the oil. Although derivatives of the croton plant have been used medicinally for thousands of years, <b>phorbol</b> was only isolated from C. Tiglium seeds in 1934.
