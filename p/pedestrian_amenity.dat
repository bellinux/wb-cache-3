40|$|Traffic signal {{control systems}} are usually {{designed}} to maximise vehicle capacity and minimise vehicle delay {{with the needs}} of pedestrians considered separately as necessary. Therefore, the aim of this research is to improve the signal control at pedestrian crossings, so that optimisation takes into account the total delay to all road users including pedestrians. Upstream Detection and Volumetric Detection at pedestrian crossing facilities have been identified as potential alternatives that might enhance <b>pedestrian</b> <b>amenity.</b> These new possibilities were evaluated using a micro-simulation software. Research to date has shown that the VISSIM model is suitable for this evaluation and the latest algorithm for signal controlled pedestrian crossing, the Puffin has been coded into the model and tested. The Puffin then formed a base control strategy against which new strategies were evaluated. The new strategies were then evaluated based on travel delay to both vehicle and pedestrian and also financial benefit to the road crossing. After calibration and validation in VISSIM model, an Upstream Detection and Volumetric Detection were developed. In the Upstream Detection, a push button was located 5 meters at an upstream location of the crossing. In the Volumetric Detection, the optimum maximum green was determined based on the lowest total person delay and total delay costs. Generally, an Upstream Detection caused a reduction in total person delay and total delay costs at a lower vehicle flow. The Volumetric Detection caused a reduction in total person delay and total delay costs at all vehicle and pedestrian flow combinations. The results showed that both Upstream Detection and Volumetric Detection have promising benefits to implement at Puffin crossing. Upstream Detection has a clear benefit at a lower vehicle flow while the Volumetric Detection shows there are changes on maximum green settings at a lower vehicle flow as pedestrian flow increases...|$|E

40|$|The work of VRU-TOO is {{targeted}} specifically at {{the application of}} ATT for reducing risk and improving comfort (e. g. minimisation of delay) for Vulnerable Road Users, namely pedestrians. To achieve this, the project operates at three levels. At the European level practical pilot implementations in three countries (U. K., Portugal and Greece) are linked with behavioural studies of the micro-level interaction of pedestrians and vehicles {{and the development of}} computer simulation models. At the National level, the appropriate Highway Authorities are consulted, according to their functions, for the pilot implementations and informed of the results. Finally, at the local level, the pilot project work is fitted into specfic local (municipality) policy contexts in all three pilot project sites. The present report focuses on the Elefsina pilot application in Greece and the relevant National and Local policy contexts are the following. At the National level, the ultimate responsibility for road safety and signal installations rests with the Ministry of Environment and Public Works. The Ministry is responsible for the adoption of standards and solutions for problems and also for a large number of actual installations, since local authorities lack the size and expertise to undertake such work on their own One of the project's aims is to provide information to the Ministry as to the suitability of the methods developed for aiding pedestrian movement, ultimately leading to a specification for its wider use. The Ministry is expecting to use the final {{results of the present study}} for possible modifications of its present standards for pedestrian controlled traffic signals. At the local level (Elefsina) the municipality has, in the past, pursued environmental improvements through pedestrianisation schemes in the city centre. At the same time it has developed a special traffic management policy, to solve a particularly serious problem of through traffic. A summary of the policy is contained in Appendix A and more details in a previous deliverable (Tillis, 1992). In the particular case of Elefsina pedestrian induced delay to through vehicular traffic, may form a key element in this policy ensuring at the same time, an incentive to divert to the existing bypass and enhancing pedestrian movement. The effectiveness of pedestrian detection techniques tested in the pilot, will provide valuable information on the future implementation of the policy. Thus, the Elefsina Pilot Project operates at the same time on three levels: It provides a basis, in combination with the other two pilot project sites, for comparing the effects of pedestrian detection on pedestrian safety and comfort at a European level. It provides information to the National authorities (Ministry of Environment and Public Works) for their standards setting, scheme design and implementation tasks. It fits into a comprehensive plan at the local level for effecting environmental improvements and enhancing <b>pedestrian</b> <b>amenity</b> and comfort at the same time. In addition, an investigation into the capabilities of pedestrian detectors to function as data collection devices, was performed. The data 'quality gap' betweenvehicular and pedestrian tr&c may be closed with the utilisation of microwave pedestrian detectors, providing a more solid foundation for the planning for total person movement through networks (vehicle occupants, public transport passengers, pedestrians).

40|$|Background Victorian {{architecture}} and built {{form in the}} UK can be quite varied in its appearance, yet is often praised by scholars and the design professions for its durability, flexibility and adaptability to changing circumstances. Although not evidenced in the literature, such neighbourhoods also possess many of the qualities that are important for walkability. Aim The {{aim of the research}} was to ascertain whether UK neighbourhoods containing a moderate proportion of Victorian {{architecture and}} built form characteristics were more walkable than neighbourhoods with less, or no, Victorian architecture. Method Researchers selected 12 neighbourhoods in three UK cities (4 neighbourhoods in each city) with varying proportions of Victorian architecture and built form characteristics. Using the app-based version of the Irvine-Minnesota Inventory, which contains approximately 290 subjective and objective questions concerning walkability in the urban environment, approximately 40 streets in each neighbourhood were audited. The collected data then was analysed along 10 urban design categories – form, density, proximity, connectivity, parks and public spaces, <b>pedestrian</b> <b>amenities,</b> personal safety, traffic safety, aesthetics and recreational facilities – {{to determine the extent of}} each neighbourhood’s walkability. Results Within each city, the neighbourhoods with the highest proportion of Victorian architecture and built form characteristics were perceived to be the most walkable. Examining the urban design categories in more detail, these same neighbourhoods also had the best form and densities, conducive to walkability, and the closest proximity to relevant services and infrastructures. There were modest correlations between these neighbourhoods and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>amenities,</b> traffic safety and aesthetics. Conclusions Neighbourhoods containing at least a moderate amount of Victorian architecture and built form characteristics appear to foster walkability. As such, they offer design and policy lessons for urban planners and designers, architects, developers and local authorities as they look to create more liveable communities for the future...|$|R

In the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, traffic diversion also became a key policy in a civic drive to remove street prostitution from the West End, a struggle that invoked discourses of ‘livability’ which were used to justify exclusion of socially undesirable people from valued space on the streets in this downtown neighbourhood.

40|$|Examining {{committee}} chair: Marc SchlossbergWalkability is {{an emerging}} and hot {{topic in the}} study of urban form. Many planning scholars and practitioners alike have already examined the many components of the land use-transportation connection and built environment-physical activity link. A rapidly growing area of urban form research concerns how to measure the level of walkability of neighborhoods. Walkability, also referred to as pedestrian accessibility, has and is being measured from a variety of angles. Some of these have used GIS and some others have not. However, very few to none have examined walkability on a street-by-street basis. This study performed a fine-grained walkability assessment at the street level by collecting data in a cutting edge, high-tech manner using a mobile GIS. Four neighborhood parks in Springfield, Oregon were studied. There were twenty ‘key’ indicators of walkability that were aggregated to the census block level in order to derive an average walkability score. Delineating pedestrian catchment areas around each park using the average walkability score, U. S. Census Bureau TIGER data, and Lane Council of Governments local government street classifications allowed an analysis of the walkable area and quality of the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>amenities.</b> In the end, some indicators were found to be better indicators of walkability, sidewalks being the more prevalent, and that some GIS data can be a substitute for more refined methods of collecting data...|$|R

40|$|The New Urbanism {{movement}} {{calls for}} redesigning American neighborhoods {{so that they}} are less oriented toward automobile travel and more conducive to walking, bicycling and transit riding, especially for non-work trips. New Urbanism calls for a return to compact neighborhoods with grid-like street patterns, mixed land uses and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>amenities.</b> This paper investigates the effects of New Urbanism design principles on both non-work and commuting travel by comparing modal splits between two distinctly different neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area. The neo-traditional neighborhood, Rockridge, and the nearby conventional suburban community, Lafayette, were chosen as case sites because they have similar income profiles, freeway and transit service levels, and geographical locations. Rockridge residents averaged around a 10 percentage point higher share of non-work trips by non-automobile modes than did residents of Lafayette, controlling for relevant factors like income and transit service levels. The greatest differences were for shop trips under one mile. Rockridge residents also averaged substantially higher rates of non-work walk trips per day, matched by lower rates of daily auto travel, suggesting that walking substitutes for motorized travel, at the margin. Modal splits were more similar for work trips, confirming the proposition that neighborhood design practices exert their greatest influence on local shopping trips and other non-work purposes. For work trips, compact, mixed-use, and pedestrian-oriented development appears to have the strongest effect on access trips to rail stations, in particular inducing higher shares of access trips by foot and bicycle. ...|$|R

40|$|Master of Regional and Community PlanningDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningJason BrodyKessler’s 1893 {{parks and}} boulevards system was {{established}} to spur investment. The 1893 Report shaped the present city pattern and form of Downtown Kansas City by encouraging decentralized city and metropolitan growth. Today’s system discourages pedestrian mobility and accessibility through the design and context of the public spaces. Since walkability contributes to successful public spaces, walking for transportation to encourage active use could improve today’s open-space system. To address the present condition facing the system, the report analyzes the morphology of Kessler’s parks and boulevards system within the 2010 Greater Downtown Area Plan boundary. For methods, stakeholder notes and professional interviews explain the planning process behind the 2011 - 2012 KCDC project to revitalize public space. The stakeholder notes and professional interviews assess {{the context of the}} Kansas City Design Center’s vision to revitalize Kessler’s parks and boulevards system. Using the StreetSmartTM walkability model, the design and context of public space can help revitalize Kessler’s 1893 system and today’s park system. The model can be used to measure and prioritize investment by assessesing the pedestrian mobility and accessibility of public spaces. The implication of the report is that if the design and context of public spaces addresses the public interest and walkability, public spaces will become connected, diverse, market-competitive, and actively used.

40|$|Bus {{transfer}} {{centers are}} often regarded as ‘undesirable neighbors’ {{that are difficult}} to site and difficult to gain support for due to noise, exhaust, traffic congestion, and the presence of unwanted passengers. In fact, there are some locations where major bus transfer activities are not only not welcome, but are probably not {{in the best interests of}} the surrounding development. However, many transit agencies are elevating the acceptance and relevance of transit in their service areas by making their transfer centers true community assets rather than nuisances. This often means finding the right location for a transit center for both the surrounding community and the passengers, replacing run down development with new facilities, incorporating exciting and inspiring architecture and design, and improving the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>amenities</b> and safety and security of the immediate area around the transfer center. Some communities have greatly expanded the concept of bus transfer centers by using them as locations for vital health and human services, as well as other conveniences that improve the quality of life for the residents of the surrounding community. In addition, others have utilized the advantage of their Federal grants to build transit centers that provide opportunities for joint development that help to generate revenues that can be used for other public improvements in the immediate area, which help to attract additional private investment and positive development where there once was blight.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 12 While {{surviving}} as {{a monument}} to the power of car culture in the 20 th century, today the gas station has become increasing obsolete in the face of growing cities and increasing environmental awareness. Alternative energy sources and different modes of transit such as walking, biking, car sharing, and public transit have grown in popularity. As a result, the number of gas stations nationally has decreased since the 1970 s, especially in urban contexts. While the redevelopment of gas station sites aims to increase density by filling the voids in the fabric once dedicated to the car, they typically fail to address the history of the site as an urban node in the circulation of people, vehicles, and energy. With their prime urban locations and past associations, the sites of former gas stations have the potential to become new nodes of distribution and communication in the city. This thesis argues that the obsolesce of the urban gas station offers the potential for a new building type that will better serve today’s changing needs for transportation and distribution of energy. The proposal consists of the design for a small-scale urban amenity node, or “Energy Commons” in Seattle. The “Energy Commons” will combine utilitarian functions with a contextual neighborhood-based program through personal vehicle recharging, neighborhood co-working offices, cyclist and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>amenities,</b> and solar energy and water harvesting and storage.
