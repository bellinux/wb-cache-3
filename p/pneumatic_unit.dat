40|$|The paper {{shows the}} results of a {{theoretical}} and experimental research activity oriented to the design and the realization of a of a low cost pneumatronic prototype, proposed for tasks of pipes and ducts inspection. The prototype consists on a self-moving <b>pneumatic</b> <b>unit</b> conceived to emulate the grub’s motion: variable geometry components are deformed under the action of pneumatic power supply, following a programmable logic actuation. A fluidic muscle is used to generate the motion and two deformable air chambers are arranged at the ends of the muscle in order to assure the anchorage to the internal pipe wall. The motion of the pneumatic robot is related to the pneumatic sequence involving inflating and deflating of the air-chambers and to the actuation to the muscle. It is required that the user can actuate in any moment the robot and manage the advancing and withdrawal, with flexible dwells. Aspects related to design procedure followed to optimize the geometry of the head, the solution of problems related to anomalous deformation of the fluidic muscle and the implementation of flexible motion laws, the comparison with other self-moving prototypes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Medical gases can be {{identified}} simply if they are supplied at different pipeline pressures. Routine maintenance errors, accidental pipeline cross-connections, or gas failures, can be automatically detected by incorporating a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>unit</b> with pressure-sensitive valves into the anaesthetic machine. A fall-iafe method of ensuring the delivery of the correct gases to the patient is described. Tragedies have been reported throughout the world from errors in medical gas pipeline installations (Robinson, 1979) and, {{in addition to the}} reported mishaps, we have been aware of other instances where disaster has been narrowly averted. The com-monest cause appears to be cross-connecting gas supply pipelines at some point between storage and the point of use (Klein and Lilburn, 1980; Cundy and Baldock, 1982). However, errors in outlet fit-tings and cross-connected lines within the anaesthe-tic machine have occurred also (Spurring and Shenolikar, 1978; Downing, 1981). A system is proposed whereby gases are delivered at differential pressures. This allows the user to check correct connections visually and by audible alarm. The system will automatically interrupt the supply of all gases {{in the event of a}} fault in the oxygen supply line and that of other gases if they deviate from the standards set. THE PRINCIPLE It is customary to distribute medical gases at a pressure of about 400 kPa. The reason for the adop-tion of this specific pressure is obscure and is proba-bly the result of common usage rather than deliber-ate design. The pressure of 400 kPa is by no means universal. The U. S. A. National Code for example, calls for a "Dynamic Pressure of 345 kPa (50 psi). " We propose that each medical gas be assigned it...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2007 The {{increasingly}} {{sedentary lifestyle}} {{of the past}} 30 years has contributed to declining health. Consequently, exercise is vital for good health maintenance. The global Health and Fitness Industry repeatedly indicates the need for optimally managed exercise with accurate information feedback. Compared to other industries, the fitness industry is lagging behind in incorporating Information Technology into its operations. On the other hand, the most current exercise equipment impose fixed-trajectory exercise on users with the dominance of static equipment designs. These exercise equipment are normally deadweight-based equipment. In deadweight-based exercise equipment, the weights generally can be changed only when the equipment is inactive. Therefore, a more novel exercise environment is required for current exercisers in the fitness industry. This thesis explores to develop a computer-controlled pneumatic dynamic resistance exercise equipment with onboard data management. This new technology optimises exercise effectiveness for users. Exercisers will have advanced diagnostic capacity, and will capture user data which can be manipulated into meaningful information for use by Health and Fitness Industry stakeholders. This thesis will explore all the key concepts about computer-controlled equipment. The key concepts to be investigated will include FX (force-displacement) control technology, pneumatic system control, fail-safe mechanics, and Graphical User Interface design. The primary aim of the project is to replicate and enhance the functionality, performance, and sensation of deadweight-based equipment. A further aim of the project is to investigate the feasibility of designing a compact retrofit-able <b>pneumatic</b> <b>unit</b> to replace the deadweights of existing standard exercise equipment.

40|$|The article {{shows the}} {{relevance}} of the approaches to the object-oriented programming when modeling the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>units</b> (PU). Based on the analysis of the calculation schemes of aggregates pneumatic systems two basic objects, namely a cavity flow and a material point were highlighted. Basic interactions of objects are defined. Cavity-cavity interaction: ex-change of matter and energy with the flows of mass. Cavity-point interaction: force interaction, exchange of energy in the form of operation. Point-point in-teraction: force interaction, elastic interaction, inelastic interaction, and inter-vals of displacement. The authors have developed mathematical models of basic objects and interactions. Models and interaction of elements are implemented in the object-oriented programming. Mathematical models of elements of PU design scheme are implemented in derived from the base class. These classes implement the models of flow cavity, piston, diaphragm, short channel, diaphragm to be open by a given law, spring, bellows, elastic collision, inelastic collision, friction, PU stages with a limited movement, etc. A numerical integration of differential equations for the mathematical models of PU design scheme elements is based on the Runge-Kutta method of the fourth order. On request each class performs a tact of integration i. e. calcu-lation of the coefficient method. The paper presents an integration algorithm of the system of differential equations. All objects of the PU design scheme are placed in a unidirectional class list. Iterator loop cycle initiates the integration tact of all the objects in the list. One in four iteration makes a transition to the next step of integration. Calculation process stops when any object shows a shutdowns flag. The proposed approach was tested in the calculation of a number of PU designs. With regard to traditional approaches to modeling, the authors-proposed method features in easy enhancement, code reuse, high reliability, and low time consuming development.

MethodsEight sheep received a Thoratec paracorporeal ventricular assist device (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, Calif) via ventriculo-aortic cannulation.

ResultsThe location of the minimum of stroke work was observed at a delay of 10 % (soon after aortic valve opening), resulting in a median of 43 % reduction in stroke work compared with baseline.

40|$|AbstractThe first {{successful}} {{application of the}} high precision pneumatic loading system for advanced material testing was developed at VTT in 1995. The pneumatic servo-controlled loading system is capable of operating {{in a range of}} extreme conditions such as high temperature, pressurised water or steam, Super Critical Water (SCW) and irradiation environments. The main benefit of the pneumatic loading system {{is that there is no}} moving parts (loading lead-throughs) required for loading a specimen inside a pressure vessel or otherwise demanding containment (water, gas, radioactive), only pressure lines and electrical feedback connections together with the <b>pneumatic</b> loading <b>unit,</b> bellows are required. Also, the pneumatically powered testing device itself can be far away from the control units and regulating servo valves. The HIPS, previously used for tensile testing, stress corrosion cracking, fatigue, in-pile creep fatigue (copper), and other test variants with combined environmental impact, has now been modified to perform load and strain controlled testing at temperatures in the creep range for steels.

In our article, the basic operation principle of the device is presented, and experimental evidence of its extraordinary performance is given: a reproducibility of 2 % to 5 % and a homogeneity within individual droplet arrays of 1 % to 2 % has been measured, as well as viscosity independent performance for liquids in the range from 1 to 5 mPas. The applicability of the DWP technology within HTS is demonstrated by performing plates with 384 or 1536 wells at a pitch of 4. 5 mm or 2. 25 mm are handled within automated equipment. Around 1, 000 dispensing cycles per minute are completed currently by conventional pipetting sys-tems. To push the limit of HTS, assay volumes ranging from 2 lL to 5 lL have to be miniaturized even further, and the liquid handling has to be accelerated. 1 - 4 Therefore, pipetting and dispensing systems are required, which can handle volumes in the nanoliter range and operate in a multi-parallel fashion compatible with well-plate formats.

Another activity during this reporting period was related to Subtask 4. 3, the selection and testing of the transport system for the FGD material. A laboratory-scale <b>pneumatic</b> emplacement test <b>unit</b> (ETU) for dry FGD materials was built at the CAER to generate data so that a final selection of the field demonstration technology can be made. A dry pneumatic system was chosen for laboratory testing because the equipment and expertise available at the CAER matched this sort of technology best. While the design of the laboratory system was based on shotcrete technology, the physical properties of the emplaced FGD material is expected to be similar for other transport techniques, either pneumatic or hydraulic. In other words, the selection of a dry pneumatic transport system for laboratory testing does not necessarily imply that a scaled-up version will be used for the field demonstration. The ETU is a convenient means of producing samples for subsequent chemical and physical testing by a representative emplacement technology. Ultimately, the field demonstration technology will be chosen based on the laboratory data and the suitability of locally available equipment...|$|R

There are several advantages with using a flexible fixture such as that you can process workpieces with different length, height and thickness in the same fixture. Bigger workpieces takes time to fasten in the fixture because the machine operator must tighten the clamps by hand. By automating the fixture with for example grippers or clamping cylinders the set time would be reduced because the clamping process is automatic. In this report there is also a mapping of various flexible fixture components such as grippers, clamping cylinders and linear units. These components are quite common today in the processing industry and are also used in fixtures. The idea of flexible components is to provide a more flexible and automated fixture then the currently used at SAAB. These components were also linked to a concept idea and based on this idea, several concepts were sketched. The result of the concept idea was two concepts that were generated in the CAD program CATIA. The first concept uses grippers for the clamping process and for additional flexibility the grippers can also be rotated with rotary actuators. Linear units are used to automatically position the beams to reduce the set time. The second concept uses clamping cylinders and rotary grippers to clamp the workpiece. Beams are positioned by an operator, but linear units could also be used in this concept as well. Finally, the concepts were evaluated according to a method from Ullman with a so called decision matrix. The concept that fulfilled the criteria best was concept 1, which uses grippers and linear units. Another method that was used from Ullman was a QFD (Quality Function Deployment) chart and this chart shows the design requirements that are important and that should be fulfilled. The components that are presented in this report have not been tested. This could be a suggestion in an upcoming work to test these components. For example the <b>pneumatic</b> linear <b>units</b> with passive or active brake could be tested to make sure that the braking force is sufficient...|$|R
40|$|Heart {{disease is}} the {{principal}} {{cause of death in}} most industrialised countries. In the U. S. A. for example, 2. 3 million individuals suffer from chronic heart failure, with an annual increase in numbers of 17 %. It is estimated that 17, 000 to 35, 000 of them per year will die from this disease if they are not given either a heart transplant or an artificial heart. Unfortunately, the numbers of heart donors cannot meet the demand for transplantation, and, at present, the artificial heart is a prohibitively expensive alternative. The total artificial heart (TAH) intended for the total replacement of the natural heart is still some years away from realisation. However, the ventricular assist device (VAD) which is used temporarily to maintain an ailing heart is available now, although only in restricted numbers due to difficulties in processing the biocompatible materials used during manufacture. Consequently, such devices are expensive, costing anywhere from AUS$ 30, 000 for the pump head to AUS$ 200, 000 for a complete system. In this study, the Australian designed $quot;Spiral Vortex$quot; VAD was used to investigate fabrication techniques for use in the eventual cost-effective manufacture of a pump head costing approximately AUS$ 4, 000. A second VAD originally designed at the Kolff Laboratory, University of Utah, U. S. A. was also used for comparative evaluation. The hard-shell Spiral Vortex VAD is intended to be used outside the body, while the soft-shell Kolff VAD has the advantage of being implantable for long-term use. They were cast from epoxy resin and vacuum formed from polyurethane, respectively. Several units of each were fabricated, including 60 of the Kolff VAD, for use in vitro and in vivo experiments. From these experiments it was found that both the Spiral Vortex and Kolff VADs could be fabricated to quality controllable standards. The Kolff VAD was used exclusively in chronic animal experiments, and was able to sustain sheep and goats for periods of up to five weeks. Furthermore, it became evident that techniques used in fabrication of the Kolff VAD could be adopted for use in the mass production of the Spiral Vortex VAD. The two other areas investigated in this study were the prosthetic heart valves and drive systems used for an artificial heart. A high percentage of the cost of an artificial heart is accounted for by the inflow/outflow valves. The trileaflet valve used in the Kolff VAD, which mimics the natural heart valve, was fabricated using inexpensive vacuum-forming techniques. Quality control was found to be adequate, with good flow characteristics which could be maintained for several weeks in animal experiments. Both the Spiral Vortex and Kolff VADs are pulsation pumps which require a <b>pneumatic</b> driver <b>unit.</b> This driver is the single most expensive component in a VAD system, costing upwards of AUS$ 150, 000. The theoretical efficiency of a compact hydromechanical drive unit was investigated using a test rig to simulate an original design based primarily on proprietary components. Results obtained so far indicate that the proposed driver can operate only under limited conditions {{as a result of its}} severe reduction in size. By adopting mass production techniques wherever possible in the fabrication of the VAD (pump head) and valves, and by reducing the cost and size of the driver unit, it may therefore be possible to produce a cost effective ventricular assist device system...|$|R
