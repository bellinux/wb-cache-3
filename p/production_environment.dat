25|$|The studios {{hosted a}} wide variety of TV {{programmes}} for a range of broadcasters, including Strictly Come Dancing, Harry Hill's TV Burp, Match of the Day, Later... with Jools Holland, Miranda, The Alan Titchmarsh Show, The Armstrong and Miller Show and 8 out of 10 Cats, and big complex live productions such as Children in Need and Comic Relief. Over the years they were home to some of the world's most famous TV programmes including Fawlty Towers, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Blue Peter, Absolutely Fabulous, classic Doctor Who and most of the best known BBC drama series. From the 1980s the use of the complex for such productions rapidly declined with the last major drama series to be shot there being The House of Eliott, which ended in 1994, and the last single drama recorded was Henry IV, Part 1, in 1995. This was because drama production moved almost entirely onto film or single-camera video, and Television Centre was a video-based, multi-camera <b>production</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{who create}} {{software}} <b>production</b> <b>environments</b> face considerable problems. Soft� ware <b>production</b> <b>environments</b> are large {{systems that are}} costly to develop. Furthermore � soft� ware <b>production</b> <b>environments</b> which support particular software engineering methods may not be applicable to {{a large number of}} software production projects. These conditions have formed a trend towards research into ways which will lessen the cost of developing software <b>production</b> <b>environments.</b> In particular � the trend has been towards the construction of meta�environments from which speci�c software <b>production</b> <b>environments</b> can be created. In this paper � we at� tempt to categorize more than 60 meta�environment e�orts. For each of the categories � we review research e�orts which illustrate di�erent approaches within that category. We conclude by presenting an emerging common thread of requirements which links this �eld together. ...|$|R

40|$|The Canadian sheep {{industry}} is characterised by highly diverse <b>production</b> <b>environments,</b> products, markets, and genetic resources. Exploitation of genetic resources for crossbreeding exists but is opportunistic rather than structured. Fluctuating markets and high input costs result in highly variable economic values for lamb and wool. Breeding objectives {{for the various}} <b>production</b> <b>environments</b> are numerous and would imply customisation of breeding objectives at the individual farm level. An integrated national approach could consider all genetic resources and <b>production</b> <b>environments,</b> heterosis and complementarity for development of an optimal number of breeding objectives and breeding strategies...|$|R
2500|$|The {{maturity}} of Ruby implementations {{tends to be}} measured by their ability to run the Ruby on Rails (Rails) framework, because it is complex to implement and uses many Ruby-specific features. The point when a particular implementation achieves this goal is called [...] "the Rails singularity".

2500|$|The {{animation}} {{was done}} in Maya 8.5 with some motion capture animations tweaked in MotionBuilder. 3D artists, animators and level designers used Maya as their <b>production</b> <b>environment,</b> which is unusual considering that most 3D games are produced using 3ds max. A large library of custom Maya tools and scripts was created to support these different disciplines. Tools like [...] "Hyperion", a lightmap rendering software, were used in place of Maya’s viewport rendering software. In-game animation was assisted with another tool they created called [...] "AnimationBlender" [...] and particle effects were edited using a tool called [...] "Particle Editor". They also created a tool called [...] "ColorTweaker", which gave them the possibility to do color correction on the PS3 in real-time.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 September 2006, a Transrapid train {{collided}} with a maintenance vehicle at [...] on the test track in Lathen. The maintenance vehicle destroyed {{the first section of}} the train, then lifted off the track to complete two full rotations before landing in a pile of pre-exploded debris. This was the first major accident involving a Transrapid train. The news media reported 23 fatalities and that several people were severely injured, these being the first fatalities on any maglev. The accident was caused by human error with the first train being allowed to leave the station before the maintenance vehicle had moved off the track. This situation could be avoided in a <b>production</b> <b>environment</b> by installing an automatic collision avoidance system.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a model that explains the involvement of first level handlers in farm level decisions. In particular, the research attempts to explain observed differences among levels of farmer's autonomy in production contracts of different agricultural commodities. We show that the trade off that a contractor faces for holding the decision rights for controlling production inputs varies for different <b>production</b> <b>environments.</b> In particular, the contractor prefers controlling inputs in production of commodities that have relatively uniform <b>production</b> <b>environments,</b> whereas it is more efficient to delegate the control to the producer for commodities that have diverse <b>production</b> <b>environments.</b> Agribusiness,...|$|R

50|$|Having a test {{environment}} {{can lead to}} failures in tested systems when they deploy in the <b>production</b> <b>environment</b> because the <b>production</b> <b>environment</b> may differ from the {{test environment}} in a significant way. However, building a replica of a <b>production</b> <b>environment</b> is cost prohibitive. Instead, the test environment, or a separate pre-production environment ("staging") should be built to be a scalable version of the actual <b>production</b> <b>environment</b> to both alleviate costs while maintaining technology stack composition and nuances. Within these test environments, service virtualization is commonly used to obtain on-demand access to dependencies (e.g., APIs, third-party applications, services, mainframes, etc.) that are beyond the team's control, still evolving, or too complex to configure in a virtual test lab.|$|E

40|$|Many past {{studies have}} {{recognised}} {{the importance of}} a shift in the supply of a commodity as a measure of the impact of research. Several of these have discussed a range of options for mathematically representing this shift in an aggregate supply function. Among those, the most realistic assumption would be ‘supply shift as parallel’ and subdividing the production area in to homogenous regions in terms {{of the impact of the}} innovation in question on yield and production costs. But, very few researchers have focused on the importance of understanding the theoretical linkages underlying these possible shifts across homogenous <b>Production</b> <b>Environments</b> (PE). It is also crucial to disaggregate the total aggregate welfare estimates based on different categories of adopters as well as <b>production</b> <b>environments</b> (PEs). In general, the normal aggregate estimates masks the range of important implications of research impacts by hiding the exceeded welfare gains of favourable environments with that of lower benefits to the non-favourable environments. There is an equal chance of committing significant empirical error in over measuring the welfare changes by ignoring the different <b>production</b> <b>environments.</b> The detailed understanding of different <b>production</b> <b>environments</b> and technology adoption process facilitates incorporation of each component of the story/activity in its appropriate form rather than developing an additional set of hypothetical assumptions. It is obvious that the corresponding unit cost reductions will not be the same across heterogeneous <b>production</b> <b>environments</b> for a given specific technology in particular region. This research paper will present empirical results of chickpea improved cultivars adoption in Andhra Pradesh state of India and provides a deeper understanding about dis-aggregated <b>production</b> <b>environments</b> and matching unit cost reductions in measuring welfare changes due to research...|$|R
