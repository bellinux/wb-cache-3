5|$|Norman Gary Finkelstein (born December 8, 1953) is an American {{political}} scientist, activist, professor, and author. His primary {{fields of}} research are the Israeli–Palestinian {{conflict and the}} politics of the Holocaust, an interest motivated by the experiences of his parents who were Jewish Holocaust survivors. He is a graduate of Binghamton University and received his Ph.D in political science at Princeton University. He has held faculty positions at Brooklyn College, Rutgers University, Hunter College, New York University, and DePaul University where he was an assistant <b>professor</b> <b>from</b> 2001 to 2007.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 2014, {{controversy}} arose over a {{story that}} Baker told the previous night about a fisherman and his two sons in New Bedford. In the following days, The Boston Globe and The Standard-Times were unable to find the fisherman. This story, which Baker claims to have occurred in 2009, has been attributed by a <b>professor</b> <b>from</b> Northeastern University as a potential false memory. Coakley seized on this moment to launch an attack on Baker, and visited New Bedford to meet with fishing industry leaders.|$|E
5|$|From 1932 to 1934, Spedding {{worked for}} Lewis as a {{chemistry}} instructor. Around this time, he {{became interested in}} the chemistry of the rare earths. These were expensive and hard to find, and generally available only in minute amounts. In 1933 he won the Irving Langmuir Award for most outstanding young chemist. The award came with a cash prize of $1,000. He borrowed money to travel to Chicago to collect it. While he was there, he was approached by a man offering several pounds of Europium and Samarium. His benefactor was Herbert Newby McCoy, a retired chemistry <b>professor</b> <b>from</b> the University of Chicago, who had obtained a supply of these elements from the Lindsey Light and Chemical Company, where they were a byproduct of thorium production. A few weeks later, Spedding received a package in the mail containing jars of the metals.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{graduation}} in 1968, Kikai worked {{for two years}} as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard. Meanwhile, he stayed {{in touch with his}} philosophy <b>professor</b> <b>from</b> his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Shōji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made a great impact on Kikai. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At that time (when somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¥40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥320,000 and mentioned this to Fukuda, who immediately lent him the money, with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80mm lens, is what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since.|$|E
5|$|Jones had {{previously}} codirected AJ Goes to France, a 2006 live-action independent film that also has Thompson {{as the leading}} actor. It was produced as an assignment for Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, where Jones majored in film. Jones had moved from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, to Minneapolis in 2005, after he graduated from Fargo South High School. For AJ's Infinite Summer, Jones was inspired by his hometown, {{as well as the}} comics he drew that featured AJ and his other friends, Danny Davy and Morgan. Additionally, the character of Peter is based on Greg Carlson, Jones' <b>professor</b> <b>from</b> Concordia and also a film director and a critic for the High Plains Reader. Secret Cities, a Fargo-based band in which Jones' friends play, provided the score for the pilot. Jones found it excellent that both his friends and his friend's band were allowed by the network to do work for the pilot.|$|E
5|$|Like other Pokémon games, Ruby and Sapphires {{gameplay}} is linear; {{the main}} events {{occur in a}} fixed order. The protagonist of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire is {{a child who has}} recently moved to a small town called Littleroot Town. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to protect Professor Birch, the regional <b>Professor,</b> <b>from</b> an attacking wild Pokémon. After defending the Professor, the player is taken to his lab and receives the chosen Pokémon as his or her starter Pokémon. His or her friend, the protagonist's rival, is also a Pokémon Trainer and occasionally battles the player. The games' two main goals are defeating the eight Gym Leaders, proving oneself worthy of challenging the Elite Four and Champion to become the new Champion and completing the Pokédex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 202 Pokémon (It is possible to obtain all 386 Pokémon, but this requires trading with Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen).|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of the site was first {{brought to the attention}} of Professor Richard Daugherty in 1952 by a rancher named John McGregor. Excavations at the site were started by Daugherty and Roald Fryxell, a geologist, under the auspices of Washington State University (WSU)and the National Park Service in 1962, and continued until 1964. In 1965, Fryxell returned to the site along with Professor Carl Gustafson and students from WSU, and had Roland Marmes dig a trench in front of the rockshelter with his bulldozer, which turned up human and elk bones. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the human remains were about 10,000 years old. In 1968, Fryxell returned, this time with several WSU professors (including a visiting <b>professor</b> <b>from</b> Poland) and members of the United States Geological Survey, and found more human and animal remains, along with bone tools. April 29 of that year, Washington Senator Warren Magnuson made a public announcement of the finds.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Boden Professor of Sanskrit at the University of Oxford {{was established in}} 1832 with money bequeathed to the university by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Boden, a retired soldier {{in the service of}} the East India Company. He wished the university to establish a Sanskrit professorship to assist in the conversion of the people of British India to Christianity, and his bequest was also used to fund scholarships in Sanskrit at Oxford. The first two professors were elected by Oxford graduates, as the university's statutes provided: Horace Hayman Wilson won by a narrow majority in 1832, and the 1860 election was hotly contested, as the rivals each claimed to be best at fulfilling Boden's intentions and presented different views about the nature and purpose of Sanskrit scholarship. Reforms of Oxford implemented in 1882 removed all mention of Boden's original purpose from the statutes, removed the power to elect the <b>professor</b> <b>from</b> graduates, and gave the holder of the professorship a fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|The ANAK Society {{has donated}} {{a number of}} gifts to Georgia Tech. In 1921, the society donated a {{staircase}} connecting Tech Tower to the D. P. Savant Building. The staircase bears a plaque naming ANAK as the benefactor, one of very few conspicuous declarations of the society's existence on the Georgia Tech campus. On September 26, 1947, ANAK presented a life-size bronze bust of Georgia Tech football head coach William A. Alexander to the Georgia Tech Athletic Association to commemorate the society's 40th anniversary. The bust was sculpted by Julian H. Harris, a noted sculptor, architect, and Georgia Tech <b>professor</b> <b>from</b> 1936 to 1972. Along with the Class of 1924, ANAK gifted a portrait of William Henry Emerson, Georgia Tech's first dean, to Georgia Tech in 1924. The portrait was painted by noted Atlanta artist Kate Edwards. After being lost {{some time in the}} 1980s, the portrait was found and restored in the early 1990s. It has hung in the atrium of the Lyman Hall Building since October 15, 1992. Along with the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society, ANAK was involved in the dedication of the Paul G. Mayer Memorial Garden on May 30, 1987. The garden, located between the Georgia Tech Library and the William Vernon Skiles Classroom Building, features a plaque bearing the lidless eye symbol of the ANAK Society.|$|E
