40|$|Design of {{dewatering}} for an excavation into a gravity aquifer is discussed. The excavation for a {{pumping station}} was located 1, 500 {{feet from the}} ocean and was successfully dewatered using seven high capacity deep wells. Falling head permeability tests in boreholes were conducted followed by various <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> used to predict aquifer behavior. Aquifer parameters were inferred from borehole tests and were later compared with data from the <b>pump</b> <b>tests.</b> Permeability values using the Modified Theis Analysis were consistently higher than results using the Well Function. Borehole permeability values were consistently lower than <b>pump</b> <b>test</b> results and backfigured values. Drawdown and flow predictions are compared with results obtained during excavation. It is concluded that, while <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> are necessary for design of major excavations into gravity aquifers, the tests must include sufficient observation wells to detect local variations in behavior.

Khawbung village claims itself {{to be the first}} village in having public water connection through bamboo-pipe and steel pipe. The first public water connection through bamboo-pipe was used in 1962. When Pu Ch. Saprawnga, the then Chief Executive Member of the Mizo U.T. visited the village in 1972, the village people had a dramatic show about the need of steel pipes. Then, the CM had given them steel pipes for public water connection. The villagers by their own efforts constructed and got public water connection in 1972 from Maumit Tui which was 1.5 kilometres from the Public Water point. The water point was stationed at Zawlbuk the old site of Boys’ Dormitory from which the villagers used to draw water. In 1985 PHE undertaken pipe line for better water supply of the village was augmented for which the source of water was obtained from Samthang Zopui. Since the augmentation of water supply in 1985, public water points were given in different localities. In 2004, the second phase of augmentation was completed getting its source from Tan Tlang. However, due to the deforestation or shifting agriculture, the water resources have been decreased year by year. During dry season, water supply is not sufficient to meet the local needs. This may be also due to the increase in use of modern toilet and washing machines. Provisionally, the village has a separate PHE Sub-Division Officer. The Sub-Division Office was long time functioning at Champhai PHE Complex. Since 2012 S.Khawbung Water Supply Scheme for pumping R.Tuipui has been initiated and the first <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> was carried on 20 December 2013 but failed due to leakage at Sasaw Kawn. It was a great pleasure that the <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> was successful and the first water reached the main Reservoir at 11:45 a.m. on 21 December 2013. Then, S.Khawbung Water Supply Scheme has been successfully commissioned since January 2014. To undertake this project, Khawbung PHE Sub-Division Office was started functioning at Khawbung itself on 12th Sept 2012.|$|E
40|$|Regional {{ground water}} flow is most usually {{estimated}} using Darcy’s law, with hydraulic conductivities estimated from <b>pumping</b> <b>tests,</b> {{but can also}} be estimated using ground water residence times derived from radioactive tracers. The two methods agree reasonably well in relatively homogeneous aquifers {{but it is not}} clear which is likely to produce more reliable estimates of ground water flow rates in heterogeneous systems. The aim of this paper is to compare bias and uncertainty of tracer and hydraulic approaches to assess ground water flow in heterogeneous aquifers. Synthetic two-dimensional aquifers with different levels of heterogeneity (correlation lengths, variances) are used to simulate ground water flow, <b>pumping</b> <b>tests,</b> and transport of radioactive tracers. Results show that bias and uncertainty of flow rates increase with the variance of the hydraulic conductivity for both methods. The bias resulting from the nonlinearity of the concentration–time relationship can be reduced by choosing a tracer with a decay rate similar to the mean ground water residence time. The bias on flow rates estimated from <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> is reduced when performing long duration tests. The uncertainty on ground water flow is minimized when the sampling volume is large compared to the correlation length. For tracers, the uncertainty is related to the ratio of correlation length to the distance between sampling wells. For <b>pumping</b> <b>tests,</b> it is related to the ratio of correlation length to the <b>pumping</b> <b>test’s</b> radius of influence. In regional systems, it may be easier to minimize this ratio for tracers than for <b>pumping</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

5000|$|To {{meet the}} growing {{demands for a}} {{drinking}} water supply to Hastings, trial boreholes were sunk in 1892, initially close to Brede Bridge, but then further to the west {{on the south side}} of the river. A continuous <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> was conducted in 1896, and the boreholes were able to supply [...] per day for six months, and so parliamentary approval was obtained for the scheme. However, landowners demanded high prices for their land, and extraction royalties for the water. Church Farm was located on the north bank of the river, and when it was offered for sale, Hastings Council bought it, assuming that water would be available beneath it. Work commenced in 1899, to sink two wells on the farm, numbered 1 and 3, while well number 2 was to the south of the river, on land sold to them by Miss Brisco. The ground conditions were treacherous, but after 4 years, the two north bank wells had reached 275 ft while the south bank well had reached 200 ft. Some 2700 ft of headings and adits to connect the wells together were also constructed. Unexpectedly, the soft ground meant that the wells had to be lined with concrete blocks, and the work cost £38,412, against the original estimate of £14,630.|$|E
50|$|These {{are used}} when {{laboratory}} testing {{is not enough}} to determine the required properties of the ground. Laboratory samples are at times not considered to be representative and of insufficient quality, stress, pore pressure, and degree of saturation. Discontinuities in the ground can also warrant filed tests. Sample sizes depend on ground nature and test type. Boreholes are commonly used. The SPT is a simple and inexpensive test which can furnish a piling contractor with useful information. The van test is used to determine the shear strength of a soil - material with coarse silt or sand can mean unreliable results. Permeability is found by determining whether the relevant aquifer is confined on unconfined with cognizance of the normal fluctuations in the aquifer. Installation of the borehole itself may influence stresses. For a reliable test this should be followed by a <b>pumping</b> <b>test.</b> Packer tests are also used to measure the impermeability of grouted ground and permeability of dam foundations, strength and deformation data can also be taken. There are many types, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic, the latter being the most popular. A clean borehole with a properly seated packer is essential (cement mortar is sometime used). Geophysical logs from the boreholes used can be taken at the same time enhancing the value of the results. Pressuremeter tests are used to stress, stiffness and strength of the ground to be investigated. It can be used in most ground types. There are three main types - pre-bored, self bored and pushed in. Boring should do minimal damage to the ground as much as possible. an unload reload method of around three times is used to give an accurate value of stiffness. Probing from the surface is done using a steel rod. Mainly used at a preliminary stage, it is also useful to check surrounding ground but is unsuitable in soils with boulders and cobbles. Static probing is mostly conducted with the use of electric sensors. It is quick and cheap. Pumping allows the determination of groundwater conditions using pumping and observation wells. Data interpretation can be complicated and is classed in steady and non-steady states. Density testing is conducted using the average of three results to obtain a significant result. The use of the sand replacement and core cutter test are common and the use of water replacement, rubber balloon, and nuclear methods are also used.In-situ testing data is important to design of works. Stress measurement in rocks and soils can be determined. Bearing tests are used to determine the shear strength and deformation characteristics of a soil. In-situ shear testing is done using a system similar to the laboratory shear box test. Large scale testing should be assessed on a case by case basis. Slope failure or settlement of a structure after field tests have been conducted are examples of phenomena which may be considered as back analysis, this be conducted successfully when accompanied by a full investigation to determine the ground and ground water conditions. Geophysical surveying can be useful in site investigation for determining layers of rock other geological features, locating aquifers, mineral deposits, voids - natural or man-made and engineering properties of the ground. Electrical resistivity and seismic methods amongst others are used. This is a specialized field. The geophysical adviser should be involved at all stages. Experience has shown care should be taken when writing the specification for this type of work amongst other factors.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the groundwater resources and potentials of the Khanewal District of Pakistan, a geophysical method in combination with <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data were used. An analytical relationship between the aquifer parameters interpreted from surface geoelectrical method and <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> was established in order to estimate aquifer parameters from surface measurements where no pumping tests exist. For the said purpose, 48 geoelectric investigations were carried out using Schlumberger vertical electrical sounding (VES). Seven of the soundings were conducted where pumping tests had been carried out at borehole sites. The vertical electrical sounding stations were interpreted, and resistivities and thickness parameters were calculated. The values of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity were calculated using the Dar Zarrouk parameter. Transmissivity values obtained from <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data and the VES method range between 954 – 4263 m 2 /day and 200 – 5600 m 2 /day respectively. Hydraulic conductivity values determined from <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data and geoelectrical technique range between 15. 9 – 60. 9 m/day and 29. 76 - 72. 3 m/day respectively. The low values of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity indicate clay or shale while high values are due to the presence of sand or gravel.
