And that's what I feel like Tricky and Dream did with this record. They took that 'Jenny from the Block' side of me, which is still {{very much a part of}} who I am and will always be, and they <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> there on that track". According to Scott Shetler of PopCrush, [...] "Run the World" [...] contains an optimistic message and upbeat melody. Shetler particularly noted the lyric [...] "Our love could run the world" [...] as a good example of the optimism in the song.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} the family, except for Marge, {{watching}} a parody of the show Dinosaurs on television. The staff thought Dinosaurs was a knock-off of The Simpsons, so at one point Bart exclaims [...] "It's like they saw our lives and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> on screen," [...] and points at the television screen. Before she reveals to the Simpson family that Selma's new boyfriend is Bob, Patty says there is something [...] "disturbing" [...] about him, which results in Lisa imagining him as being The Elephant Man. As Bob remembers his time in prison, a scene with him picking up road side trash is seen, referencing the film Cool Hand Luke. The music in the scene is {{a reference to the}} soundtrack of the film as well. Bob also remembers winning a Daytime Emmy Award in the [...] "Best Supporting Performer in a Children's Program" [...] category. In Selma's letters to Sideshow Bob, she refers to him by his prison number, 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in the novel Les Misérables. The reunion between Krusty and Bob at the telethon is a reference to a surprise reunion between former comedy partners Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin on a 1970s telethon. The telethon logo features an Al Hirschfeld-style caricature of Krusty.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says". Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t back it up. You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He said what he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E

She {{wrote in}} her journal, [...] "Mr Ruskin {{was one of the}} most ridiculous figures I have seen. A very old hat, much necktie and aged coat buttoned up on his neck, humpbacked, not {{particularly}} clean looking. He had on high boots, and one of his trousers was tucked up on the top of one.

2500|$|U2 {{originally}} {{began the}} Innocence + Experience Tour {{with the intent}} to tour in two phases, one with material primarily taken from Songs of Innocence and one with material that would eventually be from its follow-up, Songs of Experience. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "By the time we finished the Innocence tour and came full circle to focus on the [...] album, it was clear we weren't {{going to be able to}} flip it really quickly into the Experience side of the material and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> back out on tour." [...] When asked about plans to continue the Innocence + Experience Tour after the Joshua Tree Tour 2017, the Edge said, [...] "We feel like that tour wasn't finished. So right now, we'd love to finish that tour. I would imagine it's gonna be with very similar production components... But we like that tour and that project wasn't completed. It is still alive in our minds creatively." [...] On 1 November 2017, the band officially announced the Experience + Innocence Tour as a sequel of the Innocence + Experience Tour, with concerts in North America during 2018 in support of Songs of Experience.|$|E
2500|$|Rawle {{explained}} that Silas has accepted {{he is to}} be in the secure psychiatric unit until he dies so he plans to manipulate the outside world from inside as a means of living out his murderous fantasies. Rawle revealed that Silas has a [...] "nagging feeling" [...] that he made a mistake in killing India and that he wishes he could <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> He said that his character meant to murder Texas so he now wants to kill her as she is the [...] "one that got away". Hendrickse-Spendlove also commented that Silas initially intended to kill Texas so she is [...] "the final piece of the puzzle for him, and then his 'work' will be complete". Silas tells Texas another murder will soon occur which is an opportunity to [...] "play games". He is [...] "delighted" [...] to have an audience during the visits and begins to [...] "make lots of threats". Rawle {{explained that}} Silas sees that Texas has India's ring which is [...] "symbolic" [...] for Silas as he had previously taken it as a trophy. Texas taunts Silas with the ring and agrees to exchange it for information on Lynsey's murder. Rawle explained that Silas tells Texas that Will Savage (James Atherton) is responsible for Lynsey's murder which is because [...] "Silas knows that Texas and Will are close, so he points the finger of suspicion his way". He said that Silas would [...] "put quite a few people in the frame" [...] for the murder. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that Texas is [...] "manipulated" [...] by Silas when he makes her believe Will is responsible for Lynsey's murder. Silas escapes from hospital and goes to visit Texas. Hendrickse-Spendlove explained that Texas [...] "opens her front door, sees Silas and thinks, 'This is it - my life is over', to see him standing there with no police restraint, knowing that he murdered her sister India, is absolutely petrifying". Silas tells Texas that he now intends to complete what he began. Hendrickse-Spendlove would not reveal whether Texas survives the ordeal but said that Texas is [...] "never going to be safe again" [...] regardless of the outcome. In August 2012, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap confirmed that there were no current plans for Silas to return, but the door had been left open for him. On 20 January 2016, Silas is set to return to visit Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison after he was framed by Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) for the murders and attempted murders at Dee Valley Hospital. Silas left again after he killed Lindsey.|$|E
