40|$|Within {{this article}} we present a <b>progress</b> <b>plan</b> and the {{motivation}} of the research steps involved within the proposed learning framework. In a technological century, we aim to create a guided learning technology. We aim to use machine learning to support young students to articulate concepts from examples, in particular form images. Therefore, we address here the learning of natural concepts and principles of working memories that can support the learning activities. We focus also on the learning within a visual environment. We analyse then the potential of machine learning techniques to guide the human learning from examples. For this purpose, we propose a framework based on using machine learning to reason from student classifications, which we call HMCD (Human Machine Concept Dance) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the author}} {{presents}} his personal experience on teaching robotics, {{and more specifically}} on teaching humanoid robotics, within the studies for the Computer Engineering degree in the Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería Informática of the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Spain. In the paper, first of all there is {{an introduction to the}} topic and how is the situation of robotics courses within computer engineering degrees in the more significant centres in Europe and Spain. Then, the paper progresses to explain how is the situation in Valencia, where there is a Robotics Course and a Robot Laboratory Project, explaining their main characteristics, contents and <b>progress</b> <b>plan.</b> The theoretical content for the unit on humanoid robotics is explained. The paper goes in details on the available equipment and the content of the laboratory sessions, the knowledge acquired by students and the exercises they have {{to do in order to}} pass this part of the course. Main issues covered on the Robot Laboratory Project are development of walking procedures for humanoid robots, the sensor control and the robot navigation in mazes. A student contest is organized so that the different student groups can show their abilities to program specific robot tasks, such as races and going up and down stairs and ramps. Last but not least, the paper will show the conclusions on this teaching experience on robot humanoids. Keywords- robotics; humanoid robots; teaching robotics; robotics in education I...|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to (1) identify the recommendations of Curriculum Management Audits conducted in Texas Public School systems, (2) determine the degree to which each of the recommendations had been implemented, and (3) determine the perceptions of stakeholders as to the factors instrumental in the real and potential impact of the audit. The researcher conducted interviews with superintendents and key central office administrators with a working knowledge of the audit report in each of the eleven Texas school districts studied. Respondents were asked to rate recommendations written for their districts using the following descriptors: Implemented, In <b>Progress,</b> <b>Plan</b> to Implement, Recommendation Modified, No Implementation. The ranking of recommendation implementation revealed that 85 % of the recommendations made in the 11 audit reports reviewed in this study had received action toward implementation to some degree. Respondents were also asked to cite factors which facilitated or impeded recommendation implementation. Significant factors facilitating the implementation of recommendations were reported to be time, organizational structure/personnel and planning. The analysis of the collective recommendations revealed that school board policies were not adequate to direct the design, delivery and monitoring of curriculum when measured against audit Standard One criteria. School districts in Texas rely on the Texas Association of School Boards' policy division for policies. Findings indicate that greater alignment between the Texas Association of School Boards' policies and Curriculum Management Audit criteria must be sought in order for school districts in Texas to meet this Standard. System-wide planning, curriculum documents, and program-driven budgeting processes were other areas requiring attention of the school districts in the study. Evidence of the extent of implementation of recommendations suggests that school districts valued the audit report with its recommendations. It can be generally concluded that the Curriculum Management Audit had a positive impact on the involved school districts...|$|E
40|$|An {{abstract}} {{can offer}} a valuable opportunity to inform a wide audience, to capture potential readers, and to expand your own interactive professional network. Whether others will pursue their reading may depend largely on their assessment of your abstract’’. (Wolcott, 1990 cited in Silverman, 2000; p. 223). Professional Development Teachers (PDTs) have a demanding role in their respective education systems and their role perception in general {{is not confined to}} only a practicing classroom teacher but more than that. This study seeks to explore as how PDTs, in a semi-private education system, came to work together to benefit their own system schools from their expertise and learning from the graduate programme at AKU-IED. The study looks into the processes, successes and challenges of a team effort or network structure of the PDTs in a semi-private education system. The significant purpose of this network is building capacity and facilitating the process of teaching and learning in the system schools. The study will delve into how this effort leads to school improvement and what were the facilitating factors and challenges of this teamwork structure. Literature from the perspective of network structure, professional development and school improvement provides a theoretical framework. The study aims to investigate and capture the reactions of the research participants in their natural setting. To conduct this study a semi-private education system was identified where the PDTs were found working together. Research data is collected by means of interviews, observations, shadowing (non-participatory observations) and document analysis. The result of the systematic data collection and analysis enabled the researcher to derive the themes, which describe the network process. The themes contributed to and link with some theory enabling conclusions to be drawn from the research. Finally the implications of the study are discussed together with recommendations and suggestions. Working together is a facilitative approach as well as a challenging task and {{there is a need to}} set some common vision that leads to some purposive structure formation. To realize the vision, identifying the potential group of people and designing a <b>progress</b> <b>plan</b> are important factors along with the basic requirements of resources, opportunities and rewards/incentives...|$|E
