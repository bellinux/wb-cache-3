It represents {{an issue that}} is very significant from the social point of view although not regulated as single problem by law. However the whole theme infiltrates to another specific fields: social insurance, assessment medicine, psychology, juristic section, medicinal issue, ethics, upbringing and special pedagogy in a broad meaning. Current Czech law regulation of theme concerning benefits for persons with long-term unfavorable health state is based on concept of full and <b>partial</b> <b>invalidity</b> pension as benefits within pension insurance scheme and pension increase for incapacity (helplessness). Generally full and <b>partial</b> <b>invalidity</b> pension benefits originate from reduction of gainful activity and reaching of relevant time period of pension insurance. According to a survey it is evident that number of awarded full and <b>partial</b> <b>invalidity</b> pensions has increased in Jihočeský" region. Respecting diagnostic flags structure the greatest occurrence of full invalidity pensions from youth has been recorded in group of intermediate cephalonia. Solving of social insurance of the elderly is planned under the pension reform at the present. The main goal of invalidity pension is permission to live {{as close as possible to}} normal state thus to face up to a handicap and to secure appropriate family, social and work life. In fine we could deduce that there should be confirmation of obligatory conversion of full invalidity pension to old-age pension when reaching retirement age within Czech pension reform. In my study I have focused on some factors decisive for occurrence of full or <b>partial</b> <b>invalidity.</b> It represents socially significant problems in broad range of relations that establish or could establish. Long-term loss or reduction of ability to work have negative impact not only on individuals but also affect social status of their families and thus negatively influence the whole society. Exclusion from work process traumatizes young people. Pension benefits provided to the disabled from youth are not deduced from tolled premiums. That is the reason I think this should be solved out of the pension insurance system as well as pension increase for incapacity (helplessness). Costs on these benefits would be compensated by state budget within pension insurance system in the near future with perspective of transmission of these benefits to other social scheme. In this connection it is necessary to emphasize that mankind should be made sure that there is basic perception and crucial aim of social welfare in focusing on level and quality of life of individuals and their families not affected by unfavorable social or economic influences as well as their health state and well-being that will not be compounded by diseases and injuries. This fact will substantially affect the strategy of modern social policy...|$|E
40|$|Central {{point of}} the thesis at hand is the effort to clarify legal {{consequences}} arising out of {{the conclusion of the}} usurious contract. Its primary aim is to determine whether the usurious contract is voidable or rather null and void and whether it is possible to uphold the usurious contract either by applying the concept of <b>partial</b> <b>invalidity</b> or by judicial balancing of the grossly disproportionate considerations arising out of the usurious contract. This thesis is structured into two parts. The first chapter of the first part briefly introduces paradigms of the rules related to the usury. The second chapter analyzes individual characteristics of the usury. In the third chapter author argues for the possibility to review the contracts (showing the disproportion of considerations, defects of the abused's will and the element of abuse, however, not fulfilling all the characteristics of the usurious contracts due to narrow definition of the usury) by the good-manners-test. Second part of this thesis is divided into three chapters. The first chapter analyzes consequences resulting from the violation of the usury prohibition and their impact on the usurer's and the abused's legal position. This chapter also deals with the difficulties in terms of interpretation of rules governing invalidity of legal [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{discipline}} on {{the partial}} avoidance {{of a contract}} has significantly evolved {{over the past few}} years in the European law. The traditional position has been that when the contract is only partly lawful, severance of the illegal promises is possible only if the preservation of the contract, once it is deprived of the illegal clause, does not alter the whole nature of the covenants (i. e the economic meaning of the contract). If not, the whole contract is void. However, this rule is clearly inadequate when the illegality of the contractual clauses arises from the need to ensure protection of one of the contracting parties. In this case it is always necessary that only the unfair terms are void (and so cut out) whereas the rest of the contract stays valid. In this context, both the law and the courts often limit the effects of the declaration of illegality by disposing a « statutory severance » of lawful and illegal terms. This solution, which is very common in the area of consumer contracts, ensures that the contract, without the unfair terms, keeps its effects. This paper aims to analyse the evolution of the treatment of <b>partial</b> <b>invalidity,</b> in the light of the rules regulating the consumer contracts in the European countries (especially after the Directive 93 / 13) as well as of the general rules on the partial avoidance recently provided by the Roumanian Civil Code (2011), the French Project of reform of the contract law (2014) and the Draft common frame of reference. This article also studies the connections between the partial avoidance and the ineffectivity of contract (or rule of « clause réputée non écrite ») as well as the effects of the declaration of partial avoidance, which often could trigger the redrafting of the contract by the judge...|$|E
40|$|Social {{security}} expenditure totalled ATS 745 {{billion in}} 1998, the 2. 8 percent growth of nominal expenditure being 0. 7 percent below nominal GDP growth. The social expenditure ratio, i. e., {{the share of}} social expenditure in GDP, stood at 28. 5 percent in 1998, thus continuing its downward trend for the fourth consecutive year. The trend is expected to remain unchanged in 1999, as the cyclical upswing results in employment growth and a reduction of unemployment. At the same time, the budget consolidation measures (austerity budgets) are reinforcing this development. Measured by its social expenditure ratio, Austria ranks seventh in Europe. The ratios are higher in the Nordic countries as well as France and Germany. With a social expenditure ratio of 28. 7 percent, Austria was 0. 5 percentage point below the EU average in 1997. However, the structure of social security spending in Austria differs greatly from the European average. Expenditure for old-age pensions and survivor benefits is 3. 3 percentage points above the EU average and family benefits exceed {{the average of the}} fifteen member states by 1. 9 percentage points. The way Austrian social security is financed also differs from the EU average: contributions by public and private employers are 1 percentage point below the average, while employee contributions to social security are 3. 6 percentage points above the EU average; the share of tax money flowing into social security exceeds the average by 1. 6 percentage points. Old-age benefits (38. 2 percent for old-age pensions and 10. 3 percent for survivor benefits) account for the largest share of social benefits, followed by health care expenditure (25. 8 percent) and family benefits (10. 2 percent). Invalidity benefits are the fourth largest expenditure item (8. 6 percent), while unemployment benefits account for no more than 5. 6 percent of all social benefit payments. The shares of old-age pensions and invalidity benefits increased between 1997 and 1998. Spending rose most strongly (+ 10. 8 percent) in the field of invalidity benefits (including early retirement for reasons of <b>partial</b> <b>invalidity)</b> as well as early retirement after long-term insurance coverage (+ 4. 9 percent) and unemployment benefits (+ 4. 1 percent). Changes in legislation resulted in a steep decline of spending for parental leave (– 21. 5 percent) and child-birth benefits (– 75. 4 percent), although family benefit expenditure as a whole increased by 1. 6 percent.

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis spread in 2008 {{through the world}} and reached Serbia, rendered the repayment of banking loans indexed in foreign currencies, mostly in CHF at the time, even more difficult. The growing number of non-performing loans inevitably led {{to an increase in}} number of the court proceedings in which the debtors made attempts to have the loan contracts declared null and void. In these proceedings, the courts needed to take a stand on some typical clauses in loan contracts and on some banking practices that the debtors considered to be contrary to the principle of good faith, which, before the crisis, was hardly ever given judicial epilogue. In the majority of cases, two types of clauses proved to be unlawful: a clause establishing a right of the bank to subsequently, i. e. after the formation of the contract, and unilaterally, i. e. without a specific consent of the debtor, change (regularly increase) the interest rate {{for the remainder of the}} credit period; and a clause establishing the right of the bank to apply different exchange rates, i. e. the buying rate to the disbursement of the loan, and the selling rate to the value of credit installments. These clauses certainly existed even before the crisis, but the difficulties in performing the loans caused by the crisis was the social propelling force that brought these cases within the sight of the judiciary. In this paper the author analyzes the reaction of courts, and subsequently that of the legislator, to the clause in loan contracts entitling the bank to unilaterally increase the variable interest rate after the formation of contract. The application of this clause was usually conditioned on significant changes in international financial markets or changes in the costs of the sources of financing, while in some cases the conditions of the application of the clause were simply changes in the business policy of the bank or the need to operate with profit. In any case, these are circumstances which the debtor could not influence. In most cases the bank could have influenced these circumstance or at least taken them into consideration at the time of the formation of contract. If not, they still fall within the bank's sphere of control or the bank bears the risk of their occurrence. The uniform approach of the courts, both in respect to credit contracts in which the debtor is a consumer, and contracts in which the debtor does not qualify as consumer, is that these clauses in loan contracts are null and void, since they are contrary to principles of good faith and equal value of reciprocal obligations, on the one hand, and make the object of the contract unascertainable, on the other. The courts, however, hardly ever declare the contract null and void in its entirety, but rather apply the rules on <b>partial</b> <b>invalidity.</b> Until the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Financial Services Consumers in 2011, the courts could render their decisions based only on the rules of general contract law pursuant to the Law on Obligations from 1978. The Law on the Protection of Financial Services Consumers explicitly forbids the modification of variable interest rate due to changes in the business policy or internal acts of the bank and prescribes that only officially published data or criteria may be used as variable elements of the interest rate. By this means, stipulating the right of the bank to subsequently, unilaterally and, in fact, freely increase the interest rate, a practice frequently applied in cases in which it was not economically justified, became statutorily forbidden...|$|E
