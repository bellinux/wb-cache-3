5|$|Considered by itself, Artemisium was a {{relatively}} insignificant battle. The Allies did not defeat the Persian navy, nor <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> advancing further {{along the coast of}} Greece. Conversely, neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet, nor irreparably weaken it. The battle was thus an indecisive one, which pleased neither side.|$|E

After a plea from fans to safeguard the stadium, an emergency council meeting was held and the stadium was purchased for £2 million. It is currently leased back to the football club.|$|E

In 1921, Japan declared the Amami rabbit a [...] "natural monument" [...] which <b>prevented</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> being hunted. Then in 1963, it was changed to a [...] "special natural monument" [...] which <b>prevented</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> being trapped as well.|$|R

They laid hay under the stern {{to serve as}} kindling, and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> falling back into British hands. The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, the North Korean {{government}} became more aggressive, and skirmishes between {{troops of the}} North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E

Seventeen years before the game, he developed the necessary technology to allow Laguna to entomb Adel. As a researcher of the Lunatic Pandora, he also helps to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> reaching Tears' Point and initiating a Lunar Cry.

5|$|Generally {{grown as}} a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, {{although}} it requires relatively low temperatures to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> flowering quickly. It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, {{as well as}} insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus. Although this trait {{can be a problem}} to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.|$|E
5|$|In 1562 the château came briefly {{into the}} {{possession}} of the Huguenots and {{was turned into a}} state prison by Henry IV of France. Cardinal Richelieu was given the castle to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> coming under the control of unfriendly forces, though he allowed it to fall into ruin. Château de Chinon was abandoned until 1793 when, during the Reign of Terror, the castle was temporarily occupied by royalist Vendeans. Soon after, the castle lapsed back into decay.|$|E

He moved to Paris with his family after the war, where his father Michel set up his own charcuterie, after not taking over the family business in Charolles. His father gambled away all of the family's money, and the shop was closed to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> going bankrupt. By the time Michel turned ten, his father had left the family and was not heard from again.|$|E
5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, {{it does not have}} dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{enters the}} space station via an airlock. She cannot re-establish {{communication}} with Kowalski and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the capsule away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> separating from the station. Stone performs a spacewalk in order to release the cables, succeeding just as the debris field completes its orbit and destroys the station. Stone aligns the Soyuz with Tiangong, but discovers that Soyuz's engine has no fuel.|$|E

5|$|The game's plot {{focuses on}} Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old {{photography}} student who discovers {{that she has}} the ability to rewind time at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the butterfly effect. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> destroying her town. The player's actions will adjust the narrative as it unfolds, and reshape it once allowed to travel back in time. Fetch quests and making environmental changes represent the forms of puzzle solving in addition to using branching choices for conversation.|$|E
5|$|When France {{surrendered}} on 22 June, {{two ships}} were in French Algeria, one was refitting in Toulon {{and the last}} ship was in England. During Operation Catapult in July, {{an attack on the}} Vichy Fleet intended to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> being turned over to the Germans, the British seized the ship in England, but failed to prevent the two in Mers-el-Kébir from escaping to Toulon when they attacked the port.|$|E
5|$|Although the RAF claimed six Italian {{aircraft}} {{destroyed and}} two probables, including Cullen's, on 20February, Italian sources reported only the Fiat G.50 of Tenente Alfredo Fusco of the 361a Squadriglia as shot down, killing the pilot, and the G.50 of Tenente Livio Bassi of 395a Squadriglia as damaged in combat and later destroyed by fire in an attempted forced landing at Berat. On 23February, Cullen attacked a CANT Z.506 three-engined floatplane {{as it was}} taking off at Preveza in Greece, at first simply attempting to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> getting airborne but then, when it refused to stop, destroying it on a second pass. The result did not add to his official score, however, as the Italian plane was not in full flight {{at the time of}} its destruction.|$|E

5|$|Around 23:00 on 15 August, {{elements}} of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered outposts {{set up by the}} invading Austro-Hungarian army on the slopes of Cer Mountain and fighting erupted. The Austro-Hungarian positions were lightly held, and their defenders were driven back away from the mountain. By midnight, fierce clashes between the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs were underway and chaos ensued in the darkness. By the morning of 16 August, the Serbians had seized the Divača Range and dislodged the Austro-Hungarians from their positions in the village of Borino Selo. The Austro-Hungarians, who had suffered heavy casualties during the fighting, retreated in some disorder. As the day progressed, the Serbs drove the 21st Infantry Division off the slopes of Cer to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> linking with the 2nd Army in Šabac.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Muslims divided their forces: {{the bulk}} of the army, under Abbas, {{remained}} at Kamacha to continue the siege, while the remainder (an obviously exaggerated force of 50,000 according to the Zuqnin chronicler) was sent to raid further into Byzantine territory and pillage. The siege continued through the autumn, and the Arabs, who customarily did not take along many provisions, began suffering from lack of supplies. To solve their supply problems, they established a market for merchants from Mesopotamia and elsewhere. In the end, with winter approaching, Abbas was forced to raise the siege and retreat south, burning the large market-place to <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> falling into Byzantine hands.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} 1998 {{annual meeting of}} the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, held in Utah, United States, rumors were {{circulating}} about a striking fossil of a primitive bird that was in private hands. This fossil was presented by an anonymous dealer at a gem show in Tucson, Arizona. The Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, purchased it in February 1999. The museum is run by Stephen A. Czerkas and his wife, Sylvia Czerkas. Mr. Czerkas does not hold a university degree, but he is a dinosaur enthusiast and artist. He arranged for patrons of his museum, including trustee Dale Slade, to provide $80,000 for the purchase of the fossil, in order to study it scientifically and <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> disappearing into an anonymous private collection.|$|E
