50|$|Hybrids {{are well}} known in flatfishes. The Pleuronectidae, of marine fishes, have {{the largest number of}} {{reported}} hybrids. Two of the most famous intergeneric hybrids are between the European <b>plaice</b> (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa)</b> and European flounder (Platichthys flesus) in the Baltic Sea, and between the English sole (Parophrys vetulus) and starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus) in Puget Sound.

40|$|Macoma baithica {{is one of}} {{the most}} common species in the Wadden Sea. In the summer the post-larvae migrate to the high tides. The life {{conditions}} on the high tides are more favourable than on the low tides for the post-larvae. The juveniles migrate in their first winter to the low tides. If they do not migrate they can be an easy prey for predators, such as birds and shrimps. Leaving the sediment can also be very dangerous for Macoma baithica. They can become an easy prey for different animals, such as crabs, shrimps and fishes. Lab experiments were done to investigate the predation risk of Macoma baithica when they leave the sediment in the present of fishes. Experiments were done in daylight and in the dark. Post-larvae and juvenile Macoma 's were used. Three different species of fishes were used. Pomatoschistus minutes and <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> were used as predators for the post-larvae Macoma 's and Dicentrarchus labrax was used as predator for the juveniles. No Macoma baithica was eaten during the experiments with Dicentrarchus labrax. There was no significant difference (P>O. 05) in the results where Pomatoschistus minutus was used as predator. A significant difference (P<O. 05) was found in the experiments using <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> as predator. Also a significant difference was found between the experiments done in daylight and in the dark. More Macoma baithica was eaten in the daylight than in the dark by <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa.</b> It was concluded that it is dangerous for Macoma baithica to migrate. In the presence of a visually hunting predator it is more favourable to migrate when it is dark. It was also confirm that the post-larvae produce a byssus thread and thus they have also an active migration. ...|$|R

5000|$|The European <b>plaice</b> (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa)</b> is a right-eyed {{flounder}} {{belonging to}} the Pleuronectidae family. They are a commercially important flatfish which lives on the sandy bottoms of the European shelf. They range geographically from the Barents Sea to the Mediterranean. European plaice are characterised by their smooth brown skin, with distinctive red spots and bony ridge behind the eyes. They feed on polychaetes, crustaceans and bivalves {{and can be found}} at depths up to 200 metres. At night they move into shallow waters to feed, and during the day they bury themselves in the sand. Their maximum recorded length is 100 cm (39.4 inches), and maximum reported age 50 years.|$|E
50|$|The European {{flounder}} leaves freshwater in {{the autumn}} and can often be caught in estuaries when the first frosts occur. Then the fish move into deeper water for the winter. In the spring it migrates to the spawning grounds, travelling at three to four miles (five to seven kilometres) per day and not eating en route. Spawning takes place between February and May being later in more northerly latitudes. The female liberates about a million eggs which are lighter than water. The male liberates sperm which also floats and both eggs and sperm rise to the surface. Here the eggs are fertilised and hatch after six to eleven days depending on the water temperature. The developing larvae are planktonic and drift towards the coast with juvenile flounders living in shallow waters and estuaries. Young flounders become mature when still small, the males when they measure 11.5 cm and the females when they measure 18 cm. The European flounder sometimes hybridises with European <b>plaice</b> (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa)</b> and, particularly in the western Baltic Sea, the hybrid is common.|$|E

The study site was an inshore fishing ground 6 km south of Plymouth Sound, UK Changes were tested using a data set of. stomach contents from Merlangius merlangus (L.), Microstomus kitt (W.), <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> (L.), Solea solea (L.), Zeus faber (L.) and Callionymus lyra (L.) from 1928 and 1929 and a matching set from 2004. Significant {{differences were found}} in the overall diet of Merlangius merlangus between the two sampling periods. Further significant differences were found within the diets of <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> and Callionymus lyra by examining within the prey categories of Polychaeta (increase), Upogebia (decrease) and Amphipoda (increase), Upogebia (decrease) and Porcellana (decrease). Stomach contents analysis found a slight increase in the proportion of scavenging species such as Ophiuroidea, Polychaeta and Amphipoda, and a decrease in the proportions of crustaceans such as Upogebia, Porcellana and Portunus in stomach contents. These changes are in in line with what would be expected in an area impacted by trawl gear from commercial fishing fleets, Data of prey groups was not of sufficient taxanomic resolution to examine the possible contribution of climate change to the distribution of prey species.

In transposition assays, we found that the Passport transposon system improved stable cellular transgenesis by 40 -fold, has an apparent preference for insertion into genes, and is subject to overproduction inhibition like other Tc 1 elements. Passport represents the first vertebrate Tc 1 element described as both natively intact and functionally active, and given its restricted phylogenetic distribution, may be contemporaneously active. The Passport transposon system thus complements the available genetic tools for the manipulation of vertebrate genomes, and may provide a unique system for studying the infiltration of vertebrate genomes by Tc 1 element...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Prior to 2001, the "other flatfish" species complex {{included}} Alaska <b>plaice</b> (<b>Pleuronectes</b> quadrituberculatus). Flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) {{were part}} of the other flatfish complex until they were removed in 1995, and in recent years Alaska plaice was the dominant species of the complex and comprised 87 % of both the 2000 catch and the estimated 2001 trawl survey biomass. Because more biological information exists for Alaska plaice than for the remaining species of other flatfish, an age-structured population model was used to assess this stock. In contrast, survey biomass estimates are the principal data source used to assess the remaining other flatfish. In 2002, Alaska plaice were and removed from the other species complex and managed separately. Given the differences in biological information, assessment techniques, and management, it is appropriate to separate the assessment of Alaska plaice from the remaining other flatfish.

To describe the lifetime movements ofplaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> L.) in the North Sea, we combined two state-of-the-art techni-ques: ﬁsh tagging with electronic data storage tags (DSTs) and otolith microchemistry. DSTdata allowed detailed reconstruction of the geographical movements of more than 160 free-swimming adult plaice and provided continuous records of ambient temperature for periodsof up to 18 months. By matching DST data with seasonal growth-ring composition in theotoliths of 40 of these ﬁsh, we attempted to establish the retrospective positioning of theseﬁsh in space and time throughout their adult lives. Otoliths obtained from juveniles sampledfrom the main nursery areas of the English Channel and North Sea where also analyzed fordifferences in trace element composition.

40|$|Fish {{authentication}} is a {{major concern}} not only for the prevention of commercial fraud, but also for the assessment of safety risks deriving from the undeclared introduction of potentially dangerous toxic or allergenic substances or environmentally damaging fish where endangered species are involved. Moreover, food authentication might affect the diet of certain groups of consumers, such as followers of religious practices. Considering the authentication of fish products {{is one of the key}} issues in food safety, quality and sustainability, the aim of this work was to investigate the prevalence of mislabelling in sole (Solea solea), <b>plaice</b> (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa),</b> Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and hake (Merluccius merluccius) fillets from markets and supermarkets located in Apulia (Southern Italy) using DNA barcoding. The results of the molecular investigations reveal that 42 / 98 (42. 8 %) fillet samples were not correctly labelled. In particular, 12 / 27 (44. 4 %) fillets of sole (Solea solea) were identified as belonging to Solea senegalensis.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} ecological {{characteristics of}} the western sand extraction area off the Belgian coast. A review of scientific research is given with special reference to a long term ecological monitoring programme. Relevant clauses concerning the exploration and exploitation of the Belgian continental shelf were elaborated in the law of 13 June 1969. In application to this law two Royal Decrees were published to regulate exploitation. The ecological monitoring programme investigated benthic communities and demersal fish population since 1977. Close {{attention was paid to}} the evolution of dominant species belonging to the epibenthic fauna e. g. the brittle stars (Ophiura texturata and Ophiura albida), the common starfish (Asterias rubens), the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) and the common swimming crab (Macropipus holsatus) in relation to sedimentological features. The southeastern part of this sand extraction area is a nursery ground for dab (Limanda limanda) and sole (Solea solea) mostly belonging to the pre-recruit 0 -age group. A small stock of adult dab with commercial size inhabited the area, although the area was dominated by Gadiformes (Merlangius merlangus, Trisopterus luscus, Limanda limanda and <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa).</b> A change in the distribution of these populations as a consequence of sand extraction was not obvious...|$|R
