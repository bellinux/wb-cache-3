40|$|Abstract—Occurrences of {{underground}} cable faults {{in the power}} {{transmission and distribution system}} is unavoidable due to several reasons. Long outage of power supply can cause the <b>power</b> <b>distributors</b> and retailers heavy loss of revenue and discomfort of the customers. Therefore, a quick detection and rectification of the faults is a major concern of the <b>power</b> <b>distributors</b> and retailers. This paper reviews a number of high voltage cable fault locating techniques that are currently in practice and a number of state-of-the-art techniques based on highly computational methods proposed by the research community. The paper also presents some guideline for the design process of a compact and lightweight high voltage fault locating machines that can make the fault locating task easier and faster...|$|R

50|$|Many {{areas in}} Mindanao suffer {{rotating}} 12-hour blackouts {{due to the}} island’s woefully inadequate power supply.

50|$|The National Power Corporation (Pambansang Korporasyon sa Elektrisidad, {{also known}} as Napocor, NPC or National Power), is a Philippine government-owned and {{controlled}} corporation that is mandated to conduct missionary electrification throughout the Philippine archipelago. Prior to the deregulation of the power industry in the early 2000s, NPC was a vertically integrated power utility engaged in the production, transmission and distribution of electric power and {{used to be the}} largest provider and generator of electricity in the Philippines. It was also the principal power provider for Manila Electric Company, the only <b>power</b> <b>distributor</b> in the Metro Manila area and its nearby provinces (including all towns or cities such as Santo Tomas, Batangas on some of their respective provinces that cover the Meralco franchise).Napocor used to be the country's largest corporation in terms of revenue. Profitability however is a main concern now because it is in the business of missionary electrification that provides electricity to far-flung, off-grid remote areas and islands at subsidized rates. As a government owned and controlled corporation, Napocor is subject to the scrutiny of the Commission on Audit (COA) and the Governance Commission for Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GCG). It also manages 17 large dams and 11 watersheds in the country and continues to oversee the privatization of the government's remaining undisposed power assets. As of December 2015, NPC has a total of 1,735 Megawatts of generating capacity, which includes 345 MW of small generators in small islands and off-grid locations and 1,390 MW in hydroelectric power plants and independent power producing plants in the main grids.|$|E

The catholic parish had been canonically erected on November 29, 1894, and the first priest was Joseph-Cléophas Saindon, beginning on October 2, 1896. The parish municipality had been officially created on April, 1st 1895 under the same name of the mission established five years before. On May 20, 1895 the municipal council unanimously adopted a motion stipulating that French was the only language used in debates and municipal affairs. The first aqueduct was built in 1903. The same year started the construction of the first stone church. The caisse populaire (credit union) had been established in 1907 by the priest Joseph-Cléophas Saindon. The phone had been installed before the electricity, when the first switchboard was commissioned in 1908. In 1910 Sayabec became the first village of the province of Quebec to adopt macadam roads, when it applied it on route de l'Église (Church Road). Between 1912 and 1917 the grand chemin Matapédia (Matapédia Big Road) also known as chemin Militaire (Military Road) had been macadamized. In 1911 Compagnie électrique d'Amqui (Amqui Electric Company) built an hydroelectric power plant downstream of Matapédia Lake in order to provide electricity to Amqui, Val-Brillant and Sayabec. This allowed the installation of street lightning in 1914. Compagnie électrique d'Amqui held the exclusivity on the electric network for a 25 years period in exchange of providing street lightning. In 1922 Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas-Saint-Laurent (Bas-Saint-Laurent Power Company) owned by Jules-André Brillant bought Compagnie électrique d'Amqui and became the only <b>power</b> <b>distributor</b> in the region until the nationalization of electricity in Quebec in 1963.|$|E
