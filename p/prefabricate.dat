40|$|Tissue {{microarray}} (TMA) is {{a powerful}} research tool and is applied in such diverse areas as tumor marker validation and laboratory quality control. Existing TMA construction techniques require an essential step of <b>prefabricating</b> recipient paraffin blocks on which holes are punched so that tissue cores can be inserted. This procedure has several disadvantages, such as accidental block breakage during hole punching and difficulty ensuring that the cores are flush with the block surface. We developed a novel TMA construction technique without <b>prefabricating</b> recipient blocks. We used double-sided adhesive tape attached to x-ray film as an adhesive platform on which the tissue cores were placed securely. The array of tissue cores then was embedded in an embedding mold.

5000|$|Born in Dundee on 25 March 1868, {{the son of}} a plasterer, Clarks {{family moved}} to London when he was still young. In 1913 Clark joined with Harry Fenn, a surveyor, {{founding}} a company at Loughborough Junction to specialise in ornamental fibrous plasterwork and Plaster of Paris work. The business was a rapid success with commissions from the new cinemas and major theatres who competed against each other through the splendour of their interior decoration. For designs, Clark & Fenn worked closely with G. Jackson & Sons, founded in 1780 with Robert Adam as a designer. The company soon moved to larger premises at Clapham Old Town where they were able to <b>prefabricate</b> much of their work off-site. This allowed them to take the mouldings ready-prepared for installation to a theatre or cinema, minimising the disruption to performances and rehearsals.|$|E
50|$|The Company {{was founded}} by Dick Dusseldorp in 1951 {{on behalf of the}} Dutch {{building}} companies Bredero's Bouwbedrijf of Utrecht and The Royal Dutch Harbour Company as an Australian-based building contractor. Its first contract was to supply and erect 200 prefabricated houses for the Snowy Mountains’ Authority which had been established by William Hudson, engineer of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Hudson's greatest obstacle in the completion of the scheme was the provision of labour and materials. Without a resolution to these two problems the realisation of the project was doubtful. But 31-year-old Dutch immigrant Dick Dusseldorp conceived a plan to <b>prefabricate</b> frames for worker housing in Finland, plumbing in England, ship materials via Cooma and recruit labour from the Netherlands to erect the homes. Dusseldorp established 'Civil and Civic' to take on and manage the multimillion-dollar contract.|$|E

50|$|Earlier Mohammed Yusuf Khatri and {{his family}} used to <b>prefabricate</b> {{different}} traditional dresses for the persons belonging to different castes living in tribal area of Bagh block of Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh. Because the people of different castes and families had different dresses like Maroo, Jat, Meghwal, Mahajan, Bhil, Bhilala society and they were identified with their dresses. After 1990 Mohammed Yusuf Khatri did new experiments on the clothes for urban market. He did block printing with hand and designed cultural clothing firstly.He also experimented incorporating modernity in the wooden blocks and colours {{in such a way}} that its fame and popularity could be established for a long time on the national and international level.He proved his imagination true by making craft on bamboo mat, leather, jute etc. besides cloth, Bagh Print was engraved with natural colours on bamboo chick. This was the first experiment of the world which was completed with colours on bamboo mat.It is notable that before or after popularity of Bagh print in the world, no example of such kind is recorded. Hence it is the first sample of such art in the world. It is truly a revolutionary invention in India.|$|E
50|$|In 1596, James Burbage {{acquired}} {{part of the}} old Blackfriars priory, where {{a company}} of child actors, The Children of the Chapel, was already established in another of the old buildings. As Burbage was commissioning alterations to his purchase, to add galleries and extra seating for his intended audience, Street acquired a house and waterfront woodyard near Bridewell, just over the River Fleet from Burbage's purchase and directly connected by a narrow bridge. (Details of the complicated leasing arrangements for Street's new property survive, as the head lessee died just after accepting a deposit for arranging the transaction and a court case was necessary to resolve the issue.) Although no documentary record specifying Street's involvement with the Blackfriars project has been found, it is assumed that he acquired the woodyard so that he could be close to the site of his new contract. A waterfront yard was necessary as Street stayed in Berkshire, near to where his timber was grown, to <b>prefabricate</b> the components for his timber-framed buildings in London, and then transported the pieces by barge down the Thames to where they were needed. Burbage discharged him before the friary project was completed, as influential local residents had petitioned to prevent the Burbages' plan.|$|E
5000|$|A steel {{treadway}} bridge needed floating pontoons. A saddles {{on top of}} the pontoon put {{the weight}} of the bridge on the pontoon. A 12-foot sections of treadway track was bolted to the saddles. The treadway sections were put together on the spot unloaded for many truck. The sections were taken out {{to the end of the}} bridge in construction. The sections were connected together with large steel pins. The 17th was experienced with treadway bridges, but this was the largest one. To cross the Rhine would need 80 or 90 sections to complete the bridge. Moving the sections then pounding in the large pins was hard work. These bridge could carry a heavy load including a 66,800 pound M4 tanks. The floating pontoon was an 18-ton pressurized rubber bag. The saddle was the metal and plywood frame was placed on the float and supported the treadway tracks. To <b>prefabricate</b> the bridge the pontoon had to be inflated; the saddles had to be assembled and lashed to the top of the pontoon. On 30 March 1945 Company [...] "C", constructed a treadway bridge across the canal near Alvert. On 5 April 1945, the 17th Engr. Bn. constructed a 384 treadway across the Weser at Ohr, Germany.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of PhilosophyConventional business procedures are increasingly being replaced by dynamic and revolutionized growth due to the integration of Information and Communication technologies to meet changing business requirements. For survival in this highly competitive field of construction, the adaptation of new technologies enhancement and its revolution is considered as an essential requirement. Emerging ICT developments and new construction techniques have generated much needed discussion about how these two streams are connected together. The concept of prefabrication has grown {{in recent years to}} change conventional construction processes and simultaneously Building Information Model (BIM) has emerged to brighten up traditionally ill functioned business communication flow. Building Information Modelling in the early stage of building construction development provides the vehicle to bring the construction industry into line with other technically driven fields, such as Automotive and Aerospace. However, in the past this has not given much consideration towards interaction between itself and the much improved construction industry prefabrication process. This research has reviewed the current state of BIM capability in the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) professions and establishes what is technologically possible. It also closely scrutinises one of the leading UK‟s cold rolled steel prefabricator‟s design and manufacturing process. The result of the findings leads the research to undertake in-depth benchmarking process to review and select an appropriate BIM application for live implementation. Upon selection, BIM application is customised to cater current and future design process of the above SME unit and implemented within a live construction project environment. Latest design process within SME unit along with BIM solution then evaluated against commercial criteria which determine the validity of incorporating construction industry <b>prefabricating</b> processes into current BIM applications iiand highlighted its overall benefits for the prefabricators and construction industry as a whole. Latter part of the research investigated the latest technological advancement available within BIM applications.
