40|$|Within {{academic}} circles, the “deficit” {{model of}} {{public understanding of}} science has been subject to increasing critical scrutiny by those who favor more constructivist approaches. These suggest that “the public” can articulate sophisticated ideas about the social and ethical implications of science regardless of their level of technical knowledge. The seminal studies following constructivist approaches have generally involved small-scale qualitative investigations, which have minimized the <b>pre-framing</b> of issues {{to a greater or}} lesser extent. This article describes the Gene Week Project, sponsored by the Wellcome Trust, which attempted to extend this work to a large-scale consultation on genetics and health through the medium of a local daily newspaper. Readers were invited to respond to a set of open-ended questions that accompanied stimulus material published each day for five consecutive weekdays. The articles were written with the intention of extending the limited range of discourses around genetics and biotechnology that are usually presented by the popular media (hope, fear, tragedy and bravery). Responses raised overarching issues about the place of emerging health technologies in society reminiscent of previous open-ended consultations in this field. The paper ends with a critical discussion about the potential of this method to contribute to the further development of open-ended public consultations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sets the}} scene for the symposium, by {{addressing}} a number of themes that will be addressed in the following presentations. It does so by drawing upon comparative UK/Spanish work on lay understanding of nuclear fusion. Levels of awareness and knowledge about fusion among the lay public are very low. In order to investigate how people make sense of fusion, and their views on fusion as a potential energy source, a hybrid social research/problem structuring/citizen engagement methodology has been adopted, allowing a range of lay respondents {{to participate in a}} sensitisation, learning and deliberative process. Importantly, the method has concentrated on the use of ordinary language, and the elicitation of patterns of demotic practical reasoning using multiple forms of knowledge, rather than <b>pre-framing</b> the issues exclusively in terms of technical categories. In this way, groups of citizens have engaged in discussion and deliberation about issues concerning fusion in quasi-naturalistic ways. The paper will present research findings to date concerning lay interrogation of knowledge about fusion; the relationship between levels of knowledge and modes of reasoning; {{and the ways in which}} the entwining of the social and material characters of the technology shapes the ways in which sense-making is practically accomplished...|$|E
40|$|This study {{develops}} an empirically and theoretically grounded {{explanation of}} conceptual designing. Conceptual designing is a concept-mediated planning {{activity that is}} typically collaborative and {{involves the use of}} semiotic resources such as talk, text, figures, pictures, visualisations, diagrams, sketching, and gesturing. Central to conceptual designing is the intent to articulate high-level simplifications, design concepts, which guide the strategic decision-making over a thing-to-be-designed and inform detailed designing. The original main contribution of the study is an explanation of conceptual designing in terms of project-specific learning. It is assumed that the changes in the ways a project team articulates, talks about, refers to, and makes changes to a thing-to-be-designed, are indicative of project-specific learning. A novel method for the investigation of project-specific learning is presented, namely Framing Analysis of Design Articulation (FADA), and a set of analytical concepts for the investigation and conduct of conceptual designing are introduced. With FADA it is possible to investigate designers’ construction of semiotic resources, which are necessary when designers create a framing strategy for their project. As the result of investigating two real projects the study sheds light on to the deep dilemmas inherent in conceptual designing as well as delivers concrete insights for its facilitation. The work is conducted as part of the practice-based tradition, and aspires to be associated to such works that have been able to make a doubly methodological contribution; to the methodology of studying design practice by introducing theoretical insights, methods, and analytical concepts; and to the approach that designers employ in conducting conceptual designing. The key benefit of the present work for designers is the uncovering {{of the importance of the}} preliminary activities of developing semiotic resources for the construction of the design concept, i. e. the value of priming, and the significance of preliminary structuring of attention and articulation through what will be called <b>pre-framing...</b>|$|E
3000|$|... (2) If {{the frame}} {{operator}} of a frame is bijective on L^p(R), then bijectivity will guarantee the <b>pre-frame</b> operator to be surjective. Therefore, bijectivity guarantees that each function f in L^p(R) has an expansion {{in terms of}} the wavelet.|$|R
30|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} by the following two facts. There exists a compactly supported, smooth Riesz wavelet basis such that the corresponding frame operator is bijective on L^ 2 (R), but not on L^p(R) for any specified 1 < p< 2 [1]. However, a frame operator is a composition of a <b>pre-frame</b> operator and the adjoint operator of the <b>pre-frame</b> operator. One therefore wonders whether the Riesz wavelet basis is complete in L^p(R), 1 < p< 2. The second one was found in [2], p. 130, 136, in which a Riesz wavelet basis with good behavior was found to maybe be not complete in L^p(R), 2 < p<∞. A more detailed understanding of such wavelets {{can be found in}} Remark  2.2.|$|R
30|$|This study {{confirms}} the bijectivity of the pre-wavelet (semi-orthogonal wavelet) frame operator on L^p(R), 1 < p<∞ (Theorem  3.4). Due to bijectivity {{of the frame}} operator, {{it is certain that}} the <b>pre-frame</b> operator of the wavelet basis is surjective on L^p(R), 1 < p<∞. The keys for proving Theorem  3.4 are that the dual wavelet basis of the pre-wavelet basis has been constructed, and it has the same decay as the basis. In contrast, the two Riesz wavelet bases discussed earlier had only put emphasis on the wavelet behavior, but they ignored the behavior of a dual basis. It may yield negative results in the completeness of the wavelet bases in Lebesgue spaces.|$|R
30|$|Recently, an {{algorithm}} named steerable filters {{is used in}} edge extraction [1, 4 – 6]. Its effect {{depends on}} {{the accuracy of the}} lane orientation. In [4] and [1], researchers analyzed the orientation of local features at each pixel and used this orientation as the direction. This approach is useful in most cases but results in poor performance when lane marking boundaries are not dominant under complex shadows. In [5], the detected angle of a lane in the <b>pre-frame</b> stage is chosen, but angle detection is characterized by errors when vehicles change lanes. For making the problem easier, Anvari [6] divided the image into several windows. In each window, a fixed direction was chosen for the steerable filter.|$|R
30|$|While {{all these}} studies are {{informative}} and relevant taken together, they still do not clarify what leadership types, behaviors, or practices might be required in interorganizational networks in which individuals participate {{of their own accord}} and without formal fiat or based on employment contracts. This implies providing rich context-sensitive descriptions of team and leadership phenomena in practice and moving beyond narrow theoretically (<b>pre-)framed</b> or prescriptive accounts (cf. Hannah et al. 2014; DeRue and Ashford 2010; Blom and Alvesson 2015). Similarly, Endres and Weibler (2017) showed that there is a significant need for research that does not start with ‘leadership’, or what is assumed to be leadership, but rather with interaction dynamics and practices as they occur in a specific setting.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This is {{the first}} of two surveys of the World Development Report series. Here we focus on the discursive {{strategies}} adopted by the Reports. We begin by setting the Reports within the wider milieu of development theory and practice. Behind the pragmatic, problem-solving image that the Reports aim to promote we identify a narrow and <b>pre-framed</b> position that eschews radical or alternative agendas. The Reports engage in numerous discursive ploys to undermine, ignore or manipulate other positions and establish the Reports (and, by extension, the World Bank) as the repository of development ‘common sense’. While the Reports are impressive syn-thesizing documents, they have lost their ability to play a truly leading role in thinking about development because of their failure to debate alternative positions or fully acknowledge the mistakes of the past...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} the {{experiences}} of two researchers and discusses how they conducted a secondary data analysis using classic grounded theory. The aim of the primary {{study was to explore}} first-time parents’ postnatal educational needs. A subset of the data from the primary study (eight transcripts from interviews with fathers) was used for the secondary data analysis. The objectives of the secondary data analysis were to identify the challenges of using classic grounded theory with secondary data and to explore whether the re-analysis of primary data using a different methodology would yield a different outcome. Through the process of re-analysis a tentative theory emerged on ‘developing competency as a father’. Challenges encountered during this re-analysis included the small dataset, the <b>pre-framed</b> data, and limited ability for theoretical sampling. This re-analysis proved to be a very useful learning tool for author 1 (LA), who was a novice with classic grounded theory...|$|R

The 12" [...] 180gm vinyl LP comprises a recording of Throbbing Gristle's live performance at La Villette in Paris on 6 June 2008, which was a reinterpretation of their original album, and is limited to 777 copies. This album is <b>pre-framed</b> in bespoke, high-quality white gloss acrylic with an easy access clear window for removal of the record/sleeve so that the buyer can play the album and then reseal it in the frame. Accompanying the packaged vinyl is a special [...] "black" [...] extended CD version, which includes extra tracks that would not fit on the LP format. There is a version of the recording available for download, but the track lengths are different from the vinyl edition.|$|R
40|$|The cost {{of housing}} in the U. S. {{continues}} to rise faster than household income. Innovative building materials and construction technologies {{have the potential to}} reduce housing construction costs. One strategy to do this is componentization. There is a longstanding trend towards the increased use of components in U. S. residential construction. One such type of component is the composite building panel, used for walls, roofs and floors. Presently the types of composite panels used in residential construction include <b>pre-framed</b> walls of standard construction and, more innovatively, structural foam core panels with wood or wood composite faces. This thesis focuses on the design of a panelized roofing system for residential construction. The roof was chosen for various reasons. It includes some of the most complicated geometrical and structural challenges. It is often the most difficult area of the house to frame conventionally. Its construction is a crucial step in getting the house weather tight. For these reasons and others builders have identified it as a prime target for innovation. The design of the panelized roof system is illustrated as a tree of decisions. The path traveled down this tree led to a ribbed panel spanning from eave to ridge. A design selection method developed by Stuart Pugh was used to design the connection details of the system. The interdisciplinary design process used to design the roof system is examined and evaluated in light of the results it yielded. Mock-ups, models and a full scale proof-of-concept structure were built. These constructions were used as learning tools during design and to demonstrate and evaluate the performance of the roof system design. by Jordan Lewis Dentz. Thesis (M. S.)
