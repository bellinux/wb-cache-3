60|$|Brooks {{sat at his}} desk, {{frowning}} slightly, and {{tapping the}} blotting-paper with a <b>pen-holder.</b>|$|E
60|$|But {{no sooner}} {{were the words}} out of the boy's mouth than the <b>pen-holder</b> snapped in two. Luard looked at Philip with dismay.|$|E

50|$|Zhombe Store, near Zhombe Bridge (Old Somalala-Zhombe Mission dust road) was {{the best}} shop in the area. You could find almost {{anything}} there. Fountain Pens, Nibs, <b>Pen-holders</b> and ink were always available at Zhombe Store. In the sixties schools did not use today's pens but Fountain pens or <b>pen-holders</b> fitted with a nib for dipping in ink for writing. Buses and delivery vans past right {{at the front of}} Zhombe Store, so supplies were never short at this store. United Bus Service (now ZUPCO) and Kambasha Bus Service were the only buses that serviced the Que-Que (Kwekwe)-Gokwe road.|$|R
50|$|James Perry, still a {{schoolmaster}} {{and being}} {{dissatisfied with the}} quality of existing pens, began making steel pens by hand. The firm was founded in Manchester as James Perry and Co. in 1824, but later moved to London, where they made and sold pens and <b>pen-holders,</b> pencils, elastic bands and ink, and dealt in stationers' supplies. From 1829 all of Perry's pens were made by Josiah Mason, which was considerered by the time as the finest pens manufacturer. The excellence of their products swiftly raised them to the forefront of the new industry, exporting pens all over the world. By 1876 when the firm became a Limited Company, they equalled Esterbrook as being the largest manufacturers of pen nibs in the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{not about}} the <b>pen-holder</b> I care," [...] said Philip, in a {{trembling}} voice, [...] "only it was given me by my mater, just before she died." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had just}} {{finished}} the preliminary stages of the morning's work, which consisted mostly of washing his hands, changing his coat, and eating a section of a <b>pen-holder,</b> when William, the messenger, approached.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a boy}} called Luard between whom and Philip a {{friendship}} had arisen, and one day, when they were playing together in the school-room, Luard began to perform some trick with an ebony <b>pen-holder</b> of Philip's.|$|E
60|$|The quill nibs {{they sell}} {{to fit into}} {{ordinary}} <b>pen-holders</b> are no true quills at all, lacking dignity, and may even lead you into the New Humour if you trust overmuch to their use. After a proper quill commend me to a stumpy BB pencil; you get less polish and broader effects, but you are still doing good literature. Sometimes the work is close--Mr. George Meredith, for instance, is suspected of a soft pencil--and always it is blunter than quill work and more terse. With a hard pencil no man can write anything but a graceless style--a kind of east wind air it gives--and smile you cannot. So that it is often used for serious articles in the half-crown reviews.|$|R
6000|$|And Herbert Bowater {{showed that}} decidedly uncomplimentary penwiper, where the ass's head {{declares}} [...] "There {{are two of}} us;" [...] while every child had some absurdity to show; and Miss Moy's shrieks of delight were already audible at a tortoise-shell <b>pen-holder</b> disguised as a hunting-whip.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} withdrew and the Cabinet Minister {{made his way}} to his study. A little of the elasticity, however, had gone from his {{footsteps}} and he seated himself before his desk with the air of a man who faces a disagreeable quarter of an hour. He played for a moment with a <b>pen-holder.</b>|$|E
60|$|Philip {{took the}} two pieces of the <b>pen-holder</b> and looked at them. He tried to {{restrain}} his sobs. He felt utterly miserable. And yet he could not tell why, for he knew quite well that he had bought the <b>pen-holder</b> during his last holidays at Blackstable for one and twopence. He did not know in the least what had made him invent that pathetic story, but he was quite as unhappy {{as though it had}} been true. The pious atmosphere of the vicarage and the religious tone of the school had made Philip's conscience very sensitive; he absorbed insensibly the feeling about him that the Tempter was ever on the watch to gain his immortal soul; and though he was not more truthful than most boys he never told a lie without suffering from remorse. When he thought over this incident he was very much distressed, and made up his mind that he must go to Luard and tell him that the story was an invention. Though he dreaded humiliation more than anything in the world, he hugged himself for two or three days at the thought of the agonising joy of humiliating himself to the Glory of God. But he never got any further. He satisfied his conscience by the more comfortable method of expressing his repentance only to the Almighty. But he could not understand why he should have been so genuinely affected by the story he was making up. The tears that flowed down his grubby cheeks were real tears. Then by some accident of association there occurred to him that scene when Emma had told him of his mother's death, and, though he could not speak for crying, he had insisted on going in to say good-bye to the Misses Watkin so that they might see his grief and pity him.|$|E
6000|$|JOHN BUILDER {{is sitting}} in his after-breakfast chair before the fire [...] with The Times in his hands. He has breakfasted well, and is in [...] that {{condition}} of first-pipe serenity in which {{the affairs of the}} [...] nation seem almost bearable. He is a tallish, square, personable [...] man of forty-seven, with a well-coloured, jowly, fullish face, [...] marked under the eyes, which have very small pupils and a good deal [...] of light in them. His bearing has force and importance, as of a man [...] accustomed to rising and ownerships, sure in his opinions, and not [...] lacking in geniality when things go his way.

60|$|Philip {{filled her}} glass, hoping that {{champagne}} {{would make her}} more affable; he was anxious that his little jaunt should be a success. He noticed that she held her knife {{as though it were}} a <b>pen-holder,</b> and when she drank protruded her little finger. He started several topics of conversation, but he could get little out of her, and he remembered with irritation that he had seen her talking nineteen to the dozen and laughing with the German. They finished dinner and went to the play. Philip was a very cultured young man, and he looked upon musical comedy with scorn. He thought the jokes vulgar and the melodies obvious; it seemed to him that they did these things much better in France; but Mildred enjoyed herself thoroughly; she laughed till her sides ached, looking at Philip now and then when something tickled her to exchange a glance of pleasure; and she applauded rapturously.|$|E
6000|$|Then I had {{to provide}} myself with certain {{necessaries}} for the way. These were not numerous. The silver-mounted dressing-bag is here supplied by a rag containing a Miswak[FN#11] or tooth-stick, {{a bit of}} soap and a comb, wooden, for bone and tortoiseshell are not, religiously speaking, correct. Equally simple was my wardrobe; [p.24]a change or two of clothing. It is a great mistake to carry too few clothes, and those who travel as Orientals should always {{have at least one}} very grand suit for use on critical occasions. Throughout the East a badly dressed man is a pauper, and, as in England, a pauper-unless he belongs to an order having a right to be poor-is a scoundrel. The only article of canteen description was a Zemzemiyah, a goat-skin water-bag, which, especially when new, communicates to its contents a ferruginous aspect and a wholesome, though hardly an attractive, flavour of tanno-gelatine. This was a necessary; to drink out of a tumbler, possibly fresh from pig-eating lips, would have entailed a certain loss of reputation. For bedding and furniture I had a coarse Persian rug-which, besides being couch, acted as chair, table, and oratory-a cotton-stuffed chintz-covered pillow, a blanket in case of cold, and a sheet, which did duty for tent and mosquito curtains in nights of heat.[FN#12] As shade is a convenience not always procurable, another necessary was a huge cotton umbrella of Eastern make, brightly yellow, suggesting the idea of an overgrown marigold. I had also a substantial housewife, the gift of a kind relative, Miss Elizabeth Stisted; it was a roll of canvas, carefully soiled, and garnished with needles and thread, cobblers' wax, buttons, and other such articles. These things were most useful in lands where tailors abound not; besides which, the sight of a man darning his coat or patching his slippers teems with pleasing ideas of humility. A dagger,[FN#13] a brass inkstand and <b>pen-holder</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{sounds very}} well," [...] said Baxter, [...] "but {{in all those}} {{southern}} countries you must be prepared in winter for {{the rigors of the}} climate. The sun is pretty warm sometimes at this season, but {{as soon as you get}} out of it you will freeze to death if you are not careful. The only way to keep warm is to be in the sun, out of the wind, and that won't work on rainy days, and winter is the rainy season, you know. In the houses it is as cold as ice, and the fires don't amount to anything. You might as well light a bundle of wooden tooth-picks and put it in the fire-place. If you could sleep all the time you might be comfortable, for they give you a feather-bed to cover yourself with. Outside you may do well enough if you keep up a steady walking, but indoors you will have hard work to keep warm. You must wear chest-protectors. They sell them down there--great big ones, made of rabbit-skins; and a nice thing for a man to have to wear in the house is a pair of cloth bags lined with fur. They would keep his feet and legs warm when he isn't walking. It is well, too, to have a pair of smaller fur bags for your hands when you are in the house. You can have a little hole in the end of one of them through which you can stick a <b>pen-holder,</b> and then you can write letters. An india-rubber bag, filled with hot water, to lower down your back, is a great comfort. You haven't any idea how cold your spine gets in those warm countries. And, if I were you, I'd avoid a place where you see them carting coal stoves around. Those are the worst spots. And you need not expect to get one of the stoves, not while they can sell you wood at two sticks for a franc. You had better go to some place where they are not accustomed to having tourists. In the regular resorts they are afraid to make any show of keeping warm, for fear people will think they are in the habit of having cold weather. And in Italy you've got to be precious careful, or you'll be taken sick. And another thing. I suppose you brought a great deal of baggage with you. You, for instance," [...] said our friend, turning to me, [...] "packed up, I suppose, a heavy overcoat for cold weather, and a lighter one, and a good winter suit, and a good summer one, besides another for spring and fall, and an old suit to lie about in in the orange groves, and a dress suit, besides such convenient articles as old boots for tramping in, pocket-lanterns, and so forth." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{see them}} in any case as old-world images, figures of an antique stamp; products, mustn't they have been, of an order in which some social {{relativity}} or matter-of-course adjustment, some transmitted form and pressure, were still at work? Mr. Dolmidge, inordinately lean, clean-shaved, as was comparatively uncommon then, and in a swallow-tailed coat and I think a black satin stock, was surely perfect in his absolutely functional way, a pure <b>pen-holder</b> of a man, melancholy and mild, who taught the most complicated flourishes--great scrolls of them met our view {{in the form of}} surging seas and beaked and beady-eyed eagles, the eagle being so calligraphic a bird--while he might just have taught resignation. He was not at all funny--no one out of our immediate family circle, in fact almost no one but W. J. himself, who flowered in every waste, seems to have struck me as funny in those years; but he was to remain with me a picture of somebody in Dickens, one of the Phiz if not the Cruikshank pictures. Mr. Coe was another affair, bristling with the question of the [...] "hard," [...] but somehow too with the revelation of the soft, the deeply attaching; a worthy of immense stature and presence, crowned as with the thick white hair of genius, wearing a great gathered or puckered cloak, with a vast velvet collar, and resembling, as he comes back to me, the General Winfield Scott who lived so much in our eyes then. The oddity may well even at that hour have been present to me of its taking so towering a person to produce such small [...] "drawing-cards"; it was as if some mighty bird had laid diminutive eggs. Mr. Coe, of a truth, laid his all over the place, and though they were not of more than handy size--very small boys could set them up in state on very small desks--they had doubtless a great range of number and effect. They were scattered far abroad and I surmise celebrated; they represented crooked cottages, feathery trees, browsing and bristling beasts and other rural objects; all rendered, as I recall them, in little detached dashes that were like stories told in words of one syllable, or even more perhaps in short gasps of delight. It must have been a stammering art, but I admired its fluency, which swims for me moreover in richer though slightly vague associations. Mr. Coe practised on a larger scale, in colour, in oils, producing wondrous neat little boards that make me to this day think of them and more particularly smell them, when I hear of a [...] "panel" [...] picture: a glamour of greatness attends them as brought home by W. J. from the master's own place of instruction in that old University building which partly formed the east side of Washington Square and figures to memory, or to fond imagination, as throbbing with more offices and functions, a denser chiaroscuro, than any reared hugeness of to-day, where character is so lost in quantity. Is there any present structure that plays such a part in proportion to its size?--though even as I ask the question I feel how nothing on earth is proportioned to present sizes. These alone are proportioned--and to mere sky-space and mere amount, amount of steel and stone; which is comparatively uninteresting. Perhaps our needs and our elements were then absurdly, were then provincially few, and that the patches of character in that small grey granite compendium were all we had in general to exhibit. Let me add at any rate that some of them were exhibitional--even to my tender years, I mean; since I respond even yet to my privilege of presence at some Commencement or Commemoration, such as might be natural, doubtless, to any [...] "university," [...] where, as under a high rich roof, before a Chancellor in a gown and amid serried admirers and impressive applause, there was [...] "speaking," [...] of the finest sort, and where above all I gathered in as a dazzling example the rare assurance of young Winthrop Somebody or Somebody Winthrop, who, though still in jackets, held us spellbound by his rendering of Serjeant Buzfuz's exposure of Mr. Pickwick. Long was I to marvel at the high sufficiency of young Winthrop Somebody or Somebody Winthrop--in which romantic impression it is perhaps after all (though with the consecration of {{one or two of the}} novels of the once-admired Theodore of that name, which so remarkably insists, thrown in) the sense of the place is embalmed.|$|E

5000|$|The PA-3 pen plotter runs at {{one inch}} per second with 200 {{increments}} per inch {{on a paper}} roll one foot wide by 100 feet long. The optional retractable <b>pen-holder</b> eliminates [...] "retrace lines".|$|E
50|$|A dip pen has a steel nib (the pen proper) and a <b>pen-holder.</b> Dip pens {{are very}} versatile, as the <b>pen-holder</b> can {{accommodate}} {{a wide variety}} of nibs that are specialized for different purposes: copperplate writing, mapping pens, and five-pointed nibs for drawing music staves. They can be used with most types of ink, some of which are incompatible with other types of pen. Automatic pens are a category of dip pen, in which the nib is in two parts and can hold a larger quantity of ink. However, like all of its precursors, the steel-nibbed dip pens had a limited ink reservoir and a tendency to drip inkblots on the page.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{the novel}} was {{released}} under the title, Obsequies at Oxford. Crispin's University acquaintance Philip Larkin described how Bruce Montgomery (Crispin's real name) wrote it {{during his last}} year as an Oxford undergraduate: [...] "During the vacation that Easter 1943 he had spent ten days writing, with his J nib and silver <b>pen-holder,</b> a detective story".|$|E
50|$|The {{crowd had}} started {{gathering}} outside the Café Potard, {{site of the}} control, from 6am. The leading group {{had been reduced to}} nine: Acouturier, Samson, Lepoutre, Chapperon, Wattelier, Pagie and Pothier. The nine riders came into town and the moment they saw the Café Potard, a sprint broke out. Machines were thrown to the ground. Everyone rushed to be first to sign the register and to get away quickly. Tussles broke out over the <b>pen-holder</b> which sometimes disappeared, more or less intentionally, during the torment.|$|E
50|$|These {{telephones}} {{are able}} to operate on both loop-disconnect (pulse) and MF4 (tone) and a switch {{on the base of}} the telephone chooses the method. The volume of the ringer could also be changed to High, Low or Off ('off' did not actually disconnect the bell but merely locked the clapper in position so that it could not strike the bells). The Relate is shown on the left, the React has a squarer styling, without the <b>pen-holder</b> tray. Note also that {{on the underside of the}} Relate there is a mount that can be fitted in two positions. One makes it a desk telephone and mounting it the other way round turns it into a wall telephone - very ingenious. On the React, the only modification required, for wall mounting, is the reversal of a tiny tab, in the receiver recess. This prevents the handset falling on the floor. A similar tab is molded onto the top of the case, to provide an 'Off Hook' parking position.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} some new test functions {{to assess the}} performance of global optimization methods. These functions have been selected partly because several of them are aesthetically appealing and partly because {{a few of them}} are really difficult to optimize, while all the functions are multi-modal. Each function has been graphically presented to appreciate its geometrical appearance. To optimize these functions we have used the Repulsive Particle Swarm (RPS) method. We have also appended a computer program of the RPS method. Except two functions, namely the 'crowned cross' and the 'cross-legged table' functions all other new test functions are optimized by the RPS program. The program has also been tested with success on a number of well-established benchmark functions. However, the program fails miserably in optimizing the Bukin {{and a couple of other}} functions.
