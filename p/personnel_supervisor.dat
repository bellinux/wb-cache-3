Secondary analysis of (1) focus group and (2) interview data. Setting. U. S. military. Subjects. Total participants (n = 241) : Enlisted <b>personnel,</b> <b>supervisors</b> (n = 189 individuals participating in 23 focus groups), tobacco control managers, and policy leaders (n = 52 interview participants). Intervention. Not applicable. Measures. Not applicable. Analysis. Inductive, iterative coding for salient themes using an interpretive approach. Application {{of the concept of}} mediatory myths, used by institutions to cover over internal contradictions. Results. All types of participants endorsed the idea that tobacco was needed in the military for stress relief. Types of stress identified included fitting in, (relationships with coworkers and superiors) and control of workflow (taking breaks). Participants also discussed beliefs about the impact of tobacco on the military mission, and institutional sanction of tobacco use. Conclusion. Despite tobacco's well-documented negative effects on fitness, the myth that tobacco relieves stress serves several institutional functions in the military. It serves to minimize {{perceptions of}} stress on the fitness of personnel, suggests that stress can be managed solely by individuals, and institutionalizes tobacco use. Growing recognition among military leadership that countering stress is essential to fitness offers an opportunity to challenge this myth. (Am J Health Promot 2014; 29 [2]: 115 - 122.) ...|$|R

50|$|Clandestine human {{intelligence}} is intelligence collected from human sources using clandestine espionage methods. These sources consist {{of people working}} {{in a variety of}} roles within the intelligence community. Examples include the quintessential spy (known by professionals as an asset or agent), who collects intelligence, couriers and related personnel, who handle an intelligence organization's (ideally) secure communications, and support personnel, such as access agents, who may arrange the contact between the potential spy and the case officer who recruits them. The recruiter and supervising agent may not necessarily be the same individual. Large espionage networks may be composed of multiple levels of spies, support <b>personnel,</b> and <b>supervisors.</b> Espionage networks are typically organized as a cell system, in which each clandestine operator knows only the people in his own cell, perhaps the external case officer, and an emergency method (which may not necessarily involve another person) to contact higher levels if the case officer or cell leader is captured, but has no knowledge of people in other cells. This cellular organization is a form of compartmentalisation, which is an important tactic for controlling access to information, used in order to diminish the risk of discovery of the network or the release of sensitive information.|$|R

40|$|The Institute of Medicine {{recently}} {{called for}} a tobacco-free military, citing evidence that high rates of tobacco use harm readiness and create enormous costs for the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration. The pro-tobacco activities {{of the tobacco industry}} and others, sometimes supported by military authorities even when prohibited by policy, have created a culture highly hospitable to smoking. Through qualitative secondary analysis of data from interviews and focus groups, this article explores the reasons enlisted <b>personnel</b> and their <b>supervisors,</b> installation tobacco control managers, and service policy leaders give for why tobacco control policy change "cannot" effectively be achieved. Three primary reasons were given: Policies would impinge on the "right to smoke," policies would be unenforceable and lead to disciplinary breakdown, and the rights of civilian workers on military installations precluded policy enforcement. Yet evidence suggests that these reasons are not only invalid, but inconsistent with military policies addressing other threats to the health of personnel. This pervasive tobacco "exceptionalism" is a significant barrier to achieving a tobacco-free military. The military, Congress, and the President should re-evaluate the "can'ts" that have prevented effective action, and act to regulate and eventually abolish tobacco use in the armed forces...|$|R

40|$|As a {{commercial}} entertainment sector, {{the film industry}} in Australia presents an economically viable commodity, with AU$ 1087. 5 million worth of box office revenue being made in 2009 (Screen Australia, [URL] 2010). With such a significant audience to entertain, it is unsurprising that film provides an ideal avenue for the communication of music. Music is {{an important element in}} the feature film, being used to set a scene, emphasize a plot development or incite a given emotion from the viewer. Feature film music ranges from specifically composed score to pre-recorded popular music licensed into the film. Increasingly, the latter is being used in feature films – impacting on the budgets, marketing and sound personnel of a film in a myriad of ways (see Smith, The Sounds of Commerce, New York: Columbia University Press, 1998). Of these sound <b>personnel,</b> the music <b>supervisor</b> is arguably impacted upon the most, and this {{can be attributed to the}} music supervisor's role to ensure all music within the film soundtrack is cleared and used in accordance within the legal rights of the licensor. However, the music supervisor in the Australian film context extends far beyond such clearances, with such personnel deciding which tracks are selected for the film and even suggesting certain pieces to the director – thus playing a creative collaborative role in the production. This area of communication in the Australian feature film industry is largely overlooked or marginalized in academic research (see Coyle, Reel Tracks, Eastleigh: John Libbey, 2005, for some tentative research). This interdisciplinary paper contributes findings from interviews conducted by the author with Australian music supervisors throughout the period 2007 – 2009.

40|$|Introduction: Occupational {{injuries}} are a relevant research and practical issue. However, intervention studies evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} workplace injury prevention programs are seldom performed. Method: The effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention aimed at reducing occupational injury rates (incidence/employment-based = IR, frequency/hours-based = FR, severity = SR) was evaluated between 2008 and 2013 in 29 Italian foundries (22 ferrous; 7 non-ferrous; 3, 460 male blue collar workers/year) of varying sizes. Each foundry established an internal multidisciplinary prevention team for risk assessment, monitoring and prevention of occupational injuries, involving employers, occupational physicians, safety <b>personnel,</b> workers' representatives, <b>supervisors.</b> Targets Of intervention were workers, equipment, organization, workplace, job tasks. An interrupted time series (ITS) design was applied. Results: 4, 604 occupational injuries and 83, 156 lost workdays were registered between 2003 and 2013. Statistical analysis showed, after intervention, a reduction of all injury rates (- 26 % IR, - 15 %FR, - 18 % SR) in ferrous foundries and of SR (- 4 %) in non-ferrous foundries. A significant (p = 0. 021) 'step-effect' was shown for IR in ferrous foundries, independent of secular trends (p < 0. 001). Sector specific benchmarks for all injury rates were developed separately for ferrous and non-ferrous foundries. Conclusions: Strengths of the study were: ITS design, according to standardized quality criteria (i. e., at least three data points before and three data points after intervention; clearly defined intervention point); pragmatic approach, with good external validity; promotion of effective good practices. Main limitations were the non-randomized nature and a medium length post-intervention period. In conclusion, a multifaceted, pragmatic and accountable intervention is effective in reducing the burden of occupational injuries in small-, medium- and large-sized foundries. Practical Applications: The study poses the basis for feasible good practice guidelines to be implemented to prevent occupational injuries, by means of sector-specific numerical benchmarks, with potentially relevant impacts on workers, companies, occupational health professionals and society at large...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{concerned}} with developing strategies {{that can be used}} to implement and operate a School Within A School (SWAS) program that may contain an action-learning component. The study began with an intensive search of the literature. Later, two data collecting instruments were developed: (1) a semi-closed-end questionnaire which was mailed to 112 SWAS programs as identified in the National Directory of Public Alternative Schools (Flaxman and Holmstead, 1978); and (2) an open-ended telephone interview instrument which was administered via telephone to ten respondents working in SWAS programs across the United States. Prior to use, the two instruments were submitted to a panel of five experts for review. Data from the semi-closed-end instrument were recorded and each telephone interview was tape recorded and then transcribed. A summary of the most significant findings, using data from both the instruments follows. The majority of the SWAS programs were implemented to deal with a particular group of students in a more effective manner. A substantial number of programs were implemented to deal with attendance and drop-out problems. Teachers proved to be the most likely group of professionals to call for a SWAS program. Teachers also proved to be the major stumbling block to successful program implementation. The respondents emphasized the importance of dealing with change effectively in order to successfully implement innovations. Involvement of the school community facilitated program implementation. SWAS programs have been implemented and operated in the face of a district's declining resources. The operating expenses of a majority of the SWAS programs were equal to or below operating expenses of the regular host school. The major problem encountered in implementing and operating a SWAS program is the philosophical division the concept promotes between faculty proponents and opponents. However, it was also funding that by successfully dealing with the fears and threats posed by change, program advocates can facilitate implementation and operation. Finally, it was found that SWAS programs offering an action-learning component can easily initiate and maintain communication and coordination with community resource <b>personnel</b> and on-site <b>supervisors.</b> Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that: (1) SWAS programs be directed at providing either curriculum options or scheduling options; (2) prior to introducing the SWAS concept, a needs survey be conducted and school community participation be encouraged and fostered in all phases of planning, operation, and evaluation; (3) once the SWAS concept has been introduced, steps be taken to reduce the stress and fear attendant to change; (4) accurate program evaluation procedures be established that are sensitive to the goals and objectives of the SWAS program; (5) a SWAS program operate with the same per-pupil expenditure ratio as the host school; (6) lines of authority and responsibility be clearly delineated in the program proposal; and (7) community resource personnel be involved in planning, operating, and evaluating any action-learning component...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the {{response}} of Malay paddy growing peasants to the efforts of the Malaysian government to organize them in so called Farmers' Organizations. In Peninsular Malaysia, paddy production is geographically concentrated on a number of coastal plains where paddy is the major - and for most peasants the only - crop, and the main source of household income. AS the farms are small and productivity is low, these areas form islands of poverty in a country which is relatively affluent in comparison to its Southeast Asian neighbours. In the 1960 s and 1970 s, the Malaysian government introduced a number of measures to improve the income of paddy smallholders and to become independant of rice imports. These measures involved large subsidies to the peasants. Funds for these subsidies were obtained from the more advanced sectors of the economy, such as the plantation and mining sectors. These public subsidies should be considered {{in the light of the}} government's efforts to eradicate poverty and to reduce the income differences between the predominantly rural Malays who are the indigenous population and the predominantly urban immigrant Chinese. Practically all paddy smallholders are Malays. The most important development in the paddy sector was the construction of large scale drainage and irrigation schemes in the coastal paddy areas, in order to enable the production of two paddy crops per year (double cropping). As an additional measure steps were taken to help the peasants obtain the full benefits of these facilities by establishing Farmers' Organizations (FOs) which they could join voluntarily. These FOs were to provide farm support services, such as supplying seed of new paddy varieties, chemical inputs, credit and extension advice and the buying up of the paddy. Other tasks of the FOs were to promote the co-ordination of paddy production activities of the peasants and to strengthen the peasants' position as a producers group vis-à-vis other economic interests. The main reason for assigning these tasks to a newly created organization rather to than the existing rural co-operative societies was that the latter operated on a very small scale and lacked the ability to manage these complex tasks. Many rural co-operative societies were completely inactive. FOs operated on a larger scale and the management was in the hands of government officers seconded to the FO. The activities of the FOs also benefitted from larger subsidies than the co-operatives were given. This meant that FOs, despite their formal structure as voluntary associations administered by a board and assembly representing the members, were very dependent on and strongly influenced by the government. The main objective of this study was to identify the sociological factors which influenced the response of paddy growing peasants to the establishment of FOs Three aspects of this response were studied: 1. the affiliation of peasants to FOs; 2. the members' contributions to the development of FOs; 3. the utilization of FO services and the adoption of improved paddy cultivation practices. A second objective was to compare the peasants' response to FOs, in the Krian and Muda irrigation schemes. These schemes represented the two different types of government intervention in paddy production in Malaysia. In the Muda scheme there was a project authority, the Muda Agricultural Development Authority (MADA), which was responsible for the FOs the other organizations providing farm support services and operating the irrigation system. This provided a favourable opportunity to co-ordinate the various farm support services at FO level. In the Krian irrigation scheme there was no project authority and the various services were provided by separate agencies. This made local co-ordination difficult. The FOs, in Krian were supervised by the state office of the Farmers' Organization Authority (FOA), a federal agency. This office supervised all the FOs, in the state Perak, the FOs in the Krian scheme being only a small section. Due to the exploratory character of the study, only one FO could be studied in Krian and one in Muda. It appeared that in both research areas the FOs) were in fact field offices established to perform service functions under the control and supervision of FOA (in Krian and MADA (in Muda). In both areas, they concentrated mainly on the provision to their members of short term production credit and inputs. In providing credit, the FOs acted as agents of the Agricultural Bank. The credit activities were confined to the administrative routine of processing loan applications and disbursing inputs and cash. other farm support services were of minor importance. Although initially loan repayment records had been high, the recovery of the loans had become increasingly difficult in both areas. Despite the fact that the organizational set-up in Muda offered better opportunities than in Krian to link credit supply to for instance agricultural extension activities, this however was not capitilized on in actual practice. It appeared that the main comparative advantage of the organizational set-up in the Muda area compared to that in Krian was that the MADA project authority covered a much smaller area than the state office of the FOA, this facilitated the communication between FO <b>personnel</b> and their <b>supervisors.</b> The latter could also provide more support for the field staff. This made it easier to undertake non-routine activities that required frequent consultation with the supervisors. These activities were only undertaken by the FO in Muda, which ran a chicken farm and a mini-supermarket in a nearby town. However, these activities were of minor importance when compared to the routine task of credit supply. Therefore, the difference in performance between the Krian and Muda FO. was not as large as might have been expected. In order to recruit members, FO personnel in both Krian and Muda contacted peasants who were already in close contact with various government agencies and helped other peasants in their dealings with these agencies. The task of canvassing for members was left to these local contacts. only a section of the potential membership was invited by them. A large proportion of the non-invited peasants regarded access to FO membership as a priviledge controlled by the contact person. Only the more educated of the non-invited peasants joined the FO on their own initiative if they considered this to be in their interest. According to both members and non-members the most important and often only motive for joining the FO was to get cheap credit. However, the low interest rate only outweighed the costs of obtaining FO credit for peasants who needed large amounts of inputs. Those who operated a small paddy farm could obtain their inputs more conveniently from private shops. Thus, the operators of large paddy farms were overrepresented in the FOs. In both Krian and Muda the FOs had appealed to about half of the potential membership. Members of an FO must accept some responsibility and make contributions in time and money by attending and participating in meetings and buying capital shares, if the FO is to develop into a farmers organization. These member-contributions were generally low in both the FOs studied. One of the reasons was that the individual's access to the benefits of FO membership was not directly dependent on these contributions. Secondly, the benefits remained rather limited and might not have been a sufficient incentive. A third cause of low member-contributions was the loosely structured character of the local society. This made it difficult to develop the permanent commitment required for these contributions. Finally, a fourth cause was the government's emphasis on a quick increase in the number of FOs and its neglect of the need to build up commitment of the members to the FO. This has created a tendency of government agencies to act on behalf of the peasants rather than help the peasants to act for themselves and has also contributed to the general tendency of peasants to lean on the government rather than stand on their own two feet. The board and the assembly of the FO who represented the members, left much of the responsibility for the operations of the FO to the staff. They also accepted that actions suggested by them could not be carried out without prior approval by the FO staff's superiors in FOA or MADA. Rather than administering the FO the main function of the board and assembly was to communicate the wishes of the members to government agencies over which they had no control. These wishes received due consideration and often led to adaptations in the activites of these agencies. In both Krian and Muda the efforts of the FOs to change paddy cultivation practices were confined to the provision of farm support services to individual members. There were no attempts to co-ordinate the paddy production activities of the members. The farm support services of the FOs studied had only reached a small section of the peasants in both research areas, primarily those with larger farms, more education and more contacts with the world outside the village. However, this had not led to differential adoption of the new cultivation practices. The necessary inputs were also avaiable to non-members. They could be obtained from local shops, either on credit terms or for cash. Since the extension advice given was very general and hardly changed from season to season, non-members knew what the advice included. No statistically significant differences in the cultivation practices of members and non-members were found. Peasants had tried out the recommendations and retained those practices that were found useful, while rejecting those that were not. Since then, peasants had continually experimented with new practices imitating friends and relatives and selecting their own new paddy varieties. The actual practices of both members and non-members bore only a vague resemblance to the official recommendations. The study recommends a number of improvements that could help the FOs to function more effectively. These include improvements in agricultural extension services and in the role of the FO in co-ordinating its members' paddy production activities. Apart from these paddy oriented measures other suitable FO activities should be investigated, e. g. in the small scale industries sector. Finally, the study indicates a number of problems that need to be solved before the responsibility for the FO can be transferred to the members...|$|R
