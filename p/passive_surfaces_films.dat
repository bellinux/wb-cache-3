In this study, the tribocorrosion behavior of titanium in artificial saliva solutions containing fluorides is investigated. Before sliding tests were started up, electrochemical measurements such as open circuit potential (OCP) and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed to get information on the corrosion behavior of titanium in artificial saliva solutions. Then, sliding wear tests were carried out at the OCP taken by the test sample. Scanning electron microscopy and weight loss measurements were performed after the tribocorrosion tests. The presence of a compact <b>passive</b> <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> on titanium immersed was demonstrated in artificial saliva free of fluorides and in presence of up to 227 ppm F-. However, a progressive {{degradation of}} titanium was observed at a F- concentration of 12, 300 ppm. Additionally, the corrosion and wear resistance of the titanium oxide film formed at a F- concentration of 12, 300 ppm differ from the ones obtained up to 227 ppm F- reflected by a decrease of the coefficient of friction although the material loss increased. The synergism between wear and corrosion processes on titanium needs thus to be further investigated to reach a reliable prediction of the long-term behavior of titanium-based prostheses and implants in the oral cavity.

40|$|The work {{reported}} {{dealt with}} {{two aspects of}} corrosion study. The first was {{the study of the}} nature of the <b>passive</b> <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> formed on aqueously corroded stainless steels. The second was the use of Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis, ESCA, to study corrosion problems. The very thin <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> reported to be on the order of 10 to 80 angstroms thick, had been difficult to study. Since ESCA had not been widely applied to metallurgical systems, the sample preparation, ESCA manipulations and data handling procedures were established as part of this project. ^ Samples from commercially manufactured alloys were aqueously corroded under potentiostatic control. The main experiments were carried out on 304 stainless steel in 1 N H(, 2) SO(, 4) solutions with 0. 25 N KCl. These samples were then analyzed on ESCA and with alternating argon gas sputtering and analyses, the composition of the passive film was studied. ^ The <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> was found to be on the order of 20 to 35 angstroms thick for samples tested at lower potentials in the passive region. The composition profiles indicated a monotonic gradient for both iron and chromium in the film, while nickel showed an unexpected gradient. The concentration of chromium, greatly enhanced at the surface, varied with the corrosion potential in the passive region. This indicated, as predicted, a change in the film itself as the potential at which it was formed was increased toward the transpassive region. The use of both 2 P and 3 P data from ESCA showed the absence of a layered structure in the film. ^ The success of the project was shown in the complete composition profiles which were calculated for the main samples. These samples were corroded at + 0. 200 Vsce and + 0. 500 Vsce in the passive region. The suitability of ESCA for corrosion studies was clearly evident. One of the questions answered by this project was the applicability of ultra-high vacuum equipment to the study of aqueously corroded samples. The correlation of these experiments with predicted film compositions indicated that the approach was suitable and that under appropriate conditions a one to one correlation of ESCA results to the passive film can be made. ...|$|R

40|$|Extruders {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of process {{industries}} and high reliability is essential if cost effective manufacturing is to be maintained. A critical part of twin-screw extruders is the barrel that must withstand many different wear and corrosion environments depending on the end user. For many applications the extruder barrel is a critical component and it is essential that it performs in a predictable manner, providing the necessary design life-time. This project has addressed these aims by considering the wear/corrosion behaviour of current and potential extruder barrel materials from which a life prediction model has been developed. A wide range of engineering materials has been evaluated in the laboratory for abrasive wear resistance using a dry sand abrasive wear test according to ASTM G 65 - 93. An appraisal of the tests and the applicability of the results to the in-service conditions of an extruder has lead to further testing for abrasion and abrasion-corrosion resistance of four materials, namely Mild Steel, 440 C, N 18 and N 18 + 5 %TiC+ 5 %TiN. Plastic deformation was the main feature of the damaged surfaces in the form of ploughing which has been modelled in terms of a low-cycle fatigue process. The relative hardness between material and abrasive was found to be an important parameter in controlling the rate of material removal. It has also been shown that the synergistic effect of abrasion-corrosion results in an accelerated material removal rate. The information from these tests has been used to develop a model of the wear of extruder barrels by abrasive particles. It is shown that there is a correlation between the particle size, wear debris size and wear groove size distributions. From a knowledge of the particle flux, the particle size distribution and the loading conditions, metal recession is predicted based on a low-cycle fatigue process. The wear rates for a wide range of Fe- and Ni-based materials are predicted to better than a factor of two. When corrosion is also present, the mechanism of metal recession depends on whether <b>passive</b> <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> are formed. For the Fe-based materials which exhibit direct dissolution of material, the wear/corrosion rate can be estimated by combining the metal loss rate under pure wear and pure corrosion conditions only. For the Ni-base alloys, thin passive films form in all the aqueous environments studied and corrosion rates are extremely low. However, during abrasive wear the passive films are removed and the overall metal recession rate is a combination of metal loss due to abrasive wear of the substrate and the continual formation and removal of <b>surface</b> <b>passive</b> <b>films...</b>|$|R

The ac impedance data are analysed by using a non-linear least-squares fitting procedure, and the <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> resistance is found to be between 498 and 1032 kOmega cm(- 2) In the potential range 3. 6 - 4. 2 V versus Li/Li+, there is a breakdown of the passive film as demonstrated by a decrease in its resistance to 1. 2 - 4. 8 kOmega cm(- 2). This breakdown accompanies anodic oxidation of Al. Thus, there is a possibility of anodic degradation of the Al substrate that is usually used as the current-collector of positive electrodes of Li-ion batteries, if Al is exposed to the electrolyte. In the negative potential region, the deposition of uniform and non-dendritic Li occurs, which can be anodically stripped in a quasi-reversible process with high coulombic efficiency. Diffusion of Li into Al results in the formation of a surface layer of Li-Al alloy, as suggested by X-ray diffraction patterns. The quasi-reversible cathodic deposition and anodic stripping of Li with an exchange current density of 0. 16 mA cm(- 2) indicates that Al is useful as a negative electrode in Li-batteries.

The {{candidate}} gases for {{the replacement}} of SF 6 in magnesium melt protection were reviewed {{from the viewpoint of}} environmental effects, melt protection properties, and chemical properties. The <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> formed under fluorine bearing gases were analyzed by using XPS. The XPS results revealed that the <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> consist of MgO and MgF 2. The fluorine content of the <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> increases with increasing gas concentration and exposure time. The Pilling-Bedworth ratio (PBR) of MgO was 0. 73, and the porous magnesium oxide could not cover the whole melt surface. PBR of MgF 2 was 1. 29, and the <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> which contains MgF 2 could cover a lager area of the melt surface. This higher PBR of composite <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> prevented further oxidation and evaporation of magnesium...|$|R
40|$|We study {{frequency}} {{shifts in}} plate crystal resonators with <b>surface</b> <b>films.</b> The films are multiphysical, including {{the effects of}} inertia, stiffness, intrinsic stress, piezoelectric coupling, and piezomagnetic coupling. Mindlin’s two-dimensional equations for a crystal plate with two elastic <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> are generalized to include the multiphysical effects of the films. They are used to study thickness-shear vibrations of a rotated Y-cut quartz plate with initial fields resulting from the mechanical, electric, and magnetic fields in the <b>surface</b> <b>films.</b> Frequency shifts caused by the initial fields are calculated and examined. Results show that plate crystal resonators with multiphysical <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> {{may be used for}} electric/magnetic field sensing...|$|R

40|$|Quaternary Pd {{substituted}} MgNi-based hydrogen storage alloys Mg(0. 9 -x) Ti(0. 1) Pd(x) Ni (x= 0. 04, 0. 06, 0. 08, 0. 1) in amorphous phase {{were prepared}} by mechanical alloying (MA). They exhibited enhanced cycle life {{in our previous}} studies. However, their electrochemical impedances and its relationship with electrode reaction kinetics are still unclear. In this work, the impedance spectra of the above electrode alloys were measured at different depths of discharge (DODs). The observed spectra were fit well with the equivalent circuit model used in the paper. We further observed that the rate-determining step changed from charge-transfer to hydrogen diffusion with proceeding of discharge according to the fitting analyses of spectra. The fitted results demonstrated that charge-transfer resistance R(ct) decreased and then increased with the depth of discharge (DOD) and it also increased with Pd content among the studied alloys. Thickness of <b>surface</b> <b>passive</b> <b>film,</b> which {{is proportional to the}} reciprocal of double layer capacitance near the electrode alloy surface according to Badawy et al., increased with the DOD and especially with Pd content in the alloys. Meanwhile, the thickened <b>film</b> on the <b>surface</b> of electrode alloys ensured its long cycle life. Through Randles plotting and comparing the variation of Warburg coefficient sigma vs. DOD for the electrode alloys. it was found that sigma increased with the DOD and substitution of Pd also improved the diffusion performance of the studied electrode alloys.
