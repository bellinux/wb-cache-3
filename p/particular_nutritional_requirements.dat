40|$|Dietetic {{foods are}} {{foodstuffs}} intended to satisfy <b>particular</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements.</b> The German legislation on dietetic foods (Verordnung über diätetische Lebensmittel) defines which regulations these foods are subject to. In Germany, the current discussion {{focuses on the}} removal of the regulation for specific dietetic foods for diabetics and to replace the obligation to label carbohydrate exchanges with a uniform European nutrition labelling on packaged foods. BfR has already stated in several opinions that in terms of nutritional physiology, diabetic foods which, for example, advertise with a low glycaemic index, are unnecessary. In addition, the Institute is working on recommendations for standardised nutrition labelling. In light of recent discussion, the present BfR opinion asses whether the aspired alterations are contrary to the special dietary needs of individuals with a glucose metabolism disorder. Specifically in its opinion on the Jenkins study (BfR, 2009), BfR already looked into the current study results from 2008 - 2009. In the present opinion, the Institute assesses the international study results from 2002 - 2007. BfR again concludes that a diet with a low glycaemic index does not necessitate any special dietary requirements for diabetics since the vast amount of study results lead to different conclusions. This result corresponds to the draft of an EFSA opinion published just recently. The concept of carbohydrate exchanges (BE or KE) is unique in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Yet the concept offers no precisely defined values but rather provides estimated units that are applied differently in each country. Many European diabetes associations are thus asking for uniform and extended nutrition labelling on packaged foods...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{interest}} in farm animal welfare has grown rapidly {{in recent years}} because consumers increasingly demand that farm animals are reared, transported, and slaughtered in a humane way. Additionally, nutrition emerges as {{an important aspect of}} welfare since in most codes of recommendations for the welfare of animals, adequate nutrition is one of the primary requirements to be satisfied. We submit that in many cases domestic animals are provided with diets that, even when abundant and nutritious, are not necessarily adequate to foster the welfare of animals. The monotonous diets fed in confinement (total mixed rations) and on pasture (monocultures) often contain excesses of nutrients, nutrient imbalances, and toxins that adversely influence animal welfare. How much of any food an animal can eat will depend on the other foods it consumes, because at the biochemical level, nutrients and toxins interact one with another—nutrients with nutrients, nutrients with toxins, and toxins with toxins. Food intake and preference also depend on differences in how individual animals are built morphologically and how they function physiologically, and marked variation is common even among closely related animals relative to the needs for nutrients and tolerance to toxins. An integral part of an animal 2 ̆ 7 s ability to meet its <b>particular</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> and consume substances that improve health depends on having a variety of foods available so each animal can select a diet that best meets its homeostatic needs. Food choice may also offer animals a means to cope with toxins, as certain food combinations have the potential to ameliorate the negative effects of toxins. We suggest that the availability of alternatives may not only contribute to maintain homeostasis but also reduce levels of stress. Thus, food choice is necessary for individual animals to have freedom to express their normal behaviors. We contend this freedom enables the uniqueness of individuals to be manifest, thereby promoting animal welfare and performance and increasing profitability of the people who manage animals...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the present}} study, we aimed at {{providing}} a {{first look at}} the elemental composition of the early stages of cephalopods as an approach to their elemental requirements in culture. Essential and non-essential elemental profiles of the European cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, the European squid Loligo vulgaris and the common octopus Octopus vulgaris laboratory hatchlings and wild juveniles were analysed. In addition, for O. vulgaris we determined elemental profiles of mature ovary, eggs in different stages of development and followed possible effects of four dietary treatments during paralarval rearing, also analyzing elemental content of the live preys Artemia nauplii and Maja brachydactyla hatchling zoeae. Content was determined for essential (As, Ca, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Rb, S, Sr, Zn) and non-essential (Ag, Al, Ba, Cd, Hg, Pb) elements. The content in non-essential elements found in hatchlings and juveniles of the three species analyzed here seems to be far lower in comparison with subadult and adult stages of coastal cephalopods. In the octopus eggs, the non-essential element concentrations remained globally low compared to hatchlings and juveniles indicating the absorption of these elements along the ontogenetic development. The elemental composition of the octopus ovary and of the eggs, hatchlings and juveniles of the three cephalopod species analyzed here showed a high content in S. As expected, the calcified internal shell of the cuttlefish, rich in Ca and Sr, originates the main difference between species. It is remarkable the richness in Cu of hatchling octopus, that may indicate a <b>particular</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirement</b> for this element during the planktonic life. The reared octopus paralarvae feed on Artemia nauplii, a prey with relatively low Cu content, showed nearly half Cu content that the "natural" profile of octopus hatchlings or wild juveniles. This suggests a dietary effect and/or an indication of the poor physiological stage of the Artemia-fed paralarvae. At the present, the percentage of essential element absorption by food or seawater is unknown for cephalopods and should be determined in the future to understand their feeding requirements in culture...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{microbial}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> {{is a key}} {{challenge in}} microbiology. Here we leverage the recent availability of thousands of automatically generated genome-scale metabolic models to develop a predictor of microbial minimal medium requirements, which we apply to thousands of species to study the relationship between their <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> and their ecological and genomic traits. We first show that <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> are more similar among species that co-habit many ecological niches. We then reveal three fundamental characteristics of microbial fastidiousness (i. e., complex and specific <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements)</b> : (1) more fastidious microorganisms {{tend to be more}} ecologically limited; (2) fastidiousness is positively associated with smaller genomes and smaller metabolic networks; and (3) more fastidious species grow more slowly and have less ability to cooperate with other species than more metabolically versatile organisms. These associations reflect the adaptation of fastidious microorganisms to unique niches with few cohabitating species. They also explain how non-fastidious species inhabit many ecological niches with high abundance rates. Taken together, these results advance our understanding microbial nutrition on a large scale, by presenting new nutrition-related associations that govern the distribution of microorganisms in nature...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Optimizing {{nutrient}} {{efficiency is}} essential {{in order to increase}} sustainability of pig production systems, especially where the growing demand for food must be met at an affordable cost, without compromising environmental resources. To make this happen, it is necessary to develop efficient methods to accurately estimate the <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> of animals, as well as develop equipment and systems that allow for applying such expertise in the production system. Estimating the <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirement</b> of pigs through mathematical models, considering several factors that can impact the requirement, is a key factor to reduce the environmental load from pig production. Likewise, feed formulation and feeding programs, can help to achieve this. In this context, increasing the number of feeding phases in pig production, as well as precision feeding techniques, may be a tool to the esure adequacy of <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements,</b> since its use can bring economic and environmental benefits...|$|R
40|$|The {{culture of}} live microalgae to feed larvae and spat {{is one of}} the major {{bottlenecks}} in bivalve culture. Consequently, there is a strong need for alternative diets to replace live microalgae as food for bivalves in commercial and research hatcheries. This article initially reviews the literature on the <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> of bivalves and continues with a review of the development of alternative and artificial diets for bivalves. Although a limited number of such diets have been assessed experimentally, their nutritional value is currently limited by a general lack of knowledge of the <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> of bivalves. The importance of the development of artificial diets, whose nutritional composition can be precisely manipulated, in order to study bivalve nutrition is emphasized. In the absence of clearly defined artificial diets, dietary vehicles such as microcapsules and spray-dried microalgae are currently the most promising tools to study the <b>nutritional</b> <b>requirements</b> of bivalves...|$|R
