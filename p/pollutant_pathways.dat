The algorithms are implemented in an extension for ESRI ArcGIS 9. 2 a popular geographic information system (GIS) software widely used within the European Commission and in the research, environmental assessment, planning communities. The software is called MAPPE after Multimedia Assessment of <b>Pollutant</b> <b>Pathways</b> in Environment of Europe; the acronym is also the Italian word to denote maps. The purpose of the software {{is to provide a}} user-friendly way to convey the wealth of geographic data available to model the fluxes and concentrations of chemical pollutants emitted by industrial activities and other point emissions, and widespread use within households, urban environments or agriculture. The intended use is for organic contaminants such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, VOCs, and other industrial chemicals. The output of the model, i. e. maps of concentration and chemical fluxes, can be used for the screening of hot spots at continental scale, the assessment of risk for human health and ecosystems, the evaluation of policies and scenarios with reference to the ¿big picture¿ of the continental scale. However this does not avoid the need to use more detailed, site specific assessment procedures for single problems, but provides a tool for decision support in contexts such as the management of priority substances of concern for soil, water and air quality, the control of effects of environmental pollution on human health and ecosystems, and the sustainable management of agro-chemicals, etc. by making available a geographic representation available of the consequences of emissions to air, soil and water compartments.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{apply the}} adjoint for the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (hereafter CMAQ-ADJ) {{in a high}} spatial {{resolution}} study of the sensitivity of ozone to several of its precursors in the regions surrounding the Great Lakes. CMAQ-ADJ was originally developed for low spatial resolution applications. In order {{to use it in}} high spatial resolution (12 km) studies, it was necessary to resolve a conflict between the pre-set fixed output time step interval in CMAQ-ADJ and the CMAQ-calculated irregular synchronization time-step and also to modify the meteorological interface for the backward model integrations. To increase computation efficiency, the chemistry time-step in the modified CMAQ-ADJ is checkpointed instead of being re-calculated in the backward part of the model as before. I used the modified model to analyze the sensitivity of ozone to precursor species for cases of assumed high ozone episode in two target locations in southwestern and east-central Ontario. The studies examined the influence of pre-existing ozone, NO, CO, anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and isoprene on ozone level changes for the 69 hours immediately preceding the assumed high ozone event. The results are dominated by the long-distance advection, local meteorology (lake breezes), air temperature, the underlying surface features, and emissions in the <b>pollutant</b> <b>pathway.</b> Both production and titration of ozone by NOx is evident at different times and locations in the simulations. The industrial Midwest U. S. and Ohio Valley {{have been shown to be}} an important source of anthropogenic emission of NO and most VOCs that contribute to high ozone events in southwestern and east-central Ontario. Isoprene from the northern forest suppresses ozone in both target regions, with a greater magnitude in east-central Ontario. The response of ozone level in the two selected receptor regions in Ontario to different VOCs depends on the type of VOC, the time and location they are emitted, and the air temperature. Increasing VOC emissions in urban areas such as Toronto and Ottawa in the morning can enhance the ozone level by late afternoon. Increasing VOCs except ethylene and formaldehyde in regions with large VOC/NOx ratio in the morning tends to suppress the ozone level by late afternoon. Among all the species examined, NO has the largest impact on the target ozone level changes.

Transboundary transport of air pollutants has started {{to be recognized as}} a mechanism affecting air quality. Nevertheless, {{as a consequence of the}} complexity of atmospheric chemistry it is not easy to determine the importance of this effect. Photochemical models constitute an adequate tool to address this challenge, allowing the identification of <b>pollutant</b> <b>pathways</b> and the quantifi- cation of the influence of long-range transport of air pollutants. In this paper we evaluate the influence of out-of-Spain emissions on this non-compliance picture by using the CHIMERE photochemical model. For this purpose the model was run at a 0. 2 ?-horizontal resolution for a European domain. Although at this resolution not all the local effects can be captured, transboundary transport of air pollutants can be examined. Several simulations were performed considering different emission scenarios. To see all out-of-Spain emissions influence, all the emissions were set to zero, excepting those in Spain. This includes examining European and ships effects on air quality in Spain. A second simulation was performed setting to zero just European-countries emissions, to see the effect of Europe. The third and fourth simulations were carried out by setting to zero France and Portugal emissions respectively. Ozone has been found to be the pollutant more affected by this transboundary transport, in particular in the summer period.

40|$|Abstract. Due to {{the complex}} {{chemistry}} involved in troposheric ozone formation, {{it is difficult to}} predict the impact of controlling ozone precursor emissions. For this reason, modeling has become an important tool to predict ozone levels under varying emission scenarios. In spite of the efforts focused on reducing pollutant emissions, ground-level ozone concentrations in Spain are still exceeding thresholds established in EU legislation to protect human health and prevent damage to ecosystems. Resolution plays a significant role in modeling, especially when trying to simulate local effects. Higher resolution allows a more accurate definition of air <b>pollutant</b> transport <b>pathways,</b> although higher computing time is required. Besides the better definition of pollutants transport, a better model performance is also expected when simulating higher resolution domains. In this paper model predictions for three different resolutions have been analyzed over some areas in Spain (Madrid, Valencia and País Vasco) for 2004. Simulations of photochemical compounds were carried out using the regional V 200603 par-rc 1 version of the CHIMERE model. A comparison between hourly model predictions and observations was done for O 3 and NO 2 in 2004. An improvement of ozone predictions was found for Madrid and Valencia areas when considering a higher resolution. The improvement of model predictions is more clearly observed for NO 2 in this two areas. In the País Vasco area this improvement is not observed...|$|R

40|$|Emissions of {{chemicals}} {{have been on}} the rise for years, and their impacts are greatly influenced by spatial differentiation. Chemicals are usually emitted locally but their impact can be felt both locally and globally, due to their chemical properties and persistence. The variability of environmental parameters in the emission compartment may affect the chemicals’ fate and the exposure at different orders of magnitude. The assessment of the environmental fate {{of chemicals}} and the inherent spatial differentiation requires the use of multimedia models at various levels of complexity (from a simple box model to complex computational and high-spatial-resolution models). The objective of these models is to support ecological and human health risk assessment, by reducing the uncertainty of chemical impact assessments. The parameterisation of spatially resolved multimedia models is usually based on scenarios of evaluative environments, or on geographical resolutions related to administrative boundaries (e. g. countries/continents) or landscape areas (e. g. watersheds, eco-regions). The choice of the most appropriate scale and scenario is important from a management perspective, as a balance should be reached between a simplified approach and computationally intensive multimedia models. In this paper, which aims to go beyond the more traditional approach based on scale/resolution (cell, country, and basin), we propose and assess climate-based archetypes for the impact assessment of chemicals released in air. We define the archetypes based on the main drivers of spatial variability, which we systematically identify by adopting global sensitivity analysis techniques. A case study that uses the high resolution multimedia model MAPPE (Multimedia Assessment of <b>Pollutant</b> <b>Pathways</b> in the Environment) is presented. Results of the analysis showed that suitable archetypes should be both climate- and chemical-specific, as different chemicals (or groups of them) have different traits that influence their spatial variability. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the variability of the output of MAPPE for four different climatic zones on four different continents for four different chemicals (which represent different combinations of physical and chemical properties). Results showed the high suitability of climate-based archetypes in assessing the impacts of chemicals released in air. However, further research work is still necessary to test these findings. JRC.

Knowledge of <b>pollutant</b> transport <b>pathways,</b> potential source regions and their relative contribution to pollution levels in a city is thus very useful for urban planning and development of effective regulatory and mitigation strategies. In this study, the Hybrid Single–Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model driven by high resolution (1 km × 1 km) meteorological fields from the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model was used to identify the relationship between atmospheric transport patterns and daily pollutant concentrations on urban scale, with {{a case study in}} Lanzhou–an urban valley in Northwestern China. Trajectories calculated by HYSPLIT model for winter months (December, January and February) of 2002 – 2008 were analyzed using Ward’s hierarchical method to identify dominant transport pathways leading to elevated pollutant concentrations in urban Lanzhou. Potential source locations and their relative contribution to pollution levels were evaluated with the help of potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis and the concentration–weighted trajectory (CWT) method. The transport pathways from the northeast of the urban center and from the west and the east county were identified as the most important pathways leading to high pollutant concentrations in urban Lanzhou, with potential source areas located in the west and the east to the urban center.

40|$|Changes in {{land use}} and water use can greatly impact the cycling of water and {{water-borne}} substances. Increased redistribution of river water to irrigated fields can cause enhanced evapotranspiration and decreased river discharge. Additionally, the water quality can {{be affected by the}} external input of fertilisers and pesticides, and by changed <b>pollutant</b> transport <b>pathways</b> in expansive irrigation canal systems. This thesis examines basin-scale changes in water use, river discharge, water quality and nitrogen (N) loading under conditions of intensified irrigated agriculture, using the Aral Sea drainage basin (ASDB) with its two large rivers Syr Darya and Amu Darya in Central Asia as study area. Results show that more efficient irrigation techniques could reduce outtake of river water to the cotton fields in the ASDB by about 10 km 3 /year, while the corresponding river water saving at the outlet would be 60 % lower. The result illustrates the importance of accounting for return flows of irrigation water in basin-scale water saving assessments. Moreover, a decrease in riverine N concentrations at the outlet of the Amu Darya River Basin (ADRB) was observed during a 40 -year period of increasing N fertiliser input. The decrease was identified to be primarily caused by increased recirculation of river water in the irrigation system, leading to increased flow-path lengths and enhanced N attenuation. Decreasing N loads were shown to be primarily related to reduced discharge. N export from the basin may further decrease due to projected discharge reductions related to climate change. Furthermore, nutrients and metals were occasionally found at concentrations above drinking water guideline values in surface waters in the ADRB. However, metal concentrations in groundwater in the lower ADRB were subject to orders of magnitude higher health hazards. Projected decrease in downstream surface water availability would thus imply decreased access to water suitable for drinking.

40|$|The report {{describes}} the assumptions, equations {{and a few}} examples of preliminary applications of a global spatial steady-state box model entitled Multimedia Assessment of <b>Pollutant</b> <b>Pathways</b> in the Environment (MAPPE-Global). The model grounds on the concept of already developed European version of MAPPE chemical fate model. MAPPE-Global computes the removal rates of a substance with given physical-chemical properties in an evaluative environment for the Globe with a resolution of 1 x 1 degree considering atmosphere, land (natural and agriculture soils, forests, impervious surfaces, frozen territories), surface water (including lakes, inland wetlands and reservoirs) and oceans and seas. MAPPE-Global is able to consider chemical emissions in {{one or more of the}} environmental compartments and estimates chemical concentrations and fluxes accounting chemical partitioning (gas, liquid or solid), degradation, advective and diffusive transport. At this stage, MAPPE Global does not explicitly compute chemical transport in space, but only the fate of a substance at each location in space. However, the model estimates for each grid cell the mass fluxes of chemical that are available for transport inside or outside of the cell, in addition to concentrations from local emissions. Thus, MAPPE Global is developed specifically to respond questions as: •	How will a chemical spread across different media in the different climatic and landscape settings? •	How important is the variability of environmental processes in determining the fate of chemicals across the globe? In addition, the model enables estimating, for virtually any location in the world, representative parameters of the environmental removal rates that determine the fate of a contaminant. These rates may be used to feed a zero-dimensional time-dependent model that allows computing the main receptors of the chemical emissions. Besides, in order to evaluate the performance of the MAPPE-Global model a comparison with established models, such as Impact World and USEtox was made by crosschecking of the intermedia removal rate coefficients. Finally, MAPPE-Global was used to quantify for a set of 34 representative pollutants at global scale the range of variability of chemical removal rates for the different environmental compartments and to identify the fate patterns of flyers, swimmers, soil-bound and multimedia chemical substances.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{evaluation}} of solutions for integrated surface water quality management requires an integrated modelling approach. Integrated models have to be comprehensive {{enough to cover the}} aspects relevant for management decisions, allowing for mapping of larger-scale processes such as climate change to the regional and local contexts. Besides this, models have to be sufficiently simple and fast to apply proper methods of uncertainty analysis, covering model structure deficits and error propagation through the chain of sub-models. Here, we present a new integrated catchment model satisfying both conditions. The conceptual iWaQa model was developed to support the integrated management of small streams. It can be used to predict traditional water quality parameters, such as nutrients and a wide set of organic micropollutants (plant and material protection products), by considering all major <b>pollutant</b> <b>pathways</b> in urban and agricultural environments. Due to its simplicity, the model allows for a full, propagative analysis of predictive uncertainty, including certain structural and input errors. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated by predicting future surface water quality in a small catchment with mixed land use in the Swiss Plateau. We consider climate change, population growth or decline, socio-economic development, and the implementation of management strategies to tackle urban and agricultural point and non-point sources of pollution. Our results indicate that input and model structure uncertainties are the most influential factors for certain water quality parameters. In these cases model uncertainty is already high for present conditions. Nevertheless, accounting for today's uncertainty makes management fairly robust to the foreseen range of potential changes in the next decades. The assessment of total predictive uncertainty allows for selecting management strategies that show small sensitivity to poorly known boundary conditions. The identification of important sources of uncertainty helps to guide future monitoring efforts and pinpoints key indicators, whose evolution should be closely followed to adapt management. The possible impact of climate change is clearly demonstrated by water quality substantially changing depending on single climate model chains. However, when all climate trajectories are combined, the human land use and management decisions have a larger influence on water quality against a time horizon of 2050 in the study...|$|E
40|$|Stormwater-quality models {{simulating}} <b>pollutant</b> <b>pathways</b> {{in urban}} catchments are {{proven to be}} valuable means when planning and evaluating appropriate strategies to reduce the detrimental impacts of urban runoff [Zoppou, 2001]. SEWSYS, a substance flow model simulating pollutant concentrations in stormwater, is an effective instrument for predicting pollution loads from non-point sources and can therefore be used for proposing measures to reduce the release of contaminants into the environment [Ahlman, 2006]. SEWSYS is now being expanded from operating with nutrients and metals, to include also a few organic substances. In this study, two groups of organic compounds – phthalates and nonylphenols (NPs) – were selected for an initial flow analysis. These compounds, classified as “very toxic to aquatic organisms” [KEMI, 2007 a], are high volume chemicals used as additives {{in a variety of}} products [KEMI, 2007 b]. To incorporate phthalates and NPs into SEWSYS, an extensive literature study was accomplished. The study included identification of potential pollutant sources in urban areas, e. g. building materials and vehicles, and analysis of emission patterns and rates. Also, model input data such as source distribution and authentic rain series were collected from three urban catchment areas. Simulated pollutant concentrations were then compared with measured and analysed concentrations in stormwater from the investigated catchments. Preliminary model simulations showed that pollutant loadings and major contributing sources are catchment dependent: e. g. vehicles are the dominant sources of phthalates in traffic areas whereas construction materials are the most important sources in residential areas. These simulation results were then used for proposing adequate measures in order to mitigate phthalate and NP loads in stormwater. Calculations showed that by using phthalate- or NP-free construction materials, and by reducing the traffic load, the pollution load from residential and traffic areas was considerably decreased. These findings illustrate the use of SEWSYS as a tool for improving urban runoff quality, and corresponding simulations could easily be performed by local authorities for planning of effective abatement strategies.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{emissions}} from the combustion {{of fossil fuels}} and biomass in Asia have increased in recent years. High concentrations of reactive trace gases and absorbing and light-scattering particles from these sources over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of southern Asia form persistent haze layers, also known as atmospheric brown clouds, from December through early June. Models and satellite imagery suggest that strong wind systems within deep trans-Himalayan valleys are major <b>pathways</b> by which <b>pollutants</b> over the IGP are transported to the high Tibetan Plateau (TP). To evaluate this pathway, we measured black carbon (BC), ozone (O 3), and associated meteorological conditions within the Kali-Gandaki Valley, Nepal, from January 2013 to August 2015. BC and O 3 varied over both diurnal and seasonal cycles. Relative to nighttime, mean BC and O 3 concentrations within the valley were higher during daytime when the up-valley flow (average velocity of 17  ms − 1) dominated. Minimal BC and O 3 concentrations occurred during the monsoon season (July to September). Concentrations of both species subsequently increased post monsoon and peaked during March to May. We recorded average concentration for O 3 during April, July, and November were 41. 7  ppbv, 24. 5  ppbv, and 29. 4  ppbv, respectively, while the corresponding BC concentrations were 1. 17  µg m − 3, 0. 24  µg m − 3, and 1. 01  µg m − 3, respectively. Frequent episodes of concentrations two to three fold higher than average persisted from several days to a week during non-monsoon months. Our observations of increases in BC concentration in the valley – especially during pre-monsoon season (April) – {{support the hypothesis that}} trans-Himalayan valleys are important conduits for transport of pollutants from the IGP to TP. In addition, the increase in BC concentration in the KGV during high fire activity in Northern India and southern Nepal corroborates the role of trans-Himalayan valleys as vital <b>pollutant</b> transport <b>pathways...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} assess the {{contamination}} of sediments in estuaries and lakes is extremely important. This is because of various factors, both natural (tidal action, chemical remobilisation) and anthropogenic (e. g. building work), {{that lead to the}} disturbance of the sediment can result in the remobilisation or resuspension of the pollutants and, if high levels of pollutants are present in,a region, they can be responsible for a number of health impacts on the local population. The use of sediment cores to investigate the pollution levels in the sediment is a relatively easy method of assessing contamination. The main aims of this study were to investigate pollution in saltmarsh, intertidal and lake sediment cores taken from the South Liverpool area and to attempt to distinguish different <b>pollutant</b> transport <b>pathways</b> between cores. This was done using sediment cores taken from a saltmarsh, intertidal area and lake in,. South Merseyside and measuring the heavy metal and persistent organic pollutant (P AH and PCB) content using a variety of methods including; X-Ray Fluorescence, Environmental Magnetism, Gas ChromatographylMass Spectrometry and Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The results showed that, although the pollution input to the region has reduced over the last 30 years, there are still high levels of certain chemicals (including lead, mercury and PCBs) in the environment. The concentrations of the main pollutants (Pb, Zn, Hg, Cd, PCBs and PARs) are above guideline levels that are considered dangerous to aquatic organisms, however with the exception of Cd at Speke, none of the metals are present at a concentration that would be considered dangerous to human health. The main source of pollution to the saltmarsh is aquatic, whilst the main input to the lake core is from atmospheric deposition. From the data acquired for this project {{it would appear that the}} core from the Speke Hall Lake location provides a more accurate record of the pollution history of the area than those from the more dynamic saltmarsh environment.

Our work is aimed at developing a new technology for the magnetic manipulation of bacterial cells marked with specific DNA onto which magnetic nanoparticles have been grafted. With this technology, it will be possible to selectively remove from the indigenous microbial population of a soil the bacteria that have been transformed with this magnetic DNA. The tagging of plasmids comprising genes involved in chlorous <b>pollutant</b> degradation <b>pathway</b> will enable to understand the horizontal gene transfer mechanisms involved in the eviction of hard-to-remove polluants such as Lindane. A dentritic approach for the decoration of the nanoparticles appears promising as the diversity of functionalization brought by the arborescent structure answers simultaneously all the criteria of biocompatibility, low toxicity and specificity. The structure of the proposed dendritic molecules can be divided into 3 parts: a biphosphonate group at the core which allows a strong and stable coupling between the nanoparticle and the dendritic part under various pH and temperature conditions, a PAMAM (polyaminoamine) -derived dendron and then, at the periphery, hydrophilic and biocompatible oligoethyleneglycol chains decorated with arnino or carboxylic groups, allowing an interaction with the DNA through phosphate or arnine groups. It IlUlst be noted that the synthetic organic shell is easily tunable and allows the conjugation of various parts (PAMAM efficiency in DNA-complexation; OEG hydro-soluble and non toxic) in order to associate their advantages. The dentritic approach, compared to the polymeric one, allows a better size control of the decorated nanoparticles (as a function of the generation of the grafted dendron), a better follow-up of the DNA binding properties (as a function of the generation and the physico-chemical properties of the dendrimer) and finally an ensured reproductibility. The synthesis of the dentritic organic shell, its functionalization on iron oxide nanoparticles and their characterization will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Spatial {{differentiation}} is a {{topic of}} increasing interest within life cycle assessment (LCA). For chemical-related impacts, in this paper, we evaluate the relative influence of substance properties and of environmental characteristics on the variability in the environmental fate of chemicals using an advanced, spatially resolved model. The goal {{of this study is}} to explore spatial distribution and spatial variability of organic chemicals, assessing the variability of the removal rate from air with a multimedia spatially explicit model Multimedia Assessment of <b>Pollutant</b> <b>Pathways</b> in the Environment (MAPPE) Global with a resolution of 1 [*]×[*] 1 °. This provides basis to help identify chemicals for which spatial differentiation will be important in LCAs, including whether differentiation will have added benefits over the use of global generic default values, such as those provided by the USEtox model. Methodology A methodology was developed to explore spatial distribution and spatial variability of the fate of organic chemicals. Firstly, guidelines were developed to assign a hypothetical spatial distribution to chemicals which were clustered on the basis of their physical–chemical properties and persistence. Secondly, a test set of 34 representative organic chemicals was used to run MAPPE Global and USEtox model. The results of MAPPE Global were used to highlight spatial variability of removal rate from air amongst different chemicals and their related patterns of variability. A comparison between USEtox and MAPPE Global removal rates from air was performed for each chemical in order to highlight whether spatial differentiation is relevant for the assessment or not. Results and discussion Hypothetical spatial distribution of chemical fate was assigned to each combination of physical–chemical properties and persistence. Besides, spatial variability of removal rates from air was assessed running MAPPE model for the test set of 34 chemicals. The variability of results spans from less than one to over four orders of magnitude, showing differences in variability for each cluster of chemicals. Furthermore, different patterns of spatial variability are associated to each cluster of chemical as the spatial pattern is driven by a specific component of the overall removal rate. The comparison between MAPPE and USEtox removal rates from air shows that for 14 out of 34 chemicals within the test set, USEtox values are close to the median of the results of MAPPE. For 11 out of 34, USEtox underestimates the removal rate from air and the results are close to the fifth percentile of MAPPE ones. This is mainly related to how wet/dry deposition and gas exchange are accounted in the two models. Conclusions and outlook This work has made further progress towards understanding and implementing how to develop a tailored-made guidance for assessing spatial differentiation in LCA. Results on spatial distribution and spatial variability of chemical are presented as a basis for defining patterns of variability and supporting further development of spatial scenarios and archetypes to be used for life cycle impact assessment. This provides insights into whether using generic global default factors is likely to result in high uncertainty depending on the type of chemical, as well as whether pattern-specific factors would reduce the uncertainty. Uncertainties related to spatial differentiation are presented and discussed. JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGlobal {{transports}} and {{budgets of}} three PCBs were investigated with a 3 -D dynamic model for semi-volatile persistent organic <b>pollutants</b> ? GEM/POPs. Dominant <b>pathways</b> were identified for PCB transports {{in the atmosphere}} with a peak transport flux below 8 km and 14 km for gaseous and particulate PCB 28, 4 km and 6 km for gaseous and particulate PCB 180. The inter-continental transports of PCBs in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) are dominated in the zonal direction with their route changes seasonally regulated by the variation of westerly jet. The transport pathways from Europe and North Atlantic to the Arctic contributed the most PCBs over there. Inter-hemispheric transports of PCBs originated from the regions of Europe, Asia and North America in three different flow-paths, accompanying with easterly jet, Asian monsoon winds and trade winds. PCBs from the Southern Hemisphere (SH) could export into the NH. According to the PCB emissions of year 2000, Europe, North America and Asia are the three largest sources of the three PCBs, contributing to the global background concentrations in the atmosphere and soil and water. Globally, PCB 28 in soil and water has become a comparable source to the anthropogenic emissions while heavier PCBs such as PCB 153 and 180 are still transporting into soil and water. It is found that lighter PCBs have more long range transport potentials than their heavier counter-parts in the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} investigations on graphite particle combustion {{have employed}} several levels of heterogeneous reaction models, ranging from global to elementary models, {{to describe the}} oxidation of carbon to gaseous products. Unlike the counterpart homogeneous reaction models, these heterogeneous reaction models are not well developed because of the difficulties associated with decoupling the physical characteristics of the solid (e. g. surface area taking part in combustion) from the chemical kinetic data. This is certainly true for porous graphite particle combustion, where heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions occur within the pores and {{play an important role}} in the overall oxidation process. As a result, there are considerable uncertainties of physical phenomena predicted using different heterogeneous kinetic models available in the literature. A good example, discussed later in this paper, is the predicted critical particle size below which the mass burning rate becomes exponentially small. The main goal of this study is to understand the basic mechanism controlling such rapid changes in burning rates, by developing a model where physical contributions are decoupled from chemical rate constants in a consistent manner. Another important goal of the proposed study is to develop a truly intrinsic, detailed heterogeneous reaction model for porous graphite combustion at high-temperatures, and to derive a systematically reduced heterogeneous reaction model in terms of the elementary reaction rate constants of the detailed model. The validation of chemical kinetic models describing the heterogeneous and homogeneous combustion in and around a spherically symmetric porous graphite particle can be considerably simplified by experimental measurements obtained under microgravity conditions. A vital component of this study is to conduct such supporting experiments on particle burning rate and surface temperature using NASA microgravity facilities, in close coordination with the theoretical effort. The basic understanding obtained and models developed as part of this project will be useful for optimal design of coal combustion devices. These models can also be extended to investigate the role of heterogeneous chemistry on <b>pollutant</b> formation <b>pathways</b> in combustion devices. The theoretical approach developed here, with pore diffusion effects decoupled from the chemical effects, can also be extended to understand the heterogeneous combustion of other porous fuels, for example, combustion of magnesium in a CO 2 environment for propulsion in the Martian atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|A {{cardiovascular}} {{health survey}} of 1203 persons in households {{located near the}} hazardous waste disposal sites and in a reference community, was conducted from 2009 until today to assess whether rates of adverse cardiovascular health outcomes were elevated among persons living near the sites. Data included medical records of reported cardiovascular disease certificates and hospital admission for cardiovascular diseases from hospital database. The study areas appeared similar with respect to mortality, cancer incidence, and pregnancy outcomes. In contrast, rate ratios were greater than 1. 5 for 2 of 19 reported diseases, i. e., angina pectoris, and strokes. The apparent broad-based elevation in reported diseases and symptoms may reflect increased perception or recall of conditions by respondents living near the sites. Our study found that cardiovascular risk is associated only with PM 2. 5 concentrations, derived from uncontrolled burning of municipal solid waste in particular sites of our country. Their analysis demonstrated a relationship between increased levels of eventual fine particulate pollution and higher rates of death and complications from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Management of solid waste releases a number of toxic substances, most in small quantities and at extremely low levels. Because of {{the wide range of}} <b>pollutants,</b> the different <b>pathways</b> of exposure, long-term low-level exposure, and the potential for synergism among the pollutants, concerns remain about potential health effects but there are many uncertainties involved in the assessment. Future community-based health studies should include medical and psychosocial assessment instruments sufficient to distinguish between changes in health status and effects of resident reporting tendency...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{high-frequency}} bankside measurements {{from three}} catchments selected {{as part of}} the UK government-funded Demonstration Test Catchments (DTC) project. We compare the hydrological and hydrochemical patterns during the water year 2011 – 2012 from the Wylye tributary of the River Avon with mixed land use, the Blackwater tributary of the River Wensum with arable land use and the Newby Beck tributary of the River Eden with grassland land use. The beginning of the hydrological year was unusually dry and all three catchments were in states of drought. A sudden change to a wet summer occurred in April 2012 when a heavy rainfall event affected all three catchments. The year-long time series and the individual storm responses captured by in situ nutrient measurements of nitrate and phosphorus (total phosphorus and total reactive phosphorus) concentrations at each site reveal different <b>pollutant</b> sources and <b>pathways</b> operating in each catchment. Large storm-induced nutrient transfers of nitrogen and or phosphorus to each stream were recorded at all three sites during the late April rainfall event. Hysteresis loops suggested transport-limited delivery of nitrate in the Blackwater and of total phosphorus in the Wylye and Newby Beck, which was thought to be exacerbated by the dry antecedent conditions prior to the storm. The high rate of nutrient transport in each system highlights the scale of the challenges faced by environmental managers when designing mitigation measures to reduce the flux of nutrients to rivers from diffuse agricultural sources. It also highlights the scale of the challenge in adapting to future extreme weather events under a changing climate. ...|$|R
40|$|The Multimedia Environmental Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS) {{provides}} physics-based {{models for}} human health risk assessment for radioactive and hazardous pollutants. MEPAS analyzes pollutant behavior in various media (air, soil, groundwater and surface water) and estimates transport through and between media and exposure and impacts to the environment, to the maximum individual, and to populations. MEPAS includes 25 exposure pathway models, a database with information on more than 650 contaminants, and a sensitivity module that allows for uncertainty analysis. Four major transport pathways are considered in MEPAS: groundwater, overland, surface water, and atmospheric. This report describes the exposure pathway and health impact assessment component of MEPAS, which provides an estimate of health impacts to selected individuals and populations from exposure to <b>pollutants.</b> The exposure <b>pathway</b> analysis starts with pollutant concentration in a transport medium and estimates the average daily dose to exposed individuals from contact with the transport medium or a secondary medium contaminated by the transport medium. The average daily dose is then used to estimate a measure of health impact appropriate {{to the type of}} pollutant considered. Discussions of the exposure pathway models include the assumptions and equations used to convert the transport medium concentrations to exposure medium concentrations. The discussion for a given exposure pathway defines the transport pathways leading to the exposure, the special processes considered in determining the pollutant concentration in the exposure medium, and the exposure model used to estimate the average daily dose. Models for the exposure pathway and health impact assessments require definition of several parameters. A summary of the notation used for these parameters is provided...|$|R
