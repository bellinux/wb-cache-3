40|$|Power {{marketing}} {{refers to}} wholesale and retail transactions of electric power made by companies other than public power entities and the regulated utilities that own the generation and distribution lines. The growth in power marketing {{has been a}} major development in the electric power industry during the last few years, and <b>power</b> <b>marketers</b> are expected to realize even more market opportunities as electric industry deregulation proceeds from wholesale competition to retail competition. This Topical Issues Brief examines the nature of the power marketing business and its relationship with renewable power. The information presented is based on interviews conducted with nine power marketing companies, which accounted for almost 54 % of total power sales by <b>power</b> <b>marketers</b> in 1995. These interviews provided information on various viewpoints of <b>power</b> <b>marketers,</b> their experience with renewables, and their respective outlooks for including renewables in their resource portfolios. Some basic differences exist between wholesale and retail competition that should be recognized when discussing power marketing and renewable power. At the wholesale level, the majority of <b>power</b> <b>marketers</b> stress the commodity nature of electricity. The primary criteria for developing resource portfolios are the same as those of their wholesale customers: the cost and reliability of power supplies. At the retail level, electricity may be viewed as a product that includes value-added characteristics or services determined by customer preferences...|$|R
50|$|Following {{passage of}} the EPAct of 1992, {{independent}} generation owner/operators (also called independent power producers or IPPs) and unaffiliated <b>power</b> <b>marketers</b> lodged frequent complaints with FERC about unfair treatment under the new open access requirements. The complaints generally followed the same theme: vertically integrated electric utility companies would favor their own affiliated power marketing division over external parties trying to move power on the system. In many cases, the <b>power</b> <b>marketers</b> operated {{side by side with}} the transmission operators (or it might even be the same person) and there were no rules to prevent unfair treatment of external transmission system users.|$|R

40|$|Constellation Energy {{has been}} a leading {{performer}} in the merchant power business since 2001. In addition to its legacy utility, Baltimore Gas and Electric, Constellation is a merchant generator and a wholesale <b>power</b> <b>marketer</b> serving the load of utilities as well as industrial, commercial and retail customers. Constellation has developed sophisticated risk management capabilities and a large trading operation in electric power and related commodities. In a recent reorganization, Constellation gave its trading operations greater organizational independence and prominence. It also increased the scale of its proprietary trading, and used its trading operation as the tool for expanded investments into upstream natural gas and coal and international freight. In August and September of 2008, Constellation experienced a major liquidity crisis that saw its stock price fall by nearly three-quarters. In an emergency search for cash, it was forced to agree to sell itself at the low price. This paper reviews Constellation’s history and the specific events precipitating its liquidity crisis. It then places Constellation’s strategy vis-à-vis its commodity trading operations {{in the context of}} the larger history of commodity trading operations and discusses the key financial and strategic questions posed by Constellation’s crisis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} {{developing}} bidding strategies for the participants of dynamic oligopolistic electricity markets is studied. Attention is given to strategic bidding of load serving entities (LSE) in these markets. We model oligopolistic electricity markets as non-linear dynamical systems and use discrete-time Nash bidding strategies. We assume a Cournot model for our game, where the LSEs decide on demand quantities and the market price is the marginal cost of producing electricity. Attention is given to a problem, where the objective functions are quadratic in the deviations of trajectories from desired trajectories and quadratic in the control deviations from the nominal controls. It is assumed that each <b>power</b> <b>marketer</b> can estimate his/her competitors ’ benefit function coefficients. The optimal bidding strategies are developed mathematically using dynamic game theory. We deal with games that are nonlinear in the state equations. We linearize these equations for complex non-linear oligopolistic electricity multi-markets and use discrete-time Nash strategies. We show that the actual dynamic excursions from the operating point where we linearize are small so that the linearization is valid. The developed algorithm is applied to an IEEE 14 -bus power system. We show that the LSEs’ expected profits are higher for our method than those for other methods in the literature (F. Wen, A. K. David, Optimal bidding strategies and modeling of imperfect information among competitive generators. IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, Vol. 16...|$|E

50|$|Electric {{utilities}} in the U.S. {{can be both}} {{in charge}} of electricity generation and electricity distribution. The electricity transmission network is not owned by individual utilities, but by companies and organizations that are obliged to provide indiscriminate access to various suppliers {{in order to promote}} competition. In 1996, there were 3,195 electric utilities in the United States and 65 <b>power</b> <b>marketers.</b> Of these, 2,020 were publicly owned (including 10 Federal utilities), 932 were rural electric cooperatives, and 243 were investor-owned utilities.

50|$|The {{earliest}} NERC Tag {{application was}} based on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and was introduced in 1997. The form was usually completed by the <b>power</b> <b>marketers</b> or schedulers, by defining the date and time of the transaction, the physical path of the energy schedule from its point of generation to point of consumption, the financial path (buying/selling chain) of the energy schedule, the hourly energy amounts scheduled to flow, and also the OASIS transmission requests for each power system crossed which thereby documented that permission to cross each power system had been properly obtained.|$|R
50|$|When a NERC Tag {{was created}} in the spreadsheet, the {{information}} was then distilled into a small CSV formatted data packet which was disseminated via e-mail to all of the participants listed on the NERC tag. In this way, all participants of a transaction were able to determine which other electric utilities and <b>power</b> <b>marketers</b> were involved in the transaction, and what the roles of the other participants were. More importantly, {{in the event of a}} contingency such as a transmission line outage or generation failure, all participants could more easily be notified of the schedule change, and could then all act in cooperation to curtail the scheduled transaction.|$|R
