50|$|Peru has a {{long history}} of direct human {{consumption}} of Engraulis ringens and other sardines, reaching into ancient cultures, including Chimú culture, Paracas culture, Pachacamac, and most importantly the oldest known civilization in the Americas, the Caral-Supe civilization, which was based almost completely on E. ringens consumption. Nonetheless, since the 1950s, the overwhelming destination for captured E. ringens (anchoveta or <b>Peruvian</b> <b>sardine)</b> has been as the principal input for reduction fishery in the production of fishmeal and fish oil, with minuscule quantities destined for direct human consumption. Due to a combination of environmental and regulatory effects, since 2000, the Peruvian catch has ranged from 9.58 million metric tons (MT) to a low of 5.35 million MT, with the reported 2009 catch concluding at 5.35 million MT. E. ringens In recent years, direct human consumption (local and for export) has reached about 110,000 MT (about 2% of catch) due to evangelical promotion of health, environmental, and economic benefits, such as Mistura 2010, coupled with government and NGO activities, e.g. www.anchoveta.info, and private-sector offers from local supermarkets.|$|E
50|$|The local fishing {{industry}} along the affected coastline can suffer during long-lasting El Niño events. The world's largest fishery collapsed due to overfishing during the 1972 El Niño Peruvian anchoveta reduction. During the 1982-83 event, jack mackerel and anchoveta populations were reduced, scallops increased in warmer water, but hake followed cooler water down the continental slope, while shrimp and sardines moved southward, so some catches decreased while others increased. Horse mackerel {{have increased in}} the region during warm events. Shifting locations and types of fish due to changing conditions provide challenges for fishing industries. <b>Peruvian</b> <b>sardines</b> have moved during El Niño events to Chilean areas. Other conditions provide further complications, such as the government of Chile in 1991 creating restrictions on the fishing areas for self-employed fishermen and industrial fleets.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Peruvian</b> Pacific <b>sardine</b> (scientific name Sardinops sagax sagax) is a {{subspecies}} of the South American pilchard {{found in}} Peru. Related species of international importance include Sardinops caeruleus (USA), S. melanosticta (Japan), and Sardina pilchardus (Spain). Its geographical distribution {{extends from the}} Gulf of Guayaquil (Ecuador) up to Talcahuano (Chile). The most important location of the fish in Peru is Paita, Parachique, Santa Rosa, and Chimbote.|$|R
50|$|Until about 2005 the {{anchoveta}} {{was almost}} exclusively used for making fishmeal. Peru produces {{some of the}} highest quality fishmeal in the world. Since 2005 anchoveta is increasingly used for direct human consumption, as fresh fish, as canned fish or as salted-matured fillets packed in oil. Peruvian canned anchoveta is sold as <b>Peruvian</b> canned <b>sardines.</b> The new use is sometimes called the second anchoveta boom, the first boom being the discovery and subsequent fishery and fishmeal production in the 1960s/70s. The second boom was kick-started by the Peruvian Fish Technology Institute CIP, assisted by FAO. A large scale promotion campaign including by the then-president of Peru Alan Garcia helped to make the anchoveta known to rich and poor alike. Previously it was not considered as food and hardly known among the population. It is now found in supermarkets and served in restaurants. Still, only 1 percent of anchovy catches are used for direct human consumption and 99 percent continue to be reduced to fishmeal and oil.|$|R
