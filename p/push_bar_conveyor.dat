50|$|Crash bar (also {{known as}} a panic exit device, panic <b>bar,</b> or <b>push</b> <b>bar)</b> {{is a type of}} door opening {{mechanism}} which allows users to open a door by <b>pushing</b> a <b>bar.</b> While originally conceived as a way to prevent stampedes in an emergency, crash bars are now used as the primary door opening mechanism in many commercial buildings.|$|R
50|$|For rear doors, most buses have {{doors opened}} by the driver {{controls}} or patron (with touch-to-open, motion sensor or <b>push</b> <b>bars).</b> Most doors on buses use air-assist technology, the driver controlled doors, use air pressure {{to force them}} open, patron-operated doors, can push them open, however, the doors are heavy, so the touch-to-open or <b>push</b> <b>bar</b> mechanism, sends pressurized air to open the doors. Most doors will signify that they are unlocked and open with lights, this gives guide {{to those who are}} going up or down the door steps to not trip and fall.|$|R

50|$|The Kettrikes are {{a series}} of {{tricycles}} for {{children between the ages of}} 1-5 that come with a detachable <b>push</b> <b>bar.</b> Each Kettrike is still made in Germany and then shipped out worldwide. Kettler holds multiple patents on different functions of the Kettrikes.|$|R
50|$|The {{attendees}} at a {{trade union}} function {{taking place in}} the same building made their escape but the escape of some of the Stardust patrons was hampered by a number of obstructions. Some of the main fire exits were padlocked around the <b>push</b> <b>bars</b> and consequently were impossible to open.|$|R
50|$|Safety {{regulations}} were tightened {{in the wake}} of the disaster; many municipal authorities made inspections of cinemas compulsory. The Cinematograph Act 1909 was amended to ensure that cinemas had more exits, that doors opened outwards and that they were fitted with <b>push</b> <b>bars.</b> A limitation was also placed on the seating capacity of cinemas.|$|R
25|$|In {{parts of}} Europe, {{effective}} 2006, the fitting of metal bullbars, {{also known as}} grille guards, brush guards, and <b>push</b> <b>bars</b> to vehicles such as 4x4s and SUVs is only legal if pedestrian-safe plastic bars and grilles are used. Bullbars are often used in Australia {{and parts of the}} United States to protect the vehicle from being disabled should it collide with wildlife.|$|R
50|$|By 1983, Warner Brothers turned {{total control}} of {{building}} General Lees to a man named Ken Fritz. Fritz didn't have the job long before he too was fired {{and at this point}} Warner Brothers moved full production in-house. The General Lee was now the highlight of the series, and WB received enormous amounts of Lee-specific fan mail that nit-picked the inconsistencies of the cars. Because of the fame of General Lee, WB had their staff mechanics build the cars to a specific appearance, even underneath. All graphics had to meet specifications, all side markers and rocker panel chrome trim were removed; and roll <b>bars</b> and <b>push</b> <b>bars</b> had to meet an exact specification. However, some changes were made before the specifications were laid out: The <b>push</b> <b>bar</b> became wider, the interior became a light beige color, and the roll bars were covered in black foam padding. During this period, the only way to distinguish the 1968 conversions from the 1969 originals is by the shape of the dashboard padding.|$|R
5000|$|A bullbar or push bumper (also roo bar or {{nudge bar}} in Australia, moose bumper in Canada, and <b>push</b> <b>bar,</b> bull bar, brush guard, grill guard or cattle pusher in the United States) is a device {{installed}} {{on the front of}} a vehicle to protect its front from collisions, whether an accidental collision with a large animal in rural roads, or an intentional collision with another vehicle in police usage. They range considerably in size and form, and are normally composed of welded steel or aluminium tubing, or, more recently, moulded polycarbonate and polyethylene materials. The [...] "bull" [...] in the name refers to cattle, which in rural areas sometimes roam onto rural roads and highways.|$|R

50|$|Compared {{to adult}} trikes, children's model are simpler, without brakes or gears, and often with crude front-drive. Tricycles are {{typically}} used by {{children between the}} ages of two and five, after which point they usually switch to a bicycle, often with training wheels (stabilisers). Child trikes can be unstable, particularly if the wheelbase or track are insufficient. Some trikes have a <b>push</b> <b>bar</b> so adults can control the trike. Child trikes may have frames made of metal, plastic, or even bamboo.|$|R
5000|$|A curtain {{tie-back}} is {{a decorative}} window treatment which accompanies a cloth curtain. Within {{the field of}} interior decoration, tie-backs made of fabric are classified {{as a kind of}} [...] "soft furnishing" [...] (along with other fabric-based décor such as pillows, valances, towels, blankets, mattresses, bed skirts, bedspreads, jabots, and shower and window curtains) while those made out of wood, metal, or glass are considered [...] "window hardware" [...] (along with curtain rods, cornices, latches, hinges, <b>push</b> <b>bars,</b> and handles).|$|R
5000|$|Santa Clara County Protective Service Officers are {{equipped}} with an expandable baton, OC spray (from [...] "Oleoresin Capsicum"), handcuffs, flashlight, and a radio that is directly linked to the Central Dispatcher and other Protective Service Officers. The radios offer county wide coverage. The Protective Services Patrol Division currently uses Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors.Most Patrol vehicles have a cage, <b>push</b> <b>bar</b> and full emergency lighting and siren equipment.Bicycle patrol units have fully equipped bicycles with front facing emergency lighting and sirens.|$|R
50|$|Newspaper reports at {{the time}} {{triggered}} a mood of national outrage and the resulting inquiry led to legislation that public entertainment venues be fitted with a minimum number of outward opening emergency exits, {{which led to the}} invention of <b>push</b> <b>bar</b> emergency doors. This law still remains in full force to this day. No one was prosecuted for the disaster, and the person responsible for bolting the door was never identified. The Victoria Hall remained in use until 1941 when it was destroyed by a World War II parachute bomb.|$|R
5000|$|The Rizr uses a {{technical}} form factor, where the user can push on a plastic <b>push</b> <b>bar</b> located under {{the screen in}} order to open the phone. When opened, the top portion slides upwards, revealing the standard keys (including numeric, star, and pound keys). These keys are covered when the phone is closed, but the remaining keys, including the side keys, can be used normally once the keypad is unlocked; such keys can be set to automatically lock shortly after the device is closed to prevent accidental activation when in a purse or pocket.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Bluesmobile" [...] {{was also}} given to another former police car, a 1990 Ford LTD Crown Victoria, {{used in the}} 1998 sequel, Blues Brothers 2000. The model was {{equipped}} with a 190 hp 351 cubic inch engine, 4-speed automatic transmission and full optional Police Package including front <b>push</b> <b>bar,</b> canine cage insert, and Appleton spotlights. Livery is a classic [...] "Black & White" [...] common to many American police departments; in this case, {{very similar to the}} California Highway Patrol's K9 unit, with [...] "safety and service" [...] motto on the fenders.|$|R
50|$|The Architect of the Capitol, J. George Stewart, {{with the}} {{approval}} of the House Office Building Commission, selected the firm of Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson of Philadelphia to design a stripped-down classical building in architectural harmony with other Capitol Hill structures. However, while the interior design of the other House Office Buildings retains decor one would expect to see in House Office Buildings (with cherry wood paneling, brass railings, and marble floors), the Rayburn building possesses design style parallel to that of the 1960s, with chrome <b>push</b> <b>bars,</b> clocks, and elevators, and space-age fluorescent lighting fixtures.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the success}} {{seen by many}} Jewish athletes in German sports competitions, hateful and {{derogatory}} comments were still common among German spectators. An example of this rabid anti-semitism occurred during a sporting competition in Rostock, Germany which featured many sports clubs, including Berlin Bar Kochba, which was a primarily Jewish club. After Bar Kochba's athletes began winning many of the events at the competition, chants of [...] "Hep Hep" [...] were made throughout the crowd of spectators. These anti-Jewish chants (in reference to the Hep-Hep Riots of 1819) nearly <b>pushed</b> <b>Bar</b> Kochba to withdraw and leave the competition entirely.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{parameterized}} {{design system}} of disc cams with translating roller followers was studied. The secondary development of AutoCAD {{was chosen as}} the developing tool. According to the design theories of the disc cam, the solution steps of the best offset and base circle radius were proposed in this work. All the solution steps meet the requirements of the motion parameters of the <b>push</b> <b>bar.</b> The method of identifying the reasonable step angle for the given fitting precision was developed. The profile curve of the disc cam can be drawn automatically and saved as the ‘dwg’ format file. Finally, an example was used to verify the feasibility of the system...|$|R
5000|$|Drivers {{can also}} {{increase}} fuel efficiency by minimizing transported mass, i.e. {{the number of}} people or the amount of cargo, tools, and equipment carried in the vehicle. Removing common unnecessary accessories such as roof racks, brush guards, wind deflectors (or [...] "spoilers", when designed for downforce and not enhanced flow separation), running boards, <b>push</b> <b>bars,</b> and narrow and lower profile tires will improve fuel efficiency by reducing both weight and aerodynamic drag. Some cars also use a half size spare tire, for weight/cost/space saving purposes. On a typical vehicle, every extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 2%. [...] Removing roof racks (and accessories) can decrease fuel consumption by 20%.|$|R
5000|$|Ranch Hand {{manufactures}} grille guards, <b>push</b> <b>bars,</b> {{front end}} replacements, back bumper replacements for full size trucks and SUV's {{as well as}} various smaller products such as steps, headache racks, haulers and toolboxes. [...] Some {{significant differences in the}} product were developed. Instead of painting products, a new super polyester baked finish was developed. Also, expanded metal, commonly used as the mesh for BBQ grills was replaced with a higher quality custom punched insert which is custom made to match the make and the model of the vehicle. Their products are also fully welded and mount directly to the vehicle frame. One of the more unique features they have is the use of custom punched grille inserts to match the make and model of the vehicle the grille is being mounted on.|$|R
50|$|After the 1883 crush {{known as}} the Victoria Hall {{disaster}} which killed 183 children, a law was passed in England which required all public entertainment venues to be equipped with doors that open outwards, for example using crash bar latches that open when <b>pushed.</b> Crash <b>bars</b> are required by various building codes.|$|R
5000|$|Synonyms for {{grinding}} {{include the}} figurative terms treadmilling (a comparison with exercise treadmills) and <b>pushing</b> the <b>bar</b> (it {{can be a}} reference to a weightlifter [...] "pushing the bar" [...] on a bench press, over and over to get muscle gains, or a reference to Skinner boxes in which animals, having learned that pushing a button will sometimes produce a treat, will devote time to <b>pushing</b> the <b>bar</b> over and over again , or also can be a graphical reference to push the character's experience bar to higher values). Related terms include farming (in which the repetition is undertaken in order to obtain items, relating the activity to tending a farm field), and catassing, which refers to extended or obsessive play sessions. Used as a noun, a grind (or treadmill) is a designed in-game aspect which requires the player to engage in grinding.|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of the bench press, an example of a {{yielding}} isometric would be holding the bar at a given place even though it could be pressed higher, and an overcoming isometric would be pressing the bar up into the safety guards of a squat cage that prevent <b>pushing</b> the <b>bar</b> any higher.|$|R
5000|$|PORS {{are issued}} {{with a wide}} variety of {{specialised}} crowd control and riot equipment including Taser weapons and fully equipped black vans and black 4WDs to allow rapid deployment across the State at a moments notice. The vans allow a team in full tactical/riot gear to deploy on the move and access equipment as needed quickly, without need to return to a station to access gear as the part-time Public Order and Operations Support Group (OSG) officers do. PORS also have a $600,000 water cannon truck which is fitted with an airtight cabin to protect police from smoke, gas and other irritants. It also has shatterproof [...] "anti-bandit glass" [...] reinforced with wire mesh, and a heavy <b>push</b> <b>bar</b> allowing it to clear barricades and other obstacles. The high pressure 12,000 litre water cannon is able to shoot a stream of water more than 50 metres.|$|R

2500|$|Volzing: A {{method of}} holding or <b>pushing</b> the <b>bar</b> {{back onto the}} pegs while jumping over a height. This takes {{considerable}} skill, although it is now against the rules and counted as a miss. [...] The technique is named after U.S. Olympian Dave Volz, who made an art form of the practice and surprised many by making the U.S. Olympic team in 1992.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a vessel}} having a rubber for {{absorbing}} vibrations when monorail-car is drived. This vessel is {{submitted to the}} internal pressure by the rubber, so the stress occurs in it. We need to know this stress distribution. But the shape of vessel being complex, {{it is difficult to}} calculate this stress distribution. So first of all we measured the internal pressure of the vessel by the rubber, and obtained experimentaly the stress distribution by means of sticking the strain gauges on the vessel surface. We modify the shape of vessel simply, and calculate stress distribution for this shape. The calculated stress nearly equal the measured it. As result we obtained the following conclusion. If the vessel is subjected to maximum load 5. 5 t as repeated, the thin vessel-seem to be dangerous, but the thick is safety. Maximum load 5. 5 t which acts on the <b>pushing</b> <b>bar,</b> is overestimated than it actually does...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{relationship}} between live bands and the music they play and aggression in barrooms catering to young, college-aged patrons. Twenty musicians representing 14 different cover bands playing in licensed drinking establishments throughout Northeast Pennsylvania were interviewed about their influence on the behaviors of bar patrons. Content analysis of completed interviews revealed several important findings. Most notably, each of the musicians interviewed in this study reported being able to control and manipulate patron behavior, not just through the music they play, but also through their stage presence, their physical appearance and attire, and the way they interact with patrons while on and away from the stage. While none of the musicians reported ever deliberately trying to <b>push</b> <b>bar</b> patrons towards aggression, most agreed that they had the power to do so if desired. Conversely, musicians identified themselves as potentially important agents of social control within bars. Implications for future research and policy are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, the Dart {{was offered}} with a police package, with {{production}} code A38. The A38 Dart had the highest-specification components and systems throughout, including a heavy-duty suspension with a rear sway bar, stronger leaf springs and firmer shock absorbers, larger brakes with semi-metallic front disc pads, maximum engine cooling, and high-capacity alternator and battery. The engines were Chrysler's 225 slant-six, 318 V8, and 360 cuin L LA V8 (220 H.P., with non-catalyst in 49-state models and a true dual exhaust; California models {{had a single}} exhaust with the catalytic converter) with an A727 TorqueFlite transmission. Police-specific equipment such as a calibrated speedometer ("certified" [...] 120 mph), high-intensity dome light and wiring harness for a rooftop light bar were standard equipment and an A-pillar spotlight and <b>push</b> <b>bars</b> were optional. Production volume was low, with most A38 Darts going to the Los Angeles and Ventura police departments in southern California. For the most part, police agencies preferred the larger intermediate Dodge Coronet or full-size Dodge Monaco.|$|R
5000|$|The {{warp beam}} {{was at the}} top, and the work roller at the bottom. There was a sley and a guide bar.The {{carriages}} with their bobbins (brass bobbins) slid on a concave comb (bolt). In the 1825 modification, the carriages were suspended from a upwardly arching comb. The carriages are propelled by individual pusher rods which strike the ears on the carriage. There was <b>pusher</b> <b>bar</b> (later there were four) {{but there is a}} fetcher bar (locker bar) which act in conjunctions with the pushers [...] It was slow and in the early machine 14 actions were required to form each course; in 1825 this had been reduced to ten. The bobbins were necessarily small and this restricted the length of a single piece to about 4 metres The actions were controlled by an organ barrel until the adoption of the Jacquard process in 1839. This was achieved by James Wright of Radford.|$|R
5000|$|The blind {{audition}} {{stage in}} Sing My Song is called [...] "The Recordings". In {{front of each}} producer, there is a lyric screen and a red control bar. If a producer <b>pushes</b> the <b>bar,</b> it means he/she is recording the song and want the song in his/her original album. The lyrics screen will then move down, allowing the producer to see the contestant on stage. This part bears resemblance to the blind auditions in The Voice.|$|R
