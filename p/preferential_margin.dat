This paper examines {{the extent to which}} the 2006 revisions to the scheme improved market access opportunities for developing countries for agro-food exports where most of the tariff changes were concentrated. Changes in the percentage <b>preferential</b> <b>margin,</b> in the value of preferential trade and in the value of the <b>preferential</b> <b>margin</b> on agro-food imports between 2004 and 2006 from developing countries are calculated. The results show that while the 2006 revision saw only a slight increase in the average percentage <b>preferential</b> <b>margin</b> enjoyed by exporters, there has been a significant increase in the preferential trade. This was accompanied by changes in the ranking of beneficiaries, particularly under the main GSP scheme. Although the predominance of net-exporting emerging countries such as China, Brazil, Argentina, India and South Africa was maintained, some newcomers such as Thailand and Vietnam have now emerged as major GSP beneficiaries.

The effect of the Regional Trade Agreements on pre-existing trade flows {{are found to be}} significant with a mean elasticity of substitution at the product level of about 2 so that a 1 % <b>preferential</b> <b>margin</b> increases trade by only 2 % on average.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether non-reciprocal preferential regimes {{granted by the}} European Union {{have an impact on}} agricultural export flows from beneficiary countries while accounting for the costs of compliance that may prevent exporters from taking full advantage of potential benefits. Compliance costs are heterogeneous and difficult to measure. We proxy their influence and specify a model that allows for a different <b>preferential</b> <b>margin</b> impact according to the proxy costs. Adopting the gravity framework and using a sample of 554 lines of agricultural products for 131 developing countries in 2002, we find that the costs of compliance play a role in making the schemes work: the lower the costs, the greater the impact of the preferential margins. Moreover, the estimated margin effect differs between different regimes. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2010 The Agricultural Economics Society. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{determination}} of the rates of utilisation of Australian free trade agreements (FTAs). The topic is important and interesting because the utilisation rates show the usage of the agreements by traders. Low utilisation rates imply that trade agreements fail in their objective. Following a review of relevant literature, the study presents data on the utilisation rates of Australia’s preferential trade agreements (PTAs) over the time frame of 2000 - 9. This work requires some care in the definition of the utilisation rate, a matter which is discussed in detail in the presentation of this part of the empirical work. It is found that utilisation rates vary a lot. The variations appear to be related to low <b>preferential</b> tariff <b>margins</b> {{and the degree to which}} there are strict rules of origin (ROO). These rules are associated with FTAs to manage the problem of trade deflection (TD). The ROO schemes of five Australian FTAs are investigated and a ROO restrictiveness index is developed and applied to these five Australian trade agreements. The main findings are that all five ROO regimes differ significantly between the agreements, indicating that ROO are negotiated according to criteria beyond their role in managing TD. A question of interest therefore arises about the set of important determinants of ROO. One hypothesis in the literature is that more restrictive ROO are negotiated in tariff lines with relatively high <b>preferential</b> <b>margins.</b> To examine and test this hypothesis in detail, a political economy (PE) model is applied. PE and TD factors are taken into account in a test of the relative importance of these different factors. The results confirm that TD concerns in form of potential transshipment are reflected by ROO design; however this is the case only for the Australian agreements with its developing country partners. The results also show that more restrictive ROO are negotiated in tariff lines with high applied tariff rates and for commodities where a potential import penetration may occur. The higher the potential competition in the form of trade penetration and the higher market access in the form of low preferential tariff rats, the more restrictive are the negotiated ROO. Therefore, these results suggest that ROO are used as both a trade protection and as a tariff substitution tool. The research then returns to the question of the impact of ROO on the utilisation rates and trade development in Australia’s FTAs. An equation is estimated in which the relationship and impact of ROO and <b>preferential</b> tariff <b>margins</b> on the utilisation rates is tested. To avoid endogeneity between tariff rates and ROO as identified in this thesis, the study employs the instrumental variable method by using the results of the determinants of ROO as an instrument. Two main hypotheses are examined, namely (1) do more restrictive ROO increase trade costs and with that lower the application of preferential treatment in form of utilisation rates, and (2) do <b>preferential</b> tariff <b>margins</b> serve as an incentive to apply for preferential treatment. The results show a strong negative relationship between the degree of restrictiveness of ROO and the utilisation rates and a positive relationship between <b>preferential</b> tariff <b>margins,</b> and utilisation rates.

To take into account the complexity of EU protection in the F&V sector, in particular the seasonality of protection and the Entry Price System, we conducted our analysis at a very disaggregated level (eight digits of the nomenclature, monthly data). We showed that, on average, Mediterranean countries do have significant preferences compared to other countries exporting to the EU. However, the magnitude of the preferences differs among countries; Morocco has the highest preference, while Syria and Israel have the lowest. We simulated a multilateral reduction in the MFN tariffs (as planned in the Doha Round) and showed that this would reduce the heterogeneity within the zone by more strongly eroding the preferences of the most advantaged countries. The classification of Entry Price products as sensitive products would either benefit or have no effect on most Mediterranean countries.

Since the “free” trade bloc is not working in South, the paper concludes that alternative trade policy options like unilateral liberalization and seeking for multiple preferential agreements can buttress trade linked growth of the region...|$|R

40|$|Exports {{concentration}} in a reduced number of economic sectors has been always {{a concern for}} trade policy makers, mostly in developing countries. According to the economic theory and some recent empirical evidence, market access in international trade is improved through free trade agreements and preferential tariff rate programs which could affect positively export diversification.  Following a similar approach used by Debaere and Mostashari (2005) and Volpe and Gómez (2007), this paper estimates the effects on Colombia’s export diversification induced by the lower tariffs offered by Mexico and the broader preference margin vis-à-vis third countries in the Mexican market derived from the G 3 Free Trade Agreement (FTA). For this purpose, dynamic Probit and dynamic Poisson models are estimated using an unbalanced panel data available from 1995 –year when the G 3 FTA entry into force– to 2010, the latest year available. Moreover, this paper also attempts to estimate the effects of Venezuela’s withdrawal from G 3 in 2006 {{and the effects of}} the bilateral crisis between Colombia and Venezuela {{in the second half of}} 2000 s.  In general, results show that lower tariffs faced by Colombian products in Mexico are associated with higher export diversification but this impact is sensitive to the economic cycle and a negative impact on diversification can arise depending on the specification of the model. Also, broader <b>preferential</b> <b>margins</b> in Mexico induce higher export diversification for Colombian products. However, there exists a strong dependence of export diversification in Colombia on the initial conditions and the past of the export portfolio offered to Mexico. On the other hand, Venezuela’s withdrawal from G 3 FTA in 2006 had no effect on export diversification from Colombia to Mexico meanwhile the bilateral crisis showed –in some specifications– positive effects on the export diversification to Mexico, the latter revealing a trade deviation pattern. Macroeconomic control variables –including the real exchange rate– showed to be irrelevant to the model.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} regional trade integration and trade costs in services industries. The empirical analysis relies, on the one hand, on a dataset of theory-consistent bilateral trade costs calculated for 55 countries over the period 1999 - 2009 and, on the other hand, on an analysis of services commitments in 66 regional trade agreements to which these countries are parties. Despite the proliferation of services RTAs in the past decade, we find that trade costs are only slightly lower due {{to the impact of}} these agreements. In addition, we find that the trade cost reductions that do take place tend to happen before the agreement is signed. This mechanism is consistent with countries using services RTAs as a way of “locking in” reforms. Finally, we find that the <b>preferential</b> <b>margin</b> of services RTAs is quite thin: members and non-members both see slightly lower trade costs when an RTA is signed. We discuss the possible explanations for these findings in terms of the nature of services RTAs and their relationship with regulatory reform in signatory countries. Based on these results, we argue that regionalism in the case of services seems relatively non-discriminatory and does not lead to substantial trade preferences. ...|$|E

40|$|The ongoing {{negotiations}} on non-agricultural market access (NAMA) in the WTO {{are expected to}} lead to substantive reductions in the tariff rates on industrial goods in both the developed and the developing countries. Although an agreement on the formula and coefficient(s) {{is yet to be}} reached, it is becoming increasingly clear that countries are moving towards a differentiated swiss-type formula with deeper cuts for higher tariffs. The July (2004) Framework Agreement stipulated that LDCs will not be required to undertake any tariff reduction commitments under the NAMA. However, LDCs are likely to suffer substantive tariff preference erosion as a consequence of NAMA negotiations since any tariff reduction by the developed countries will result in a fall in the <b>preferential</b> <b>margins</b> currently enjoyed by the LDCs under the various GSP schemes operated by the developed countries. Consequently, the competitive edge currently enjoyed by the LDCs by taking advantage of the preferential treatment under the various GSP schemes is set to suffer erosion. This is a major concern for Bangladesh and other LDCs in the Asia-Pacific region. This paper attempts to make an estimate about the range of preferential erosion for Bangladesh given her current trade pattern and preferential treatment enjoyed by her exports. The paper finds that for Bangladesh, the preferential erosion could be substantial (e. g. $ 42. 1 million worth of net preference erosion in the EU alone for RMG products under one of the possible scenarios). Reduced preference margin will also undermine future competitiveness in the developed country markets. It is also to be noted that tariff reductions under NAMA will have positive implications for Bangladesh in the US market where most of Bangladesh’s industrial goods do not enjoy GSP treatment. Thus, tariff reduction under NAMA is expected to have diverse implications for Bangladesh’s export of industrial goods. NAMA, thus, may increase Bangladesh’s competitive edge vis-à-vis Caribbean and Sub-Sahara African countries which are currently enjoying zero-tariff access for apparels under the AGOA and the CBI. The paper reviews some of the proposals that are being discussed to address the possible negative consequences of preference erosion for the LDCs...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the trade creating effects of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) for a large sample of countries over the period 1960 - 2000. The paper builds upon the existing literature by examining whether any significant effects of PTAs occur through {{a change in the}} variety of exports (i. e. the extensive margin) or through a change in the volume of existing products (the intensive margin). To address this issue we employ the commonly used gravity equation as well as a matching approach to deal with potential self-selection problems. Our results indicate that exports respond positively to the formation of a PTA between countries, and that much of this increase in exports occurs along the extensive margin. We also show that the gains are strongest for larger trading partners, with again much of the benefits occurring along the extensive <b>margin.</b> <b>preferential</b> trade agreements, intensive and extensive margin, matching, difference-in-difference...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{the degree}} of {{preference}} utilization in four major importing countries (Australia, Canada, EU and US) and provide evidence that preferences are more widely used than previously thought. For Australia and Canada, we have obtained a new dataset on imports by preferential regime that has {{so far not been}} publicly available. For the EU and US, we make use of more disaggregated data than previously used in the literature. We empirically test what determines utilization rates. In line with previous studies, we find that utilization increases with both the <b>preferential</b> <b>margin</b> and the volume of exports, suggesting that using preferences can be costly. However, we also find that utilization rates are often very high, even for very small preferential margins and/or very small trade flows, which contradicts numerous estimates that average compliance costs are as high as 2 - 6 %. We extend the existing literature in relation to both data and methodological issues. In particular, we construct pseudo transaction-level data that allows us to assess more precisely when available preferences are utilized. Using this methodology, we obtain a more realistic estimate of what determines utilization. Rather than constituting a percentage share of the trade value, our findings indicate that utilization costs involve an important fixed cost element. We provide estimates for such fixed costs, which appear to be in the range of USD 14 to USD 1, 500...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyUsing {{the results}} of seven nationally and {{regionally}} representative household surveys, this study analyzes the impact of trade liberalization on wage inequality through a channel in which applied tariffs, owing to the <b>preferential</b> <b>margin</b> given under numerous preferential trade agreements, would affect industry wage premiums during the 1992 - 2006 period in Chile. I find the skill premiums for high-skilled workers there to have decreased, especially after 2000; this circumstance is unlike that seen in most other Latin American countries or during Chile's initial reform period. The results of econometric analyses show that industries which experienced larger tariff reductions were those with initially higher shares of low-skilled workers and lower industry wage premiums, and a statistically significant negative relationship between applied tariffs and industry wage premiums, that is, tariff reductions contributed {{to an increase in}} initially lower industry wage premiums. However, the impacts of applied tariffs on industry wage premiums disappear, after controlling for unobservable timeinvariant industry characteristics during the 2000 - 2006 period. Thus, I find no statistically significant relationship between applied tariffs and industry wage premiums. The findings suggest that, unlike a theoretical assumption that tariff reduction-induced productivity improvements lead to increases in industry wage premiums, industries with initially higher productivity tend to have lower applied tariffs and higher wage premiums in such a short time-period. Therefore, I cannot conclude that bi- or multilateral trade liberalization during this period has contributed to wage equalization through a channel in which applied tariffs affect industry wage premiums.

MENA countries use tariffs and nontariff barriers, and tariff dispersion and nontariff barriers, as substitute protection measures. Tariff levels and tariff dispersion are complements. Excluding Tunisia, the cross-country correlation between tariff and nontariff barriers is - 0. 46. The correlation between tariff dispersion and nontariff barriers is - 0. 8. The paper also develops an overall index of trade protection and finds that tariff levels, their dispersion, and nontariff barriers account for 60 percent, 10 percent, and 30 percent of overall protection, respectively.

40|$|The EU has {{recently}} completed negotiating {{a series of}} association agreements with mediterranean countries. Trade preferences for agricultural goods which are granted under these agreements as well as under former arrangements are analyzed by calculating the value of preference margins at several stages {{in the evolution of}} preferences. The total value of preference margins for all countries covered was about â‚¬ 130 million under the agreements in the midseventies and increased by 48 per cent until 1995. It was eroded by about 14 per cent until 2000 due to the reduction of EU MFN tariffs.

40|$|EU trade {{preferences}} {{have long}} been crucial to ACP countries operating {{on the margins of}} the world economy. But recent changes in trading rules now threaten the banana and sugar industries, and the small-scale producers who rely on them. Can they find new openings to fill the gap? The writing has been on the wall for some time now, but that does not make it any easier to accept. The erosion of ACP <b>preferential</b> <b>margins</b> for the EU s sugar and banana markets is now a certainty, and with it will come tougher times for many producers. Sugar and banana farmers in the Caribbean and Pacific are expected to be the hardest hit, their problems compounded by the small size of their markets and the vulnerability of their export sectors. Diversification offers the best hope for ACP farmers affected by the changes. But finding new products and new markets is no easy task, and time is not on their side. Under agreements dating back more than 40 years, Sugar and Banana Protocols guaranteed protected export markets to the EU for these two key ACP commodities. Now, under pressure from competitors, those preferences are being drastically cut back. In November 2005, the EU announced that it would slash by 36 % over 4 years the price it pays for sugar from ACP regions. Meanwhile, at the 6 th World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005, the EU confirmed its decision to apply a new import tariff on bananas from January 2006. This tariff of 176 /t for Latin America is considered by ACP exporters to be too low to safeguard their own trade position on the EU market. It is the latest round in a 5 -year dispute which began when Latin American producers complained that the EU's banana regime was unfair. But will this new tariff regime maintain the benefits of ACP banana producers? Trade preference mechanisms have proved the mainstay of many ACP sugar and banana producing countries over the past 4 decades, creating a dependence which will be painful to sever. For Barbados, Belize, Fiji, Guyana and Swaziland the current income transfer from the Sugar Protocol is equivalent to over US$ 50 (42) per capita. For Mauritius, the figure is US$ 150 (126). In a number of ACP countries, family-run banana farms have traditionally been the backbone of the economy. Who stands to lose According to the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), the heaviest losses will be to Dominica and St. Vincent for bananas, Guyana for sugar, and Belize for both bananas and sugar. But the repercussions will be felt far and wide. Sugar generates 24 % of the GDP in Swaziland. In Fiji, 42 % of the value of agriculture and 30 % of processing comes from sugarcane production. The ACP Sugar Group has estimated that price cuts will lead to annual losses of 400 million, as well as massive unemployment, rural instability and urban migration. One estimate predicts that banana sector employment in the four banana-producing countries of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) will fall by 84 %. Sensing that change was inevitable, some ACP countries have already begun to distance themselves from their time-honoured crops. St. Kitts shut its state-owned sugar industry in July 2005 and the sugar railway now carries tourists. Trinidad closed its state-owned sugar company in 2003. But a gulf divides the two groups of ACP countries affected by the new trade rules those, like Mauritius, which have a stable and sound development base, and others, like Dominica, who put all their hopes in a single commodity. The European Commission has pledged an aid package worth 40 million for 2006, and its draft Action Plan of June 2005 indicated that an annual 100 million may be available to support restructuring and diversification up until 2013. Breaking the dependence upon traditional primary commodities is not easy. But with the right help and support, it can be done, as some ACP producers are already proving with new high value products such as ginger, garlic and chilli peppers, added value items such as sauces and chutneys, and organic and fair trade products. Also of interest is the small but growing niche market for exotic tropical fruits, such as passion fruit, lychees and durian. Sugaring the pill Sugar-related products also offer potential for ACP producers planning to continue sugar production. A study commissioned by the Dutch government on bio-ethanol made from sugar cane found that this could prove an export option for producers hit by falling prices. Other studies noted that co-generation of electricity from bagasse is a viable prospect for Guyana and Swaziland. In addition to a well-established sugarcane by-product sector, Mauritius already has a co-generation sector with 10 power plants producing more than 40 % of the island s energy. Said Hans van Klink at the Dutch Sustainable Development Group, When you look to the sugar chain there is much more to optimise than just sugar: you can use material for energy production and extract other useful products, creating added value. Many small-scale Caribbean banana producers have already left the export market. In Jamaica, farmers are producing fruit for the tourist market and for banana chips. In St. Lucia, an Agricultural Diversification Programme is expanding the non-traditional crop sector, with good growth seen in mango, hot pepper and avocado production. Many producers are moving into supplying fresh vegetables and flowers for hotels and cruise ships. Mauritius enjoys healthier prospects than most as it has used sugar revenues to fund diversification into textiles, tourism and finance. It is helped by a well-developed infrastructure and a dynamic private sector. Diversification into non-sugar agricultural sectors has been less successful, with constraints including limited fertile land resources and planting material, though biotechnology is helping to counter this handicap. In Kenya, farmers helped by the Community Rehabilitation and Environmental Programme (CREP) are finding it more profitable to abandon sugarcane production and grow food. Fiji has moved into the production of flowers and exotic fruits and farmers are exporting traditional food crops to the Indo-Fijian communities in Australia and New Zealand. Products targeted for diversification include breadfruit, jack fruit, okra, indigenous nuts, industrial hemp and stevia. In Papua New Guinea, Ramu Sugar Ltd is successfully diversifying into beef cattle, oil palm and peanuts. The use of technology can also provide a competitive edge. Erica s Country-Style in St. Vincent uses the internet to sell pepper sauces and food snacks to US markets. Innovative technologies for in vitro micropropagation of ginger are helping Jamaican producers develop a range of products including essential oils, pesticidal and medicinal preparations. Forest product exports offer some potential, especially for Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. To what extent these new products can help maintain the broader economic and social benefits traditionally derived from the sugar sector remains to be seen. Agriculture and beyond There is also scope for diversification outside agriculture. A World Bank report on the Caribbean suggests new product areas such as adventure tourism and the creation of upscale resorts. Other potential growth sectors include health services, information and communication technology and offshore education. Producers will need technical support as well as funding if they are to make the transition. In many ACP countries, domestic markets are small, but servicing the larger regional markets involves improved methods of preservation and packaging. Regional organisations could do much to help by promoting diversification where there are economies of scale, through regional research programmes and marketing organisations. There is no time to be lost. Diversification must begin before a shift in prices occurs, urges the Commonwealth Secretariat, which has put forward proposals for a Special Fund for Diversification. Easier said than done. Noting the notorious delays involved in accessing EU funds, the European Research Office observes that ACP negotiators would do well to push for the early, timely and effective delivery of assistance to national restructuring and/or diversification programmes.

This paper examines in detail the prospects and challenges for trade expansion in the two most prominent arrangements in eastern and southern Africa: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). It finds that possibilities of growth in intraregional trade may be limited, but that the two arrangements offer opportunities for member countries to gain policy credibility for trade reforms and tariff liberalization and to address structural weaknesses. In this regard, the negotiation of the Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union can also have a significant impact.
