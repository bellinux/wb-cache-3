5000|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{can also}} be explained by using the high- and low-context culture theory. By mapping the performance on facial expression and the cultural backgrounds of the <b>participants,</b> <b>we</b> can tell that more exaggerating expressions of emotion tend to correlate with relatively lower-context culture (Western Caucasian culture), while subtler facial expressions belong to higher-context culture (East Asian culture). This is because, in a low-context cultural environment, people tend to express themselves as explicit as possible, thus exaggerating facial expression becomes a complementary tool for further elaboration of the speaker’s meaning by conveying speaker’s emotion vividly and effectively avoid misunderstanding.|$|E

[...] "Second Wind Phenomenon" [...] is a mature musical oeuvre that {{combines}} elements of Soundtrack, Science-Fiction, Psychedelia, IDM, Drill'n'Bass and Radioplays. Being a real concept-album, inspired a lot by the way Bands like Godley & Creme, The Legendary Pink Dots or Coil (band) produced their albums, it is very divers and eclectical while slightly touching all kind of musical styles. The production defines the limits of what is possible in modern music-production as up to date. It features binaural microphoning-techniques {{and a lot of}} unusual vocal production. Along the <b>participants</b> <b>we</b> find the names of Holger Czukay (Can), Igor Sirodzha, Coloma, twila.too and Carla Subito (Fetisch Park).

50|$|If {{both of the}} {{independent}} variables are categorical variables, we can analyze the results of the regression for one independent variable at a specific level of the other independent variable. For example, suppose that both A and B are single dummy coded (0,1) variables, and that A represents ethnicity (0 = European Americans, 1 = East Asians) and B represents the condition in the study (0 = control, 1 = experimental). Then the interaction effect shows whether the effect of condition on the dependent variable Y is different for European Americans and East Asians and whether the effect of ethnic status is different for the two conditions. The coefficient of A shows the ethnicity effect on Y for the control condition, while the coefficient of B shows the effect of imposing the experimental condition for European American participants. To probe if there is any significant difference between European Americans and East Asians in the experimental condition, we can simply run the analysis with the condition variable reverse-coded (0 = experimental, 1 = control), so that the coefficient for ethnicity represents the ethnicity effect on Y in the experimental condition. In a similar vein, if we want to see whether the treatment has an effect for East Asian <b>participants,</b> <b>we</b> can reverse code the ethnicity variable (0 = East Asians, 1 = European Americans).|$|E
