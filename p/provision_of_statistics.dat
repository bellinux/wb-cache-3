40|$|The recent Government {{paper on}} the Central Statistics Office and the {{accompanying}} report of the Statistical Council are to be welcomed. This is partly because their specific proposals {{would lead to a}} more efficient system of providing official statistics. Moreover, the very publication of these papers, together with the Statistical Users 2 ̆ 7 Seminar of June 1984, have meant that the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> has come alive as a policy issue. One hopes that this symposium can give a further impetus to this policy debate. This Society is a particularly appropriate host for this set of contributions, as it is the only regular forum which brings together statisticians, social scientists and Government officials. For too long, the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> has been seen as either something which was of little importance or else the concern {{of a small group of}} "experts". It is tempting to decry such notions by assertion. There is, however, a danger that at a Society such as this, the importance of statistics will be taken as self-evident. This is understandable. After all, the national income accounts have been described as the staff of life for the macro-economist, and similar things could be said about the links which bind policy analysis and statistics provision in so many areas. At an even broader level, information has been described as the currency of democracy. But in the harsh world which we are facing, the importance of statistics will not be taken as axiomatic. This is especially the case in view of the many competing claims for public expenditure. Hence, this paper begins with the links between statistics provision, policy making and research. It goes on to point out a number of ways in which the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> falls short of potential. Some key constraints on the achievement of this potential are briefly enumerated. Finally, a number of matters which might usefully be considered by the new National Statistics Board are discussed...|$|E

40|$|To {{address the}} growing {{diversity}} of ability and {{skills of the}} student intake the University of Sheffield has set up the Maths and Statistics Help Centre to provide extra-curricular support to help students {{make the transition to}} Higher Education. The provision of maths support has been around since the early 90 ’s and has developed into a sophisticated and valued means of addressing mathematical diversity. In contrast statistics support is new in its development and is being seen as a subject in its own right rather than as part of mathematics. This paper will provide the university’s attempt at enhancing statistics support. First it will review current <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> support and consider feedback received, secondly it will draw up a plan for developing the support to better fit the need.

40|$|Since opening {{one hundred}} years ago in 1894, an {{important}} function carried out by the Department of Minerals and Energy has been the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> on the mineral and petroleum industry. These statistics continue {{to play an important role}} in the mining industry. They are used by companies and the Government to assist in management and investment decisions. I am pleased to present the 1993 - 94 Mineral and Petroleum Statistics Digest, containing the most comprehensive statistical information available on the Western Australian mining industry. The resource industry has always been important to the economic health of Western Australia. Moreover, with continued concern over Australia’s international trade balance, Western Australia’s mineral and petroleum exports play an essential role in improving the current account deficit. It is timely, therefore, that this edition of the Digest includes for the first time information on export destinations. The statistics on mineral and petroleum exports were assembled by the Department with assistance from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and resource companies. I would like to thank these organisations for their help as it would be impossible to present such a comprehensive publication without their support. Previous surveys of our readers have found that this publication is generally well regarded and useful. We want to ensure that this remains the case and hence this edition includes a survey form canvassing your views. I would appreciate it if you could make suggestions and comments on the form and return it to the Department. This will enable us to provide an improved service to all of our customers...|$|E
40|$|Registries of {{occupational}} diseases in various European countries differ considerably in criteria for notification and recognition, statistical data provided {{and the legal}} and social security context. Therefore, figures on occupational diseases are not comparable between countries and are often regarded as not reliable even within a country. Still, registries {{of occupational}} diseases are an important source for policy on occupational safety and health. To evaluate registries of occupational diseases in European (EU) countries {{for their ability to}} provide appropriate information for preventive policy. Contact persons of national registries for occupational diseases in six countries were sent a questionnaire on the objectives of their registry and on the quality of monitoring time trends and alerting to new risks. An auditor then visited each contact person, discussed the completed questionnaire and sent a draft audit report to the contact person for verification. Two reviewers then established a quality score based on the verified audit report. The results of the audit were sent to each contact person, who was asked to evaluate the usefulness of the audit instrument for future quality improvement of the registry. The objectives of the registries assessed in the six countries were compensation, <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics,</b> prevention and research. The average quality was rated 3. 2 (SD 2. 2) out of 10 for monitoring occupational diseases and 5. 3 (SD 1. 4) out of 10 for alerting to new risks. The main reasons for the low scores were inadequate education and training of physicians and poor participation of notifying physicians. Three of the six contact persons (50 %) agreed that the audit could actually contribute to future quality improvement of the registry in relation to prevention. Registries in EU countries do not adequately monitor existing occupational diseases or adequately alert to newly occurring occupational diseases.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Death Records dataset of Scotland contains administrative records about mortality events occurred in Scotland since 1974. Typically, information that is collected on the registration form includes name and address, date and cause of death, duration of illness {{as well as the}} occupation of the deceased. The cause of death is recorded on a medical certificate and must be taken at the time of registration. Arrangements for the registration of a stillbirth follow roughly the same process. All deaths in Scotland must be registered within eight days by a Local Registrar. Then, every death registered is entered by a Local Registrar onto the Forward Electronic Register (FER) system. This is a live computer system linked to National Records of Scotland. The information is then transferred to the National Records of Scotland Vital Events statistical database where quality checks are carried out on each record. The paper records are sent by Local Registrars to National Records of Scotland (NRS) in January of each year. The registration of a death in Scotland is controlled by the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965. The Act controls the registration system of births, deaths and marriages in Scotland, including the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> to Scottish Ministers and the power to the Registrar General authority to correct errors in entries. Information on Scottish deaths has been recorded since 1855 when it became compulsory. However, information in the National Records of Scotland database is available from 1974 onwards. All Vital Events which occur in Scotland should be registered in Scotland, even if the people involved are residents of other countries. Registrations do not include Scottish residents who have died abroad. Information on deaths in England and Wales is recorded by the Office for National Statistics. In Northern Ireland it is recorded by the Department for Finance and Personnel. The classification of the underlying cause of death is based on the information collected on the death certificate together with any additional information provided by other official sources. The cause of death codes may change if additional information is provided by a GP, Consultant or Procurators Fiscal. For deaths registered from 1 January 2000, the causes of death have been coded in accordance with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD- 10). Deaths which were registered in 1999 were coded using both ICD- 9 and ICD- 10, in order to obtain an indication of the effect on the figures of the change in the classification. The complexity of the ICD- 10 rules can result, in some cases, in the underlying cause of death coded by National Records of Scotland differing from that which was recorded on the original death certificate. The National Records of Scotland Death Records data is of a high standard and is the most reliable death dataset available in Scotland. Automatic quality checks are carried out by the National Records of Scotland computer system at the point of entry by the Local Registrar and further checks are then carried out by staff once the information has been passed into the National Records of Scotland Vital Events statistical database. Research Usage and Linkage The National Records of Scotland Death Records data are used in combination with other Vital Events statistics to produce a wide variety of health statistics and research and answer parliamentary questions. For example the figures contribute to debate and the development of policy on issues such as ‘fuel poverty’ and the health of the elderly, winter fuel payments, and programmes for seasonal flu vaccination, central heating installation and home insulation. The Scottish Government use the data for the development of health related policy including alcohol and drug related deaths and also suicides. It is also used to monitor their National Indicators, specifically to reduce mortality from coronary heart disease among the under 75 s in deprived areas and to target population growth. It is also used to estimate life expectancy in order to assess the scale of inequalities in health between different population sub-groups, and how Scotland compares with other countries. The Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland also widely use the data for health related research including cancer mortality, drug and alcohol misuse and also for the calculation of standardised mortality ratios for individual hospitals and the monitoring of unusual increases or patterns in deaths. In particular, the Death Records data are part of the ISD Scottish Morbidity Database, which links together NHS Scotland’s inpatient, mental health and cancer registry datasets with the NRS Death Records. Furthermore, NRS Stillbirth and infant death records are also part of NHS Scotland’s Maternity and Neonatal Linked Database. This database contains obstetric histories of mothers giving birth since 1981. National Records of Scotland Death Registration data are also used as part of the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS). This is a large-scale linkage study which has been created using data from a range of government statistical administrative sources. The SLS website provides a high quality longitudinal research dataset {{that can be used to}} provide an insight into the health and social status of the Scottish population and how it changes over time. In theory the National Records of Scotland Death Records can be linked to other datasets with common identifiable fields such as name, address and postcode. </div...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Birth Registration dataset for Scotland contains administrative records about birth events occurred in Scotland since 1855, while electronic individual records are available from 1974 onwards. Typically, the information collected through the registration form includes the date, time and place of birth, child’s name and sex, mother’s full name, place of residence, occupation, and details of the father depending on the marital status. Other information is collected for statistical information and this includes the mother’s previous children and her birth details as well as additional details about the father. A father’s name {{can be added to}} the register at any time after the birth. The registration of births in Scotland is controlled by the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965. The Act controls the registration system of births, deaths and marriages in Scotland, including the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> to Scottish Ministers and the power to the Registrar General authority to correct errors in entries. All births in Scotland must be registered within 21 days by a Local Registrar. This applies even if the baby is stillborn or only lives for a short time. The doctor or midwife attending the delivery must issue a medical certificate of stillbirth and this certificate is used to register the birth. &# 160; The paper records are sent by Local Registrars to National Records of Scotland in January of each year. However, birth registrations recorded by Local Registrars are also linked by a computer system and so National Records of Scotland always has a ‘live’ and up to date system of birth registrations in Scotland. In particular, every birth registered is entered by a Local Registrar onto the Forward Electronic Register (FER) system. This is a live computer system linked to National Records of Scotland. The information is then transferred to the National Records of Scotland Vital Events statistical database where quality checks are carried out on each record. The National Records of Scotland Birth Registration data is of a high standard. Automatic quality checks are carried out by the National Records of Scotland computer system at the point of entry by the Local Registrar and further checks are then carried out by staff once the information has been passed into the National Records of Scotland Vital Events statistical database. Information on births in England and Wales is recorded by the Office for National Statistics. In Northern Ireland it is recorded by the Department for Finance and Personnel. Birth registration records for England & Wales and/or Northern Ireland may not always be on exactly the same basis as National Records of Scotland’s figures for Scotland as there can be differences in the coverage of what at first sight appear to be the same statistics. For the purpose of producing statistics of home births from the information which is held in National Records of Scotland’s database, the following definition should exclude almost all the births which occur elsewhere&# 58; the final character of the ‘institution’ code is ‘N’ (i. e., the birth did not take place in an institution); the postcode of the mother’s usual residence {{is the same as the}} postcode of the place of birth (in order to exclude births which took place in, say, the house of another family member); and the mother’s country of residence is Scotland (this condition is necessary because, for mothers who are not resident in Scotland, the value in the National Records of Scotland statistical database’s field for the postcode of the mother’s usual residence may actually be the postcode of the place of birth. This is done so that, when National Records of Scotland produces statistics for areas within Scotland, it counts births to mothers who are not resident in Scotland on the basis of where the births occurred. National Records of Scotland produces its statistics of births to mothers who are not resident in Scotland by using the database’s separate code for mother’s country of residence). Note that this definition may not produce absolutely accurate figures for home births. It will include any cases where a mother gave birth in another home within the same postcode, and exclude cases where a woman chose (or had) to give birth in someone else’s home that was in a different postcode. All the Vital Events statistics of births, stillbirths, marriages, civil partnerships and deaths on the National Records of Scotland website are based on the date of registration of the event and not the date on which the event occurred. For example, a birth on 31 December 2010 which was registered on 5 January 2011 would be included in the 2011 figures (because the statistics are the numbers of events registered in the specified period). All Vital Events which occur in Scotland should be registered in Scotland, even if the people involved are residents of other countries. For example, if an American tourist dies in Scotland, the death should be registered in Scotland. Research Usage and Linkage The National Records of Scotland Birth Registration data are used in combination with other Vital Events statistics to produce a wide variety of statistics and research and answer parliamentary questions. This includes estimating the size of the population to meet population growth targets. National Records of Scotland Birth Registration data are also used as part of the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS). This is a large-scale linkage study which has been created using data from a range of government statistical administrative sources. This high quality longitudinal research dataset can be used to provide an insight into the health and social status of the Scottish population and how it changes over time. The National Records of Scotland Birth Registration records have been linked to other many studies and research. For example the data is part of the Millennium Cohort Study, a 1 % sample of census records and vital events data to help examine important social health and demographic issues. The Birth Registration data are also used by NHS Scotland for a wide variety of research including fertility rates and teenage pregnancies. NRS birth records are in fact part of NHS Scotland’s Maternity and Neonatal Linked Database, which contains obstetric histories of mothers giving birth since 1981. &# 160; In theory the National Records of Scotland Birth Registration records can be linked to other datasets with common identifiable fields such as name, address and postcode. </div...|$|E

40|$|Thanks to the President and Council of the Malta Hotels & Restaurants Association for trusting me {{with the}} {{execution}} of this report to Natalie Ann Flynn, EU Consultant for the MHRA, for her research support in all stages of the report and its preparation for publication; to Donald Pace Bonello, MHRA Chief Executive and to Dolores Brincat, MHRA Secretary for assisting in administering the survey amongst MHRA members, collecting responses and preparing this report for printing; and to the Employment & Training Corporation for the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> relevant <b>statistics.</b> The Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association (MHRA) is publishing {{a report on the}} implications of the social policy acquis communautaire (Chapter 13) of the European Union on its members. The objectives of such an exercise are to provide a practical guide to MHRA members as to the real implications of conforming to this chapter of the acquis; to identify internal differences, if any, within the MHRA membership with respect to the challenges of EU accession posed by this chapter; and to research, and help facilitate, the preparedness of MHRA members on whatever measures they may need to address with regards to the above. This report was commissioned to Dr Godfrey Baldacchino. N/...|$|R

40|$|The Emerging Risks Unit (EMRISK) was {{requested}} by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to develop a system for the routine monitoring of data from the Rapid Alert System on Food and Feed (RASFF), with the main objective of detecting potentially relevant patterns of notifications and a timely reporting. The RASFF-Database, maintained by the European Commission (EC), includes detailed information on food safety events notified {{by the members of}} the RASFF-network. EMRISK has developed a system that enables the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> up-to-date <b>statistics</b> (e. g. frequency tables and graphs) from the RASFF-Database. The core system is based on IT applications to produce alerts of new or re-emerging hazards and ad hoc reports. The IT tools developed are used by EMRISK for its monitoring activities and to provide a fast response to specific requests received from EFSA‟s scientific Units. The evaluation of the RASFF-Database as a potential source of information for the identification of emerging risks indicates that this source of information, largely based on surveillance and inspection programs driven by the existing legislation, can be useful mainly for the identification of re-emerging hazards. Some of the tools developed by EMRISK in this system (e. g. the excel pivot-tool for ad hoc reports) could be useful not only for EFSA, but also for the EC and the Member States to exploit the data notified withi...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Record linkage (RL) {{has become}} {{increasingly}} useful in health care administration, demographic studies, <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> health <b>statistics</b> and medical research. Linkage failure may occur when databases are affected by missing or inaccurate information. In particular, if the subsets {{of those who are}} not linked are not representative of the original population, the results obtained from linked data may be biased. This paper discusses the impact of incomplete RL on survival analysis. METHODS: In our study we assess by simulations the potential impact of such bias, that we will refer to as RL, on the effect of the covariates in the Cox regression model. We also evaluate the RL bias introduced by an incomplete linkage procedure on the analysis of survival in a cohort of patients with breast cancer. RESULTS: Our simulation study shows that the relative bias of the factors, which the linking probability depends on, reaches the threshold of 20 %, and is never less than 5 %. The bias observed in the simulation for a comparable scenario is consistent with the actual one estimated from the breast cancer records. CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete RL is rarely explicitly taken into account in the models for survival analysis. This study indicates that such a practice is potentially leading to inefficient and biased results, in particular in presence of medium or small sample sizes...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} dissertation is to explore the potential of a writing group to encourage post graduate students and academic members of staff to publish. Writing for publication is identified as a desirable, if not essential, element of personal and organisational development. A triangulated survey is presented based on the interpretivist research paradigm. The methods used included a self administered questionnaire which provided quantitative and qualitative data. The design of this instrument was informed {{by the use of}} focus groups. In addition, five semi-structured interviews were conducted. Analysis for the quantitative element of the study was based on the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> descriptive <b>statistics</b> and non-parametric comparisons. Microanalysis and axial coding as described by Strauss & Corbin (1998) were applied to qualitative data sources, in order to identify data categories and their associated properties. Triangulation was based on the notion of data completeness as opposed to data confirmation. The results of the study show that writing groups have a significant potential to encourage those interested in writing for publication. However, the concepts of motivation and time {{have a major impact on}} those expressing an interest in becoming involved in writing for publication. It is therefore concluded that writing groups do not represent a panacea, but rather should be implemented as one of many support strategies used...|$|R
