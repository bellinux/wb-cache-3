5000|$|A bucksaw is a {{crosscut}} saw: it {{is designed}} to cut across the grain. The width of the blade is constant from the teeth to the back.

50|$|Chair skills/function: Because of {{extensive}} proximal shoulder weakness {{and lack of}} triceps function, there is a forward head bob present while pushing. Because {{of a lack of}} triceps strength, there is pulling on the back part of the wheel for the <b>push</b> <b>stroke</b> using biceps by bending the elbows; elbows are also out to the side when pushing. This is called an “unopposed biceps push”. Because of wrist extensor weakness and lack of other wrist and hand function, there may be use of the forearm on the wheel for starts, turns and stops.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese saw or nokogiri (...) {{is a type}} of saw used in {{woodworking}} and Japanese carpentry {{that cuts}} on the pull stroke, unlike most European saws that cut on the <b>push</b> <b>stroke.</b> Japanese saws are the best known pull saws, but they are also used in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Nepal. Among European saws, both coping saws for woodworking and jewelers saws for metal working also cut on the pull stroke like Japanese saws. Cutting on the pull stroke is claimed to cut more efficiently and leave a narrower cut width (...) [...] On the other hand, a pull stroke does not easily permit putting ones body weight behind a stroke. This can be readily solved by using a vise or clamping. Another disadvantage, due to the arrangement and form of the teeth , is that Japanese saws do not work as well on hardwoods as European saws do. Japanese saws were originally intended for comparatively soft woods like cypress and pine whereas European saws were intended for hard woods like oak and maple.|$|E

5000|$|Japanese saw (nokogiri 鋸), which cuts on {{the pull}} stroke, {{rather than the}} European style <b>push</b> <b>stroke.</b> This allows the blades to be quite thin in {{comparison}} to the Western saw. There are two main kinds of cutting teeth on Japanese saws: rip (yoko noko-giri)and crosscut (tate-noko-giri). The rip and crosscut are combined in one blade, known as a ryoba (lit. [...] "dual edge":; 両刃). The rip and crosscut patterns are also made in single-edged saws, kataha nokogiri 片刃, both with stiffening back pieces and without. The stiff-backed saws, known as douzuki　(lit. [...] "with guide"; 導付き) are typically used in cutting fine joinery. There are many other types of Japanese saws as well: osae-biki 押さえ引き鋸 (lit. [...] "press-cut saw"), used for flush-cutting pegs to a surface without marring the surface. The saw teeth have no set to one or both sides to accomplish this feat. There is the azebiki (lit. ridge saw; 畔挽き), which has cutting both rip and crosscut teeth, and is short and rounded in profile. It is used for sawing in confined areas and starting cuts in the middle of surfaces. There are many other types and sub-types of saw. Most saws sold in the West are mass-produced items with induction-hardened teeth and relatively cheap replaceable blades. The handmade forged saws are very laborious to make and involve more manufacturing steps in the forging to complete than planes or chisels.|$|E
50|$|The upright {{forehand}} hitting stroke, {{which is}} commonly used when the ball {{is close to the}} feet, will seldom be made with the handle in the same plane as the ball, unless the ball is to the immediate right of the player i.e. beside or alongside his feet. (Stick shown on far right of illustration)—which is generally the case when the ball is being hit directly to the front or from left to right—with a bowed stick even this vertical handle position will present an angled head to the ball. The further away {{to the front of the}} player the ball is the greater will be the head angle presented to the ball. To deal with the problem of head presentation some players use a low 'roundhouse' style of hitting, rather than an upright style and may also employ sweep-hits or slap-hitting of the ball (the difference being the positioning of the hands, sweep hits are generally made with the hands together at the top of the stick and with the base of the stick head in contact with the ground, while slap-hits are usually made with the hands in the more spread dribbling grip and the stick head is not necessarily in contact with the ground, but it may be), either sweep or slap type strokes give greater control over the angle of the face of the stick as it makes contact with the ball and are often the preferred strokes when passing the ball over longer distances (over shorter distances—less than 20 m—a <b>push</b> <b>stroke</b> is often preferred).|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to use instantaneous net drag-force profiles to understand front-crawl and backstroke swimming technique. Twenty-nine elite front-crawl and 19 elite backstroke swimmers (FINA point ranking 924. 5 ± 69. 0) were recruited. From the net drag-force profile the Minimum and Maximum net force occurred during the insweep phase and during the upsweep phase of the front-crawl stroke, respectively. When swimming backstroke the minimum and maximum net drag-forces occurred during the pull phase and <b>push</b> <b>stroke</b> phases, respectively. When turning their head to breath the swimmers increased the net drag-force by 22 %, which could be detrimental to swimming performance. When comparing the variables of swimming speed and the range of force fluctuations participants who exhibited smaller intra-stroke force changes produced faster swimming speeds. This practical knowledge can assist coach, sports scientist or exercise professional in providing stroke correction during swimming...|$|E
50|$|Saws were {{at first}} {{serrated}} {{materials such as}} flint, obsidian, sea shells and shark teeth.In ancient Egypt, open (unframed) saws made of copper are documented {{as early as the}} Early Dynastic Period, circa 3,100-2,686 BC. Many copper saws were found in tomb No. 3471 dating to the reign of Djer in the 31st century BC. Saws have been used for cutting a variety of materials, including people (see Death by sawing). Models of saws have been found in many contexts throughout Egyptian history. Particularly useful are tomb wall illustrations of carpenters at work that show sizes and the use of different types. Egyptian saws were at first serrated, hardened copper which cut on both pull and <b>push</b> <b>strokes.</b> As the saw developed, teeth were raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side, rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set. Saws were also made of bronze and later iron. In the Iron Age, frame saws were developed holding the thin blades in tension. The earliest known sawmill is the Roman Hierapolis sawmill from the third century AD and was for sawing stone.|$|R
5000|$|The main methods {{by which}} the ball is moved around the field by players are a) passing b) pushing the ball and running with it {{controlled}} to the front or right {{of the body and}} c) [...] "dribbling"; where the player controls the ball with the stick and moves in various directions with it to elude opponents. To make a pass the ball may be propelled with a <b>pushing</b> <b>stroke,</b> where the player uses their wrists to push the stick head through the ball while the stick head is in contact with it; the [...] "flick" [...] or [...] "scoop", similar to the push but with an additional arm and leg and rotational actions to lift the ball off the ground; and the [...] "hit", where a swing at ball is taken and contact with it is often made very forcefully, causing the ball to be propelled at velocities in excess of 70 mph. In order to produce a powerful hit, usually for travel over long distances or shooting at the goal, the stick is raised higher and swung with maximum power at the ball, a stroke sometimes known as a [...] "drive".|$|R
50|$|When punting, as in Oxford and Cambridge, the quanter stands {{stationary}} at {{the back}} (Oxford and Cambridge disagree on which is the rear end: decked in Cambridge and undecked in Oxford) and slides the quant into the water at an angle forwards. As the punt glides forwards the loosely held quant becomes increasingly vertical. When the quant is just past the vertical, i.e. sloping downwards {{from front to back}} of the punt, the quanter pushes on the quant to propel the punt forwards. At the end of the <b>pushing</b> <b>stroke</b> the quant is twisted with a downward roll of the wrists to break it free from the bottom, and then retrieved by being thrown forwards hand-over-hand in readiness for the next stroke. A rhythmic and smooth style is usually considered to be 'good form'. Disaster may strike if the quanter loses grip on the quant while attempting to extract it from the bottom, and the quant is left 'stuck in the mud' at an increasing distance behind the punt. This is not 'good form'.It is not unknown, when the quant sticks in the mud, for an inexperienced quanter to choose to hold onto the quant rather than letting go, with the result that the quanter is left dangling {{from the end of the}} quant, and subsides slowly into the water. This, too, is considered not good form.|$|R

30|$|To {{incorporate}} {{the principles of}} evidence-based practice to improve classification of trunk impairment, {{an exploration of the}} available literature was deemed necessary. Although classification systems for other paralympic sports, including wheelchair basketball, Nordic skiing and athletics, examine trunk impairment, these systems are largely based on expert opinion, similar to the classification system for wheelchair rugby [7 - 9]. Previous research indicates trunk muscle strength, trunk coordination and trunk range of movement determine: a) trunk position which impacts on force application on the hand rims, b) trunk stability which decreases paradoxical movements, making arm movements and force application more effective and c) trunk movement which determines the range of the push rim {{that can be used in}} each <b>push</b> <b>stroke.</b> Therefore, trunk impairment may impact significantly on wheelchair propulsion, especially in high resistance wheeling such as accelerating from standstill [10, 11]. However, some significant activities determining wheelchair sport performance were not assessed (e.g. reach, turning and maintaining balance after perturbation). Furthermore, the impact of impairment on performance in wheelchair sports can be modified by equipment [12]. Athletes in wheelchair court sports always perform using equipment. The minimum equipment is a sports wheelchair that is usually custom made. In addition, many athletes use belts and straps to improve force generation. Athletes who have trunk impairment also use straps to increase stability. The use of equipment is not considered in determining the sports class according to the IPC classification code [4]. Therefore, to support evidence-based classification, the impact of equipment should be treated as a covariate.|$|E

40|$|Many {{authors have}} {{proposed}} that sprint and distance front crawl swimmers differ in their stroke characteristics, however little three-dimensional quantitative data is provided to support these assumptions. It is currently unknown whether sprint and distance swimmers exhibit distinct stroke characteristics when swimming at the same pace. There were two main purposes of this study: 1) {{to determine whether there}} are distinct kinematic and kinetic differences between sprint and distance front crawl swimmers, and 2) to investigate whether stroke characteristics of front crawl swimmers, in terms of kinematic and kinetic variables change with swimming speed. Fifteen male national/international front crawl swimmers (17. 87 +/- 2. 33 yrs; 73. 87 +/- 8. 72 kg; 183. 02 +/- 6. 84 cm) volunteered to participate in this study. This sample was composed of seven sprint (SG) and eight distance (DG) swimmers. Each testing session required swimmers to perform four 25 m sprints and one 400 m max effort (front crawl), with no pacing strategy, in a randomised order. Each trial was performed through a 6. 75 m 3 calibrated space and recorded by six gen-locked JVC KY 32 CCD cameras (4 below and 2 above water) sampling at a frequency of 50 fields per second. All trials were processed using ‘APAS’ software to obtain 3 D coordinate data. Anthropometric measures were quantified using the elliptical zone method. Both data sets were entered into a bespoke MATLAB program which output: average swim velocity (Vav), stroke length (SL), stroke frequency (SF), stroke index (SI), vertical and lateral displacement for each segment, shoulder and hip roll angle, and elbow joint angle variables (1 st back, shoulder x, end back, hand exit and recovery elbow angle). Stroke phase (entry, pull, push and recovery) durations (%) were quantified at instants corresponding to percentiles of the stroke cycle. Centre of mass position data were obtained from the digitised 3 D data using a 14 segment rigid link body model in conjunction with the body segment parameter data obtained by the elliptical zone method. Component whole body velocity (VCOMHor), acceleration (accCOM) and net force (forceCOM) were derived from the centre of mass position data. Variables were statistically analysed in SPSS v. 14. 0, using a General Linear Model, repeated measures analysis of variance. The results indicated that the groups differed (p< 0. 05) with respect to the duration of the pull phase, the occurrence of max left and right shoulder roll and the temporal sequencing of the shoulders and hips rolling at both sprint and distance pace. Other variables approached significance between the groups, particularly when distance swimming, such as the duration of the push phase (p= 0. 082), the Vav (p= 0. 071) and average VCOMHor (p= 0. 071). The stroke kinematic variables that changed between paces (p< 0. 05) were the duration of the entry, pull, push, hand exit and recovery phases; the elbow angle at the end back position and the push phase range; total shoulder and hip roll; the sum average vertical displacement of the foot; the time to max vertical and lateral displacement of the finger; the time at max right elbow extension; the average VCOMHor, Min VCOMHor and Max VCOMHor. The stroke kinetic variables that changed between paces (p< 0. 05) were the Min accCOM, Max accCOM, range of accCOM, min forceCOM and max forceCOM. Other variables approached significance between the paces such as the entry elbow angle (p= 0. 084), the max right elbow extension (p= 0. 056), the finger lateral range (p= 0. 067) and the time to max accCOM (p= 0. 079). The SG displayed shorter durations of the pull and push phases than the DG for both paces, which was linked to the faster horizontal velocity and/or vertical acceleration of the hand. The sequencing order of the shoulders and hips changed between groups and paces, which was speculated to be controlled by the magnitude of the leg-kick. The main changes between paces were the greater magnitude of elbow angle at both the end back position and the push phase range, which contributed to the adjustment of kinetic variables. SL, SF, SI, Vav and the duration of the all the stroke phases changed between sprint and distance pace {{in order to meet the}} physiological requirements of the race distance. The prolonged duration of the entry phase, when distance swimming, resulted in a delayed attainment of the catch position and maximum stroke depth. Moreover, the magnitude of shoulder and hip roll increased at distance compared to sprint pace, which in turn influenced the magnitude of average vertical and range of lateral displacement of the finger between paces. In conclusion, contrary to the literature, SG and DG differed only with respect to the duration of the pull and <b>push</b> <b>stroke</b> phases and the sequencing order of the shoulders and hips. All swimmers adjust the majority of kinematic and kinetic variables depending on the swim pace in order to optimise performance for that race distance.

Preliminary {{outcomes}} of the SmartWheel Users' Group database: a proposed framework for clinicians to objectively evaluate manual wheelchair propulsion. Objectives: To describe a standard clinical protocol for the objective assessment of manual wheelchair propulsion; to establish preliminary values for temporal and kinetic parameters derived from the protocol; and to develop graphical references and a proposed application process for use by clinicians. Design: Case series. Setting: Six research institutions that collect kinetic wheelchair propulsion data and contribute that data to an international data pool. Participants: Subjects {{with spinal cord injury}} (N= 128). Interventions: Subjects propelled a wheelchair from a stationary position to a self-selected velocity across a hard tile surface, a low pile carpet, and up an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant ramp. Unilateral kinetic data were obtained from subjects using a force and moment sensing pushrim. Main Outcome Measures: Differences in self-selected velocity, peak resultant force, <b>push</b> frequency, and <b>stroke</b> length across all surfaces, relationship between (1) weight-normalized peak resultant force and self-selected velocity and (2) push frequency and self-selected velocity. Results: Graphical references were generated for potential clinical use based on the relation between body weight-normalized peak resultant force, push frequency, and velocity. Self-selected velocity decreased (ramp carpet > tile), and <b>push</b> frequency and <b>stroke</b> length remained unchanged when compared across the different surfaces. Weight-normalized peak resultant force {{was a significant predictor of}} velocity on tile and ramp. Push frequency was a significant predictor of velocity on tile, carpet, and ramp.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Postural control aims {{to build}} up and align the body {{orientation}} (posture) and stabilize body segments. The existence of two separate mechanisms, one for the control of body orientation with respect to gravity and one for its stabilisation, is an emerging concept that allows {{a better understanding of}} postural disorders, including <b>pushing,</b> after <b>stroke.</b> Objectives. - Literature review concerning pushing, one of the most puzzling postural behaviours after stroke. METHODS: Critical review of papers indexed in Medline and book chapters dealing with pushing. RESULTS: There is no agreement about the definition of pushing: some authors consider that pushers push himself toward the paretic side using the healthy arm or leg; others consider that pushers lean (list) toward the side opposite the lesion and resist any attempt to become more upright. Surprisingly, the push itself has never been measured. Some ordinal scales have been recently proposed, but their psychometric properties have not been analysed. These methodological insufficiencies explain in part the disagreements about frequency (from 5 % to 50 % of patients with stroke) and cause(s) of pushing. CONCLUSION: Pushing may be the most dramatic clinical manifestations of an extreme bias {{in the construction of the}} biological vertical. We argue for a better assessment of vertical perception/representation after stroke involving the three modalities of the biological (subjective) vertical: the visual vertical, the haptic or tactile vertical, and especially the postural vertical...|$|R
