In the case of parts of the interviewees, the collection of the posture caused displeasure.|$|E

Although Democrats have noticed the problem for at least fifteen years, they never succeeded in boosting Democratic turnout. Many voter registration groups, such as the nonpartisan Rock the Vote, largely avoided Texas due to Texas's relatively demanding voter registration laws, which consists of filling out a form and submitting it <b>postage-free</b> to the county voter registrar and verifying your identity at the polls with a free Texas Election Identification Certificate (EIC). Jenn Brown, board chair of Battleground Texas, has described Texas as a [...] "non-voting state;" [...] in 2010, Governor Rick Perry was voted for by only 18 percent of voting age Texan citizens in his successful re-election campaign.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Rice Reynolds (June 18, 1884 [...] - [...] February 13, 1963) was a Democratic U.S. {{senator from}} North Carolina between 1932 and 1945. Almost {{from the outset}} of his Senate career, [...] "Our Bob," [...] as he was known among {{supporters}} back home, acquired distinction as a passionate isolationist and increasingly as an apologist for Nazi aggression in Europe. Even after America's entry into World War II, according to a contemporary study of subversive elements in America, he [...] "publicly endorsed the propaganda efforts of Gerald L. K. Smith," [...] whose scurrilous publication The Cross and the Flag [...] "violently assailed the United States war effort and America's allies." [...] Reynolds and Smith, one of the nation's most influential fascists, likewise collaborated on The Defender, an anti-Semitic newspaper partly owned by Reynolds. Reynolds on occasion turned over his Senate office facilities to subversive propagandists and allowed them to use his franking privilege to mail their literature <b>postage-free.</b>|$|E
