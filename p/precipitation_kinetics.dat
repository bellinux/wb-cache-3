40|$|The <b>precipitation</b> <b>kinetics</b> of {{coherent}} Cu rich precipitates (CRPs) in binary Fe–Cu and ternary Fe–Cu–Ni alloys during {{thermal aging}} was modelled by the kinetic Monte Carlo method (kMC).

This agreement was obtained owing to the correct description of the fast cluster mobility.

The precipitation of scorodite from sulphate-based effluents at ambient pressure (95 $ sp circ$C) was investigated using a supersaturation controlled precipitation technique. This technique has been used to precipitate scorodite from chloride-based solutions. Test work using NaOH showed that amorphous ferric arsenate precipitation was avoided even at very high supersaturation levels ($>$ 70). This was in sharp contrast with the results obtained in the chloride system (supersaturation $<$ 10). The use of NaOH resulted in very slow <b>precipitation</b> <b>kinetics</b> and a low yield of arsenic precipitation but nevertheless scorodite was produced at 95 $ sp circ$C. Particle growth through seed recycling was demonstrated, as was the moderate negative effect of increased sulphate concentration on the <b>precipitation</b> <b>kinetics.</b> By replacing NaOH with Mg(OH) $ sb 2 $ much improved <b>precipitation</b> <b>kinetics</b> were obtained. The slow addition of ferric ions to sulphate solutions containing arsenic was also found to precipitate scorodite.
