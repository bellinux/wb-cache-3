5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions {{are considered to}} have rotation rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have been assigned a rotation <b>period</b> <b>of</b> 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a rotation <b>period</b> <b>of</b> 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E
