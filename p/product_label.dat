25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the <b>product</b> <b>label,</b> and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E

2500|$|Absolute {{bioavailability}} of rosuvastatin {{is about}} 20% and Cmax is reached in 3 to 5 hours; administration with food {{did not affect}} the AUC according to the original sponsor submitted clinical study and as per <b>product</b> <b>label.</b> However, a subsequent clinical study has shown a marked reduction in rosuvastatin exposure when administered with food. It is 88% protein bound, mainly to albumin. [...] Fraction absorbed of rosuvastatin is frequently misquoted in the literature as approximately 0.5 (50%) due to a miscalculated hepatic extraction ratio in the original submission package subsequently corrected by the FDA reviewer. It is likely that closer to 0.25 (25%) of the administered dose is absorbed.|$|E
2500|$|The general {{population}} of healthy adults {{is not at}} risk for potential adverse effects from caffeine if they limit their consumption to 400mg per day, which {{is the equivalent of}} 5 standard cans, with one can being 250ml in volume. Consumption of a single energy drink will not lead to excessive caffeine intake. Adverse effects associated with caffeine consumption in amounts greater than 400mg include nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, increased urination, abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia), and dyspepsia. Consumption also has been known to cause pupil dilation when taken with certain antidepressants or SSRIs. [...] Caffeine dosage is not required to be on the <b>product</b> <b>label</b> for food in the United States, unlike drugs, but some advocates are urging the FDA to change this practice.|$|E

2500|$|Salsa was {{the fourth}} {{innovation}} based on Cuban music to hit the US, and differed {{in that it was}} initially developed in the US, not in Cuba. Because Cuba has so many indigenous types of music {{there has always been a}} problem in marketing the 'product' abroad to people who did not understand the differences between rhythms that, to a Cuban, are quite distinct. So, twice in the 20th century, a kind of <b>product</b> <b>label</b> was developed to solve this problem. The first occasion was in the 1930s after [...] "The Peanut Vendor" [...] became an international success. It was called a 'rumba' even though it really had nothing to do with genuine rumba: the number was obviously a son pregon. The label 'rumba' was used outside Cuba for years as a catch-all for Cuban popular music.|$|E
