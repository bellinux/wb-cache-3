With Dr. Stephanie Wolfe, a child neurology specialist at the University of North Carolina, Escolar developed the Protocol for the Assessment of Neurodevelopmental Function in Early Infancy (PANDI) to detect developmental delays at an early age, predict future neurodevelopment, and give parents {{the information they need}} to provide their children with early interventions. With Dr. Michele Poe, Escolar and the NFRD staff developed a staging system to help physicians determine whether a patient with Krabbe disease was a good candidate for transplantation.

50|$|The {{last major}} {{haematological}} complication associated with FA is bone marrow failure, defined as inadequate blood cell production. Several types of failure are observed in FA patients, and generally precede MDS and AML. Detection of decreasing blood count is generally {{the first sign}} used to assess necessity of treatment and possible transplant. While most FA patients are initially responsive to androgen therapy and haemopoietic growth factors, these {{have been shown to}} promote leukemia, especially in patients with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, and have severe side effects, including hepatic adenomas and adenocarcinomas. The only treatment left would be bone marrow transplant; however, such an operation has a relatively low success rate in FA patients when the donor is unrelated (30% 5-year survival). It is therefore imperative to transplant from an HLA-identical sibling. Furthermore, due to the increased susceptibility of FA patients to chromosomal damage, <b>pretransplant</b> conditioning cannot include high doses of radiations or immunosuppressants, and thus increase chances of patients developing graft-versus-host disease. If all precautions are taken, and the marrow transplant is performed within the first decade of life, 2-year probability of survival can be as high as 89%. However, if the transplant is performed at ages older than 10, 2-year survival rates drop to 54%.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{systematically}} review the prognostic value of <b>pretransplant</b> 18 F-fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose {{positron emission tomography}} (FDG-PET) in refractory/relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma treated with autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). MEDLINE was systematically searched for appropriate studies. Included studies were methodologically appraised. Results of individual studies were meta-analyzed, if possible. Eleven studies, comprising a total of 745 refractory/relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma patients who underwent FDG-PET before autologous SCT, were included. The overall methodological quality of these studies was moderate. The proportion of <b>pretransplant</b> FDG-PET positive patients ranged between 25 and 65. 2  %. Progression-free survival ranged between 0 and 52  % in <b>pretransplant</b> FDG-PET positive patients, and between 55 and 85  % in <b>pretransplant</b> FDG-PET negative patients. Overall survival ranged between 17 and 77  % in <b>pretransplant</b> FDG-PET positive patients, and between 78 and 100  % in FDG-PET negative patients. Based on five studies that provided sufficient data for meta-analysis, pooled sensitivity and specificity of <b>pretransplant</b> FDG-PET in predicting treatment failure (i. e., either progressive, residual, or relapsed disease) were 67. 2  % (95  % confidence interval [CI] 58. 2 – 75. 3  %) and 70. 7  % (95  % CI 64. 2 – 76. 5  %), respectively. Based on two studies that provided sufficient data for meta-analysis, pooled sensitivity and specificity of <b>pretransplant</b> FDG-PET in predicting death during follow-up were 74. 4  % (95  % CI 58. 8 – 86. 5  %) and 58. 0  % (95  % CI 49. 3 – 66. 3  %), respectively. In conclusion, the moderate quality evidence suggests <b>pretransplant</b> FDG-PET to have value in predicting outcome in refractory/relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with autologous SCT. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of <b>pretransplant</b> FDG-PET positive patients remains disease free and a considerable proportion of <b>pretransplant</b> FDG-PET negative patients develops disease relapse after autologous SCT...|$|E
40|$|Several <b>pretransplant</b> factors, {{including}} CRP (C-reactive protein) levels, {{reflect the}} risk of complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. IL- 6 induces CRP increase, and we therefore investigated the effects of <b>pretransplant</b> IL- 6, soluble IL- 6 receptors, IL- 6 family cytokines and CRP serum levels on outcome for 100 consecutive allotransplant recipients. All patients had related donors, none had active infections and 99 patients were in complete remission before conditioning. The incidence of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) requiring treatment was 40 %, survival at Day + 100 82 %, and overall survival 48 %. Despite a significant correlation between <b>pretransplant</b> CRP and IL- 6 levels, only CRP levels significantly influenced transplant-related mortality (TRM). However, CRP did not influence overall survival (OS). <b>Pretransplant</b> IL- 31 influenced late TRM.

Therefore, this study described this evolution and investigated whether <b>pretransplant</b> MNA predicts post-transplant immunosuppressive medication nonadherence (IMNA). Adult participants (single transplant, <b>pretransplant</b> and ≤ 1 post-transplant assessment, using medications <b>pretransplant)</b> in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (a prospective nation-wide cohort study) were included. Nonadherence, defined as any deviation from dosing schedule, was assessed using two self-report questions <b>pretransplant</b> and at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post-transplant. Nonadherence patterns were modelled using generalized estimating equations. The sample included 1505 patients (average age: 52. 5 years (SD: 13. 1); 36. 3 % females; 924 renal, 274 liver, 181 lung, 126 heart). The magnitude and variability of self-reported MNA decreased significantly from <b>pretransplant</b> to 6 months post-transplant (OR = 0. 21; 95 % CI: 0. 16 - 0. 27). Post-transplant IMNA increased continuously from 6 months to 3 years post-transplant (OR = 2. 75; 95 % CI: 1. 97 - 3. 85). <b>Pretransplant</b> MNA was associated with threefold higher odds of post-transplant IMNA (OR = 3. 10; 95 % CI: 2. 29 - 4. 21).

40|$|In heart transplantation, the {{clinical}} significance of <b>pretransplant</b> donor-specific antibodies (DSA) detected by solid phase assay (SPA), {{which is more}} sensitive than the conventional complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assays, is unclear. The aim was to evaluate SPA performed on <b>pretransplant</b> sera for survival after heart transplantation. <b>Pretransplant</b> sera of 272 heart transplant recipients were screened for anti-HLA antibodies using CDC and SPA. For determination of <b>pretransplant</b> DSA, a single-antigen bead assay was performed. The presence of anti-HLA antibodies was correlated with survival. Secondary outcome parameters were acute cellular rejection, graft coronary vasculopathy and ejection fraction. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, SPA-screening did not predict survival (P = 0. 494), this in contrast to CDC screening (P = 0. 002). However, the presence of <b>pretransplant</b> DSA against HLA class I was associated with decreased short-term survival compared to non-DSA (P = 0. 038).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Disorders {{of calcium}} {{homeostasis}} {{are one of}} the most common problems in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Elevated calcium levels increase the incidence of cardiovascular mortality in ESRD patients, and appear to be a risk factor for the occurrence of delayed graft function (DGF) after kidney transplantation. Therefore, we investigated the impact of <b>pretransplant</b> serum calcium levels on outcomes after kidney transplantation: DGF, acute rejection, graft function, and survival, as well as the incidence of cardiovascular events. METHODS: We studied 285 patients (96. 9 % of all transplanted patients) who underwent their first transplantation between 1995 and 2004. Demographic data were extracted from hospital records or were documented during follow-up; serum samples were collected at the time of transplantation. RESULTS: In our cohort the incidence of DGF was 16. 5 % and 35. 4 % of acute rejection episodes (ARE). However, <b>pretransplant</b> calcium levels were not related to DGF or ARE in our patient cohort. Furthermore, there was no correlation between <b>pretransplant</b> serum calcium level with the incidence of cardiovascular events or mortality, as well as graft function or survival.

Methods: The impact of <b>pretransplant</b> DSA and immune activation marker soluble CD 30 (sCD 30) on 3 -year graft survival was analyzed in 385 presensitized kidney transplant recipients. Findings: A deleterious influence of <b>pretransplant</b> DSA on graft survival was evident only in patients who were positive for the immune activation marker sCD 30. In the absence of sCD 30 positivity, 3 -year graft survival was virtually identical in patients with or without DSA (83. 1  ±  3. 9 % and 84. 3  ±  2. 8 %, P =  0. 81).

40|$|Rationale: The role of {{pulmonary}} function before {{stem cell}} transplant {{as a potential}} risk factor {{for the development of}} early post-transplant respiratory failure and mortality is controversial. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the <b>pretransplant</b> pulmonary function of 2, 852 patients who received their transplant between 1990 and 2001. Measurements: <b>Pretransplant</b> FEV 1, FVC, total lung capacity (TLC), diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), and the alveolar–arterial oxygen tension difference P(A-a) O 2 were measured and assessed for association with development of early respiratory failure and mortality in Cox proportional hazard logistic models. Main Results: In multivariate analyses, progressive decrease of all lung function parameters was associated with a stepwise increase in risk of developing early respiratory failure and mortality when assessed in independent models. On the basis of a significant correlation between FEV 1 and FVC (r = 0. 81), FEV 1 and TLC (r = 0. 61), and FVC and TLC (r = 0. 80), and a lack of correlation between FEV 1 and DLCO, we developed a <b>pretransplant</b> lung function score based on <b>pretransplant</b> FEV 1 and DLCO {{to determine the extent of}} pulmonary compromise before transplant. Multivariate analysis indicated that higher <b>pretransplant</b> lung function scores are associated with a significant increased risk for developing early respiratory failure (category II hazard ratio [HR], 1. 4; category III HR, 2. 2; category IV HR, 3. 1; p < 0. 001) and death (category II HR, 1. 2; category III HR, 2. 2; category IV HR, 2. 7; p < 0. 005). Conclusions: These results suggest that not only does compromised <b>pretransplant</b> lung function contribute to the risk for development of early respiratory failure and mortality but this risk may be estimated before transplant by grading the extent of FEV 1 and DLCO compromise...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of <b>pretransplant</b> biopsy in {{defining}} the quality of kidney grafts is still debated.

METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we analyzed 372 recipients of single kidney transplantation (SKT) from deceased donors between 1997 and 2007, with an available <b>pretransplant</b> biopsy. We evaluated 5 - and 10 -year graft survival, incidence of delayed graft function, and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 1 and 5 years. RESULTS: Graft survival at 5 and 10 years was significantly better for recipients with a score of 0 compared to transplants with a score of 1 to 5, whereas we did not observe any significant difference among transplants with a score of 1 through 4. Survival of kidneys with a score of 5 was significantly worse compared to grafts with a score of 1 to 4. In a multivariate Cox model, only <b>pretransplant</b> histological score was significantly associated with graft survival. Transplants with a score of 0 and 5 had the best and the worst graft function, respectively, both at 1 and 5 years, whereas we did not observe any difference among patients with a score of 1 through 4. In a multivariate logistic regression, <b>pretransplant</b> histological score was independently associated with the prevalence of an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min at 5 years. Finally, delayed graft function rate was significantly higher in recipients with a score of 5 compared to patients with a score of 1 to 4 and score of 0.

40|$|BackgroundPreoperative extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) is a {{risk factor}} for poor outcome and currently considered a contraindication to lung transplantation.

MethodA retrospective review of 715 consecutive lung transplants performed between May 2005 and September 2011 was conducted using a prospectively collected institutional registry database. Twenty-four lung transplants (3. 4 %) were performed in the 31 patients with attempted <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO; 7 patients who received ECMO patients did not survive or were deemed unfit for transplantation. These patients were compared with a control group of 691 patients who did not receive <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO. ResultsThe duration of <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO was 171  ±  242 hours (median, 91 hours). Venovenous ECMO was used for respiratory failure in 15 patients, whereas venoarterial ECMO was used for circulatory collapse due to pulmonary hypertension in 9 patients. Patients in the retransplant ECMO group were younger (46  ±  15 years vs 57  ±  14 years, P < . 01) compared with the control group, with no difference in recipient gender (male/female: 10 / 14 vs 380 / 311), donor age (33  ±  14 years vs 36  ±  15 years), or donor gender (male/female: 10 / 14 vs 352 / 339). Emphysema was less common (1, 4 % vs 260, 38 %, P < . 01), and cystic fibrosis (5, 21 % vs 72, 10 %, P = . 09), redo lung transplant (3, 13 % vs 28, 4 %, P = . 08), and bronchiectasis (2, 8 % vs 6, 1 %, P = . 03) were more common in the <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO group. Patients in the <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO group had a significantly higher lung allocation score (87  ±  9 vs 44  ±  15, P < . 01). All patients in the <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO group underwent double lung transplants on pump (cardiopulmonary bypass/ECMO), and single lung transplants were performed in 171 patients (25 %) and pump was used in 243 patients (35 %) in the control group. The cardiopulmonary bypass time was longer in the <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO group (277  ±  69 minutes vs 225  ±  89 minutes, P = . 02), with no difference in ischemic time (343  ±  93 minutes vs 330  ±  98 minutes, P = . 54). Cadaveric lobar lung transplants were performed because of the urgency to overcome size mismatch with an oversized donor more frequently in 25 % (n =  6, no mortality with the longest follow-up at 6 years) of patients in the <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO group versus 0. 3 % (n =  2) of patients in the control group (P < . 01). Post-transplant ECMO was used for primary graft dysfunction in 13 patients (54 %) in the <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO group and 41 patients (6 %) in the control group (P < . 01). The median hospital stay was 46 days in the <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO group versus 27 days in the control group (P = . 16). The actuarial survivals after lung transplants at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were 96 %, 88 %, 83 %, 74 %, and 74 %, respectively, in the <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO group, and 97 %, 94 %, 90 %, 83 %, and 74 %, respectively, in the control group (P = . 787). ConclusionsAlthough the incidence of primary graft dysfunction requiring post-transplant ECMO is higher and the hospital stay is longer in patients receiving <b>pretransplant</b> ECMO, the graft survival is good (2 -year survival, 74 %). ECMO is efficacious as a bridge to lung transplantation with good post-lung transplant outcomes...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the psychosocial determinants of quality of life at 6 months after transplantation. METHODS: A sample of liver transplant candidates (n = 60), composed of consecutive patients (25 % with familial amyloid polyneuropathy [FAP]) attending outpatient clinics was assessed in the <b>pretransplant</b> period using the Neo Five Factor Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and depression Scale (HADS), Brief COPE, and SF- 36, a quality-of-life, self-rating questionnaire. Six months after transplantation, these patients were assessed {{by means of the}} SF- 36. RESULTS: Psychosocial predictors where found by means of multiple regression analysis. The physical component of quality of life at 6 months after transplantation was determined based upon coping strategies and physical quality of life in the <b>pretransplant</b> period (this model explained 32 % of variance). The mental component at 6 months after transplantation was determined by depression in the <b>pretransplant</b> period and by clinical diagnoses of patients. Because FAP patients show a lower mental component of quality of life, this diagnosis explained 25 % of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that coping strategies and depression measured in the <b>pretransplant</b> period are important determinants of quality of life at 6 months after liver transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Secondary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) {{have been}} {{reported}} after autologous transplantation. It is not known whether the MDS results from the <b>pretransplant</b> conventional-dose chemotherapy or from the high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) used for the transplant procedure. We performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of morphologically normal <b>pretransplant</b> marrow or stem cell specimens from 12 patients who subsequently developed myelodysplasia after HDC. To determine if the abnormal clone was present before HDC, we used {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) to detect the cytogenetic markers observed at the onset of posttransplant MDS. Cryopreserved, <b>pretransplant</b> bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell specimens, obtained at the time of harvest, or archival smears were used. Standard cytogenetic analysis had been performed <b>pretransplant</b> in four patients, showing a normal karyotype. In 9 of 12 cases, the same cytogenetic abnormality observed at the time of MDS diagnosis was detected by FISH in the pre-HDC specimens. Our findings support the hypothesis that, in many cases of posttransplant MDS, the stem cell damage results from prior conventional-dose chemotherapy and may be unrelated to HDC or the transplantation process itself.

40|$|<b>Pretransplant</b> {{screening}} affords {{an important}} opportunity {{to detect and}} treat preexisting active infection in the solid-organ transplant recipient. In this article, <b>pretransplant</b> strategies for preventing infections after solid-organ transplantation are reviewed. In addition {{to the search for}} active preexisting infection in the transplant candidate, immunization remains a cornerstone of preventive practice. Because there is a suboptimal response to vaccinations in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, as well as in patients with end-stage organ dysfunction, standard immunization of the transplant candidate should be updated as early as possible {{in the course of the}} illness, including pneumococcal, influenza, and hepatitis B vaccines. Liver transplant candidates should receive hepatitis A vaccine, and children should receive Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccine. All nonimmune <b>pretransplant</b> patients should be considered candidates for the varicella vaccine. The management of special risk groups is discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{transplant}} {{has been}} performed {{with an increased}} frequency as the treatment for end-stage cardiac disease. Although cholelithiasis is more frequent in both <b>pretransplant</b> and posttransplant patients, no standard management approach exists. <b>Pretransplant</b> patients are well recognized for cardiac events, and posttransplant immunossupressed patients are at a considerable risk for septic complications. Because the first presentation of gallstones in this population is often acute cholecystitis, asymptomatic calculi cannot be considered benign and {{it seems reasonable to}} recommend <b>pretransplant</b> screening and posttransplant surveillance for gallstones. Prophylatic laparoscopic cholecistectomy should be undertaken in the stable patient to avoid the substantial mortality associated with postoperative acute cholecystitis and urgent cholecystectomy. In this case report we present a 44 year-old male with acute cholecystitis after cardiac transplantation who was submitted to a safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy one year and seven months later...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{significance}} of <b>pretransplant,</b> donor-specific antibodies on long-term patient outcomes {{is a subject}} of debate. This study evaluated the impact and {{the presence or absence}} of donor-specific antibodies after kidney transplantation on short- and long-term graft outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the frequency and dynamics of <b>pretransplant</b> donor-specific antibodies following renal transplantation from a randomized trial that was conducted from 2002 to 2004 and correlated these findings with patient outcomes through 2009. Transplants were performed against a complement-dependent T- and B-negative crossmatch. Pre- and posttransplant sera were available from 94 of the 118 patients (80 %). Antibodies were detected using a solid-phase (LuminexH), single-bead assay, and all tests were performed simultaneously. RESULTS: Sixteen patients exhibited <b>pretransplant</b> donor-specific antibodies, but only 3 of these patients (19 %) developed antibody-mediated rejection and 2 of them experienced early graft losses. Excluding these 2 losses, 6 of 14 patients exhibited donor-specific antibodies at the final follow-up exam, whereas 8 of these patients (57 %) exhibited complete clearance of the donor-specific antibodies. Five other patients developed ''de novo'' posttransplant donor-specific antibodies. Death-censored graft survival was similar in patients with <b>pretransplant</b> donor-specific and non-donor-specific antibodies after a mean follow-up period of 70 months. CONCLUSION: <b>Pretransplant</b> donor-specific antibodies with a negative complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch are associated with a risk for the development of antibody-mediated rejection, although survival rates are similar when patients transpose the first months after receiving the graft. Our data also suggest that early posttransplant donor-specific antibody monitoring should increase knowledge of antibody dynamics and their impact on long-term graft outcome...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{association}} of iron overload with complications of allogeneic {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT) has been suggested in previous studies. Because hepcidin plays {{a central role in}} the regulation of iron homeostasis, we analyzed the association between <b>pretransplant</b> serum hepcidin- 25 levels and early infectious complications after allogeneic HSCT. We studied 55 consecutive adult patients with a median age of 47 years (range: 20 – 64 years) who underwent allogeneic HSCT for hematologic malignancies at our institution. Thirty-two patients had myelogenous malignancies; the remaining 23 had lymphogenous malignancies. The median <b>pretransplant</b> serum hepcidin level of patients in the study was 21. 6 ng/mL (range: 1. 4 – 371 ng/mL), which was comparable to that of healthy volunteers (median: 19. 1 ng/mL [range: 2. 3 – 37 ng/mL]; n= 17). When cumulative incidences of documented bacterial and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections at day 100 were compared according to <b>pretransplant</b> hepcidin- 25 levels, the incidence of bacterial, but not CMV, infection, was significantly higher in the high-hepcidin group (≥ 50 ng/mL; n= 17) than in the low-hepcidin group (< 50 ng/mL; n= 38) (65 % [95 % confidence interval, 38 %– 82 %] versus 11 % [3 %– 23 %]; P <. 001). This finding was confirmed by multivariate Cox analysis adjusted for confounders, including <b>pretransplant</b> ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. No fungal infection was documented in either group. These results suggest that the <b>pretransplant</b> serum hepcidin- 25 level may be a useful marker for predicting the risk of early bacterial complications after allogeneic HSCT. Larger prospective studies are, however, warranted to confirm our findings...|$|E
40|$|A {{longitudinally}} {{study was}} conducted among 42 bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients to investigate the association between <b>pretransplant</b> psychosocial variables and psychophysiological outcomes during the immediate convalescence period. Family relationships (cohesion, expressiveness, and conflict) and coping resources (cognitive, social, emotional, spiritual/philosophical, and physical resources) were assessed on the admission day (Day - 7 Time 1). Data on psychological distress and pain intensity were obtained on Day + 7 (Time 2) and Day + 14 (Time 3). The average scores at Times 2 and 3 were computed to indicate the overall adjustments of the patients during the hospitalization period after the day of actual transplant (Day 0). It was shown that higher expressiveness family relationships and higher resources to cope effectively with stressful situations were associated with less psychological distress during the above period. Both <b>pretransplant</b> psychosocial variables were not associated with pain intensity during hospitalization. Allogeneic transplant patients reported higher pain intensity than did autologous transplant patients. Psychological distress and pain intensity were positively correlated with each other. Our findings show that <b>pretransplant</b> family relationships and coping resources associate moderately with psychological distress during the immediate convalescent period of BMT. The present findings support the family-centered approach to BMT care and provide a scientific basis for <b>pretransplant</b> psychosocial interventions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{overload}} {{is considered}} {{a risk factor for}} mortality in patients with hematopoietic malignancies. Hepcidin is a key regulator of systemic iron balance. We previously reported dynamic changes of serum hepcidin- 25 levels in patients with hematologic malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the association of <b>pretransplant</b> hepcidin- 25 levels with overall survival (OS), engraftment, and other clinical outcomes of allo-HSCT in patients with hematologic malignancies. A total of 166 patients were divided into two groups depending on their <b>pretransplant</b> serum hepcidin- 25 levels; their median age was 49. 5 years, and the median follow-up time was 46. 8 months. At 3 years, the patients in the high-hepcidin group had a significantly lower OS than those in the low-hepcidin group (49. 2 vs. 69. 0 %, respectively; P = 0. 006). Multivariate analysis revealed that <b>pretransplant</b> serum hepcidin- 25 level, sex, and disease status were independently associated with OS. The incidence of platelet engraftment was significantly lower in the high-hepcidin group than in the low-hepcidin group, whereas no significant differences were observed in neutrophil and reticulocyte engraftments between these groups. Hence, <b>pretransplant</b> serum hepcidin levels can be a marker for predicting delayed platelet recovery after allo-HS...|$|E
