5|$|After the JNA {{captured}} Vukovar, it transferred a {{large number}} of the inhabitants of the city to the detention facility in Dalj on 20 November. The transfer occurred {{on the basis of a}} request by Goran Hadžić, <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> of the SAO SBWS. Those suspected of involvement in the fighting were interrogated and tortured, and at least 35 were executed.|$|E

He was the second Puerto Rican to graduate from the University (after Pedro Gerónimo Goyco, a later <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> native of Mayagüez who would eventually interact with Betances when both returned to Puerto Rico). Among Betances' teachers were: Charles-Adolphe Wurtz, Jean Cruveilhier, Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud, Armand Trousseau, Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau and Auguste Nélaton.|$|E

5|$|The Prime Minister of Pakistan is the <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> {{and head}} of {{government}} of the country, and is responsible for nominating {{the rest of the}} government, chairing Cabinet meetings and deciding when to call general elections for the National Assembly.

5|$|The decorations were in wood, stucco and stone, {{including}} marble, with geometrical and floral {{patterns and}} arabesques with Samarran and Byzantine origins. The decorations were {{more complex than}} the earlier Islamic forms and more carefully adapted to structural constraints. The imposing architecture and decoration of Fatimid buildings such as the al-Hakim mosque provided a backdrop that supported the dual role of the Fatimid caliph as both religious and <b>political</b> <b>leader.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E

5|$|King {{decided to}} appoint two {{additional}} ministers, one {{in charge of}} the Royal Canadian Air Force, the other to oversee the Royal Canadian Navy. He therefore, asked Macdonald to join the federal cabinet as minister of national defence for naval services. Macdonald, who had fought in World War I as a soldier on the front lines in France and Belgium, decided it was his duty to fight World War II as a <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> in Ottawa. He handed over his responsibilities as premier to A. S. MacMillan and was sworn into the federal cabinet on July 12, 1940.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald's {{five years}} in Ottawa were tumultuous ones. He oversaw a massive {{increase}} in Canada's naval forces and {{played a key role}} in a political crisis that threatened to tear the Liberal government and the country apart. He also incurred the wrath of Mackenzie King, a <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> whom Macdonald grew to loathe. When he entered the federal cabinet in 1940, Macdonald seemed a likely candidate to replace the aging King and one day become prime minister himself. By the time he resigned in 1945, Macdonald's federal political career was in tatters.|$|E

Makkhi's father resolves the situation by accepting an apology from Chulbul. Chulbul meets Dayal Babu (Anupam Kher), a local <b>political</b> <b>leader,</b> who also dislikes Chedi. With his help, Chulbul adulterates the breweries of Chedi, and wrongly frames him for it.|$|E

The charges include war crimes of persecutions, extermination, murder, imprisonment, torture, inhumane acts and cruel treatment, deportation, forcible transfer of population, wanton destruction and plunder of property. Hadžić died in July 2016, before his trial could be completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} Muslim {{support for}} Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature as the <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> to the British. His {{support for the}} Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced {{his opposition to the}} satyagraha non-cooperation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Tintin et les Picaros began {{serialisation}} in both Belgium and France in Tintin-l'Hebdoptmiste {{magazine in}} September 1975. It was then {{published in a}} collected volume by Casterman in 1976. For this publication, a page {{was removed from the}} story so that it would fit the standard 62-page book format. The page in question was located between pages 22 and 23 of the published book, and featured Sponz attempting to smash a glass, but accidentally breaking a statue of Bordurian <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> Kurvi-Tasch instead. A launch party was held at the Hilton Hotel in Brussels.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{outcomes of}} a research on features of perception of modern Russian <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> in young people. A technique of multidimensional semantic differential was employed: the {{subjects were asked to}} assess 15 objects (<b>political</b> <b>leaders,</b> 'my ideal', 'ideal leader', 'antipathetic person' and 'Myself') according to 33 personality traits using a seven-point scale. The outcomes suggest that the structure of the students' perception of <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> is quite simple and is based on three modalities: 'morality', 'power' and 'intelligence'. Comparing these outcomes with the research data obtained in 2004 using the same technique allowed the authors to conclude that the students do not assess modern <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> according to the moral qualities of the latter, but rather perceive them through the qualities of power associated with social manipulation...|$|R

5|$|A 5 hours, 9 {{minutes long}} biographical {{documentary}} film, , made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures {{the history of}} those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised <b>political</b> <b>leader.</b> Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values {{as a metaphor for}} the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.|$|E
5|$|A corrupt <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> named Chedi Singh (Sonu Sood) meets Chulbul {{and both}} quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks {{his father to}} arrange his {{marriage}} with Nirmala. His father refuses because he needs money to repay the loans he took to make his factory, and he believes that he can acquire money through his son marrying a rich girl. In desperate need of money, Makkhi steals from Chulbul's cupboard and gives the stolen cash to Nirmala's father, hoping that he will permit Makkhi to marry Nirmala. Meanwhile, Chulbul meets Rajjo and proposes marriage, which she rejects, as she has {{to take care of}} her father, Haria (Mahesh Manjrekar)—a drunkard.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, Brundage {{wrote to}} other IOC members {{that he had}} no {{objection}} to Soviet involvement in international sports, with representation on the IOC, if the USSR joined the international sports federations (ISFs). The IOC required that an NOC be independent of the government of the territory which it represents; there were concerns a Soviet NOC would not be. This was a problem not unique to communist states; a number of Latin Americans countries were starting to bring the local NOCs into the political structure, with an official naming the NOC chair—who might even be the country's <b>political</b> <b>leader.</b> This mixture of sports and politics worried Brundage.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with his two surviving heirs was fraught, for, while the King had great affection for his youngest son John, he showed little warmth towards Richard and indeed seems to have borne him a grudge after their argument in 1184. The bickering and simmering tensions between Henry and Richard were cleverly exploited by the new French king, Philip Augustus. Philip had come to power in 1180 and he rapidly demonstrated {{that he could be}} an assertive, calculating and manipulative <b>political</b> <b>leader.</b> Initially Henry and Philip Augustus had enjoyed a good relationship. Despite attempts to divide the two, Henry and Philip Augustus agreed a joint alliance, even though this cost the French king the support of Flanders and Champagne. Philip Augustus regarded Geoffrey as a close friend, and would have welcomed him as a successor to Henry. With the death of Geoffrey, however, the relationship between Henry and Philip broke down.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Borduria {{was based on}} Eastern Bloc countries. Their police force was modelled on the Soviet KGB. Hergé named the <b>political</b> <b>leader</b> of Borduria Plekszy-Gladz, a pun on plexiglas, although the English translators renamed him Kûrvi-Tasch ("curvy tash"), {{a reference to the}} fact that the leader's curved moustache, inspired by that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, was a prominent symbol in Borduria. As evidence for the accuracy of Hergé's {{depiction of}} an Eastern Bloc city, Farr highlighted that Borduria's Kûrvi-Tasch Platz closely resembled East Berlin's Platz der Republik, which would only be completed in the 1970s. All of the furniture in the Bordurian police headquarters was drawn from that found in the Studios Hergé premises.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of a band of Latin American revolutionaries was also influenced by the French leftist activist Régis Debray's accounts of his time spent fighting in the Bolivian Andes alongside the Argentine Marxist–Leninist revolutionary Che Guevara. Hergé's {{depiction of}} Bordurian support for Tapioca's government was {{a reference to the}} Soviet Union's support for various Latin American regimes, most notably that of Castro's Cuba, with San Theodoros being depicted as having been governed under the ideological system of Borduria's <b>political</b> <b>leader,</b> Kurvi-Tasch. Similarly, Hergé included a reference to Alcazar being backed by the International Banana Company in order to reflect the influence of Western multinational corporations in Latin America.|$|E
