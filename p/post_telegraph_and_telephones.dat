It went on air with radio broadcasts of international news translated into Persian, which it offered to local subscribers. Under the new regime, it operated {{under the supervision of}} various state offices and ministries such as the Ministry of Culture, Ministry of <b>Post,</b> <b>Telegraph</b> <b>and</b> <b>Telephones,</b> Office of the Prime Minister and the Labor Ministry until 1947. In 1957, the General Department of Tablighat fell {{under the supervision of the}} Publications Department of Tehran Radio as an independent department. In 1963 the activities of Pars Agency were brought under the newly created Information Ministry. Its name was changed to Pars News Agency, or PANA, and it began operating around the clock. In July 1975 the Iranian legislature passed a bill establishing the Ministry of Information and Tourism and changing the status of Pars News Agency to a joint public stock with capital assets of about 300 million rials. It then became an affiliate of the new ministry. Its Articles of Association in 23 paragraphs and notes were adopted by the then National Consultative Assembly of Iran.|$|E
