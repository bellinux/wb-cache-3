40|$|Abstract <b>Substance</b> <b>addiction</b> is {{detrimental}} to the addict, their family, social environment and society as a whole, which is why research needs to approach it with problem solving in mind. The present study has a salutogenic health perspective, and focuses on coping in recovery from <b>substance</b> <b>addiction.</b> The informants’ experiences of coping were explored using the qualitative approach. The informants were residents from the same treatment facility for <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> in North-Norway. Men and women were included. Semi-structural interview guides were constructed specifically for the informants. The transcripts resulting from these one-hour interviews were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The superordinate themes were Together Into Drug Addiction, Vulnerability Factors, Making a Choice, Together Out of Drug Addiction, Focusing on oneself, The Gradual Change and Goals and Dreams. Keywords: coping, recovery, <b>substance</b> <b>addiction,</b> qualitative approach, IP...|$|R

50|$|Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectal Behavior Therapy and Behaviorism {{are widely}} used {{approaches}} for addressing Process <b>Addictions</b> and <b>Substance</b> <b>Addictions.</b> Less common approaches are Eclectic, Psychodynamic, Humanistic, and Expressive therapies.1 <b>Substance</b> <b>addictions</b> are relate to drugs, alcohol, and smoking. Process addictions relate to non-substance related behaviors such as gambling, spending, sexual activity, gaming, internet, and food.|$|R

50|$|One form of <b>addiction</b> is <b>substance</b> <b>addiction.</b> This is {{different}} from substance abuse in that abuse of a substance is not really definable while <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> is a behavioral addiction where there is an overwhelming involvement with the use and buying of drugs or alcohol. It is a mental dependence or <b>addiction</b> to a <b>substance</b> but not a physical addiction, although {{it can lead to}} a physical addiction in the end.|$|R
40|$|About 60 % of {{patients}} consuming substances that {{are able to}} cause addiction fulfil the criteria of any personality disorder. Repetitive use of these substances may cause <b>substance</b> <b>addiction.</b> This paper reviews current literature in neurobiology research and integrates data collected from our own research group to the topics a) processing of emotional valent stimuli, b) craving for the <b>substance</b> of <b>addiction,</b> c) relapse behavior and d) impulsive behavior. The mechanisms listed are core mechanisms that characterize clinical appearance {{of patients}} with <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> and comorbid personality disorder. Major research techniques referred to are positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as research using personality inventories. Here we test the following hypotheses: Global hypothesis: Neurobiological structures relevant for the pathological interplay of addictive behavior in <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> are also involved in the processing of aversive emotional stimuli. Further hypotheses: 1) A new developed mathematical model for Fluorodopa uptake in neuronal tissue is valid to assess dopamine storage in amygdala in psychiatric patients with <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> and healthy controls 2) The dopamine neurotransmitter system affecting amygdala and nucleus accumbens is involved in the processing of aversive emotional stimuli. 3) Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala influence the processing of emotional valid stimuli. The extent of this influence is determined by the dopamine storage capacity in amygdala and nucleus accumbens. 4) ACC and nucleus accumbens are structures involved in craving, impulsive behavior and relapse behavior. 5) Distinct evidence based approaches in psychotherapy evaluated for the treatment of patients with <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> and comorbid personality disorder train the skill to reduce dysfunctional coping strategies. Conclusion: the results of our studies contributed to all hypotheses listed above. This paper may give new points of view that may help to develop a sustainable neurobiological basis for a better understanding of this severe comorbidity in patients...|$|R

40|$|Similarities and {{differences}} between obesity and addiction are a prominent topic of ongoing research. We conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis on 87 studies in order to map the {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) response to reward in participants with obesity, <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> and non-substance (or behavioural) addiction, and to identify commonalities {{and differences}} between them. Our study confirms the existence of alterations during reward processing in obesity, non-substance <b>addiction</b> and <b>substance</b> <b>addiction.</b> Specifically, participants with obesity or with addictions differed from controls in several brain regions including prefrontal areas, subcortical structures and sensory areas. Additionally, participants with obesity and <b>substance</b> <b>addictions</b> exhibited similar blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI hyperactivity in the amygdala and striatum when processing either general rewarding stimuli or the problematic stimuli (food and drug-related stimuli, respectively). We propose that these similarities may be associated with an enhanced focus on reward – especially with regard to food or drug-related stimuli – in obesity and <b>substance</b> <b>addiction.</b> Ultimately, this enhancement of reward processes may facilitate the presence of compulsive-like behaviour in some individuals or under some specific circumstances. We hope that increasing knowledge about the neurobehavioural correlates of obesity and addictions will lead to practical strategies that target the high prevalence of these central public health challenges...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the general}} public appears to have embraced the term 'videogame addiction', the {{scientific}} debate as to whether 'gaming addiction' can actually be considered an <b>addiction</b> similar to <b>substance</b> <b>addictions</b> of DSM-IV is still unsettled. To date, research on gaming addiction has focused on problematic behavior from the gaming activity itself {{and there has been}} little empirical research related to pathological personality patterns that usually are associated with <b>substance</b> <b>addictions.</b> Therefore, the current study examined how game exposure and 'problematic gaming behavior' are related to personality patterns associated with addiction by means of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory- 2 (MMPI- 2). A large-scale survey study was performed among 1004 adolescent boys (age-range 11 - 18, M = 14. 18, SD = 1. 36) measuring problematic gaming behavior, physical game-related symptoms, gaming behavior and three MMPI- 2 subscales measuring personality patterns usually associated with <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> (MAC-R, APS, AAS). Results showed that problematic gaming and physical symptoms were positively related to all MMPI- 2 subscales, while game exposure was not related to the indirect measures of addictive personality patterns (i. e., MAC-R, APS). Thus, problematic gaming should be clearly distinguished from high game exposure. High game exposure merely indicates enthusiasm for some although it may be psychopathological for others. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Although {{the general}} public appears to have embraced the term 'video game addiction', the {{scientific}} debate as to whether 'gaming addiction' can actually be considered an <b>addiction</b> similar to <b>substance</b> <b>addictions</b> of DSM-IV is still unsettled. To date, research on gaming addiction has focused on problematic behavior from the gaming activity itself {{and there has been}} little empirical research related to pathological personality patterns that usually are associated with <b>substance</b> <b>addictions.</b> Therefore, the current study examined how excessive gaming and ‘problematic gaming behavior’ are related to personality patterns associated with addiction by means of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory- 2 MMPI- 2). Design, setting, and participants: A large-scale survey study among 1, 004 adolescent boys (age-range 11 - 18 years; M = 14. 18, SD= 1. 36; response rate 96. 17 %). Measurements: Problematic gaming behavior, physical game-related symptoms, gaming behavior and three MMPI- 2 subscales measuring personality patterns usually associated with <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> (MAC-R, APS, AAS) were assessed. Findings: Results showed that problematic gaming and physical game-related symptoms were positively related to all three substance abuse subscales of the MMPI- 2.

About twenty percent of twelve-step programs are for <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> recovery, the other eighty percent address a variety of problems from debt to depression. It would be an error to assume the effectiveness of twelve-step methods at treating problems in one domain translates to all or to another domain, therefore readers are directed to relevant sections in each group's article.|$|R

40|$|Ontologies {{are being}} {{developed}} throughout the biomedical sciences to address standardization, integration, classiﬁcation and reasoning needs {{against the background of}} an increasingly data-driven research paradigm. In particular, ontologies facilitate the translation of basic research into beneﬁts for the patient by making research results more discoverable and by facilitating knowledge transfer across disciplinary boundaries. Addressing and adequately treating mental illness is one of our most pressing public health challenges. Primary research across multiple disciplines such as psychology, psychiatry, biology, neuroscience and pharmacology needs to be integrated in order to promote a more comprehensive understanding of underlying processes and mechanisms, and this need for integration only becomes more pressing with our increase in understanding of differences among individuals and populations at the molecular level concerning susceptibility to speciﬁc illnesses. <b>Substance</b> <b>addiction</b> is a particularly relevant public health challenge in the developed world, affecting a substantial percentage of the population, often co-morbid with other illnesses such as mood disorders. Currently, however, there is no straightforward automated method to combine data of relevance to the study of <b>substance</b> <b>addiction</b> across multiple disciplines and populations. In this contribution, we describe a framework of interlinked, interoperable bio-ontologies for the annotation of primary research data relating to <b>substance</b> <b>addiction,</b> and discuss how this framework enables easy integration of results across disciplinary boundaries. We describe entities and relationships relevant for the description of addiction within the Mental Functioning Ontology, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest Ontology, Protein Ontology, Gene Ontology and the Neuroscience Information Framework ontologies...|$|R

40|$|Some recent {{evidence}} suggests that problem gambling presents at elevated rates among treatment samples of substance users; if so, there may be significant implications for treatment. This study utilised a retrospective clinical case file review of all clients assessed for entry into a residential substance use service in Australia over a calendar year. Fifty-seven (21. 4 %) of the 266 participants were classified as potential problem gamblers. Potential problem gamblers (PPGs) were not associated with increased psychological and social vulnerability; but displayed phenomenology divergent from single <b>substance</b> <b>addiction,</b> indicative of impulsivity. PPGs {{were more likely to}} be male, have a personality disorder, and be associated with a broader pattern of criminality, particularly crimes associated with financial gain. These findings challenge the recent re-conceptualisation of problem gambling, suggesting that problem gambling within treatment populations of substance users should be treated as a disorder adjacent to <b>substance</b> <b>addiction,</b> associated with distinct and specific phenomenology...|$|R
40|$|Many {{recognize}} that several behaviors potentially affecting the reward circuitry in human brains {{lead to a}} loss of control and other symptoms of addiction in at least some individuals. Regarding Internet addiction, neuroscientific research supports the assumption that underlying neural processes are similar to <b>substance</b> <b>addiction.</b> The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has recognized one such Internet related behavior, Internet gaming, as a potential addictive disorder warranting further study, in the 2013 revision of their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Other Internet related behaviors, e. g., Internet pornography use, were not covered. Within this review, we give a summary of the concepts proposed underlying addiction and give an overview about neuroscientific studies on Internet addiction and Internet gaming disorder. Moreover, we reviewed available neuroscientific literature on Internet pornography addiction and connect the results to the addiction model. The review leads to the conclusion that Internet pornography addiction fits into the addiction framework and shares similar basic mechanisms with <b>substance</b> <b>addiction.</b> Together with studies on Internet addiction and Internet Gaming Disorder we see strong evidence for considering addictive Internet behaviors as behavioral addiction.
