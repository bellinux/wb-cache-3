500|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have attempted to}} find a real-world correspondence for Gawain's journey to the Green Chapel. The Anglesey islands, for example, are mentioned in the poem. They exist today as a single {{island off the coast}} of Wales. In line 700, Gawain is said to pass the [...] "Holy Head", believed by many scholars to be either Holywell or the Cistercian abbey of Poulton in Pulford. Holywell is associated with the beheading of Saint Winifred. As the story goes, Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances. Her uncle, another saint, <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> back in place and healed the wound, leaving only a white scar. The parallels between this story and Gawain's make this area a likely candidate for the journey.|$|E
500|$|As a music critic, Cardus's romantic, instinctive {{approach}} {{was the opposite}} of Newman's objective school of musical criticism. Initially in awe of Newman's reputation, Cardus soon discovered his own independent, more subjective voice. A fellow critic wrote that Newman [...] "probed into Music's vitals, <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> under deep X-ray and analysed cell-tissue. Cardus laid his head against her bosom {{and listened to the}} beating of her heart." [...] Despite their different approaches, the two writers held each other in considerable regard; at times, Newman's own prose showed the influence of Cardus's style. Among leading musicians who have paid tribute to Cardus, Yehudi Menuhin wrote that he [...] "reminds us that there is an understanding of the heart {{as well as of the}} mind... in Neville Cardus, the artist has an ally". Colin Davis highlighted [...] "the quality and verve of Cardus's writing", which had made him a household name.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to her trial, Siddiqui {{said she}} was {{innocent}} of all charges. She maintained she could prove she was innocent but refused {{to do so in}} court. On 11 January 2010, Siddiqui told the judge that she would not co-operate with her attorneys and wanted to fire them. She said she did not trust the judge and added, [...] "I'm boycotting the trial, just to let all of you know. There's too many injustices."

50|$|Plath, on February 11, 1963, {{was found}} dead of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in <b>her</b> kitchen after <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in the oven. She sealed the rooms between the kitchen and her sleeping children with wet towels and cloths.|$|R
