5|$|Schnaufer {{was ordered}} to Carinhall, the {{residence}} of the Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, on 8 February 1945. Göring informed him about the intent to appoint him as Inspekteur der Nachtjäger (Inspector of the night fighter force), a role held by Oberst Werner Streib at the time. Schnaufer pushed back, not wanting to <b>push</b> <b>out</b> his friend and mentor from this position. He argued that he would better serve the German cause fighting the enemy. Göring was convinced and Schnaufer remained in his position as Geschwaderkommodore.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's dark plumage fades {{to brown}} from November until February (the Antarctic summer), before the yearly moult in January and February. Moulting is rapid in this species {{compared}} with other birds, taking only around 34days. Emperor penguin feathers emerge from the skin after they have grown {{to a third of}} their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help reduce heat loss. New feathers then <b>push</b> <b>out</b> the old ones before finishing their growth.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to <b>push</b> <b>out</b> the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E

5|$|After the Fort Worth tornado dissipated, another {{thunderstorm}} {{developed over}} Johnson County, tracking northeastward into Tarrant County and eventually merging with the supercell that had produced the earlier F3tornado. The new development prompted the re-issuance of the tornado warning for Tarrant County at 6:40p.m. CST (00:40UTC). At 7:05p.m. CST (01:05UTC), the Arlington tornado touched down on South Cooper Road, causing initial {{damage to a}} restaurant; the tornado's touchdown coincided {{with the appearance of}} a tornado vortex signature on radar imagery. Well-built homes within a residential area along Embercrest Drive sustained widespread damage, with some houses experiencing up to F3-rated damage; such damage occurred after garage doors failed, allowing tornadic winds to unroof homes and <b>push</b> <b>out</b> exterior walls. As a consequence, homes that faced the tornadic winds sustained more damage than homes whose attached garages were sheltered from the strong winds. After crossing Matlock Road, the tornado did additional damage to one- and two-story homes in another subdivision, producing F3damage. Many homes suffered the collapse of brick masonry walls due to poor construction as they were not properly anchored to the homes' frames. The tornado then swept across northern portions of the Arlington Municipal Airport, dealing F2damage before briefly paralleling Interstate 20. At 7:12p.m. CST (01:12UTC), the tornado crossed the interstate, overturning at least one 18-wheeler. The twister continued to track northeast, causing F2damage to a subdivision northeast of Grand Prairie Municipal Airport in Dallas County before dissipating at 7:20p.m. CST (01:20UTC).|$|E

50|$|In this contest, {{each player}} tries to <b>push</b> his {{opponent}} <b>out</b> of the ring, {{through the back}} or {{the side of the}} circle. If a player falls to the ground, or he releases Suk, he is declared to be the loser. No player is to throw his opponent off balance by pulling the latter's rod. An expert player can skid or slide around within the circle, but the game or round is not won until a player is successfully <b>pushed</b> <b>out.</b> A round is considered as drawn if no player is <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> of the circle. If all three rounds are drawn, a tie-breaker is declared, without any time limit, until a player is <b>pushed</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R

25|$|Kisenosato {{is mainly}} a yotsu-sumo wrestler, and his {{favourite}} {{grip on his}} opponent's mawashi is hidari-yotsu, or right hand outside, left hand inside. His most common winning kimarite is yorikiri (force out), followed by oshidashi (<b>push</b> <b>out)</b> and tsukiotoshi (thrust over). He {{has been criticized for}} frequently stalling at the tachi-ai, or initial charge, in an attempt to unsettle his opponent.|$|E

25|$|Kotonishiki was {{regarded}} as an oshi-sumo specialist, favouring tsuki (thrusting) and oshi (pushing) techniques. However, he was also capable of fighting on the mawashi or belt. Somewhat unusually, his preferred grip on the mawashi was morozashi, with both arms inside his opponent's. His most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri (force out), closely followed by oshi-dashi (<b>push</b> <b>out).</b> Together these two techniques accounted for half his victories at sekitori level. He very rarely employed throwing moves, {{with the exception of}} sukuinage, a beltless scoop throw.|$|E

25|$|A {{possible}} surgical {{alternative to}} corneal transplant is {{the insertion of}} intrastromal corneal ring segments. A small incision {{is made in the}} periphery of the cornea and two thin arcs of polymethyl methacrylate are slid between the layers of the stroma {{on either side of the}} pupil before the incision is closed by a suture. The segments <b>push</b> <b>out</b> against the curvature of the cornea, flattening the peak of the cone and returning it to a more natural shape. The procedure offers the benefit of being reversible and even potentially exchangeable as it involves no removal of eye tissue.|$|E

25|$|Kotomitsuki was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, and his {{favourite}} {{grip on the}} mawashi was migi-yotsu, {{with his}} left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms (although he was also capable of fighting in the reverse position, hidari-yotsu). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri, the force out, followed by oshi-dashi (<b>push</b> <b>out)</b> and hataki-komi (slap down). He was fond of dashinage (pulling throws, both overarm and underarm), and {{was also one of the}} few rikishi to employ uchi-muso, a technique which involves tapping the opponent's inner thigh with the back of the hand to off-balance him, before twisting him down.|$|E
25|$|Wakanohana {{was noted}} for his {{wide range of}} techniques, winning the prestigious Ginō-shō prize on six occasions. His {{favourite}} grip on his opponent's mawashi was hidari-yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His most common winning kimarite was yorikiri, or force out, followed by oshidashi or <b>push</b> <b>out.</b> Together these two techniques accounted for almost fifty percent of his career victories. He had knowledge {{of a wide range}} of throwing moves, such as uwatenage (overarm throw), shitatenage (underarm throw), sukuinage (scoop throw) and kubinage (neck throw), as well as extremely rare techniques such as amiuchi (the fisherman's throw), kawazugake (hooking backward counter throw) and susoharai (rear footsweep).|$|E

25|$|Axis ships transported 30,605 men, 13,254 {{horses and}} 6,265 motor {{vehicles}} across the Black Sea from Romania, from 1–2 September. With the reinforcements, the Germans captured {{most of the}} Black Sea naval bases but were held up at Novorossiysk, where the Soviet 47th Army had prepared for a long siege. The port fell on 10 September, after a four-day battle, the final German victory in the Caucasus. It left the heights south of the port and several coast roads {{in the hands of}} 47th Soviet Army. Attempts to <b>push</b> <b>out</b> of Novorossiysk were costly failures and the Axis also failed to break the defences on the coastal plain from Novorossiysk to Tuapse, having only the strength to stabilise the line. Romanian Army losses were particularly high and the Romanian 3rd Mountain Division was nearly wiped out by a Soviet counter-attack from 25–26 September.|$|E
25|$|China's {{golden age}} of {{animation}} would {{come to an end}} following the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. Many animators were forced to quit. If not for harsh economic conditions, the mistreatment of the Red Guards would threaten their work. The surviving animations would lean closer to propaganda. By the 1980s, Japan would emerge as the animation powerhouse of the Far East, leaving China's industry far behind in reputation and productivity. Though two major changes would occur in the 1990s, igniting some of the biggest changes since the exploration periods. The first is a political change. The implementation of a socialist market economy would <b>push</b> <b>out</b> traditional planned economy systems. No longer would a single entity limit the industry's output and income. The second is a technological change {{with the arrival of the}} Internet. New opportunities would emerge from flash animations and the contents became more open. Today China is drastically reinventing itself in the animation industry with greater influences from Hong Kong and Taiwan.|$|E
