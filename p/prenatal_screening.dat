The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by <b>prenatal</b> <b>screening</b> followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. More children are born with Down syndrome in countries where abortion is not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age. About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected. In the 1950s, in the United States, it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to <b>prenatal</b> <b>screening</b> and abortions.

40|$|Background: Nursing {{students}} {{must be able to}} ensure that patients understand important health screening information. However, studies have reported a deficit in nursing students’ knowledge of genetics and genetic disorders. Aim: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate nursing students’ knowledge of, and attitudes to <b>prenatal</b> genetic <b>screening.</b> Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted with final year undergraduate nursing students recruited from a tertiary teaching hospital in Kelantan, Malaysia. Thirty-four of the 37 students returned a self-administered questionnaire (response rate= 97 %) that assessed knowledge of, and attitudes to, <b>prenatal</b> genetic <b>screening.</b> Findings: The majority of the respondents demonstrated an adequate level of knowledge regarding <b>prenatal</b> genetic <b>screening</b> (65 %), and 62 % were more supportive than others of screening. Approximately one third (35 %) had limited knowledge.

2500|$|Newborn {{screening}} debuted as {{a public}} health program in the United States in the early 1960s, and has expanded to countries around the world, with different testing menus in each country. Both <b>prenatal</b> <b>screening</b> (screening before birth) and newborn screening (screening soon after birth) have improved health care. The first disorder detected by modern newborn screening programs was phenylketonuria, a metabolic condition in which the inability to degrade the essential amino acid phenylalanine can cause irreversible mental retardation unless detected early. [...] With early detection and dietary management, the negative effects of the disease can be largely eliminated. [...] Robert Guthrie developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born. [...] Guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on filter paper which could be easily transported, recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale. [...] Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMotor vehicle crashes, homicide, suicide, {{and drug}} abuse are among the leading causes of pregnancy-associated deaths. To prevent such deaths, {{identifying}} women for intervention is required. The universally offered Florida Healthy Start <b>Prenatal</b> Risk <b>Screen</b> was evaluated to identify women {{at increased risk for}} traumatic pregnancy-associated death. MethodsFlorida’s Enhanced Maternal Mortality Reporting Database for 1999 through 2005 was linked with Florida’s Healthy Start <b>Prenatal</b> Risk <b>Screen</b> to identify traumatic pregnancy-associated death as the outcome. Distribution of Healthy Start risk scores among women who died were compared with the screened population. Traumatic death estimates per 100, 000 births were drawn for each risk score, along with estimates of the relative risk (RR) of traumatic death for each score. The RR of women with scores {{greater than or equal to}} 4 were compared with the risk of women scoring 0 to  3. FindingsAlmost 20 % of the 620, 959 women who did not die of traumatic death had a risk score of 0, compared with only 3 % of the 144 women who did die of traumatic death. As risk scores increased, the chance of traumatic deaths sharply increased. A woman with a score of 4 had 11. 78 times (confidence interval [CI], 4. 63 – 29. 69) the risk of traumatic death compared with a woman with a risk score of  0.

Specifically, distinction is possible between ventricular diverticula and aneurysms, which is important because each condition has a different clinical outcome. We report the case of a 35 -year-old, gravida 1, para 1 woman, with no significant past medical history, who underwent routine <b>prenatal</b> ultrasound <b>screening</b> at 32 weeks’ gestation. A four-chamber ultrasound of the fetal heart combined with M-mode echocardiography showed abnormal dilatation of the right ventricular chamber measuring 2. 2 [*]cm × 1. 0 [*]cm but with normal contractility. Delivery was performed at full term by cesarean section, and a right ventricular diverticulum was confirmed by postnatal cardiac computed tomography. The baby developed normally with no cardiac sequelae during followup. This case demonstrates the importance of making a correct diagnosis of ventricular diverticula by prenatal ultrasound when abnormal dilatation of the fetal ventricle is identified during routine screening. Because evaluating the wall contractility by M-mode ultrasound leads to evaluating whether it has the myocardium, we conclude that M-mode echocardiography is effective for the purpose of prenatal cardiac diagnosis and can distinguish between ventricular aneurysms and functioning ventricular diverticula...|$|R

40|$|Background: Congenital {{anomalies}} {{are among}} the leading causes of fetal and infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. <b>Prenatal</b> ultrasound (US) <b>screening</b> has become {{an essential part of}} antenatal care in the developed world. Such practice is just evolving in the developing countries such as Nigeria. The aim {{of this article is to}} present our initial experience and demonstrate the effectiveness of a <b>prenatal</b> US <b>screening</b> program in detecting congenital malformation in a developing country. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective evaluation of the prenatal US screenings conducted at a major referral hospital in Southwestern Nigeria. All pregnant women referred to the antenatal clinic for mid-trimester screening during the period of study were assessed. Results: Two hundred and eighty-seven pregnant women (5 with twin gestations) were presented for fetal anomaly scan during the study period. Twenty-nine anomalies (9. 9 %) were detected among the scanned population. Sixteen of the anomalies were followed to delivery/termination with a specificity of 93. 5 %. The commonest malformations were demonstrated in the genitourinary tract (34. 5 %) followed by malformations within the central nervous system (27. 6 %). Six (20. 6 %) of the anomalies were lethal. Five of the anomalies were surgically correctable. Conclusion: Institutions and hospitals across Nigeria and other low- and middle-income countries need to develop policies and programs that would incorporate a standardized routine <b>screening</b> <b>prenatal</b> US in order to improve feto-maternal well-being and reduce the high perinatal mortality and morbidity in developing nations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{development}} {{is vital for}} embryonic survival and growth. Early gestation embryo loss or malformation {{has been linked to}} yolk sac vasculopathy and congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, the molecular pathways that underlie these structural defects in humans remain largely unknown hindering the development of molecular-based diagnostic tools and novel therapies. Methodology/Principal Findings: Murine embryos were exposed to high glucose, a condition known to induce cardiovascular defects in both animal models and humans. We further employed a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify proteins differentially expressed in embryos with defects from those with normal cardiovascular development. The proteins detected by mass spectrometry (WNT 16, ST 14, Pcsk 1, Jumonji, Morca 2 a, TRPC 5, and others) were validated by Western blotting and immunoflorescent staining of the yolk sac and heart. The proteins within the proteomic dataset clustered to adhesion/migration, differentiation, transport, and insulin signaling pathways. A functional role for several proteins (WNT 16, ADAM 15 and NOGO-A/B) was demonstrated in an ex vivo model of heart development. Additionally, a successful application of a cluster of protein biomarkers (WNT 16, ST 14 and Pcsk 1) as a <b>prenatal</b> <b>screen</b> for CHDs was confirmed in a study of human amniotic fluid (AF) samples from women carrying normal fetuses and those with CHDs...|$|R
