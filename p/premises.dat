40|$|In ‘Single <b>premise</b> {{deduction}} and risk’ (2008) Maria Lasonen-Aarnio {{argues that}} {{there is a kind of}} epistemically threatening risk that can accumulate over the course of drawing single <b>premise</b> deductive inferences. As a result, we have a new reason for denying that knowledge is closed under single <b>premise</b> deduction—one that mirrors a familiar reason for denying that knowledge is closed under multiple <b>premise</b> deduction. This sentiment has more recently been echoed by others (see Schechter 2011). In this paper, I will argue that, although there is a kind of risk that can accumulate over the course of drawing single <b>premise</b> deductive inferences, it is importantly different to the kind of risk that multiple <b>premise</b> deductive inferences can introduce. Having distinguished these two kinds of risk, I shall offer some reasons for thinking that the kind associated with single <b>premise</b> deductions is, in fact, epistemically benign—it poses no threat, in and of itself, to the knowledge status of a belief. If this is right, then Lasonen-Aarnio’s argument against single <b>premise</b> closure is unsuccessful...|$|R

I show that what I take to be the strongest argument for rejecting multi <b>premise</b> closure is also an argument for rejecting single <b>premise</b> closure.

5|$|Plantinga's {{free will}} defense begins by asserting that Mackie's {{argument}} failed {{to establish an}} explicit logical contradiction between God {{and the existence of}} evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing <b>premises</b> not stated in the argument itself. With an explicit contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add <b>premises</b> to the argument for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remain unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.|$|E
