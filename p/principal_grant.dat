25|$|Upper Canada College {{occupies}} an open, 17 hectare (43 acre) {{campus in}} Deer Park, near the major intersection of Avenue Road and St. Clair Avenue, {{in the residential}} neighbourhood of Forest Hill. There are 15 buildings on the site: The main structure (the Upper School), constructed between 1959 and 1960, central on the campus, and with a dominant clock tower, houses the secondary school component of the college, in a quadrangle form. Laidlaw Hall, the principal assembly hall, featuring a full theatre stage and a pipe organ, {{is attached to the}} west end of the Upper School and, at the other end, is the Memorial Wing, the school's main infirmary. Closing {{the north end of the}} main quadrangle (which is the location of the statue of the Lord Seaton, installed in 1934) is one building, built in 1932, that contains the two boarding houses, as well as two private residences for the associated boarding masters, adjacent to which is the school chapel, donated by Governor General Vincent Massey. Satellite to this complex are townhouse-style residences for masters and their families; the residence of the college's <b>principal,</b> <b>Grant</b> House, built in 1917; and a small, two-storey cricket pavilion, inaugurated by Governor General Raymond Hnatyshyn. The Preparatory School, part of which was designed by Eden Smith, is at the south-west corner of the campus, near which is a home for the Prep headmaster and a small gatehouse.|$|E

In the domestic arena, the Foundation believes that policy makers are seeking innovative and pragmatic solutions to the long-term challenges affecting the well being of all Americans.|$|E
50|$|By 1952, the {{cornerstone}} {{to a new}} Public School in Port Perry was laid on Queen Street, just west of Ottawa Street. The movement of public school students {{to what is now}} R.H. Cornish Public School opened several classrooms to students enrolled in the High School's programs. However, the existing school facility did not {{meet the needs of the}} community or of the growing enrollment Port Perry High School was experiencing. Under <b>Principal</b> <b>Grant</b> MacDonald's leadership, an aggressive expansion program brought a new wing north of the existing building (with a combined gymnasium/auditorium) in 1961 and a second addition which included a second smaller gymnasium, central offices, a cafeteria, classrooms and a full technical facility in 1967.|$|E

5000|$|Many of {{the errors}} were {{described}} as 'bizarre'. One teacher was paid for 39 days, instead of 39 hours getting thousands of dollars more than he should have. Another teacher was overpaid by $39,000. She returned the money immediately, but two months later, had not been paid since. A relief teacher was paid for working at two different schools {{on the same day}} - one in Upper Hutt and the other in Auckland. Ashburton College <b>principal,</b> <b>Grant</b> McMillan, said the 'most ludicrous' problem was when [...] "Novopay took $40,000 directly out of the school bank account to pay a number of teachers who had never worked at the college". Another difficulty was the amount of time it was taking callers to get through to Talent2's helpline. When Gladstone School principal Margaret Hyslop called for assistance, she found she was 1,117th in the complaints queue.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{consider}} a specific channel through which trust between parties to an exchange {{can go on}} to affect nations’ comparative advantage in certain industries. My approach revolves around the autonomy that employers (<b>principals)</b> <b>grant</b> to workers (agents), which is a key feature of workplace organization. I hypothesize that social trust generates a comparative advantage in industries with more autonomous micro production environments. I employ individual-level data on work autonomy to construct {{a measure of the}} extent to which industries are characterized by autonomy in the production process. Results of a cross-country cross-industry analysis confirm that countries with higher levels of social trust have a comparative advantage in high-autonomy industries and vice versa. Results are robust to the possibility of reverse causality. The paper’s key contribution is to provide a link between the microeconomic literature on workplace organization and the comparative macroeconomic literature on social trust...|$|R

2500|$|Central to this {{development}} was <b>Principal</b> William <b>Grant,</b> who, shortly after assuming {{the position of}} principal in 1917, concentrated on appointing a group of teachers described as [...] "eccentric, crotchety, quaint, though widely travelled and highly intelligent" [...] and saw the student enrollment and teacher salaries double, bursaries grow, and a pension plan established {{over the course of}} his tenure.
