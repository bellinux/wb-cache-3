5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} venom {{is thought to}} have {{provided}} the catalyst for the rapid diversification of snakes in the Cenozoic period, particularly to the Colubridae and their colonization of the Americas. Scholars suggest that the reason for this huge expansion was the shift from a mechanical to a biochemical method of subduing prey. Snake venoms attack biological pathways and <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> also targeted by venoms of other taxa; for instance, calcium channel blockers have been found in snakes, spiders, and cone snails, thus suggesting that venom exhibits convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{species of}} Paraceratherium are mainly {{discernible}} through skull characteristics. P. bugtiense and P. orgosensis share {{features such as}} relatively slender maxillae and premaxillae, shallow skull roofs, mastoid-paroccipital <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> relatively thin and placed back on the skull, a lambdoid crest, which extends less back, and an occipital condyle with a horizontal orientation. P. transouralicum has robust maxillae and premaxillae, upturned zygomata, domed frontal bones, thick mastoid-paroccipital processes, a lambdoid crest that extends back, and occipital condyles with a vertical orientation. P. orgosensis is distinguished from the other species by the larger size of its teeth, and distinct crochets of its molars.|$|E

5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> part of the function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E
5|$|Other {{lavender}} to violet-colored corals include Clavulina amethystinoides, {{which is}} so multiply branched so as to appear toothed, and Clavulina amethystina, {{which can only be}} reliably distinguished by its two-spored basidia in comparison to the four-spored basidia of Clavaria species. In Alloclavaria purpurea, the branching is reduced and the color usually a duller purple. The Australian coral Clavaria versatilis is also similar in appearance to Clavaria zollinger, but has branch tips that end in two short and blunt <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> the same color {{as the rest of the}} fruit body. Ramariopsis pulchella—a small, violet-colored coral fungus rarely taller than —could be mistaken for a small C.zollingeri. It has roughly spherical spores measuring 3.0–4.5 by 2.5–3.5μm.|$|E
