5|$|After Brokeback Mountain {{lost the}} Academy Award for Best <b>Picture</b> <b>to</b> Crash, many accused the Academy of {{homophobia}} and {{for making a}} non-groundbreaking choice, and commentators including Kenneth Turan and Nikki Finke derided the Academy's decision. However, Roger Ebert argued that claims of foul play were unjustified and that the better film won.|$|E

These Westinghouse and later RCA cameras sent field-sequential color television <b>pictures</b> <b>to</b> earth. The earth receiving stations included mechanical equipment that converted these <b>pictures</b> <b>to</b> standard television formats.|$|R

5|$|At the University of Illinois, Polish-born {{research}} engineer Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner {{was working}} independently {{on a similar}} process. On June 9, 1922, he gave the first reported U.S. demonstration of a sound-on-film motion <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> members of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. As with Lauste and Tigerstedt, Tykociner's system would never be taken advantage of commercially; however, De Forest's soon would.|$|E
5|$|Eskimo was not {{the first}} {{dramatic}} film to use an all-native cast for the native roles; that was the 1914 silent film In the Land of the Head Hunters. It was, however, the first motion <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> be filmed in the language of a Native American people, and the first feature film shot in Alaska. Ray Mala became nationally famous for his work in Eskimo, and subsequently had a long career as a lead and supporting actor in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|The Revenant has {{received}} numerous award nominations and wins, particularly for DiCaprio's performance, Iñárritu's direction and Lubezki's cinematography. At the 88th Annual Academy Awards, Iñárritu won the Best Director {{award for the}} second time in a row, Emmanuel Lubezki won for the third time in a row the award for Best Cinematography and DiCaprio won his first award for Best Actor. Hardy lost his category to Mark Rylance for Bridge of Spies, and the film itself lost Best <b>Picture</b> <b>to</b> Spotlight.|$|E

5|$|Van Dyke {{intended}} the <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> depict the corrupting influence white culture {{had on the}} Eskimos, much {{as he had done}} in White Shadows in the South Seas. The script originally ended with Mala and Iva escaping onto the ice, only to drown. But producer Hunt Stromberg felt this ending was too downbeat, and changed it in April 1932 to the ending now seen on film.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{continued}} to battle typecasting, turning down well-paying villainous roles {{to develop more}} complex characters. His performance as police inspector Slimane in Walter Wanger's Algiers (1938) was recognized by the National Board of Review. Working with director John Farrow at RKO Pictures in 1939, he created a fine character study as the condemned anarchist in Five Came Back, and portrayed a heroic priest in Full Confession. Calleia was announced to star as Father Damien in an RKO <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> be {{written and directed by}} Farrow, but the project was not realized.|$|E
5|$|Fey's {{projects}} after 2008 {{include a}} voice {{role in the}} English-language version of the Japanese animated film Ponyo. In 2009, she appeared in The Invention of Lying, alongside Ricky Gervais, Jennifer Garner, Rob Lowe, and Christopher Guest. Her next film role was in Shawn Levy's 2010 comedy Date Night, a feature that focuses on a married couple, played by Fey and Steve Carell, who go on a date; however, the night goes awry for the two. Also in the same year, she voiced Roxanne Ritchie, a television reporter, in the DreamWorks animated film Megamind (2010). With a total worldwide gross of US$321million, Megamind is Fey's most commercially successful <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> date. It earned US$173million outside the U.S. and US$148million domestically.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Herman J. Mankiewicz and {{producer}} Sam Jaffe announced {{they were working}} on a <b>picture,</b> <b>to</b> be titled Mad Dog of Europe, which was intended to be a full-scale attack on Hitler. Jaffe had quit his job at RKO Pictures to make the film. Hays summoned the pair to his office and told them to cease production as they were causing needless headaches for the studios. Germany had threatened to seize all the properties of the Hollywood producers in Germany and ban the import of any future American films.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, a {{match with}} {{abbreviated}} rounds was staged between boxers Michael Leonard and Jack Cushing at the Black Maria. Seven-hundred-and-fifty feet worth of images {{or even more}} were shot {{at the rate of}} 30 fps—easily the longest motion <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> date. In August 1894, the film premiered at the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company's parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. A half-dozen expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout. For a planned series of follow-up fights (of which the outcome of at least the first was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight James J. Corbett, stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other Kinetoscope company—the first movie star contract.|$|E
5|$|One {{innovation}} of the Rokeby Venus, {{when compared}} to other large single nude paintings, {{lies in the fact that}} Velázquez depicts a back view of its subject who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in prints by Giulio Campagnola, Agostino Veneziano, Hans Sebald Beham and Theodor de Bry, as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, but then in Rome, of which Velázquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping hermaphrodite (<b>picture</b> <b>to</b> the right above), now in the Louvre, of which a cast was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist. However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original.|$|E

5|$|Shot {{mostly on}} {{location}} on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, Jaws {{was the first}} major motion <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> be shot on the ocean. As a result, the film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks suffered many malfunctions, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures gave the film what was then an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture, over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{reveals that}} the {{procession}} {{was connected to the}} marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen’s six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended to be realistic. In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen’s Horse in 1601.|$|E
5|$|The DVD {{version was}} re-{{released}} in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008. A Laserdisc version of The Phantom Menace {{was released in}} Japan several months before it was available on DVD in the U.S. The Star Wars films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011; The Phantom Menace was restored to improve the picture quality and remove the magnification present on the previous DVD release, restoring approximately 8 percent of the <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> the frame. In the Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, the Yoda puppet was replaced with a CGI model, making it consistent with the other films of the prequel trilogy.|$|E

5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> {{either a}} UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of}} the machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback {{in the way that they}} handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.|$|E
5|$|The era of American film {{production}} {{from the early}} sound era to {{the enforcement of the}} Hays Code in 1934 is denoted as Pre-Code Hollywood. The era contained violence and crime in pictures which would not be seen again until decades later. Although the Hays office had specifically recommended removing profanity, the drug trade, and prostitution from pictures, it had never officially recommended against depictions of violence in any form in the 1920s. State censor boards, however, created their own guidelines, and New York in particular developed a list of violent material which had to be removed for a <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> be shown in the state. Two main types of crime films were released during the period: the gangster picture and the prison film.|$|E
5|$|Today, the Alaska Volcano Observatory {{monitors}} {{activity at}} Mount Cleveland using satellite imagery. Cloud cover often obscures the volcano, which makes many events difficult to follow. In addition, the low {{resolution of the}} satellite imagery allows minor events, which do not make an impression on the satellite <b>picture,</b> <b>to</b> pass unnoticed. There are no seismic or geophysical instruments on the mountain (the nearest are in Nikolski), and some eruptions are first observed by pilots flying over the volcano. A field {{study was conducted in}} late 2001, and an automatic system based on thermal anomalies was implemented following eruptive events in 2005. In recent years the Alaska Volcano Observatory has made an effort to expand volcanic coverage westward along the Aleutian Arc.|$|E
