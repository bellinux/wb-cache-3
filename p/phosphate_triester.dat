The Nordic Expert Group for Criteria Documentation of Health Risks from Chemicals. 143. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> with flame {{retardant}} properties. Arbete och Hälsa 2010; 44 (6) : 1 - 220. This document comprises the following phosphate triesters: Tricresyl phosphate TCP Triethyl phosphate TEP Tris(2 -butoxyethyl) phosphate TBEP TIPP Tri-n-butyl phosphate TBP Triisopropylated phenyl phosphate/ isopropylated triphenyl phosphate Tris(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate TCEP Tris(monochloropropyl) phosphate TMCPP Tris(1, 3 -dichloro- 2 -propyl) phosphate TDCPP Triphenyl phosphate TPP Tris(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate TEHP The <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> are mainly used as {{flame retardant}}s and plasticisers. They differ widely in physical properties {{as well as}} toxicological profiles and toxic potency. Most of these esters have low vapour pressures and are presumably absorbed to a substantial degree by the skin. The dermal exposure route may therefore {{be more important than}} inhalation. Human toxicological data on the <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> are scarce, particularly regarding occupational inhalation exposure. Based on animal data, the critical effects vary depending on substance and include cholinesterase inhibition, neurotoxicity, cancer, reproductive toxicity, and liver and kidney toxicity. Organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) has been associated with exposure to some triaryl phosphates. The most well-known example is the TCP isomer tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP), which has been associated with numerous cases of poisoning worldwide. The TOCP content is therefore kept at a very low level in commercial phosphate ester products of today. Commercial products of TCP, TIPP and TPP may, however, contain other triaryl phosphates associated with OPIDN. Several other <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> have shown other (non- OPIDN) neurotoxic effects in animals. Some of the esters covered in this document exhibit carcinogenic effects in animals (TBP, TCEP, TDCPP and TEHP), whereas TCP shows no such potential. The other esters have not been properly tested. The lowest observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) of the <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> range from 5 to 600 mg/kg bw/day. The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs), only identified for TBEP, TBP and one commercial product of TIPP, are in the range 9 - 20 mg/kg bw/day.

Cu(II)) in comicelles with CTANO(3) was studied toward a series of <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> and diesters that were either neutral (1 - 7) or cationic and amphiphilic (8 - 10). While the pseudo-first-order rate constants at [catalyst] = 1 x 10 (- 3) M are larger (ca. one order of magnitude) for the micellar catalyst, the second-order rate constants are higher for the hydrophilic catalyst. With <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters,</b> regardless {{of the structure of}} the substrate, TMED C 1 (.) Cu(II) -bound OH- is a better nucleophile than free OH-, while TMED C- 16.

Cu(II) and TMED C- 16. Cu(II) is a better nucleophile than free OH-. Partial neutralization of the negative charge of the substrate may explain this behavior. In all cases the amphiphilic substrates are intrinsically more reactive than the neutral ones.

Programa de Pós-Graduação em QuímicaAs substituições nucleofílicas em ésteres de fosfato são amplamente estudadas na {{literatura}}. Os parâmetros estudados nestas reações são: sensibilidade ao grupo de saída e aos nucleófilos, medidas através de ?LG e ?Nu, respectivamente, a partir de Relações Lineares de Energia Livre (RLELs) de Brønsted. Quanto à reatividade de triésteres de fosfato, poucas evidências encontradas na literatura sugerem que grupos espectadores têm mínima influência. Neste trabalho foram preparados e estudadas as reações de hidrólise dos triésteres de fosfato tri-piridil fosfato (TPP), metil-di-piridil fosfato, di-etil-piridil fosfato, tri- 4 -nitrofenil fosfato (T 4 NPP), tri- 3 -nitrofenil fosfato (T 3 NPP) e tri- 3 -clorofenil fosfato (T 3 ClPP). A alta constante de hidrólise espontânea do TPP (2, 2 × 10 - 5 s- 1) e o alto efeito isotópico (kH/kD = 3, 15) foram, inicialmente, interpretados como evidências de catálise básica geral intramolecular. Porém, estudos cinéticos posteriores com os triésteres triarílicos T 4 NPP, T 3 NPP e T 3 ClPP mostraram que os mesmos são mais reativos que sistemas di-alquil arílicos. Assim, os grupos espectadores, alquil ou aril, podem aparentemente contribuir em diferentes extensões para a reatividade dos triésteres de fosfato. A partir de RLELs de Brønsted, a influência dos grupos espectadores pode ser determinada e um novo parâmetro definido como ?NLG foi proposto para caracterizar a participação destes grupos. In {{the present}} work <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> pyridyl tri-phosphate (9), di-ethyl- 2 -pyridyl phosphate (22), methyl-di- 2 -pyridyl (23) phosphate, tri- 3 -nitrophenyl phosphate (25 a) tri- 4 -nitrophenyl phosphate (25 b), and tri- 3 -chlorophenyl phosphate (25 c) were prepared. The spontaneous hydrolysis of the reactions containing the pyridyl group were studied under different conditions of temperature, pH and solvent. Due to low water solubility of the 25 a-c, the hydrolyses reactions were followed in different mixtures of acetonitrile / water {{in order to}} obtain, by extrapolation, the constants of the spontaneous hydrolysis of each triester. The high value of spontaneous hydrolysis constant of triester 9 (2. 2 × 10 - 5 s- 1) and the high isotope effect (kH / kD = 3. 15) were initially interpreted as evidence for intramolecular general base catalysis. However, subsequent kinetic studies with the triaryl phosphates 25 a-c showed that these compounds are considerably more reactive than the corresponding dialkyl aryl system. Thus, the spectator groups, alkyl or aryl, can apparently contribute in different extents to the reactivity of <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters.</b> So, in nucleophilic substitution reactions of <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters,</b> besides the sensitivities to the leaving group and to the nucleophile, measured as ßLG and ßNu, respectively, the role of spectator groups becomes important. From Brønsted type linear free energy relationship # the influence of spectator groups can be determined, and a new parameter defined as ßNLG was proposed to characterize the participation of spectator groups. Regarding the reactivity of <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters,</b> evidence {{found in the literature}} suggested that spectators groups had little or no influence and the correlation of Khan and Kirby had been used to calculate or predict the reactivity of these compounds. However, new evidence presented in this work indicate that triaryl <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> have reactivities that depend upon the spectator groups. The values of ßNLG found for triaryl and dialkyl aryl systems were 0. 29 and 0. 60 respectively. In fact, despite suffering smaller influence from spectator groups, the triaryl <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> are more reactive than di-alkyl aryl triesters and, the latter are more influenced by spectator groups. Finally, {{the results of this study}} add to existing literature new linear free energy correlations, clarifying and quantifying the effects of spectator groups in the hydrolysis of <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters,</b> aspects previously considered unimportant in this type of reaction...|$|R

50|$|Once {{azinphos-methyl}} {{is absorbed}} {{it can cause}} neurotoxic effects, like other organophosphate insecticides. At high concentrations AzM itself can be toxic because it can function as a acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor.

Gutoxon can react with a serine hydroxyl group at the active site of the AChE. The active site is then blocked and AChE is inactivated. Under normal circumstances acetylcholinesterase rapidly and efficiently degrades the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and thereby terminates the biological activity of acetylcholine. Inhibition of AChE results in an immediate accumulation of free unbound ACh at the ending of all cholinergic nerves, which leads to overstimulation of the nervous system.|$|E

50|$|To {{prevent the}} toxic effects, AzM can be biotransformed. Although AzM (in figure 2 named guthion) can be bioactivated by a {{cytochrome}} P450 (CYP450)-mediated desulfuration to its <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> or oxon(gutoxon), {{it may also}} be detoxified by CYP itself (reaction 2 in figure 2). CYP450 is namely able to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of the P-S-C bond in AzM to yield DMTP and MMBA.The other pathways of detoxification involves glutathione (GSH)-mediated dealkylation via cleavage of the P-O-CH3 bond, which than forms mono-demethylated AzM and GS-CH3 (reaction 3 in figure 2). This mono-demethylated AzM may be further demethylated to di-demethylated AzM and again GS-CH3 (reaction 4 in figure 2). AzM also may undergo glutathione-catalyzed dearylation which forms DMPDT and glutathione-conjugated mercaptomethyl benzazimide (reaction 5 in figure 2)Gutoxon, the compound that mainly causes AzM to be toxic, can also be detoxified. Gutoxon can again be detoxified with the help of CYP450. CYP450 catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of gutoxon, which than yields DMP and MMBA (reaction 6 in figure 2). Other detoxification pathways of gutoxon are via glutathione-mediated dealkylation, which goes via cleavage of the P-O-CH3 bond to form demethylated AzM and GS-CH3 (reaction 7 in figure 2), and via glutathione-catalyzed dearylation to yield DMTP and glutathione-conjugated mercaptomethyl benzazimide (reaction 8 in figure 2).|$|E

Inicialmente, estes catalisadores foram empregados na degradação do {{paraoxon}} metílico (DMPNPP). Os resultados serviram para identificar a eficiência mais pronunciada do catalisador com a fase espinélio (MgAl 2 O 4) incipiente, o qual permitiu um aumento na velocidade da reação de aproximadamente 7 × 105 vezes em relação à reação em propan- 1 -ol sem a presença do catalisador. A etapa seguinte envolveu estudos de reações de propanólise com uma série de triésteres e diésteres de fosfato e o catalisador MgAl 2 O 4. O foco foi avaliar os efeitos da natureza química dos substratos aliados às propriedades da superfície. Os experimentos indicaram que existe uma relação direta entre as propriedades texturais e estruturais dos catalisadores com as especificidades das interações catalisador-substrato. Triésteres e diésteres de fosfato com grupos de saída piridin- 2 -ol apresentaram um efeito catalítico diferenciado. Isso sugere que os centros bimetálicos do catalisador espinélio devem favorecer a interação com os grupos piridin- 2 -ol. Por fim, os estudos mostraram que o catalisador espinélio atua eficientemente na degradação de triésteres de fosfato, gerando metabólitos menos tóxicos, sendo esse um dos objetivos fundamentais do presente trabalho. Abstract: The {{development of}} catalysts that {{are active in}} the cleavage between phosphorous and oxygen bond has always been strongly appealing due to the properties related with the chemical stability of such bonds. The proposal of this Thesis {{is focused on the}} preparation and characterization of solid catalysts in the form of Al 2 O 3 -MgO mixtures with increasing amounts of MgO. The reactions were performed under heterogeneous catalysis conditions with the use of 1 - propanol as solvent and the mixed oxides. Firstly, these catalysts were employed in the degradation of methyl paraoxon (DMPNPhP). The results enabled identification of the spinel incipient phase (MgAl 2 O 4) as the best catalyst, allowing a constant rate increase of about 7 × 105 times when compared to the reaction with 1 -propanol without catalyst. DMPNPhP was used as standard substrate in further studies of the effect of the thermal treatment conditions of the catalyst; the effect of water in the reaction system and substrate concentration optimization studies for maximum catalytic efficiency. The next step involved studies of the propanolysis reaction with a series of <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> and diesters using MgAl 2 O 4 as the catalyst. At this point, the focus was to evaluate the effects of the chemical nature of the substrates allied with the surface effects, such as the limitations in the catalytic effect, for exemple steric hindrance factors important for the bulky molecules, such as the triaryl triesters. The experimental results have indicated that there is a direct relationship between the structural and textural properties and the specificities of the catalyst-substrate interactions. <b>Triester</b> and diester <b>phosphates</b> with 2 -hydroxypyridine derivatives leaving group have shown different catalytic effects compared to substrates which have leaving groups with very close pKa values. This suggests that the spinel catalyst bimetallic centers should favor the interaction with such groups and this may additionally contribute in the transition state stabilization of these reactions.

The first {{synthesis of}} the enantiomeric fluorosuccinic acids has been accomplished, and a stereochemical analysis has shown that synthesis via esterified malate precursors using diethylamino- sulphurtrifluoride gives inversion of configuration, whereas prep- aration via aspartic acid and polyhydrogen fluoride in pyridine gives retention of configuration. The circular dichroism spectra of the fluorosuccinic acids are anomalous, being the first example of such behaviour in a-substituted carboxylic acids and derivatives. A previously assigned configuration of a Pseudomonal metabolite (+) - fluorosuccinic acid has been corrected. The fluorosuccinic acids are not substrates for malic enzyme, but are potent inhibitors of fumarase. Using (2 S) -fluorosuccinic acid as a mechanistic probe the fumarase reaction is identified as a bimolecular E 2 elimination. A stereochemical analysis of enzymic phosphoryl transfer reactions using CD spectroscopy has been investigated, and a new synthesis of inorganic pyrophosphate used to prepare P 1 =[(S) - 16 0, 17 0, 18 0]-pyrophosphate whose 31 P n. m. r. spectrum is discussed. The first example of 31 p- 17 o coupling as observed by 31 P n. m. r. is demonstrated. - The magnitude of the 31 P- 18 0 isotope shift {{is dependent on the}} nature of the phosphorus to oxygen bond. An elegant method for establishing the isotopic configuration of oxygen chiral phosphates by n. m. r. has been developed, requiring the synthesis of D -glucose- 6 [(S) - 16 0, 17 0, 18 0]-phosphate, adenosine- 5 '- [(S) - 16 0, 17 0, 18 0]-phosphate, and their six membered cyclic <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters.</b> Chemical cyclisation of these molecules occurs both with racemisation and inversion of configuration at phosphorus.

40|$|The {{generation}} of synthetic oligonucleotides {{is dependent on}} an efficient solid-phase synthesis methodology. This thesis evaluates the 2 '-O -levulinyl (Lv) and 2 '-O-monomethoxytrityl (MMT) ribonucleosides, as possible synthons for RNA and branched RNA synthesis. A key feature of this RNA and bRNA synthesis procedure is their removal while still attached to the solid support and under conditions that prevent isomerization or cleavage of the nascent strands. For the first time, the stability of 3 '- 5 '-internucleotide <b>phosphate</b> <b>triesters</b> (and diesters) adjacent to a ribose 2 '-hydroxyl group was determined on a solid support. These studies are not only relevant to the proper assembly of branched and linear RNA species, {{but also to the}} stability of an unusual branched RNA species ("RNA X") proposed to form during the pre-mRNA splicing reactions in vitro. These studies are also important to the development of large quantities of native and chemically modified short interfering RNA (siRNA) for animal and human studies. The 2 '-O-Lv and 2 '-O-MMT ribonucleoside monomers served as building blocks for the assembly of a series of branched nucleic acid species (bRNA, bDNA, msDNA and hyperbranched or "dendritic" DNA/RNA) with discrete length, base composition and structure. These structures were synthesized via an iterative divergent-growth strategy, which facilitates the regioselective branching, deblocking and chain lengthening steps from a branchpoint core. These structures served as useful materials (bio-probes) as demonstrated by the biological studies performed with E. coli RNaseH and the yeast lariat RNA debranching enzyme (yDBr 1). These studies not only led to the identification of novel branched nucleic acid inhibitors of yDBR 1 and RNase H, but also provided new insights about the substrate specificity of these important enzymes. This thesis also describes the synthesis of a new nucleic acid form, the so-called "oxepane nucleic acids" (ONAs), in which the pentofuranose ring of DNA and RNA was replaced with a 7 -membered heptose sugar ring. ONA were found to be much more resistant towards nuclease degradation than natural DNA, an important feature if these analogues are to be used in biological media. Furthermore, ONAs exhibited cross-pairing with complementary RNA and were found to elicit E. coli RNaseH mediated degradation of the RNA strand. These finding are significant because oligonucleotide-directed RNase H degradation of the target RNA is a key determinant for the gene-specific inhibitory potency of antisense oligonucleotides. When comparing the rates of RNase H-mediated degradation induced by 5 (furanose), 6 (2 '-ene-pyranose) and 7 (oxepane) membered ring oligonucleotides, the following trend was observed: DNA > 2 '-ene-pyranose NA > ONA. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of our current understanding of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, particularly with regard to the required flexibility of the oligonucleotide strands that bind to the RNA target. Hence, ONAs are useful tools for biological studies and provide new insights into the structure/function of natural and alternative genetic systems...|$|R

The base-typical fragment ions produced by pyrolysis at 280 degrees C of the polymer-bound oligonucleotide triesters {{in the mass}} spectrometer permit the analytical monitoring of DNA chain growth, using simple mathematical operations. The base composition can be determined directly from the polymer. In addition, minor nucleosides can easily be detected...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{naturally}} occurring cyclodextrins and their derivatives {{have been developed}} as miniature reaction vessels, to manipulate the outcomes of chemical transformations at the molecular level. In this manner, the rate of hydrolysis of a <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> has been en-hanced by almost five orders of magnitude, and the ratios of products obtained from elec-trophilic aromatic substitution reactions, from competing reactions to give indigoid dyes, and from nitrile oxide cycloadditions have all been changed, by factors of up to 3500 times...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} novel {{phosphinate}} and <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> derivatives of the anti-viral nucleoside analogue araA have been prepared. Spectroscopic and analytical data {{have been collected}} on both the reagents and the nucleotides. An in vitro assay indicated inhibition of DNA synthesis by mammalian cells, by each of the nucleotide derivatives, in the range 3 - 30 microM. Inhibition was reduced, but not abolished, for the phosphinates relative to the phosphates. These {{results are consistent with}} a mode of action involving release of the free nucleoside araA and the nucleotide araAMP...|$|E
40|$|Pronucleotides {{represent}} a promising tool {{to improve the}} biological activity of nucleoside analogs in antiviral and cancer chemotherapy. The cycloSal-approach {{is one of several}} conceptually different pronucleotide systems. This approach can be applied to various nucleoside analogs. A salicyl alcohol as a cyclic bifunctional masking unit is used, and shown to afford a chemically driven release of the particular nucleotide from the lipophilic <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> precursor molecule. A conceptual extension of the cycloSal-approach results in the design of "lock-in"-cycloSal-derivatives. The cycloSal-approach is not restricted to the delivery of bioactive nucleotides but also useful for the intracellular delivery of hexose- 1 -phosphates. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs part of {{our effort}} to deliver masked {{phosphates}} inside living cells we have discovered that certain <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> derivatives of the inactive nucleoside analogue, dideoxy uridine (ddU) are inhibitors of HIV replication at μM levels. Moreover, we note that certain phosphoramidate derivatives retain their activity in thymidine kinase-deficient cells, which indicates that they do indeed act by intracellular release of the free nucleotide, and that they successfully by-pass the nucleoside kinase. The increased structural freedom in drug design which this allows may have implications {{for dealing with the}} emergence of resistance and may stimulate the discovery of improved therapeutic agents...|$|E
40|$|Base {{modification}} during solid-phase phosphoramidite {{synthesis of}} oligodeoxynucleotides has been investigated. We have discovered chemical modification that converts dG and dG-containing oligomers to a fluorescent form. This modification {{has been linked}} to N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), an acylation catalyst, which can displace <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> adducts at the 6 -position of guanine. Further, we have found that this fluorescent intermediate can be converted in ammonium hydroxide solution to 2, 6 diaminopurine deoxyribonucleoside (2, 6 DAP), a potentially mutagenic nucleoside analog. We have shown that N-methylimidazole (NMI) in place of DMAP eliminates the fluorescent species and reduces 2, 6 DAP contamination...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{evidence that}} a reduced pyrrolo[1, 2 -a]benzimidazole (PBI) cleaves DNA {{as a result of}} phosphate alkylation followed by hydrolysis of the resulting <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester.</b> The base-pair specificity of the phosphate alkylation results from Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonding of the reduced PBI in the major groove at only A. T and G. C base pairs. Alkylated phosphates were detected by 31 P NMR and the cleavage products were detected by 1 H NMR and HPLC. Evidence is also presented that a reduced PBI interacts with DNA in the major groove rather than in the minor groove or by intercalation...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} novel <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> {{derivatives}} of the anti-cancer nucleoside analogue araC {{have been prepared}} by a rapid 2 -step procedure, not necessitating prior sugar protection. Spectroscopic and lipophilicity data have been collected on these compounds. An in vitro assay indicated inhibition of thymidine incorporation by mammalian epithelial cells, by each of these compounds, in the range 3 - 300 /xM. Moreover, the degree of inhibition showed a close correlation to chemical structure; in particular, {{there was a clear}} relationship between inhibition of thymidine incorporation and log(P). These results are consistent with cellular penetration by the intact phosphate triesters and intracellular action by an unspecified mechanism. Triethyl phosphate is inactive under the conditions of the test...|$|E
40|$|Various 5 'O-N-protected deoxynucleoside- 3 '-O-beta-cyanoethyl-N,N-dialkylamino-/N- morpholinophosphoramidites were {{prepared}} from beta-cyanoethyl monochlorophosphoramidites of N,N-dimethylamine, N,N-diisopropylamine and N-morpholine. These active deoxynucleoside phosphates have successfully {{been used for}} oligodeoxynucleotide synthesis on controlled pore glass as polymer support and are very suitable for automated DNA-synthesis due to their stability in solution. The intermediate dichloro-beta- cyanoethoxyphosphine can easily be prepared free from any PC 1 (3) contamination. The active monomers obtained from beta-cyanoethyl monochloro N,N- diisopropylaminophosphoramidites are favoured. Cleavage of the oligonucleotide chain from the polymer support, N-deacylation and deprotection of beta-cyanoethyl group from the <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> moiety can be performed in one step with concentrated aqueous ammonia.

40|$|A rapid, simple, and {{sensitive}} high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) method {{was developed and}} validated for quantitative analysis of 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythyrmidine (zidovudine, AZT) diaryl <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> pro-drugs, in rat plasma using 2 ', 3 '-dideoxy- 2 ' 3 '-didehydrothymidine (d 4 T) as internal standard (IS). The analytes were extracted from rat plasma with methanol after protein precipitation. The compounds were separated by HPLC with gradient elution (on a Shim-pack VP-ODS C- 18 analytical column using a mobile phase of methanol/ 10 mM ammonium acetate). All the analytes were detected in positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The method was validated and the specificity, linearity, lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), precision, accuracy, recoveries and stability were determined. LLOQs were 10 ng mL(- 1) for M 1, M 2, M 3, M 4. and M 5, respectively. Cori-elation coefficient (r) values for the linear range of 10 - 10, 000 ng mL(- 1) were greater than 0. 999 for all the analytes. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy were higher than 7. 13 %. The relative and absolute recovery was above 72 % and no matrix effects were observed for all the analytes. This validated method provides a modern, rapid, and robust procedure for the pharmacokinetic studies of the pro-drugs after intravenous administration to rats. Some important results of AZT diaryl <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> pro-drugs concerning chemical effect on pharmacokinetic performance are also studied. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractNucleoside analogues {{previously}} {{found to}} be inactive against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be activated by simple chemical derivatisation. As part of our effort to deliver masked phosphates inside living cells we have discovered that certain <b>phosphate</b> <b>triester</b> derivatives of inactive nucleoside analogues become inhibitors of HIV replication. This discovery underlies {{the importance of the}} masked phosphate approach, and has significant implications for the future design of chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogues. If highly modified nucleoside analogues may be active without the intervention of nucleoside kinase enzymes, major advantage may accrue in terms of low toxicity and enhanced selectivity. Moreover, the increased structural freedom may have implications for dealing with the emergence of resistance. The concept herein described as ‘kinase bypass’ may thus stimulate the discovery {{of a new generation of}} antiviral agents...|$|E
