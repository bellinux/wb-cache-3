30|$|This {{study has}} shown that CBCCs, as ECD structures, which are {{established}} and managed by communities are playing {{an important role in}} communities by providing a pre-primary school learning environment and in 2006 / 2007 over 400, 000 children were attending these CBCCs. While Malawi specific studies have not been done to determine the impact of CBCCs on the future development of the child, it is evident that these CBCCs ensure that children have access to <b>pre-school</b> <b>education,</b> health <b>services</b> and nutrition. In addition to this, the CBCCs admit a considerable proportion of orphaned children hence they constitute {{an important component of the}} national response to the HIV and AIDS epidemic. Apart from the training of caregivers which is the responsibility of the national authorities, all other activities within CBCCs are being managed by community members; hence such a community-based and a community-owned approach to ECD programming can be sustainable as long as communities are mobilised to support and own the process. There is a need for the Governments of Malawi to invest in ECD in order to meet the MDG for poverty reduction, education and health.|$|R
