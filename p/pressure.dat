40|$|Drawing upon {{organizational}} culture and institutional theory, this study investigates how institutional <b>pressures</b> motivate {{the firm to}} adopt Internet-enabled Supply Chain Management systems (eSCM) and how such effects are moderated by {{organizational culture}}. The results of a survey of 131 firms suggest that the dimensions of institutional <b>pressures</b> (i. e., normative, mimetic, and coercive <b>pressures)</b> have differential effects on eSCM adoption intention. While mimetic <b>pressures</b> {{are not related to}} eSCM adoption intention, normative and coercive <b>pressures</b> are positively associated with eSCM adoption intention. In addition, organizational culture (i. e., flexibility orientation and control orientation) plays different roles in the relationships between these three dimensions of institutional <b>pressures</b> and eSCM adoption intention. While flexibility orientation negatively moderates the effects of coercive <b>pressures</b> and positively moderates the effects of mimetic <b>pressures,</b> control orientation positively moderates the effects of coercive and normative <b>pressures</b> and negatively moderates the effects of mimetic <b>pressures.</b> Implications and suggestions for future research are provided.

5|$|Climatic and osmotic <b>pressure</b> places {{physiological}} {{constraints on}} organisms, {{especially those that}} fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water <b>pressure</b> differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing <b>pressure</b> and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by osmotic <b>pressure</b> gradients. Water <b>pressure</b> {{in the depths of}} oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water <b>pressure</b> differences.

40|$|AbstractWe {{classified}} homogenous river types across Europe {{and searched}} for fish metrics qualified to show responses to specific <b>pressures</b> (hydromorphological <b>pressures</b> or water quality <b>pressures)</b> vs. multiple <b>pressures</b> in these river types. We analysed fish taxa lists from 3105 sites in 16 ecoregions and 14 countries. Sites were pre-classified for 15 selected <b>pressures</b> to separate unimpacted from impacted sites. Hierarchical cluster {{analysis was used}} to split unimpacted sites into four homogenous river types based on species composition and geographical location. Classification trees were employed to predict associated river types for impacted sites with four environmental variables. We defined a set of 129 candidate fish metrics to select the best reacting metrics for each river type. The candidate metrics represented tolerances/intolerances of species associated with six metric types: habitat, migration, water quality sensitivity, reproduction, trophic level and biodiversity. The results showed that 17 uncorrelated metrics reacted to <b>pressures</b> in the four river types. Metrics responded specifically to water quality <b>pressures</b> and hydromorphological <b>pressures</b> in three river types and to multiple <b>pressures</b> in all river types. Four metrics associated with water quality sensitivity showed a significant reaction in up to three river types, whereas 13 metrics were specific to individual river types. Our results contribute to the better understanding of fish assemblage response to human <b>pressures</b> at a pan-European scale. The results are especially important for European river management and restoration, as it is necessary to uncover underlying processes and effects of human <b>pressures</b> on aquatic communities...|$|R
