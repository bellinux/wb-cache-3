Some MPs suggested that the live telecast should not be scrapped to let the <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> was really happening in the Dewan Rakyat and judge the MPs in conducting the people's voice in the parliament. The live telecast of the proceedings is to be continued {{to show that there}} is transparency and to let the people know how the MPs are behaving and debating.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{vocal music}} has {{traditionally}} been sung in a thin, non resonant voice or in falsetto and is usually solo rather than choral. All traditional Chinese music is melodic rather than harmonic. Chinese vocal music probably developed from sung poems and verses with music. Instrumental pieces played on an erhu or dizi are popular, and are often available outside of China, but the pipa and zheng music, which are more traditional, are more popular in China itself. The qin {{is perhaps the most}} revered instrument in China, even though very few <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it is or seen and heard one being played. The zheng, a form of zither, is most popular in Henan, Chaozhou, Hakka and Shandong. The pipa, a kind of lute, believed to have been introduced from the Arabian Peninsula area during the 6th century and adapted to suit Chinese tastes, is most popular in Shanghai and surrounding areas.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} 'loving well' was further {{developed}} when the band made {{a trip to}} the Dominican Republic and were inspired by the resilient spirits of people living in poverty on the island. When the band started to write the songs for the album, they joined the character of 'Mr. Lovewell' and the concept of 'loving well', creating the overall message of love that is present in the album. Millard stated the band's dream for the album was [...] "to inspire others to ‘pay it forward’ to the cross. It doesn’t have to be about major sacrifices. Just let your life become such that <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you stand for".|$|E

On 25 June 1996 Fox Lorber released The Killer along with Hard Boiled as a double feature on home video. The Killer {{was released}} on DVD by The Criterion Collection on 1 April 1998 in the original Cantonese language track with English subtitles.

500|$|Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Hair" [...] on The Paul O'Grady Show on June 17,2011. The {{song was}} the first of the four performances planned, and Gaga opened the show with her sitting on the piano. She appeared bald but wore a teal colored fringed dress, and sang an acoustic version of [...] "Hair", while staring at a teal colored wig placed in front of her. The piano on which she sang was covered with brown, curly hair and she was surrounded by flames. Halfway through the performance, Gaga took the wig and placed it on her head. Ryan Love of Digital Spy had a preview of the recording of the show, and commented that when [...] "it's just GaGa [...] on the piano, you can't help but be impressed." [...] Cynthia Robinson from The Huffington Post theorized that Gaga pretending to be bald was not a [...] "fashion statement", instead she was [...] "saying something about shedding that skin, that costume, that barrier that she created with all of her vaunted costumes—at least so that <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> she is inside before putting it back on." ...|$|E
500|$|Keenan is {{featured}} in several segments of Mr. Show, {{most notably in}} the Ronnie Dobbs sketch presented in the first season. In one scene, he is seen being arrested with Dobbs. Later in the sketch he {{is featured}} wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band [...] "Puscifer". When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies [...] "Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty but... he knows it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?" [...] He also appears in episode 2.6, [...] "The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop", {{as one of the}} viewers of Coupon: The Movie, saying [...] "Now is not the time", waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater. Later, Keenan would sing on a track for the Mr. Show incarnation Run Ronnie Run, and appear in the [...] "music video sex scene" [...] on its DVD. Keenan appeared {{on the cover of the}} May/June 1999 issue of Pop Smear magazine, portraying Charles Manson as part of a photo essay, imitating a famous Life magazine portrait. He also appeared as Satan in the 2002 film Bikini Bandits and its 2004 sequel Bikini Bandits 2: Golden Rod. When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, [...] "Oh, Manson. He's a real person. <b>People</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he looks like, how he talked.

2500|$|Like other {{technology}} in Snow Crash, Rat Things are {{powered by a}} nuclear isotope battery, which requires extensive cooling due to the massive amount of waste heat generated. The Rat Things are passively cooled by a system of heat sinks that are only effective when the Rat Thing runs fast enough to move ambient air across the fins. To prevent rapid overheating when stationary, they must remain in their hutches (effectively dog houses), where they are continuously sprayed by jets of refrigerant. Through running, Rat Things are capable of breaking the sound barrier (about 768mph at sea level), although this is not typically permitted by Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong's [...] "good neighbor" [...] policies due to noise reasons. Because they must be either moving at high velocities or actively cooling in their hutches, Rat Things are rarely seen by human eyes and few <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they look like.|$|E
2500|$|In later {{collections}} Lagerfeld {{chose to}} break away from the ladylike look of Chanel and began to experiment with fabrics and styles. During the 1980s, more than 40 Chanel boutiques opened worldwide. By the end of the 1980s, the boutiques sold goods ranging from US$200-per-ounce perfume, US$225 ballerina slippers to US$11,000 dresses and US$2,000 leather handbags. Chanel cosmetics and fragrances were distributed only by Chanel outlets. Chanel marketer Jean Hoehn explained the firm's approach, saying, [...] "We introduce a new fragrance every 10 years, not every three minutes like many competitors. We don't confuse the consumer. With Chanel, <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to expect. And they keep coming back to us, at all ages, as they enter and leave the market." [...] The 1984 launch of a new fragrance, in honor of the founder, Coco, continued the label's success. In 1986, the House of Chanel struck a deal with watchmakers and in 1987, the first Chanel watch debuted. By the end of the decade, Alain moved the offices to New York City.|$|E
2500|$|On October 6, 2014 {{the results}} of the study were {{published}} in the journal Resuscitation. Among those who reported a perception of awareness and completed further interviews, 46 per cent experienced a broad range of mental recollections in relation to death that were not compatible with the commonly used term of NDEs. These included fearful and persecutory experiences. Only 9 per cent had experiences compatible with NDEs and 2 per cent exhibited full awareness compatible with OBEs with explicit recall of 'seeing' and 'hearing' events. One case was validated and timed using auditory stimuli during cardiac arrest. According to Caroline Watt [...] "The one ‘verifiable period of conscious awareness’ that Parnia was able to report did not relate to this objective test. Rather, it was a patient giving a supposedly accurate report of events during his resuscitation. He didn’t identify the pictures, he described the defibrillator machine noise. But that’s not very impressive since many <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> goes on in an emergency room setting from seeing recreations on television." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Eminem also {{addressed}} the mindstate he had {{while working on}} 2009's Relapse saying: [...] "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if <b>people</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E
