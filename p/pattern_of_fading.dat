5000|$|Thomagata Patera is {{a volcano}} on Jupiter's moon Io. It {{is located on}} Io's anti-Jupiter {{hemisphere}} at , {{to the east of}} the nearby active volcanoes Volund and Zamama. Thomagata is a kidney-shaped Ionian patera, a type of volcanic crater similar to a caldera, 56 km long, 26 km wide, and 1.2 - 1.6 km deep. [...] The volcano is currently inactive as a thermal hotspot has never been observed at Thomagata and the bright floor of the patera suggests that it is cold enough for sulfur dioxide and sulfur to condense. [...] Thomagata is located near the center of a low, 100 km wide mesa. The edge of the mesa rises 200 m above the surrounding plains, however the slope up to the edge of Thomagata Patera is unknown. If the floor of the patera is at the same level as the surrounding plains, the western slope of the mesa would have a grade of 2°. [...] The morphology of this mesa and the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>faded</b> lava flows along its slopes radiating away from Thomagata (at least on its eastern side) suggest that Thomagata Patera and the mesa that surrounds it may be a shield volcano, also called a tholus on Io. [...] The irregular margin of the mesa and the lack of debris at the base of its basal scarp suggest that it was modified by sulfur dioxide sapping.|$|R
40|$|VHF {{amplitude}} transmissions, from a {{large number}} of non-synchronous satellite passes, were recorded to deduce ionospheric scintillation occurrences from low to auroral latitudes during a geomagnetically quiet period. An intense region of random scintillationproducing irregularities was centred near a mid-latitude station. Simultaneously, the records obtained from satellites moving in meridional planes indicated the presence <b>of</b> pronounced, regular <b>fading,</b> or quasiperiodic (QP) scintillations, at large zenith angles and equatorwards of the station. Other stations, positioned away from scintillationproducing irregularities, recorded signals which were free of QP scintillations. It is suggested that reflection and interference of the transmitted radio waves, due to the presence of tilted ionization surfaces embedded in the random scintillation-producing structure, are responsible for the preferential occurrence <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> the regular <b>fading...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ability {{to persist}} in human macrophages {{is central to the}} {{virulence}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is not invariable among various strains. Differential gene expression that is associated with phenotypic virulence may provide additional information of virulent genes involved in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis, which is not fully elucidated. Three hypervirulent strains of M. tuberculosis isolated from patients suffering with tuberculous meningitis were shown to grow more rapidly inside human macrophages in a previous study. In the current investigation, expression of 7 mycobacterial genes (fadE 28, mce 1 A, mymA, acr, sigA, sugC, and Rv 3723) of these strains during ex vivo macrophage challenge and in vitro acid shock was quantified by real-time PCR. Using rrs gene as a normalisation gene, fadE 28 gene exhibited differential gene expression that is associated with phenotypic virulence, whereas the other 6 genes showed indistinguishable expression <b>patterns.</b> Up-regulation <b>of</b> <b>fadE</b> 28 gene in the hypervirulent strains may account for virulence by increasing the efficiency of beta-oxidation, which is important for the persistence in macrophages as M. tuberculosis uses fatty acids preferably inside phagosome <b>of</b> macrophages. The <b>fadE</b> 28 gene, together with its adjacent genes may also be critical in the process of lipid modification that could facilitate parasitism in human macrophages. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Allison, Holly's best friend, wrote some of the lyrics, though his name never appeared in the songwriting credits. Joe Mauldin played the double bass on this recording.

However, the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> in an actual wireless communication link depend on the particular deterministic geometry of reflectors that the signal encounters. In this paper, we present a deterministic model of multipath propagation, and we apply the model to two reflector geometries: a circular <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> reflectors and a parabolic <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> reflectors. Numerical results for each case are included, and it is shown that the geometry of the reflectors that the signal encounters has a substantial effect on the rate of change in signal strength observed by a mobile receiver. 1...|$|R

60|$|He produced, as he spoke, {{what seemed}} a jewel box. It was carved richly out of ebony by his own hand, and inlaid with a fanciful tracery of pearl, {{representing}} a boy {{in pursuit of a}} butterfly, which, elsewhere, had become a winged spirit, and was flying heavenward; while the boy, or youth, had found such efficacy in his strong desire that he ascended from earth to cloud, and from cloud to celestial atmosphere, to win the beautiful. This case of ebony the artist opened, and bade Annie place her fingers on its edge. She did so, but almost screamed as a butterfly fluttered forth, and, alighting on her finger's tip, sat waving the ample magnificence of its purple and gold-speckled wings, as if in prelude to a flight. It is impossible to express by words the glory, the splendor, the delicate gorgeousness which were softened into the beauty of this object. Nature's ideal butterfly was here realized in all its perfection; not in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> such <b>faded</b> insects as flit among earthly flowers, but of those which hover across the meads of paradise for child-angels and the spirits of departed infants to disport themselves with. The rich down was visible upon its wings; the lustre of its eyes seemed instinct with spirit. The firelight glimmered around this wonder--the candles gleamed upon it; but it glistened apparently by its own radiance, and illuminated the finger and outstretched hand on which it rested with a white gleam like that of precious stones. In its perfect beauty, the consideration of size was entirely lost. Had its wings overreached the firmament, the mind {{could not have been more}} filled or satisfied.|$|R
