40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, medical information has rapidly been changed into electronic form. Such a trend brought in another radical change of <b>purchasing</b> <b>pattern</b> of medical libraries and the access pattern of the users. Within {{the last four or five}} years, many medical libraries have changed their <b>purchasing</b> <b>pattern</b> from printed to electronic form. More users are beginning to depend on websites. While this phenomenon caused the librarians to reexamine their traditional duties, an abundance of unattested information were heaped on the users. Medical librarians decided to make the information to be more user-friendly. By this we mean, whenever the user desires to find any medical information, he/she would call to the librarian rather the library. To meet the needs of the users, several services are available: one-stop service, the requested information will be supplied within 12 hours that is in the boundary of the library, subject search service, SDI service, a mobile service which announces users 2 ̆ 7 status, formatting of thesis according to the journal 2 ̆ 7 s rule, analysis of the quotations, and purchasing personal books. All these services are accessible on the website, being effective for the last five years. This study is striving to discover users’ pattern of utilizing the medical information, the frequency of users’ visit, the degree of their satisfaction, and the need for such services, in order to find a better way of serving the medical professionals and to identify the role of the medical librarian in influx of the electronic informational era...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of consumers' perceived {{risks and benefits of}} agro-biotechnology in shaping the <b>purchase</b> <b>pattern</b> for organic food among US consumers. Consumers' general purchase behavior, knowledge of GM technology, and socio-demographic variables were examined in relation to their impact on organic food purchase. The sample data indicated that less than one fourth of the consumers bought organic products at least sometimes. Only 2 % of the consumers bought organic food very often. Perceived risks of agro-biotechnology played a dominant role in influencing organic food purchase decisions. Consumers who were concerned about negative attributes of agro-biotechnology including long-term health and environmental hazards, inequity in the distribution of benefits from the technology, and adverse effects to small and medium farms were the potential organic food consumers. Benefits of agro-biotechnology did not {{play an important role in}} shaping the <b>purchase</b> <b>pattern</b> for organic food. Food safety was the most important consideration while making organic food purchase decisions. Importance of food safety while making food purchase decisions and consumers' trust in the ability of grocery stores to supply safe food were other important factors in determining <b>purchase</b> <b>pattern</b> for organic foods. In this study, prices of food products did not play important role in determining <b>purchase</b> <b>pattern</b> for organic foods.

40|$|As one of {{the largest}} sources of {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions, the building and construction sector is facing increasing pressure to reduce its life cycle GHG emissions. One central issue in striving towards reduced carbon emissions in the building and construction sector is to develop a practical and meaningful yardstick to assess and communicate GHG results through carbon labelling. The idea of carbon labelling schemes for building materials is to trigger a transition to a low carbon future by switching consumer-purchasing habits to low-carbon alternatives. As such, failing to change <b>purchasing</b> <b>pattern</b> and behaviour can be disastrous to carbon labelling schemes. One useful tool to assist customers to change their purchasing behaviour is benchmarking, which has been very commonly used in ecolabelling schemes. This paper analyses the definition and scope of benchmarking in the carbon labelling schemes for building materials. The benchmarking process has been examined within the context of carbon labelling. Four practical issues for the successful implementation of benchmarking, including the availability of benchmarks and databases, the usefulness of different types of benchmarks and the selection of labelling practices have also been clarified...|$|E
40|$|Because loyal {{consumers}} {{are less likely}} to switch to competitors and because they are more tolerant to increases in price than non-loyal consumers, one of the main aims of firms is the “generation” of loyal consumers. But what is consumer loyalty? The marketing literature emphasises that for “true loyalty” {{it is important to consider}} both consumers' <b>purchasing</b> <b>pattern</b> (i. e. repurchases) as well as the underlying attitudes of the consumers. Thus, true loyalty includes both a behavioural (purchase) component, which results in repeated purchases, and an attitudinal component, which results in a dispositional commitment to a product, a brand, or a company, and associates a unique value to it. However, considering the characteristics of food products and the sector the question arises whether the above mentioned strict definition of true consumer loyalty is realistic in the food sector. The aim of our paper is to empirically test this question. In order to test our research question we conduct 30 semi-structured in-death interviews with regular customers of an organic retail shop in March / April 2009. Each interview lasts for roughly thirty minutes. Consumer loyalty, food sector, survey, organic products, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E

In our pilot study, caregivers residing in a documented Chicago food desert (N = 34, 79 % ethnic minority) received a voucher to use a commercial IGS to purchase groceries for their household. Caregivers most frequently purchased fruits, vegetables, meats, and caloric beverages, and endorsed 4 factors as potentially important determinants of future IGS use. IGS programs could {{have a role in}} improving urban food access if they have competitive prices, provide rapid delivery, and incorporate strategies to discourage purchasing of discretionary caloric beverages. Objective Proposals to improve urban food access include providing incentives for new supermarket development, facilitating transportation to existing supermarkets, and using farmers markets and street vendors as supplemental food sources (1 – 4). However, these approaches are costly and face logistical challenges (5, 6). A novel strategy to improve food access involves Internet grocery service (IGS) that delivers healthful foods to the home. IGS is convenient, may overcome potential transportation barriers, and does not require new supermarket construction; however, it does involve delivery fees and requires Internet access.

While it is possible to get some estimates of the macro changes taking place in India, it is impossible to get any accurate measures of the subjective experiences that proceed, accompany or follow such changes. However, the fact remains that the profile of the Indian market is vastly different from what it was earlier.
