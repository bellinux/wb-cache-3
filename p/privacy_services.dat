40|$|Abstract. Privacy {{related to}} context {{information}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important issue due to {{the wide range of}} new applications using computational, location and personal context information. In this article, we propose a <b>privacy</b> <b>service,</b> called Context <b>Privacy</b> <b>Service</b> (CoPS), to control how, when and to whom disclose a user’s context information. In order to identify the end-user privacy concerns, we carried out a survey where we asked approximately 100 people about their willingness to use context-aware services and to disclose their context information. Based on the results of this survey and experience reported by other research groups, we identified the main service requirements and designed CoPS aiming flexibility, generality, simplicity and fine-grained privacy control. CoPS is supposed to aid the end-user to define and manage his privacy policies regarding his context information.

5000|$|One {{criticism}} of WHOIS {{is the lack}} of full access to the data. [...] Few parties have realtime access to the complete databases. Others cite the competing goal of domain privacy as a criticism although this problem is strongly mitigated by domain <b>privacy</b> <b>services.</b> Currently the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) broadly requires that the mailing address, phone number and e-mail address of those owning or administrating a domain name to be made publicly available through the [...] "WHOIS" [...] directories. The registrant's (domain owner's) contact details, such as address and telephone number, are easily accessible to anyone who queries a WHOIS server. However, that policy enables spammers, direct marketers, identity thieves, or other attackers to loot the directory for personal information about these people. Although ICANN has been exploring changing WHOIS to enable greater privacy, {{there is a lack of}} consensus among major stakeholders as to what type of change should be made. [...] Some domain registrars offer private registrations (also known as domain privacy), by which the contact information of the registrar is shown instead of the customer's. With the offer of private registration from many registrars, some of the risk has been mitigated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Mobile IP (MIP) {{enables the}} Mobile Node (MN) {{to move around}} without loosing their transport-layer {{connectivity}} by using re-sources in the foreign domain network. MIP {{is expected to be}} the core infrastructure of future mobile communication, but certain level of se-curity services must be provided before the wide deployment of MIP. Security services, such as authentication and access control, have been considered since the birth of MIP, but little attention has been given to location <b>privacy</b> <b>services</b> despite of their increased signi¯cance in wireless network. MIPv 6 uses IPSec to provide data con¯dentiality and authenti-cation between Home Agent (HA) and the Mobile Node (MN). However, no practical solution was suggested for location information protection in MIP. During the past years a variety of theoretical concepts for loca-tion privacy have been proposed, but most of them are not applicable to MIP communication. So, in this paper, we identify required level of location privacy, and propose new protocol for providing the identi¯ed level of location privacy. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Vehicular ad hoc {{networks}} (VANETs) {{will enable}} new applications that increase safety and convenience {{of the passengers}} in the car. Most applications for VANETs are applications in a distributed system. They use information provided by different cars, and road side units. Different, sometimes complementary means exist to establish a trustworthy and privacy preserving system; they include certification, reputation systems, plausibility checking, and frequently changing pseudonyms. Often, these measures are tailored to specific aspects {{of the system and}} cannot easily be combined in an overall security architecture, nor can they easily be used by application developers. In this work, we present a framework to integrate trust and <b>privacy</b> <b>services</b> for the use in vehicular environments. The main contributions of this paper are (1) a consistent architecture for securing vehicular communications that can easily be used by application developers, (2) the principle of security sensors including a model for trust establishment for the vehicular domain and (3) the context mix model for preserving location privacy of vehicles.
