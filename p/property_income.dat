5|$|Daniel Cady, Stanton's father, was a {{prominent}} Federalist attorney who served one term in the United States Congress (1814–1817) and then became both a circuit court judge and, in 1847, a New York Supreme Court justice. Judge Cady introduced his daughter to the law and, together with her brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, planted the early seeds that grew into her legal and social activism. Even as a young girl, she enjoyed reading her father's law books and debating legal issues with his law clerks. It was this early exposure to law that, in part, caused Stanton to realize how disproportionately the law favored men over women, particularly married women. Her realization that married women had virtually no <b>property,</b> <b>income,</b> employment, or even custody rights over their own children, helped set her course toward changing these inequities.|$|E

25|$|Socialists {{attribute}} the vast disparities in wealth {{to the private}} ownership {{of the means of}} production by a class of owners, creating a situation where {{a small portion of the}} population lives off unearned <b>property</b> <b>income</b> by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock. By contrast, the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary. In order to rectify this situation, socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product.|$|E

500|$|The {{church has}} been criticized for its wealth, as monthly or {{quarterly}} donations were encouraged in the second article of the statutes of the Federation of Evangelical Missionary. According to the CCMM, property acquisition was evidence of significant income. The 1999 parliamentary report considered the church a [...] "small cult" [...] (a cult whose annual income is less than five million francs), which provided [...] "relatively accurate information" [...] to the Parliamentary Commission. The annual budget of the church was estimated between 2.4 and 3.1million francs (the total of donations in 1998 and 1995 respectively), mainly from Sunday offerings, donations, loans, financial products and <b>property</b> <b>income.</b> In 1999, the commission estimated the church's property at about 15million francs. As of 31December1998, the church's net active wealth (composed of real estate and stock) reached 7.3million francs. Concerning its finances, the church said it applies five major principles: economy, recovery, devotion, voluntary work and solidarity. Money comes from Sunday collections, sometimes from personal loans and from donations intended for a particular use; there is no external financial support. Accounts are published at the annual general assembly of the church, by the financial commission of the Federation and by Social Security. Trainee pastors work outside the church; permanent pastors receive a low salary, and are affiliated with the Caisse d'assurance vieillesse, invalidité et maladie des cultes (CAVIMAC).|$|E

2500|$|In Marxian analysis, {{capitalist}} firms increasingly substitute {{capital equipment}} for labor inputs (workers) under competitive pressure {{to reduce costs}} and maximize profits. Over the long-term, this trend increases the organic composition of capital, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the [...] "reserve army of labour"). This process exerts a downward pressure on wages. The substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting {{in a situation of}} relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of <b>property</b> <b>income</b> for the capitalist class.|$|E

Using data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics, an important stylized fact is revealed: The rising inequality of <b>property</b> <b>incomes,</b> particularly dividends, interest, and rent, have played the most important role in the increase of overall income inequality. Contrary to popular belief, increasing inequality of labor income plays only a secondary role.

2500|$|Piero Sraffa and Joan Robinson, {{whose work}} {{set off the}} Cambridge controversy, {{pointed out that there}} was an {{inherent}} measurement problem in applying this model of income distribution to capital. Capitalist income (total profit or <b>property</b> <b>income)</b> is defined as the rate of profit multiplied by the amount of capital, but the measurement of the [...] "amount of capital" [...] involves adding up quite incomparable physical objects [...] adding the number of trucks to the number of lasers, for example. That is, just as one cannot add heterogeneous [...] "apples and oranges," [...] we cannot simply add up simple units of [...] "capital." [...] As Robinson argued, {{there is no such thing}} as [...] "leets," [...] an inherent element of each capital good that can be added up independent of the prices of those goods.|$|E
2500|$|While {{orthodox}} classical revolutionary Marxist academics {{are convinced}} that the statistical data show that profitability is falling, businessmen can often happily see their profits grow anyway, and have more real money in the bank. In theory they should have less money, but in practice they have more. That is because financial relationships between quantities of money (defined using a currency unit) can vary from the value proportions that exist between products or physical assets (defined in terms of the MELT, i.e. the monetary equivalent of labor time). If there is a significant drop in overall profitability, this will very likely also be reflected in data about the profit included in value-added, but that is only a rough indicator of the trend (the data quality may not be very great). Official statistics include in value-added only the net value of new production; if a business makes money simply from selling an asset it has, or from asset appreciation, this is not normally considered [...] "value-added", but <b>property</b> <b>income.</b> [...] If that was not the case, then any kind of business income (or just about any kind of income) would represent value-added. It does not.|$|E
