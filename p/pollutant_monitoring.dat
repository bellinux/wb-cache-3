40|$|Abstract: This study {{focuses on}} {{determining}} the variation of indoor pollutants in public transport buses in the City of Toledo running on biodiesel (BD) and {{ultra low sulfur diesel}} (ULSD). The indoor <b>pollutants</b> <b>monitored</b> are carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitric oxide (NO), and particulate matter (PM). Temperature (Temp.) and relative humidity (RH) are also measured inside the vehicle {{in addition to}} the <b>monitored</b> in-vehicle <b>pollutants.</b> The various factors generally affecting indoor air quality in any microenvironment are indoor sources of pollutants (people, furniture, etc.), ventilation, outdoor air quality, meteorology, pollutant decay, and vehicular traffic. The objective of this research paper is to study the daily, monthly, and seasonal variation of in-vehicle pollutants in relation to different vari-ables and also determine the statistical significance of in-vehicle pollutant levels in biodiesel and ultra low sulfur diesel buses. The daily, monthly, and seasonal variations of the <b>pollutants</b> <b>monitored</b> are studied and it was observed that the pollutant level buildup within a bus compartment is due to a combination of different factors and not a result of variation due to a single variable. CO 2 levels are influenced by a combination of varying passenger ridership, vehicular traffic, ventilation settings, and bus status. CO and SO 2 levels depend on vehicular traffic, ventilation settings, and to an extent on vehicle speed. NO levels varied with vehicular traffic and ventilation settings. PM levels are influenced by vehicular traffic, ventilation settings and vehicle speed. Relatively higher pollutant concentrations are observed for the majority of pollutants in winter month...|$|R

Interlaboratory uncertainties of time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations were satisfactory (from 28 % to 112 %) given the number of participating laboratories (10) and ultra-trace metal concentrations involved. Data dispersion of TWA concentrations was mainly explained by uncertainties generated during DGT handling and analytical procedure steps. We highlight that DGT handling is critical for metals such as Cd, Cr and Zn, implying that DGT assembly/dismantling should be performed in very clean conditions.
