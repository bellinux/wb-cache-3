25|$|Particular {{attention}} has been paid to improving systems in recent reforms. Many industrial multiversities and specialist colleges have been established, strengthening some incomplete subjects and establishing new specialties, e.g., automation, nuclear power, energy resources, oceanography, nuclear physics, computer science, polymer chemistry, <b>polymer</b> <b>physics,</b> radiochemistry, physical chemistry and biophysics. A project for creating 100 world class universities began in 1993, which has merged 708 schools of higher learning into 302 universities. Merging schools of higher learning has produced far-reaching reform of higher education management, optimizing of educational resources allocation, and further improving teaching quality and school standards. More than 30 universities have received help from a special national fund to support their attainment of world elite class.|$|E
25|$|Polymers are {{studied in}} the fields of {{biophysics}} and macromolecular science, and polymer science (which includes polymer chemistry and <b>polymer</b> <b>physics).</b> Historically, products arising from the linkage of repeating units by covalent chemical bonds have been the primary focus of polymer science; emerging important areas of the science now focus on non-covalent links. Polyisoprene of latex rubber {{is an example of a}} natural/biological polymer, and the polystyrene of styrofoam is an example of a synthetic polymer. In biological contexts, essentially all biological macromolecules—i.e., proteins (polyamides), nucleic acids (polynucleotides), and polysaccharides—are purely polymeric, or are composed in large part of polymeric components—e.g., isoprenylated/lipid-modified glycoproteins, where small lipidic molecules and oligosaccharide modifications occur on the polyamide backbone of the protein.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{investigation of}} the density of localized states in non-crystalline matters and low-dimensional structures is {{the aim of the}} paper as well as the {{investigation of the}} mechanism of Hall effect in various regimes of jamp conduction. It has been shown, that tails of the density of states in non-crystalline matters depend on the temperature pre-history of a sample. It has been shown, that tails of the density of states in low-dimensional narrow-zone structures are suppressed strongly. The possibility of the property regulation for non-crystalline semiconductors with the help of thermal treatment has been revealed. Theoretical forecastings of the Hall mobility and typical geometrical sizes, characterizing Hall effect, have been obtained. The theory of tails of the density of states and Hall effect in non-crystalline matters is being used for the determination of parameters of a material electron structure.

50|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{literature}} on food rheology because the study of food rheology entails unique factors beyond an understanding of the basic rheological dynamics of the flow and deformation of matter. Food can be classified according to its rheological state, such as a solid, gel, liquid, emulsion with associated rheological behaviors, and its rheological properties can be measured. These properties will affect the design of food processing plants, as well as shelf life and other important factors, including sensory properties that appeal to consumers. Because foods are structurally complex, often a mixture of fluid and solids with varying properties within a single mass, the study of food rheology is more complicated than study in fields such as the rheology of polymers. However, food rheology is something we experience every day with our perception of food texture (see below) and basic concepts of food rheology well apply to <b>polymers</b> <b>physics,</b> oil flow etc. For this reason, examples of food rheology are didactically useful to explain the dynamics of other materials we are less familiar with. Ketchup is commonly used an example of Bingham fluid and its flow behavior can be compared to that of a polymer melt.|$|R
