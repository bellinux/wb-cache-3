40|$|Antigenicity of {{the surface}} A-layer protein of an {{atypical}} Aeromonas salmonicida strain was tested in goldfish following immunization with various A-protein (AP) antigenic preparations (soluble form, alum-precipitated, conjugated with <b>polyacrolein</b> nanoparticles, or bacterin). ELISA revealed innate specific anti-AP antibody activity in all fish on day 0, while no significant antibody enhancement was seen on days 21 or 42 following the primary immunization. A second stimulation with soluble AP resulted in a clear response in groups primed with bacterin and alum-precipitated AP but no response in those primed with soluble AP or AP-nanoparticles conjugate. The implication of these results for vaccine design is discussed...|$|E
40|$|An {{optimized}} {{procedure of}} covalent glucose oxidase, urease, Bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase and Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase immobilization on paramagnetic, non-porous, <b>polyacrolein</b> beads is presented. The resulting insolubilized enzymes {{can be employed}} for {{extended periods of time}} without loss of activity. The conditions were optimized for maximizing the activity of the linked enzyme. Coated beads bearing up to 15 mu g(active) (enzyme) /mg(beads) were obtained on reproducible basis. The paramagnetic feature of the particles facilitates the enzyme handling. In the magnetic field, the enzyme separation is fast and complete. Thus, the paramagnetic beads represent an excellent carrier for immobilized enzymes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} new surface {{modification}} approach of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) structured as inorganic hosts NaYF₄ codoped with Yb³⁺ and Er³⁺ {{based on their}} encapsulation in a two-stage process of precipitation polymerization of acrolein under alkaline conditions {{in the presence of}} UCNPs. The use of tetramethylammonium hydroxide both as an initiator of acrolein polymerization and as an agent for UCNP hydrophilization made it possible to increase the <b>polyacrolein</b> yield up to 90 %. This approach enabled the facile, lossless embedment of UCNPs into the polymer particles suitable for bioassay. These particles are readily dispersible in aqueous and physiological buffers, exhibiting excellent photoluminescence properties, chemical stability, and also allow the control of particle diameters. The feasibility of the as-produced photoluminescent polymer particles mean-sized 260 nm for in vivo optical whole-animal imaging was also demonstrated using a home-built epi-luminescence imaging system. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Gas phase photopolymerizations are commercially {{used for}} a variety of coating and device {{applications}} such as corrosion resistance and electronic insulation. Acrolein forms a crosslinked polymer onto a metal readily upon ultraviolet irradiation. The reaction kinetics and processing, however, are poorly understood. In the present work, the dynamics of the photopolymerization of acrolein on Au surface were studied by monitoring the gas phase kinetics and the surface dynamics in-situ and in real time. Surface second harmonic generation (SSHG), a second order nonlinear optical process, was developed to determine the fraction of the unreacted monomer concentration on the surface during the polymerization. The SSHG was also used to determine the adsorption of acrolein on Au. It was found that adsorption of acrolein was a chemisorption process and can be characterized as a Langmuir adsorption process. Upon UV irradiation, the surface reaction rate was found to be first-order in the surface monomer concentration, 1 / 2 -order in light intensity, and independent of the gas pressure at the operational pressure range. The comparison of the macroscopic rate laws with the microscopic rate equations suggested that the initiation and propagation took place initially at the surface adsorbed layer. The existence of a metal surface may enhance the free radical formation on the surface and led the photopolymerization occur selectively on the surface. After the formation of a polymer layer on Au, the photopolymerization was found to take place mainly in the gas phase. The apparent rate of the gas phase polymerization was found to be first order in the gas pressure and 1 / 2 order in light intensity. This mechanism was further confirmed by studying the effects of the surface steric hindrance, the nature of substrate, and the volume of the irradiated gas molecules on the polymerization dynamics, as well as the evolution of <b>polyacrolein</b> topography. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} final film thickness increased with ultraviolet light intensity, but was insensitive to the initial pressure. The <b>polyacrolein</b> film formed was partially crosslinked and had a glass transition temperature of 118 ∘C. ^ This research demonstrated the effectiveness of using SSHG in studying surface dynamics in-situ. Most significantly, it demonstrated the importance of the metal/monomer interaction that leads to the enhancement of the surface reaction and showed an ability to control the deposition of high integrity thin dielectric films onto metallic substrates. ...|$|E
40|$|Radiation-mediated {{grafting}} of <b>polyacrolein</b> onto {{polymethyl methacrylate}} microspheres activated the particles for chymotrypsin immobilization. Treatment of porous polystyrene/magnetite particles with <b>polyacrolein</b> produced very small enzyme loading enhancement and significantly increased substrate diffusional resistance. These results nonetheless demonstrate {{the feasibility of}} obtaining grafted materials and of utilizing this approach to improve the capacity of microspheres for protein immobilization. Enzyme immobilization on a more conventional support material, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B, was studied extensively. Specific activities and the amounts of active immobilized enzyme were determined for several different preparations of alpha-chymotrypsin immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of free and immobilized enzyme with a spin label coupled to the active site was used to probe the effects of different immobilization conditions on the immobilized enzyme active site configuration. Specific activity of active enzyme decreased and rotational correlation time of the spin label increased with increasing immobilized enzyme loading. Enzyme immobilized using an intermediate six-carbon spacer arm exhibited greater specific activity and spin label mobility than directly coupled enzyme. The observed activity changes due to immobilization were completely consistent with corresponding active site structure alterations revealed by EPR spectroscopy. When EPR spectra were recorded {{in the presence of}} indole, direct evidence for the existence of two distinct forms of active alpha-chymotrypsin immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 B was obtained. The indole EPR spectra of five different spin-labeled immobilized enzyme formulations were all resolved into the same two spectral components. Both subpopulation spectra were approximately identified experimentally, and the subpopulation exhibiting greatly restricted spin-label motion was shown also to be relatively inaccessible to solvent. Using overall specific activity data and subpopulation fractions from EPR spectral analysis, the specific activity of the more constricted immobilized enzyme active form was shown to be approximately fifteen times smaller than that of the other class of immobilized enzyme molecules with an indole EPR spectrum similar to that of chymotrypsin in solution. Variations in overall specific activity of formulations with different loadings and different supports result entirely from changes in the proportions of the same two subpopulations of immobilized enzyme molecules. Deactivation in aliphatic alcohols of alpha-chymotrypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin-CNBr Sepharose 4 B conjugates was also studied by several characterization methods. Active site titration measurements, which were used to determine the amount of catalytically active enzyme, revealed appreciable differences between the deactivation kinetics of free and immobilized chymotrypsin. In all cases for the immobilized enzyme, the kinetics of active enzyme disappearance differed significantly from first-order. Interestingly, the estimated intrinsic activity of immobilized chymotrypsin remaining active after different exposure times to 50...|$|E
40|$|B {{cells have}} been shown to present antigen to T cells very {{efficiently}} through their capacity to capture antigens by their membrane immunoglobulin. This direct cognate interaction of T and B cells results in the proliferation and differentiation of B cells. This concept has been established using soluble proteins. However, most of the antigens to which the immune system is exposed are included in complex particulate structures such as bacteria or parasites. The capacity of B cells to present these large and complex antigens is still unclear. To address this question we have studied the presentation by trinitrophenyl (TNP) -specific B cells of the same antigen TNP-KLH (keyhole limpet haemocyanin), either in a soluble form or covalently linked to <b>poly(acrolein)</b> microspheres, from 0. 25 to 1. 5 microns in diameter. In the presence of irradiated splenocytes or purified macrophages as a source of antigen-presenting cells (APC), KLH-specific T cells proliferated in response to soluble TNP-KLH or to TNP-KLH coupled to beads. In contrast, TNP-specific memory B cells were totally ineffective in presenting the TNP-KLH beads to KLH-specific T cells whereas they presented very efficiently soluble TNP-KLH. Similar results were obtained with the A 20 B lymphoma or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated TNP-specific B cells. These results therefore indicate that B cells are unable to present large size particulate antigens such as bacteria or parasites...|$|E

The work {{is aimed at}} studying the properties of fibrinolysin Y. pestis from the recombinant strain-producer E. coli and its use for construction of the immunoglobulin diagnosticum. For the first time, the method of cleaning of fibrinolysin Y. pestis has been developed.
