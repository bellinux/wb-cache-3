A survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted from November 10 to 14 found that majorities of nearly identical size felt that Occupy Wall Street, and the Tea Party, respectively, {{did not share}} their values.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the prevalence, predictors and outcomes of unmarried mothers‟ repartnering patterns. Results indicate that {{five years after}} a nonmarital birth, over one-quarter of mothers have formed a co-resident relationship with a new partner, {{and many of these}} partners have greater economic capacities than their prior partner. Among mothers who were eligible to “trade up ” in their partners ‟ economic capacities over time, 73 <b>percent</b> <b>did</b> so in partners‟ incarceration status, 79 <b>percent</b> <b>did</b> so in partners ‟ employment status, and 60 <b>percent</b> <b>did</b> so in partners ‟ educational attainment. These proportions are much higher than the percentage of eligible mothers who “traded down. ” Our findings are consistent with the idea that unmarried mothers continue to search for „good partners ‟ after their children are born and suggest that many of these women are successful in their search...|$|R

500|$|Of the oviparous teleosts, most (79 <b>percent)</b> <b>do</b> {{not provide}} parental care. Male care {{is far more}} common than female care. Male {{territoriality}} [...] "preadapts" [...] a species to evolve male parental care. One unusual example of female parental care is in mother discuses, which provide nutrients for their developing young {{in the form of}} mucus. Some teleost species have their eggs or young attached to or carried in their bodies. For sea catfishes, cardinalfishes, jawfishes and some others, the egg may be incubated or carried in the mouth, a practice known as mouthbrooding. In some African cichlids, the eggs may be fertilised there. In species like the banded acara, young are brooded after they hatch and this may be done by both parents. The timing of the release of young varies between species; some mouthbrooders release new-hatched young while other may keep then until they are juveniles. In addition to mouthbrooding, some teleost have also developed structures to carry young. Male nurseryfish have a bony hook on their foreheads to carry fertilised eggs; they remain on the hook until they hatch. For seahorses, the male has a brooding pouch where the female deposits the fertilised eggs and they remain there until they become free-swimming juveniles. Female banjo catfishes have structures on their belly to which the eggs attach.|$|E
