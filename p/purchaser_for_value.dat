2500|$|Were {{the issue}} treated {{as one of}} {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation, the simple equitable principle to be applied {{would be that the}} contract is voidable unless third party rights have intervened. The defrauded party (Alice, in the example) has a right to rescind the contract, until the point where Claire's rights had intervened. Claire could be considered a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> <b>for</b> <b>value</b> without notice of any pre-existing interest, and should take full title to the property. This was essentially the approach advocated in Lewis v Averay. However, it is not the stance English law is currently taking. In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson the House of Lords by three to two decided to uphold an older line of authority which declares a contract void from the start. If there was never any contract between the seller and the fraudster, the fraudster cannot sell any property right to the third party, because they never had a good property right in the first place. This follows the Latin maxim, nemo dat quod non habet, that one cannot give what one does not have. So the present law is that if a person deals with another by distance (and not face to face, in which case there is deemed to be no [...] "mistake" [...] about identity), that person's presumed identity is recorded in a document, {{and it turns out that}} that person is in fact an uncreditworthy [...] "rogue" [...] then the third party cannot acquire good title and the good must be returned to the original person who is defrauded. The minority of the House of Lords (Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett) preferred to follow Lewis v Averay, which is in line with the law across Europe, in the United States and most of the rest of the world.|$|E

40|$|Good faith <b>purchasers</b> <b>for</b> <b>value</b> — {{individuals}} who unknowingly {{and in good}} faith purchase property from a seller whose own actions in obtaining the property are of questionable legality — have long obtained special protection under the common law. Despite the seller’s own actions being tainted, such purchasers obtain valid title themselves and are allowed to freely alienate the property without any restriction. Modern copyright law, however, does just the opposite. Individuals who unknowingly and in good faith purchase property embodying an unauthorized copy of a protected work are altogether precluded from subsequently alienating such property, or risk running afoul of copyright’s distribution right. This Article examines copyright law’s anomalous treatment of good faith purchasers and shows how the concerns motivating the good faith purchaser doctrine in the common law, relating to the free alienability of property and the informational burdens that consumers might have to unduly bear, carry over to the principal settings where modern copyright law operates. It then develops an analogous doctrine for copyright law that would balance the concerns of copyright owners and innocent consumers. Under this doctrine good faith <b>purchasers</b> <b>for</b> <b>value</b> of objects embodying infringing content would obtain good title to such objects {{as long as they}} acquire the object from its manufacturer prior to a judicial determination of infringement against the manufacturer, i. e., so long as the manufacturer’s title is merely voidable and not void.

40|$|It is {{not unusual}} for {{practitioners}} reviewing a Delaware corporation's stock records to find omissions or procedural defects raising questions as to the valid authorization of some of the outstanding stock. Examples of such omissions and defects are limitless, but not infrequently found examples include the absence of board resolutions authorizing the issuance of stock shown by the transfer books as having been issued, the absence of evidence that issuances were properly authorized by the requisite votes of the board or, if required, by the stockholders, the absence of evidence that the consideration to have been received by the corporation in exchange for the stock was in fact received, the issuance of more shares than were authorized by the certificate of incorporation at the time, the issuance of stock prior to the filing of the charter amendment or certificate of designations authorizing or creating the stock, and similar procedural and substantive irregularities. Not infrequently, these defects occurred some time ago, and the stock in question may have changed hands multiple times since issuance. Confronted with such irregularities, most corporate lawyers' first instinct would be to attempt to correct the defect through board and, if necessary, stockholder, ratification of the defective issuance, with the intent of putting the parties in the positions they thought they were in prior to discovering the irregularity. However, Delaware courts have not always viewed defects in stock issuances as being curable by ratification. In a number of leading cases, the Delaware Supreme Court has treated the statutory formalities for the issuance of stock as substantive prerequisites to the validity of the stock being issued, and has determined that failure to comply with such formalities renders the stock in question void. A finding that stock is void means that defects in it cannot be cured, whether by ratification or otherwise. Thus, practitioners finding defects in stock issuances are put in the uncomfortable position of having to make a judgment whether the defect is one that renders the stock void, in which case ratification is not an option, or voidable, in which case ratification is an option. Unfortunately, the decisions issued by the Delaware courts have not afforded certainty in this critical area. Indeed, a recent decision of the Court of Chancery acknowledges that although "Delaware law is replete with cases" discussing the void-voidable distinction, the law as to when and whether a defective stock issuance can be cured "is not as clear as it could be. " This article analyzes the reasons for this lack of clarity, and proposes some solutions which would benefit buyers and sellers of corporate stock. We begin by examining the legal requirements applicable to stock issuances. Next, we discuss the foundation of the doctrinal distinction between void and voidable stock. We then discuss the cases where courts have found stock to have not been issued in accordance with these legal requirements, and whether such finding has resulted in the stock being found void or voidable. We also consider the purposes, principles and policies of certain provisions of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, designed to validate, in most circumstances, certain defects in stock in the hands of innocent <b>purchasers</b> <b>for</b> <b>value.</b> Interestingly, these provisions of the UCC have not been frequently discussed in the court cases that have considered whether stock is void or voidable, and the cases that have discussed them refer to them as setting forth an equitable rather than a legal principle - which is ultimately not helpful to corporate lawyers who opine on legal, not equitable, matters. In conclusion, we suggest that the policy underlying Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code to validate stock in the hands of innocent <b>purchasers</b> <b>for</b> <b>value,</b> notwithstanding technical defects in its issuance, should be recognized as a principle of law, not solely as a principle of equity, and should be applied by the Delaware courts as such. As a result, technical defects relating to statutory formalities should not lead to a finding of void stock, but at worst to voidable stock. Cure or ratification should be permitted except in cases where the issuance violates the directors' duty of loyalty or otherwise would be inequitable. Such a rule would allow practitioners to opine as to the validity of a corporation's outstanding stock where the stock was issued defectively but the defect cured, subject to a standard exception for fiduciary duties and other equitable matters, and would eliminate the risk that stock held in the trading markets or otherwise held by innocent <b>purchasers</b> <b>for</b> <b>value</b> might be deemed void...|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} a {{creditor}} to undo a fraudulent or voluntary conveyance depends on the specific type of creditor and transfer at issue. If the creditor had obtained a judgment {{at the time of}} the conveyance, then the creditor will be able to avoid it. However, a creditor that reduces the debt owed to it to a judgment only after the conveyance has occurred must prove that the conveyance was indeed fraudulent, for the purpose of defrauding creditors. This is a very difficult standard to prove, but the state does provide some statutory presumptions of fraudulent intent. In particular, a transfer between spouses or close family members is presumed to be fraudulent unless proved otherwise, as is renunciation of a gift received by a beneficiary under a will. However, a conveyance to a bona fide <b>purchaser</b> <b>for</b> fair <b>value</b> can not be upset where the purchaser is unaware of the fraudulent intent of the conveyor.|$|R

40|$|Are {{investors in}} securitized {{receivables}} {{to be treated}} as the owners of an asset whose sale has taken it {{beyond the reach of the}} trustee in bankruptcy of their sellers? O are they {{to be treated as}} holders of a security interest in the transferred asset who have left behind an interest in the sellers 2 ̆ 7 hands that would cause the asset to be subject to claims and interference by the sellers 2 ̆ 7 grasping trustee? By adopting contrasting-arguably conflicting-statements in two subsections of a single section, the drafters of 1999 Article 9 have thrust this issue in the faces of courts and commentators. They did this by adopting section 9 - 318 which reads in full as follows: Section 9 - 318. No interest retained in right to payment that is sold; rights and title of seller of account or chattel paper with respect to creditors and purchasers. (a) [Seller retains no interest. ] A debtor that has sold an account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note does not retain a legal or equitable interest in the collateral sold. (b) [Deemed rights of debtor if buyer 2 ̆ 7 s security interest unperfected. ] For purposes of determining the rights of creditors of, and <b>purchasers</b> <b>for</b> <b>value</b> of an account or chattel paper from, a debtor that has sold an account or chattel paper, while the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s security interest is unperfected, the debtor is deemed to have rights and title to the account or chattel paper identical to those the debtor sold. Subsection (a) embraces the securitizers 2 ̆ 7 position; it unequivocally indorses the form of the transaction. Upon 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 everything is gone: all is beyond the grasp of the trustee. There are no qualifications; neither perfection, nor notice, nor any other act is required. This 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 of receivables is as much a 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 as the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s sale of inventory to a buyer <b>for</b> <b>value</b> would be a 2 ̆ 2 sale. 2 ̆ 2 But subsection (b) looks to the substance of the transaction and rejects the form. Here a 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 of certain covered receivables is the grant of a 2 ̆ 2 security interest. 2 ̆ 2 Like the grant of a security interest, this sale without perfection leaves behind fragments of title large enough to give purchase to the sellers 2 ̆ 7 creditors. Of course lawyers are accustomed to ignoring form and following substance, and of doing the opposite. What is different here is that the drafters ask us-with respect to the same transaction-to do one in subsection (a) (respect form) and the other in subsection (b) (ignore form). It may be possible to make the two subsections get along with one another, but it requires work. On their face, they appear inconsistent. I am not the first to see the apparent inconsistency between the two subsections. Members of the drafting committee saw it, 2 ̆ 7 and the use of the verb 2 ̆ 2 deemed 2 ̆ 2 in subsection (b) shows that the drafters anticipated this claim. In this article I consider how we came to this place and whether the drafters have successfully found a path through this thicket that will allow them to satisfy the securitizers (all is gone with a sale) and the creditors of a seller whose buyer has not perfected (enough is left behind despite a sale to give the creditors a hold) without, at the same time, giving purchase to the trustee in bankruptcy of a seller of perfected, securitized receivables...|$|R
