40|$|Using {{algorithms}} {{from computer}} graphics, namely hidden line and surface removal, techniques {{have been constructed}} to derive the 3 -axis visible or millable set of a computer model from a given orientation or simulate <b>and</b> <b>verify</b> <b>machining</b> toolpaths. In this paper, an approach that reduces the accessibility problem of 5 -axis milling using a flat end tool into a 3 -axis accessibility problem is discussed. Using this approach, global detection of possible gouging into other parts, while a 5 -axis flat end mill is in use, is made feasible and collisions can be avoided. Key Words: NURBs, accessibility, 5 -axis machining. 1 Introduction Several methods are in use, when freeform computer models are realized using milling machines. Possibly the most common approach utilizes a ball end tool with three degrees of freedom, namely translation in x, y, and z [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The ball end center of the tool follows an offset [8] to the model by the tool radius while the ball end surface is tangent to [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{microprocessors}} have been specified <b>and</b> <b>verified</b> using <b>machine</b> supported formal techniques [2], [1], [7], [8], [10]. Some {{of these were}} pre-existing designs, others were designed {{as part of the}} specification and verification project. Even in the case of new designs, the formal techniques used offered very little support for incremental design and verification. Support for incremental design and verification means that certain additions to the implementation and/or specification can be verified without re-verification of the previous parts. Here, we present techniques for incremental design and verification which, as well as providing more appropriate models, also make the formal verification more efficient. The formal framework to support these ideas has been implemented in the HOL system and has been used in the specification, design and verification of a microcoded microprocessor. The techniques deal with three different aspects of the microprocessor: specification of mac [...] ...|$|R

The control programs, consisting {{of a number of}} tasks running concurrently, are automatically translated into the timed automata model of UPPAAL.

As such it is imperative that the services of the control program are offered in a timely manner in order that the behavior of the environment is supervised and controlled appropriately.

40|$|In dynamic {{systems that}} adapt to users' needs and {{changing}} environments, dependability needs cannot be avoided. This paper proposes an orthogonal fault tolerance model {{as a means}} to manage and reason about multiple fault tolerance mechanisms that co-exist in dynamically adaptive systems. One of the key challenges associated with dynamically evolving fault tolerance needs is the feature interaction problem arising from the integration of fault tolerance features. The proposed approach provides a separation of fault tolerance concerns to study the effects of integrated fault tolerance on the system. This approach uses state machine and operational semantics to reason about these interactions and inconsistencies. The proposed approach is supported by the tool NuSMV to simulate <b>and</b> <b>verify</b> the state <b>machines</b> against logic statements.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a CAM package based on AutoCAD for refurbished and new components with intricate geometry. By using a deburring robot such as the Yamaha Zeta- 1 Robot, deburring and polishing of a refurbished workpiece involves analyzing the geometry of the workpiece, determining and designing tool path, generating tool path data, animating the path traced by the robot tool <b>and</b> <b>verifying</b> the tool path on the Yamaha Zeta- 1 Robot. The most popular PC-based CAD package, AutoCAD, is chosen as the developing platform. A software package mainly programmed in AutoLISP, which is an underlying software application of AutoCAD, functions as a processor of the solid models of the workpieces and generates tool path data for the robot. The Yamaha Zeta- 1 Robot, which is designed specifically for precision deburring, is chosen for executing the generated tool path. The development is coined by exploiting the powers of AutoLISP, C, C++ and DCL (Dialogue Control Language). This CAM package functions as an interface between the workpiece and the user, and a postprocessor for the tool location for the robot. A kinematic model of the Yamaha Zeta- 1 has been established and a commercial virtual reality application software package, WorldToolKit, is employed in animating the real robot based on the Yamaha Zeta- 1 's geometric parameters and kinematics. This virtual robot serves as a virtual reality simulator to test <b>and</b> <b>verify</b> the <b>machining</b> path generated. Experimental verification of the post-processed data generated by the developed software is presented for both deburring and polishing features. The results show the successful implementation of this CAM software package...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an Ontology {{inference}} {{cloud service}} (OICS) with auto-scaling capability is designed and implemented for the CNC machine tool industry. The OICS is a knowledge-based cloud manufacturing system, {{and is used}} to recommend machine tools and cutting tools based on the Ontology inference techniques. Three core functional modules: the Ontology inference module, the VMT (Virtual Machine Tool) module, and the request filtering module, are developed to allow multiple users to perform inference service, <b>and</b> <b>verify</b> the recommended <b>machine</b> tools or cutting tools via VMT simulations. The OICS is implemented and hosted in a cloud virtual machine, called a worker. Furthermore, the worker controller (WCR), is designed to automatically adjust the number of virtual machines to provide users splendid service quality. Finally, we deploy the developed OICS to a public cloud platform, namely Windows Azure, to conduct integrated tests. Testing results of a case study physically applying the OICS to a machine tool factory show that the OICS can successfully recommend suitable machine tools and cutting tools for machining tasks, and support multiple users in a reasonable performance. The results of this paper can be a useful reference for industrial practitioners to construct cloud-based manufacturing systems...|$|R

40|$|In This Paper {{we present}} a study of Split <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> Die of Sheet Metal Blanking Process for Length Component. The Component with 740 mm length is {{considered}} <b>and</b> Analysis of <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> Die was carried out for study. The Split <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> Die techniques introduced is being studied in this paper {{and it is the}} most applicable technique for the lengthy components. Sheet metal parts are widely used in products of high complexity and precision such as vehicles, aircraft and other automobile related products. Therefore, the press process has been identified {{as one of the most}} important manufacturing processes. During Blanking Process the force acting is more between the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> die, failure or damage may occurs as reaches some production, so need to replace the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> die as damages occurs. For small components <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> die can easily replaceable, easy maintenance, easy handling, less time consuming and low cost. As we consider lengthy components <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> die the manufacturing, heat treatment, maintenance, handlings need more time and cost is also very high.

40|$|The {{problem of}} expressing I/O and side effects in {{functional}} languages is a well-established one. This paper addresses this problem from a general semantic viewpoint by giving a unified framework for describing shared state, I/O and deterministic concurrency. We develop a modified state transformer which lets us mathematically model the API, then investigate <b>and</b> <b>machine</b> <b>verify</b> some broad {{conditions under which}} confluence holds. This semantics is {{used as the basis}} for a small deterministic Haskell language extension called CURIO, which enforces determinism using runtime checks. Our confluence condition is first shown to hold for a variety of small components, such as individual shared variables, 1 -to- 1 communication channels, and I-structures. We then show how models of substantial APIs (like a modification of Haskell’s file I/O API which permits inter-process communication) may be constructed from these smaller components using “combinators ” {{in such a way that}} determinism is always preserved. We describe combinators for product, name-indexing and dynamic allocation, the last of which requires some small extensions to cater for process locality...|$|R
