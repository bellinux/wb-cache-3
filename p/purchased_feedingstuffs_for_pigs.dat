40|$|Following {{a request}} from the Health and Consumer Protection, Directorate General, European Commission, the Panel on Biological Hazards was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on Microbiological Risk Assessment in <b>feedingstuffs</b> <b>for</b> food-producing animals for both public health and animal health. In accordance with the terms of reference, this report does not consider hazards such as BSE/TSE agents, parasites and virus, or contamination by fungi and mycotoxins. The Panel on Biological Hazards identified Salmonella spp. as the major hazard for microbial contamination of animal feed. Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O 157 : H 7 and Clostridium sp. are other hazards for which feed is regarded a far less important source. In addition, antimicrobial resistant bacteria, or antimicrobial resistance genes can be transmitted via feed. Forage, industrial compound feed, home-grown cereals and <b>purchased</b> straight <b>feedingstuff</b> are the four major groups of feeds for EU livestock. The report focuses on industrial compound feed as the feed group with the highest risk for becoming contaminated by Salmonella spp. Oil seed meal and animal derived protein are the major risk feed materials for introducin...|$|R

40|$|Fumaric acid is {{currently}} authorised as a preservative in <b>feedingstuffs</b> <b>for</b> all animal species. Fumaric acid is considered safe <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and poultry provided that an expected use level of 20 000 mg/kg in complete diets <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and poultry is not exceeded. The {{margin of safety}} <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and poultry is approximately two. The tolerated fumaric acid concentration in complete diets for ruminants is higher. The margin of safety <b>for</b> <b>pigs,</b> poultry and ruminants is sufficiently high that setting a maximum content is not necessary. In contrast, the maximum safe level in milk replacer for veal calves (and probably other young mammals) is provisionally estimated to be 10 000 mg/kg milk replacer, with no margin of safety. Fumaric acid is rapidly metabolised by well-recognised pathways, and neither fumarate nor its metabolites are expected to accumulate in animal tissues. Consequently, human exposure {{is not expected to}} be increased by the use of fumaric acid in animal nutrition. Fumaric acid is a severe irritant to eyes. Given the potential for eye irritation, the particle size and the dusting potential, exposure to other mucous membranes such as the respiratory tract may also be a concern and it is advisable to minimise exposure by inhalation. The use of fumaric acid in animal nutrition will not pose a risk to the environment. Fumaric acid has value as a food preservative only in the presence of significant moisture. Comparable situations in feed are limited to some feedingstuffs, feed processing and feeding techniques. In such situations, its function in feed is essentially the same as that in food and no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary. However, the FEEDAP Panel has reservations about the effectiveness of any preservative, including fumaric acid, in raw materials and compound feedingstuffs with a typical moisture content of ≤ 12 %...|$|R

Five floor pen studies on turkeys for fattening were provided by the applicant. In four studies, growth and feed to gain ratio was improved, after four weeks, by 60 mg Mo-Na from Coxidin® kg- 1 complete feedingstuff. In the following four-week period, comparable effects could be observed for growth rate, but not for feed to gain ratio. Clinical endpoints, indicative for coccidiosis control, were with one exception (intestinal lesion score seven days after inoculation in two studies) not influenced. Coccidiosis in turkey is commonly milder than in chicken, this may contribute to explaining the lack of conclusive clinical data in these studies. Cumulative data (after 84 days for female and 112 days for male turkeys) showed positive effects for 60 mg Mo-Na from Coxidin ® kg- 1 complete <b>feedingstuff</b> <b>for</b> growth and feed to gain ratio in one study, for feed to gain ratio and reduced mortality in another study, and reduced mortality alone in a third study.

The high use level proposed by the applicant for linalool (25 mg/kg complete feed) is safe for salmonids, veal calves, cattle for fattening and pets (excluding cats) without a margin of safety {{with the exception of}} dogs (SF = 1. 4). The safe use level <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and dairy cows is 20, for piglets 12 and for poultry 10 mg/kg complete feed.

For nerolidol, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 -methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol, the maximum safe concentration is 1 mg/kg complete feed <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and poultry and 1. 5 mg/kg complete feed for all other species. The absence of a margin of safety would not allow the simultaneous administration in feed and water for drinking of the following compounds: linalool, nerolidol, 2 -methyl- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol and 2 -(4 methylphenyl) propan- 2 -ol. No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 6 up to the highest safe level in <b>feedingstuffs</b> <b>for</b> all animal species.

40|$|ABSTRACT Ninety-six adult Single Comb White Leghorn {{males were}} divided into two 48 -bird groups to assay <b>feedingstuffs</b> <b>for</b> {{apparent}} metabolizable energy (AME) and true metabolizable en-ergy (TME). The metabolizable energy contents of corn, wheat, oats, rye, barley, glucose and soy-bean, rapeseed, sunflower, dehydrated alfalfa, feather, and fish and meat meals were evaluated. The experiment consisted of three replicates in a cross-over design. The excreta voided by birds in both assays was collected quantitatively at 24 - and 48 -hr intervals after feeding. A set of corrected AME values (AMEC) was obtained by correcting AME results for endogenous excreta losses. A prediction of AME results was also obtained by using the chemical composition of the 13 <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Birds trained <b>for</b> the AME assay to eat their feed requirements in 1 hr consumed less than ad libitum fed birds even after 14 days of training. Introduction of experimental diets caused a further reduction in intake even though all feeds were pelleted and of similar color. Thirty-nine of 117 AME values were discarded because intakes were less than 50 g/bird. Two TME values were dis-carded due to problems unrelated to feed.

40|$|In {{the present}} review, the {{quantitative}} impact of dietary aflatoxin, deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisin concentrations on performance of pigs and broilers is evaluated, with {{special emphasis on}} low concentrations of these toxins. Also, responses in performance of pigs and broilers to these three toxins are related to their absorption and elimination kinetics. By applying simple linear regression, information from many literature sources is integrated and condensed into, for example, estimates of depression in rates of weight gain, relative to non-contaminated diets, with increasing toxin concentrations. It was estimated that with each mg/kg increase of aflatoxin in the diet, the growth rate would be depressed by 16 % <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and 5 % for broilers. For DON, with each mg/kg increase in the diet, the growth depression was estimated at about 8 % <b>for</b> <b>pigs,</b> while broilers showed no response to DON concentrations below 16 mg/kg. Fumonisin showed the lowest impact on growth performance; with each mg/kg increase, the depression in growth rate was estimated at 0 · 4 and 0 · 0 % <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and broilers, respectively. Dietary concentrations that cause a 5 % reduction in growth rate were estimated at 0 · 3 and 1 · 0 mg/kg <b>for</b> aflatoxin <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and broilers, respectively; 1 · 8 and 0 · 6 mg/kg for pure and naturally contaminated DON <b>for</b> <b>pigs,</b> respectively; 21 and 251 mg/kg <b>for</b> fumonisin <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and broilers, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A murine {{model for}} Streptococcus suis {{infection}} in pigs was validated by inoculating groups of 5 BALB/c and 5 CF 1 mice with 107 CFU/ml of 13 different S. suis serotype 2 strains. The pathogenicity of these strains {{had been established}} in a standardized pig model of S. suis infection using one- week-old gnotobiotic pigs. We inoculated groups of mice intraperitoneally with 4 strains that were highly virulent <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and belonged to the phenotype MRP+EF+, with 4 strains, that were weakly virulent <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and belonged to the phenotype MRP+EF*, and with 5 strains that were non- virulent <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and belonged to phenotype MRP - EF -. The S. suis strains that were highly virulent <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> caused high morbidity and an intermediate mortality in mice, the S. suis strains that were weakly virulent <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> caused high morbidity but low mortality, and the strains that were non- virulent <b>for</b> <b>pigs,</b> induced highest morbidity and mortality. These results were comparable in both breeds of mice. In contrast to the pathology of S. suis infection in pigs with specific lesions, lesions in mice were histologically often characterized as non-specific, i. e., necrotizing encephalitis and focal or diffuse hepatitis sometimes with abscesses. Irrespective of breed (BALB/c vs. CF 1), the murine model used for S. suis infection was incompatible with the pig model.

Therefore, we regard the presently available murine models unsuitable for studying S. suis infections in pigs...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 48 gilts (initially 211 lb) {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of ractopamine HCl and α-lipoic acid on finishing pig performance and carcass characteristics. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments in a 22 -d experi-ment. Pigs were fed corn-soybean meal-based diets. Treatments were arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial with main effects of ractopamine HCl (0 or 9 g/ton) and α-lipoic acid (0 or 300 ppm). For overall growth performance (d 0 to 22), ADG tended (P < 0. 09) to be greater <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> fed ractopamine HCl. Although F/G improved (P < 0. 01) <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> fed ractopamine HCl, there was a trend (P < 0. 07) for an interaction between ractopamine HCl and α-lipoic acid. <b>For</b> <b>pigs</b> fed diets without ractopamine HCl, added α-lipoic acid numerically improved F/G, whereas in pigs fed ractopamine HCl, added α-lipoic acid numerically worsened F/G. Average final weight tended (P < 0. 06) to be greater <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> fed ractopamine HCl. No other differences in growth performance were observed. For the comparison of carcass characteristics, average live weight, HCW, yield, loin eye area at the 10 th rib, and standardized fat-free lean were increased (P < 0. 04) <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> fed ractopamine HCl.
