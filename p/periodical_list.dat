40|$|TENYEARS AGO {{a student}} searching through the card catalog in his school library {{could expect to}} find books, pamph-lets and <b>periodicals</b> <b>listed</b> for his {{assigned}} and personal quests. Today in a rapidly growing number of school libraries he would find indexed on cards or printout {{a larger number of}} books and pamphlets, and in addition, films, slides, filmstrips, discs, tapes, periodicals on micro-film, programmed learning texts, and remote access retrieval listings. Choosing from the materials available, he could decide to look, listen or read, or perhaps do all three. His chances for learning would seem to have improved. To give all students the tools they need for learning must be the shared responsibility of all workers in the changing curriculum: the administrator, the supervisor, the researcher, the classroom teacher, as well as the librarian and media specialist. Indeed, as the Committee for Economic Development points out, "The task of improving edu-cation is the business of everyone-everyone who is concerned about the future.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two {{directories}} {{that contain}} information about serials also offer lists {{of thousands of}} journals identified as peer-reviewed. Librarians generally regard these lists as authoritative. OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical medicine journals on both peer-reviewed lists, measure the extent of discrepancies between these two lists, and determine the cause for these discrepancies. DESIGN: Comparison study. MEASUREMENTS: The extent of the discrepancies were tallied once the author had attempted to control for all extraneous variables. Interviews with the editorial staffs of each directory in regard to procedures for compiling the directories did not produce an explanation for these discrepancies. RESULTS: Nearly half (46 %) of the 784 clinical medicine journals were unique to either one directory's list of peer-reviewed journals or the other's, indicating significant discrepancies between the two directories. Specifically, The Serials Directory listed 211 (27 %) unique titles and Ulrich's International <b>Periodicals</b> Directory <b>listed</b> 150 (19 %) unique titles (total unique titles = 46 %). Both directories listed 423 of the same titles (54 %).
