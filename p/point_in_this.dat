5|$|After {{losing the}} first two games, Samsung Galaxy won a long third game against SK Telecom. SKT {{dominated}} {{the early stages of}} the game and built up a lead in both kills and gold. The turning <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> game was a fight over Baron, an important in-game objective, where Samsung Galaxy was able to kill half of SK Telecom's team and destroy two of their turrets afterwards. After winning a similar engagement over Baron later in the game, Samsung Galaxy was then able to quickly destroy five of SKT's defensive towers and win the game. This third game was the second-longest in competitive League of Legends history, at 71 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E

5|$|The current view among astronomers who model Type Ia {{supernova}} explosions, however, is {{that this}} limit is never actually attained and collapse is never initiated. Instead, the increase in pressure and density due to the increasing weight raises {{the temperature of the}} core, and as the white dwarf approaches about 99% of the limit, a period of convection ensues, lasting approximately 1,000years. At some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> simmering phase, a deflagration flame front is born, powered by carbon fusion. The details of the ignition are still unknown, including the location and number of points where the flame begins. Oxygen fusion is initiated shortly thereafter, but this fuel is not consumed as completely as carbon.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was one of}} {{two phases}} to build an {{expressway}} bypass {{on the south side of}} Hamilton. Despite this, plans for both The Linc as well as the Red Hill Valley Parkway appeared simultaneously in 1963, when Hamilton City Council approved the 'Hamilton Area Transportation Study' which included the Highway53 Freeway as one of five proposed expressways. These were subsequently added to the city's official plan in 1964. However, political change and shifting public attitudes would soon reject the idea of inner-city expressways, instead shifting the focus to public transportation. The cancellation of the Spadina Expressway in Toronto was the turning <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> shift.|$|E
5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing <b>point,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E

5|$|Alaska possessed no {{mental health}} {{treatment}} facilities prior {{to the passage of}} the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.|$|E
5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} with a tight focus on a small group (with {{everyone}} in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached the turning point in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, it was {{reported}} that Jean Lanfray, a Swiss farmer, murdered his family and attempted to take his own life after drinking absinthe. The fact that Lanfray was an alcoholic who had consumed considerable quantities of wine and brandy prior to drinking two glasses of absinthe was overlooked or ignored, therefore placing the blame for the murders solely on absinthe. The Lanfray murders were the tipping <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> hotly debated topic, and a subsequent petition to ban absinthe in Switzerland collected more than 82,000 signatures. A referendum was subsequently held on banning the drink on 5 July 1908. After it was approved by voters, the prohibition of absinthe was then written into the Swiss constitution.|$|E
25|$|At some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, Nemțeanu {{also went}} into {{business}} as a clothing retailer, but ended up overspending. Sued by his creditors, Fischer-Galați claims {{that he was only}} spared bankruptcy by a sympathetic judge, who enjoyed his poetry. By then, Nemțeanu's disease was interfering with his lifestyle, causing him to write in the supine position, on couches, as the only way in which he could prevent exhaustion. His friends and readers pooled their money and sent him to a sanitarium in Lausanne, where he arrived in November 1913. For a couple of months afterward, he wrote at home to his female friend, Emilia Weissbluth, keeping her informed of his health. This correspondence ended abruptly, possibly because her parents rejected his marriage proposal.|$|E
25|$|A common {{method to}} achieve this is the self-consistent {{multiple}} scattering approach. One essential <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> approach {{is the assumption that}} the scattering properties of the surface, i.e. of the individual atoms, are known in detail. The main task then reduces to the determination of the effective wave field incident on the individual scatters present in the surface, where the effective field is the sum of the primary field and the field emitted from all the other atoms. This must be done in a self-consistent way, since the emitted field of an atom depends on the incident effective field upon it. Once the effective field incident on each atom is determined, the total field emitted from all atoms can be found and its asymptotic value far from the crystal then gives the desired intensities.|$|E

This moved Héloïse {{to write her}} first Letter; the first being {{followed}} by the two other Letters, in which she finally accepted the part of resignation, which, now as a brother to a sister, Abelard commended to her. Sometime before 1140, Abelard published his masterpiece, Ethica or Scito te ipsum (Know Thyself), where he analyzes the idea of sin and that actions are not what a man will be judged for but intentions. During this period, he also wrote Dialogus inter Philosophum, Judaeum et Christianum (Dialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian), and also Expositio in Epistolam ad Romanos, a commentary on St. Paul's epistle to the Romans, where he expands {{on the meaning of}} Christ's life.|$|E
25|$|Klaas A. Posthuma {{argues that}} neither Tristan nor Isolde try {{for one moment}} to ignore their {{feelings}} of {{love for each other}} nor do they try to overcome them. On the contrary, they yield to their feelings with all their hearts – but secretly. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the Schopenhauer doctrine. Another important <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> philosophy is Schopenhauer's opinion about finding happiness with one woman only, which he rejected – his reason for never marrying. But for Tristan there is only one woman, Isolde, with Death as alternative. And this leads to the inevitable conclusion that it was not Schopenhauer and his doctrine that were responsible for the creation of Wagner's sublime music drama but his unfulfilled love for the woman he met and loved during these years, Mathilde Wesendonck.|$|E
25|$|On February 11, Mussolini {{signed the}} Lateran Treaty, making Vatican City a {{sovereign}} state.

Italy used the diplomatic prestige associated with this successful agreement to adopt a more aggressive foreign policy. Germany experienced a major turning <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> year due to the economic crash.
