50|$|The {{production}} of the first commercially successful transistor radio is often incorrectly attributed to Sony (originally Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo). However the Regency TR-1, made by the Regency Division of I.D.E.A. (Industrial Development Engineering Associates) of Indianapolis, Indiana, was the first <b>practical</b> <b>transistor</b> radio made in any significant numbers. The TR-1 was announced on October 18, 1954 and put on sale in November 1954 for $49.95 (the equivalent of about $361 in year-2005 dollars) and sold about 150,000 units.|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), such as low cost, flexibility and large-area fabrication, have recently {{attracted much attention}} due to their electronic applications. <b>Practical</b> <b>transistors</b> require high mobility, large on/off ratio, low threshold voltage and high stability. Development of new organic semiconductors is key to achieving these parameters. Recently, organic semiconductors have been synthesized showing comparable mobilities to amorphous-silicon-based FETs. These materials make OFETs more attractive and their applications have been attempted. New organic semiconductors resulting in high-performance FET devices are described here {{and the relationship between}} transistor characteristics and chemical structure is discussed...|$|R

50|$|There are {{numerous}} claimants {{to the title}} of the first company to produce <b>practical</b> <b>transistor</b> radios. Texas Instruments had demonstrated all-transistor AM radios as early as 1952, but their performance was well below that of equivalent battery tube models. A workable all-transistor radio was demonstrated in August 1953 at the Düsseldorf Radio Fair by the German firm Intermetall. It was built with four of Intermetall's hand-made transistors, based upon the 1948 invention of Herbert Mataré and Heinrich Welker.However, as with the early Texas units (and others) only prototypes were ever built; it was never put into commercial production.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in photoactive organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) is reviewed. Photoactive OFETs {{are divided into}} light-emitting (LE) and light-receiving (LR) OFETs. In the first part, LE-OFETs are reviewed {{from the viewpoint of}} the evolution of device structures. Device performances have improved in the last decade with the evolution of device structures from single-layer unipolar to multi-layer ambipolar transistors. In the second part, various kinds of LR-OFETs are featured. These are categorized according to their functionalities: phototransistors, non-volatile optical memories, and photochromism-based transistors. For both, various device configurations are introduced: thin-film based <b>transistors</b> for <b>practical</b> applications, single-crystalline <b>transistors</b> to investigate fundamental physics, nanowires, multi-layers, and vertical transistors based on new concepts...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} of a {{universal}} second-order filter using configurable analog blocks (CABs) for field programmable analog arrays is presented. The configurable blocks are capable of performing integration, differentiation, amplification, log, anti-log, add and negate functions. To maintain high frequency operation, the programmability and configurability of the blocks are achieved by digitally modifying the block's biasing conditions. Using at most four CABs, this article shows {{that it is possible to}} design a versatile second-order filter realizing all the standard five filter functions; lowpass, highpass, bandpass, notch and allpass. SPICE simulation results using <b>practical</b> bipolar junction <b>transistor</b> (BJT) parameters confirm the feasibility of using the CABs in designing second-order filters...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{companies}} working together, Texas Instruments of Dallas, Texas and Industrial Development Engineering Associates (I.D.E.A.) of Indianapolis, Indiana, {{were behind}} the unveiling of the Regency TR-1, the world's first commercially produced transistor radio. Previously, Texas Instruments was producing instrumentation for the oil industry and locating devices for the U.S. Navy and I.D.E.A. built home television antenna boosters. The two companies worked together on the TR-1, looking to grow revenues for their respective companies by breaking into this new product area. In May 1954, Texas Instruments had designed and built a prototype and was looking for an established radio manufacturer to develop and market a radio using their transistors. (The Chief Project Engineer for the radio design at Texas Instruments' headquarters in Dallas, Texas was Paul D. Davis, Jr., who had a degree in Electrical Engineering from Southern Methodist University. He was assigned the project due to his experience with radio engineering in World War II.) None of the major radio makers including RCA, Philco, and Emerson were interested. The President of I.D.E.A. at the time, Ed Tudor, jumped at the opportunity to manufacture the TR-1, predicting sales of the transistor radios at [...] "20 million radios in three years". [...] The Regency TR-1 was announced on October 18, 1954 by the Regency Division of I.D.E.A., was put on sale in November 1954, {{and was the first}} <b>practical</b> <b>transistor</b> radio made in any significant numbers. Billboard reported in 1954 that [...] "the radio has only four transistors. One acts as a combination mixer-oscillator, one as an audio amplifier, and two as intermediate-frequency amplifiers." [...] One year after the release of the TR-1 sales approached the 100,000 mark. The look and size of the TR-1 was well received, but the reviews of the TR-1's performance were typically adverse. The Regency TR-1 is patented by Richard C. Koch, , former Project Engineer of I.D.E.A.|$|E
3000|$|The unique [...] "zero-gap" [...] {{electronic}} structure of graphene, however, {{leads to a}} few limitations for application of this material in real electronic devices. In order, for example, to prepare a <b>practical</b> <b>transistor,</b> one {{has to have a}} graphene layer where energy band gap is induced via application of electric field or via modification of its {{electronic structure}} by means of functionalization. There are several ways of the modification of the electronic structure of graphene with the aim of gap formation [3]. Among these ways are (i) incorporation within the structure of nitrogen and/or boron or transition-metal atoms; (ii) use of different substrates that modify the electronic structure; (iii) intercalation of different materials underneath graphene grown on different substrates; and (iv) deposition of atoms or molecules on top, etc.|$|E
40|$|We {{employ a}} global {{optimization}} method to predict two-dimensional (2 D) nanostructures through the {{particle swarm optimization}} (PSO) algorithm. By performing PSO simulations, we predict new stable structures of boron monolayer sheets {{for a wide range}} of boron concentrations. We present a new class of boron sheets, composed of triangular and hexagonal motifs, which are more likely to be the precursors of boron nanotubes. We describe a simple and clear picture of electronic bonding in boron sheets and highlight the importance of three-center bonding and its competition with two-center bonding, which can also explain the stability of recently discovered boron monolayer sheets. The graphene-based electronics is an intriguing prospective for replacing silicon for next-generation of <b>transistors.</b> <b>Practical</b> application of graphene based materials requests a band gap. We present results from first-principles density-function calculation for semiconducting graphene based on nitrogen-seeded epitaxial graphene. A small fraction of covalently-bonded nitrogen leads to a band gap opening in epitaxial graphene and a transition from a semi metallic to a semiconducting state. The induced gap is shown to be attributed to the modification of the 1 t conjugation of epitaxial graphene. The resulting nitrogen-seeded graphene opens a band gap about 0. 8 eV, in good agreement with experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{transistors}} {{capable of}} forming an interconnected network are fundamental for optical information processing {{but have not}} been realized on a silicon chip. To be <b>practical,</b> an optical <b>transistor</b> must be cascadable, provide signal gain with logic level restoration, have input/output isolation and be free from critical biasing. It {{also needs to be}} compact and compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. However, almost all previous proposals or demonstrations of optical transistors fail to meet these criteria. ^ In this work, we demonstrate an all-silicon optical transistor using enhanced optical nonlinearity in two 5 -micrometer-radius silicon rings which allows a small optical signal to control a large signal. While a single device can simultaneously achieve 3 ̆e 3 dB signal gain and 3 ̆e 20 dB ON/OFF ratio, a cascaded device, can yield a signal gain of 3 ̆e 7 dB. An output ON/OFF ratio over 18 dB can be achieved with an input ON/OFF ratio of merely 2 dB. It also accomplishes fundamental logic operations like NAND or NOR on a single device, which normally require multiple electronic transistors. The optical transistor demonstrated here has many characteristics of its electronic analogue and promises to be a stepping stone for future optical computing. ^ This work will also touch base on some of the early work on realizing inverse opal photonic crystals as an efficient thin film solar cell back-reflector and on fabricating photonic crystals through a scaffold of hydrogen silsesquioxane resist. ...|$|R
