2500|$|Flappers' {{behavior}} was considered outlandish {{at the time}} and redefined women's roles. In the English media they were stereotyped as pleasure-loving, reckless and prone to defy convention by initiating sexual relationships. Some have suggested that the flapper concept as a stage of life particular to young women was imported to England from Germany, where it originated [...] "as a sexual reaction against the over-fed, under-exercised monumental woman, and as a compromise between pederasty and normal sex". In Germany teenage girls were called [...] "Backfisch", which meant a young fish not yet big enough to be sold in the market. [...] Although the concept of [...] "Backfisch" [...] was known in England by the late 1880s, the term was understood to mean a very demure social type unlike the flapper, who was typically rebellious and defiant of convention. The evolving image of flappers was of independent young women who went by night to jazz clubs such as those in Harlem, which were viewed as erotic and dangerous, where they danced provocatively, smoked cigarettes and dated freely, perhaps indiscriminately. [...] They were active, sporting, rode bicycles, drove cars, and openly drank alcohol, a defiant act in the American <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prohibition.</b> With time came the development of dance styles such as the Charleston, the Shimmy, the Bunny Hug, and the Black Bottom, which were considered shocking, but were a symbolic badge of the flapper's rejection of traditional standards.|$|E
