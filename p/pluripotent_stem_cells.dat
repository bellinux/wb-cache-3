Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary emphysema. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore {{the ability of the}} mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation in vitro.|$|E
5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 and 2007 it was {{reported}} that introducing a small number of specific transcription factor genes into normal skin cells of mice or humans can turn these cells into <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> known as induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> The technique uses modified retroviruses to transform the cells; this is a potential problem for human therapy since these viruses integrate their genes at a random location in the host's genome, which can interrupt other genes and potentially causes cancer.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} study on motor {{functional}} recovery after {{spinal cord injuries}} in mice showed that after human-induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were transplanted into the mice, the cells differentiated into three neural lineages in the spinal cord.

25|$|However, {{reprogramming}} {{allows for}} the creation of pluripotent cells, induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> from adult cells. It {{is important to note that}} these are not adult stem cells, but adult cells (e.g. epithelial cells) reprogrammed to give rise to cells with pluripotent capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein transcription factors, <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> with ESC-like capabilities have been derived. The first demonstration of Induced <b>Pluripotent</b> <b>Stem</b> <b>Cells</b> was conducted by Shinya Yamanaka and his colleagues at Kyoto University. They used the transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 to reprogram mouse fibroblast cells into pluripotent cells. Subsequent work used these factors to induce pluripotency in human fibroblast cells. Junying Yu, James Thomson, and their colleagues at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28, and carried out their experiments using cells from human foreskin. However, they were able to replicate Yamanaka's finding that inducing pluripotency in human cells was possible.|$|E

Unlike producing beta cells from conventional embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> or the more recently developed induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> (iPS) technique, Melton's method involved direct cell reprogramming of an adult cell type (exocrine cell) into other adult cell type (beta cell) without reversion to a <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> state.|$|R
25|$|In April 2009, it was {{demonstrated}} that generation of iPS cells is possible without any genetic alteration {{of the adult}} cell: a repeated treatment of the cells with certain proteins channeled into the cells via poly-arginine anchors was sufficient to induce pluripotency. The acronym given for those iPSCs is piPSCs (protein-induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> hold {{great promise}} {{in the field}} of {{regenerative}} medicine.

25|$|In June 2007, three {{separate}} research groups, {{including that of}} Yamanaka's, a Harvard/University of California, Los Angeles collaboration, and a group at MIT, published studies that substantially improved on the reprogramming approach, giving rise to iPSCs that were indistinguishable from ESCs.

30|$|Other, non-reprogrammed <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> {{populations have}} caught the {{attention}} of the scientific community as an alternative to ethically contentious ES cells and genetically modified iPS cells. However, though several populations of adult <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> that possess pluripotency have been put forth, many have faced a great deal of suspicion due to irreproducibility and pluripotency marker identification. Isolated from bone marrow, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), both pluripotent and non-tumorigenic, were reported to contribute to chimeric offspring when injected into a mouse model and to regenerate damaged tissue in vivo[17, 18]. Human marrow-isolated adult multilineage inducible (MIAMI) cells and very small embryonic-like <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (VSELs), isolated from umbilical cord blood in addition to bone marrow, were soon to follow, exhibiting similar pluripotent and non-tumorigenic properties [17 â€“ 19]. Like VSELs, unrestricted somatic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (USSCs), isolated from umbilical cord blood, are reportedly pluripotent but lack the classic <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> marker expression [20]. These adult <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> lines have all been publically flagged for further investigation and reproduction, {{or in the case of}} VSELs, negated entirely [21, 22].|$|R
25|$|The {{impetus for}} SCNT-based stem cell {{research}} has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells. Methods to reprogram normal body cells into <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were developed in humans in 2007. The following year, this method achieved a key goal of SCNT-based {{stem cell research}}: the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines that have all genes linked to various diseases. Some scientists working on SCNT-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Though recent studies have put in question how similar iPS cells are to embryonic stem cells. Epigenetic memory in iPS affects the cell lineage it can differentiate into. For instance, an iPS cell derived from a blood cell will be more efficient at differentiating into blood cells, while it will be less efficient at creating a neuron. This {{raises the question of}} how well iPS cells can mimic the gold standard ESC in experiments, as stem cells are defined as having the ability to differentiate into any cell type. SCNT stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies.|$|E
