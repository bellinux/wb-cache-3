40|$|The {{traditional}} chip-synchronous assumption used in {{the analyses}} of <b>optical</b> <b>codes</b> in <b>optical</b> code-division multiple access gives a pessimistic performance upper bound, while a more realistic chip-asynchronous assumption gives a more accurate performance. It is also known that a hard-limiter can be placed at {{the front end of}} an optical decoder to reduce the effects of multiple-access interference and the near-far problem. In this paper, the "hard-limiting" performance of two-dimensional (2 -D) <b>optical</b> <b>codes</b> is analyzed under the chip-asynchronous assumption. We apply a Markov-chain method for a more accurate analysis, which can be generalized to 2 -D <b>optical</b> <b>codes</b> with arbitrary maximum cross-correlation values.

40|$|With the {{explosive}} growth of bandwidth requirement in optical fiber communication networks, <b>optical</b> <b>code</b> division multiple access (OCDMA) has witnessed tremendous achievements {{as one of the}} promising technologies for optical access networks over the past decades. In an OCDMA system, <b>optical</b> <b>code</b> processing {{is one of the key}} techniques. Rapid <b>optical</b> <b>code</b> reconfiguration can improve flexibility and security of the OCDMA system. This thesis focuses on advanced optical modulations and en/decoding techniques for applications in fast reconfigurable OCDMA systems and secure optical communications. A novel time domain spectral phase encoding (SPE) scheme which can rapidly reconfigure the <b>optical</b> <b>code</b> and is compatible with conventional spectral domain phase en/decoding by using a pair of dispersive devices and a high speed phase modulator is proposed. Based on this scheme, a novel advanced modulation technique that can simultaneously generate both the <b>optical</b> <b>code</b> and the differential-phase-shift-keying (DPSK) data using a single phase modulator is experimentally demonstrated. A symmetric time domain spectral phase encoding and decoding (SPE/SPD) scheme using a similar setup for both the transmitter and receiver is further proposed, based on which a bit-by-bit <b>optical</b> <b>code</b> scrambling and DPSK data modulation technique for secure optical communications has been successfully demonstrated. By combining optical encoding and optical steganography, a novel approach for secure transmission of time domain spectral phase encoded on-off-keying (OOK) /DPSK-OCDMA signal over public wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) network has also been proposed and demonstrated. To enable high speed operation of the time domain SPE/SPD scheme and enhance the system security, a rapid programmable, code-length variable bit-by-bit <b>optical</b> <b>code</b> shifting technique is proposed. Based on this technique, security improvements for OOK/DPSK OCDMA systems at data rates of 10 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s using reconfigurable <b>optical</b> <b>codes</b> of up to 1024 -chip have been achieved. Finally, a novel tunable two-dimensional coherent optical en/decoder which can simultaneously perform wavelength hopping and spectral phase encoding based on coupled micro-ring resonator is proposed and theoretically investigated. The techniques included in this thesis could be potentially used for future fast reconfigurable and secure <b>optical</b> <b>code</b> based communication systems...|$|R

40|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} of communication systems, network security issues {{have more and}} more impact on daily life. It is essential to construct a high degree of optical layer security to resolve the security problem once and for all. Three different techniques which can provide optical layer security are introduced and compared. Optical chaos can be used for fast random number generation. Quantum cryptography is the most promising technique for key distribution. And the <b>optical</b> <b>coding</b> techniques can be deployed to encrypt the modulated signal in the optical layer. A mathematical equation has been derived from information theory to evaluate the information-theoretic security level of the wiretap channel in <b>optical</b> <b>coding</b> schemes. And the merits and limitation of two coherent <b>optical</b> <b>coding</b> schemes, temporal phase coding and spectral phase coding, have been analysed. The security scheme based on a reconfigurable <b>optical</b> <b>coding</b> device has been introduced, and the corresponding security protocol has been developed. By moving the encryption operation from the electronic layer to the optical layer, the modulated signals become opaque to the unauthorised users. <b>Optical</b> <b>code</b> distribution and authentication is the one of the major challenges for our proposed scheme. In our proposed protocol, both of the operations are covered and defined in detail.
