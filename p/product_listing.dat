500|$|Prior to any {{announcement}} regarding Knights of the Nine, Bethesda had {{pursued a}} somewhat novel plan to distribute downloadable content through micropayments, priced from US$0.99 to US$2.99, {{instead of the}} more common practice of releasing expansion packs. The program was initially met with criticism by customers due to its alleged low value, but later releases—at a reduced price, and with more content—proved more popular. The releases, in addition to stirring controversy, raised questions regarding Bethesda's future content release plans, and as to whether expansion pack releases were necessary at all. In August 2006, one Bethesda employee wrote in a post to Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls forums {{that the company had}} [...] "no plans to make an expansion for Oblivion". Further questions were raised by a <b>product</b> <b>listing</b> found on game retailer GameStop's website September 11, 2006, listing a Knights of the White Stallion Expansion Pack for Oblivion. The game had a listed shipping date of November 21, 2006. The title was kept on the website only brieflyremoved after gaming news site GameSpot sent Bethesda a request for comment on the product.|$|E
