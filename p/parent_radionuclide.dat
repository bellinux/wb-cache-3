50|$|The {{decaying}} nucleus {{is called}} the <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclide</b> (or parent radioisotope), and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide.

50|$|When {{particles}} {{are subject to}} radioactive decay, Decay correction {{may be used to}} compute the decay rate or number of particles at a point in time relative to when they were measured.

The dried samples were then grinded into fine powder using a stainless steel ball mill and sieved through a 2  mm mesh size and poured into 1  l Marinelli beakers. The Marinelli beakers were hermetically sealed, weighed and stored for 4  weeks, to allow the short-lived daughters of 238 U and 232 Th decay series to attain equilibrium with their long-lived <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclides</b> (ASTM 1983, 1986).

40|$|A current {{emphasis}} in nuclear medicine is to better match the physical lifetime of the radionuclides used in vivo for {{diagnosis and treatment}} to the biological lifetime of the diagnostic procedure or to minimize radiation dose to areas other than those to be treated. In many cases the biological lifetime is {{on the order of}} minutes. Since the direct production of radionuclides with half lives of minutes requires the user to be near a suitable reactor or accelerator, this study was undertaken to produce short-lived radionuclides indirectly. If a long-lived radionuclide decays into a short-lived radionuclide, quick separation of the daughter activity from the parent enables the user to have a short-lived daughter while freeing him from the constraint of proximity to a cyclotron. Systems where a short-lived daughter is separated from a long-lived <b>parent</b> are called <b>radionuclide</b> generators. Two generator systems were developed for use in nuclear medicine, one in diagnostic work and the other for therapeutic work. The yield and breakthrough characteristics were within the limits required to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure in patients. Two <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclides</b> were produced using the beams available from medium energy cyclotrons. The yield was high enough to produce generators that would be useful in clinical applications...|$|R
50|$|Secular {{equilibrium}} {{can only}} {{occur in a}} radioactive decay chain if the half-life of the daughter radionuclide B is much shorter than the half-life of the <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclide</b> A. In such a situation, the decay rate of A, and hence the production rate of B, is approximately constant, because the half-life of A is very long compared to the timescales being considered. The quantity of radionuclide B builds up until the number of B atoms decaying per unit time becomes equal to the number being produced per unit time; the quantity of radionuclide B then reaches a constant, equilibrium value. Assuming the initial concentration of radionuclide B is zero, full equilibrium usually takes several half-lives of radionuclide B to establish.|$|E

2500|$|The biggest {{source of}} natural {{background}} radiation is airborne radon, a radioactive gas that emanates from the ground. Radon and its isotopes, <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclides,</b> and decay products {{all contribute to}} an average inhaled dose of 1.26mSv/a (millisievert [...] ). Radon is unevenly distributed and varies with weather, such that much higher doses apply to {{many areas of the}} world, where it represents a significant health hazard. Concentrations over 500 times the world average have been found inside buildings in Scandinavia, the United States, Iran, and the Czech Republic. Radon is a decay product of uranium, which is relatively common in the Earth's crust, but more concentrated in ore-bearing rocks scattered around the world. Radon seeps out of these ores into the atmosphere or into ground water or infiltrates into buildings. It can be inhaled into the lungs, along with its decay products, where they will reside {{for a period of time}} after exposure.|$|R

In intervals of high transuranic concentrations, gamma rays from other sources may complicate analysis and interpretation.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of painful skeletal metastases {{is a common}} clinical problem, {{and the use of}} therapeutic radionuclides which localize at metastatic sites {{has been found to be}} an effective method for {{treatment of}} pain, especially for multiple sites for which the use of external beam irradiation is impractical. There are currently several metastatic-targeted agents radiolabeled with various therapeutic radionuclides which are in various stages of clinical investigation. Since neutron rich radionuclides are produced in research reactors and often decay by emission of beta(-) particles, most radionuclides used for bone pain palliation are reactor-produced. Key examples of radionuclides produced by single neutron capture of enriched targets include rhenium- 186 and samarium- 153. In addition, generator systems are also of interest which provide therapeutic daughter radionuclides from the decay of reactor-produced <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclides.</b> One important example is rhenium- 188, available from generators via decay of reactor-produced tungsten- 188. Tin- 117 m is an example of a reactor-produced radionuclide which decays with the emission of low-energy conversion electrons rather than by beta(-) decay. Each of these agents and/or radionuclides has specific advantages and disadvantages, however, the ideal agent for bone pain palliation has not yet been identified. The goal of this paper is to briefly review the production and use of several reactor-produced radionuclides for bone pain palliation, and to discuss the role of the ORNL High Flux Isotope Reactor(HFIR) for the production of many of these radionuclides...|$|R

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{radioactive materials}} (NORM) found in liquid wastes from hydraulic fracturing are an emerging environmental health concern. 1 The heavily drilled Marcellus Shale, for example, contains isotopes of radium, polonium, and lead. 2, 3 However, the few {{studies that have}} focused on NORM in fracking wastewater (produced fluids) have reported on a single element—radium. 4, 5 In this issue of EHP, researchers estimate total reactivity for a mixture of isotopes present in liquid fracking waste from the Marcellus Shale. 3 Decay chains—the series of transformations that radionuclides undergo until a stable isotope is produced—are important in planning for the treatment, management, and disposal of radioactive waste. 6 Long-lived radioactive elements (such as 226 radium) transform into shorter-lived decay products (such as 210 lead and 210 polonium).

40|$|This Performance Assessment for the Savannah River Site E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility was {{prepared}} to meet requirements of Chapter IV of the Department of Energy Order 435. 1 - 1. The Order specifies that a Performance Assessment should provide reasonable assurance that a low-level waste disposal facility will comply with the performance objectives of the Order. The Order also requires assessments of impacts to water resources and to hypothetical inadvertent intruders for purposes of establishing limits on radionuclides that may be disposed near-surface. According to the Order, calculations of potential doses and releases from the facility should address a 1, 000 -year period after facility closure. The point of compliance for the performance measures relevant to the all pathways and air pathway performance objective, {{as well as to}} the impact on water resources assessment requirement, must correspond to the point of highest projected dose or concentration beyond a 100 -m buffer zone surrounding the disposed waste following the assumed end of active institutional controls 100 years after facility closure. During the operational and institutional control periods, the point of compliance for the all pathways and air pathway performance measures is the SRS boundary. However, for the water resources impact assessment, the point of compliance remains the point of highest projected dose or concentration beyond a 100 -m buffer zone surrounding the disposed waste during the operational and institutional control periods. For performance measures relevant to radon and inadvertent intruders, the points of compliance are the disposal facility surface for all time periods and the disposal facility after the assumed loss of active institutional controls 100 years after facility closure, respectively. The E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility is located in the central region of the SRS known as the General Separations Area. It is an elbow-shaped, cleared area, which curves to the northwest, situated immediately north of the Mixed Waste Management Facility. The E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility is comprised of 200 acres for waste disposal and a surrounding buffer zone that extends out to the 100 -m point of compliance. Disposal units within the footprint of the low-level waste facilities include the Slit Trenches, Engineered Trenches, Component-in-Grout Trenches, the Low-Activity Waste Vault, the Intermediate-Level Vault, and the Naval Reactor Component Disposal Area. Radiological waste disposal operations at the E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility began in 1994. E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility closure will be conducted in three phases: operational closure, interim closure, and final closure. Operational closure will be conducted during the 25 -year operation period (30 -year period for Slit and Engineered Trenches) as disposal units are filled; interim closure measures will be taken for some units. Interim closure will take place following the end of operations and will consist of an area-wide runoff cover along with additional grading over the trench units. Final closure of all disposal units in the E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility will take place at the end of the 100 -year institutional control period and will consist of the installation of an integrated closure system designed to minimize moisture contact with the waste and to serve as a deterrent to intruders. Radiological dose to human receptors is analyzed in this PA in the all-pathways analysis, the inadvertent intruder analysis and the air pathway analysis, and the results are compared to the relevant performance measures. For the all-pathways analysis, the performance measure of relevance is a 25 -mrem/yr EDE to representative members of the public, excluding dose from radon and its progeny in air. For the inadvertent intruder, the applicable performance measures are 100 -mrem/yr EDE and 500 mrem/yr EDE for chronic and exposure scenarios, respectively. The relevant performance measure for the air pathway is 10 -mrem/yr EDE via the air pathway, excluding dose from radon and its progeny in air. Protection of groundwater resources is addressed by comparing calculated compliance point concentrations in groundwater with the relevant performance measure, which was determined to be the Safe Drinking Water Act MCLs for beta-gamma and alpha-emitting radionuclides, and for radium and uranium. Radon fluxes for each disposal unit are calculated and compared to the average flux of 20 pCi/m{sup 2 }/s upper limit specified in the relevant performance objective. Thirty-five <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclides</b> are addressed in the groundwater transport calculations, 15 radionuclides in the air pathway calculations, and 78 <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in the intruder analysis for all disposal units. Radon- 222 fluxes are also evaluated for all disposal units...|$|R
40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{have previously}} been {{proposed for the}} source of elevated radon in ground water of southwestern Ohio: (1) penecontemporaneous uranium at the Silurian-Ordovician unconformity, and/or (2) <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclides</b> transported from fragments of uranium-rich Ohio Shale within the glacial drift above the aquifer. To further test the first hypothesis, vertical profiles of dissolved radon in ground water and uranium in rock cores were obtained at two locations immediately underlain by the Silurian/Ordovician unconformity. Radon concentrations exceeding 1000 pCi/l occurred in zones where the bedrock had uranium concentrations greater than 1. 5 ppm. Radon concentrations of less than 500 pCi/l occurred in zones where the rock had uranium concentrations below 0. 25 ppm. A log-linear regression model between uranium and radon had a correlation coefficient of 0. 82. Three aspects of the results support the hypothesis that the source is transported, although not necessarily from fragments of Ohio Shale. First, the high uranium-radon zones did not occur consistently or exclusively at the Silurian/Ordovician unconformity. Second, the high uranium-radon zones are correlated to fracture zones having a higher hydraulic conductivity and thus appear {{to be related to the}} zones of greater flow and transport. Third, the amount of uranium-radon disequilibrium increases exponentially with increasing hydraulic conductivity. The hypothesis of a penecontemporaneous source, not supported by our study, arose when previous investigators conducted regional surveys of domestic wells and springs and found a correspondence between elevated radon and the location of the Silurian-Ordovician unconformity. The observations of the previous investigators can be explained by the fact that the basal Silurian is in some places a horizon of higher hydraulic conductivity that facilitates transport. The two most probable external sources of uranium would be uranium-containing detritus in the glacial drift or uranium-containing phosphate fertilizers spread on the surface. Given that the uranium was transported into the aquifer during the Holocene, it could not have generated enough radium in the time elapsed since entering the aquifer to produce the radon levels that were measured. This observation indicates that radium was cotransported with uranium into the zones of high radon...|$|R

The study participants used varying modelling approaches and information sources to estimate dose rates and tissue concentrations {{for a range of}} biota types exposed to soil contamination at a shallow radionuclide waste burial site in Australia. Results indicated that the dominant factor causing variation in dose rate estimates (up to three orders of magnitude on mean total dose rates) was the soil-to-organism transfer of radionuclides that included variation in transfer parameter values as well as transfer calculation methods. Additional variation was associated with other modelling factors including: how participants conceptualised and modelled the exposure configurations (two orders of magnitude); which progeny to include with the <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclide</b> (typically less than one order of magnitude); and dose calculation parameters, including radiation weighting factors and dose conversion coefficients (typically less than one order of magnitude).

40|$|This article {{continues}} {{from the earlier}} article "An Introduction to Nuclear Medicine" where the general principles of nuclear medicine were discussed. Radionuclides are required in both diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures. Naturally occurring radionuclides are generally not suitable for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures due to their typically long half-lives or less than ideal physical or chemical characteristics; therefore appropriate radionuclides need to be produced. The common methods of radionuclide production for nuclear medicine include: fission, neutron activation, cyclotron and generator. Fission occurs in a nuclear reactor where neutrons are used to bombard fission nuclides such as uranium- 235 (235 U) or plutonium- 239 (239 Pu). Fission results in the splitting of the large nucleus into smaller fission fragments along {{with the release of}} gamma radiation and high energy neutrons. Neutron activation also takes place in a nuclear reactor. The neutrons are used to bombard stable nuclides to form other radionuclides. There are disadvantages with this process so other production means are oft en preferred. Cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles such as protons (p), deuterons (d), triton (t) and alpha (alpha) particles to high velocities to penetrate the orbital electrons of the target atom and interact with the nucleus. Generators produce the most commonly used radionuclide in nuclear medicine, technetium- 99 m (99 mTc). The radionuclide generator sees the decay of a long half-life <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclide</b> to a short half-life daughter radionuclide. The daughter is the radionuclide used in nuclear medicine.

The practical yield of Nd- 140 at EOB in the former reaction over the energy range of E- 3 He = 33. 5 -> 0 MeV amounted to 3. 5 MBq/mu A It and in the latter reaction over the energy range of E-p = 18. 6 -> 16. 2 MeV to 15. 5 MBq/mu A h. These values correspond to about 41 % and 60 % of the respective theoretical values. Successful separations of the radionuclide were performed by means of cation-exchange chromatography resulting in decontamination factors of >= 10 (8) and >= 7 x 10 (5) for the cerium and praseodymium target materials, respectively. With the no-carrier-added Nd- 140 obtained, an efficient Nd- 140 /Pr- 140 radionuclide generator system was developed and evaluated.

As part of the PA process, an analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential magnitude of gaseous release of radionuclides from the FTF over the 100 -year institutional control period and 10, 000 -year post-closure compliance period. Specifically, an air and radon pathways analysis has been conducted to estimate the flux of volatile radionuclides and radon at the ground surface due to residual waste remaining in the tanks following closure. This analysis was used as the basis to estimate the dose to the maximally exposed individual (MEI) for the air pathway per Curie (Ci) of each radionuclide remaining in the combined FTF waste tanks. For the air pathway analysis, several gaseous radionuclides were considered. These included carbon- 14 (C- 14), chlorine- 36 (Cl- 36), iodine- 129 (I- 129), selenium- 79 (Se- 79), antimony- 125 (Sb- 125), tin- 126 (Sn- 126), tritium (H- 3), and technetium- 99 (Tc- 99).

Unfortunately, all available emitters have serious disadvantages: 211 At forms weak bond with carbon atoms in the biomolecule {{and in the case}} of 212 Bi and 213 Bi short half-life often limits the application of these nuclides. However, the short half-life of 212 Bi and 213 Bi could be effectively lengthened by binding the <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclide</b> 212 Pb (t 1 / 2 = 10. 6 h) or 225 Ac (t 1 / 2 = 10 d) to the biomolecule, thereby effectively extending the use of short half-life 212 Bi and 213 Bi. In addition, in vivo generator delivers much greater dose per unit of administered activity compared to 212 Bi and 213 Bi alone. In our studies we investigated the use of TiO 2 nanoparticles as potential carriers for 225 Ac/ 213 Bi in vivo generator. The TiO 2 nanoparticles have unique properties like: high specific surface, high affinity for multivalent cations and simple way of synthesis, which are useful in the process of labelling. Commercially available (e. g. P- 25 Degussa) and synthesised in our laboratory nanoparticles were used in experiments. The nanoparticles were characterized by TEM, SEM, DLS and NanoSight techniques. In our experiments we tested two different methods of labelling. The first one was based on the possibility of formation strong bonds with certain cations on the surface of the nanopraticles. In the second one, TiO 2 nanoparticles were doped with 225 Ac during the process of synthesis. In both cases we obtained high yields of labelling (> 99 %). Afterwards, the stability of labelled nanoparticles was examined in 0. 9 % NaCl, 10 - 3 M EDTA, solutions of biologically active substances (cysteine, glutathione) and human serum. In the case of TiO 2 nanoparticles with 225 Ac, which was built in the crystalline structure, the leakage of 225 Ac and its daughter radionuclides was not significant in any of solutions, even when the incubation time was extended to 10 days. The leakage in serum, from nanoparticles with adsorbed 225 Ac on their surface, was slightly higher, but still insignificant. The obtained results show high stability of labelled nanoparticles and allow to begin further experiments, which are based on modification of the surface by silane compounds which enable binding TiO 2 nanoparticles to the biomolecules.

40|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} {{is a relatively}} young medical field. The nuclear medicine department performs both diagnostic tests and therapies using open radiation sources whereas the diagnostic use currently prevails. The imaging method used is called scintigraphy and uses a scintillation camera capturing the distribution of administered radiopharmaceutical. Using a scintillation detector, which is incorporated in a gamma camera, {{the distribution of the}} radiopharmaceutical in the target tissue can be observed, either after {{a certain period of time}} from the administration of the radiopharmaceutical (static scintigraphy) or over time (dynamic scintigraphy). One of the most common examinations performed at the nuclear medicine department is bone scintigraphy. The examination is carried out using osteotropic radiopharmaceutical that binds to bones, thus revealing pathologies caused by the change of metabolic activity. The examination in itself takes place through external detection of the administered radiopharmaceutical. Bone scintigraphy is a very useful examination that is used to detect bone metastases in cancer diseases, to diagnose primary malignant bone tumors, to detect infectious processes in the bones, to diagnose joint diseases, metabolic diseases of the skeleton, and bone injuries. The examination in itself is performed by using radiopharmaceuticals. Once administered, the radiopharmaceutical serves as a diagnostic indicator. This is a medicine that incorporates a radionuclide that emits ionizing radiation. The radionuclides used in nuclear medicine are artificially prepared and transported either as ready-to-use products or as radionuclide generators to the nuclear medicine department. The generator that is the most commonly used at the nuclear medicine department is the 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generator. The above mentioned radionuclide generator consists of a glass chromatography column which is located in a lead shielding cylinder. The column contains the adsorbent material (alumina) in which the <b>parent</b> <b>radionuclide</b> is adsorbed. Due to different chemical properties of the parent and the daughter element the daughter radionuclide can be washed out (eluted) by means of a suitable solution. In practice, the radiopharmaceuticals are commonly prepared using kits that are commercially available. The kits are labeled by using sodium pertechnetate solution obtained from the 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generator. Prior to the administration of the radiopharmaceutical to the patient it is necessary to carry out the determination of radiochemical purity. The most commonly used is a paper chromatography and thin layer chromatography. In the Czech Republic, 99 mTc labelled diphosphonates (e. g. the kits TechneScan HDP, 6 -MDP or 8 -MDP are used for bone scintigraphy. These osteotropic radiopharmaceuticals are prepared in a shielded laminar box in the radiopharmaceutical laboratory at the nuclear medicine department. The preparation is subject to the manufacturer's instructions. After preparation, prior to administration to the patient, the determination of radiochemical purity needs to be performed. The determination of radiochemical purity of the radiopharmaceutical TechneScan HDP is carried out by using thin layer chromatography (ITLC-SG) by means of 13. 6 % solution of sodium acetate and methyl ethyl ketone as eluent. However, this determination is demanding for the normal operation of the department in terms of design as well as costs. Therefore, a suitable alternative method was sought. The new method consists in paper chromatography by using 0. 9 % solution of sodium chloride and acetone as eluent. After 50 determinations of radiochemical purity using pharmacopoeial and alternative methods was found that the alternative method is applicable for the routine determination of radiochemical purity during normal operation of the nuclear medicine departmen...|$|E
