40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>haze</b> {{formation}} in white wine {{is dependent on}} the presence of both wine protein and other unknown wine components, termed factor(s) X. The ability to reconstitute <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> upon heating artificial model wine solutions (500 mg/L thaumatin, 12 % ethanol, 4 g/L tartaric acid) to which candidate components were added was employed to identify factor(s) X. No <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> was formed in the absence of additives. The individual or combined addition of caffeic acid, caftaric acid, epicatechin, epigallocatechin- 0 -gallate, gallic acid, or ferulic acid at typical white wine concentrations did not generate <b>protein</b> <b>haze.</b> However, PVPP fining of commercial wines resulted in a reduction in <b>protein</b> <b>haze,</b> suggesting that phenolic compounds may play a modulating role in haze formation. To elucidate the nature of the unknown factor(s) wine was fractionated and fractions were back-added to model wine and tested for their essentiality. Wine fractions were generated by ultrafiltration, reverse-phase chromatography, and mixed-mode anion-exchange and reverse-phase chromatography. The only purified fraction containing the essential component(s) was free of phenolic compounds, and analysis by mass spectrometry identified sulfate anion as the dominant component. Reconstitution with KHSO 4 using either commercially available thaumatin or wine proteins confirmed the role of sulfate in wine <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> formation. The two main wine proteins, thaumatin-like protein and chitinase, differed in their haze response in model wines containing sulfate. Other common wine anions, acetate, chloride, citrate, phosphate, and tartrate, and wine cations, Fe 2 +/ 3 + and Cu+/ 2 +, when added at typical white wine concentrations were not found to be essential for <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> formation.

40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>haze</b> is an {{aesthetic}} problem in white wines {{that can be}} prevented by removing the grape proteins that have survived the winemaking process.

Protein removal is currently achieved by bentonite addition, an inefficient process that can lead to higher costs and quality losses in winemaking. The development of more efficient processes for protein removal and haze prevention requires understanding the mechanisms such as the main drivers of protein instability and the impacts of various wine matrix components on haze formation.

40|$|White wines {{suffer from}} heat-induced <b>protein</b> <b>hazes</b> during {{transport}} and storage unless the proteins are removed prior to bottling. Bentonite fining {{is by far the}} most commonly used method, but it is inefficient and creates several other process challenges. An alternative to bentonite is the enzymatic removal of haze-forming grape pathogenesis-related proteins using added proteases. The major problem with this approach is that grape pathogenesis-related proteins are highly protease resistant unless they are heat denatured in combination with enzymatic treatment. This paper demonstrates that the protease BcAP 8, from the grape fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, is capable of degrading chitinase, a major class of haze-forming proteins, without heat denaturation. Because BcAP 8 effectively removes haze-forming proteins under normal winemaking conditions, it could potentially benefit winemakers by reducing bentonite requirement...|$|R
40|$|Consumers expect white wines to be clear. During {{the storage}} of wines, grape {{proteins}} can aggregate to form <b>haze.</b> These <b>proteins,</b> particularly chitinases and thaumatin-like proteins (TL-proteins), need to be removed, and this is done through adsorption by bentonite, an effective but inefficient wine-processing step. Alternative processes are sought, but, {{for them to be}} successful, an in-depth understanding of the causes of <b>protein</b> <b>hazing</b> is required. This study investigated the role played by ionic strength (I) and sulfate toward the aggregation of TL-proteins and chitinases upon heating. Purified proteins were dissolved in model wine and analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The effect of Ion protein aggregation was investigated within the range from 2 to 500 mM/L. For chitinases, aggregation occurred during heating with I values of 100 and 500 mM/L, depending on the isoform. This aggregation immediately {{led to the formation of}} large particles (3 mu m, visible haze after cooling). TL-protein aggregation was observed only with I of 500 mM/L; it mainly developed during cooling and led to the formation of finite aggregates (400 nm) that remained invisible. With sulfate in the medium chitinases formed visible haze immediately when heat was applied, whereas TL-proteins aggregated during cooling but not into particles large enough to be visible to the naked eye. The data show that the aggregation mechanisms of TL-proteins and chitinases are different and are influenced by the ionic strength and ionic content of the model wine.

40|$|Bentonite fining {{is used in}} the {{clarification}} of white wines to prevent <b>protein</b> <b>haze.</b> This treatment results in the loss of {{a significant portion of the}} wine itself, as well as aroma compounds important for the quality of white wines. Among other interesting effects on wine quality, yeast cell wall mannoproteins have been shown to stabilize wine against <b>protein</b> <b>haze.</b> A previous work showed that wine yeast strains engineered by deletion of KNR 4 release increased amounts of mannoproteins and produce wines showing attenuated responses in <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> tests. This paper describes the technological properties of several new recombinant wine yeast strains, deleted for genes involved in cell-wall biogenesis, as well as the regulatory gene KNR 4. Stabilization of wines produced by three of the six recombinant strains analyzed required 20 − 40 % less bentonite than those made with their nonrecombinant counterparts. The availability of multiple targets for genetically improving yeast mannoprotein release, as shown in this work, is relevant not only for genetic engineering of wine yeast but especially for the feasibility of genetically improving this character by classical methods of strain development such as random mutagenesis or sexual hybridization.

40|$|Protein {{denaturation}} {{in white}} wines results into a hazy suspension with precipitate formation, affecting negatively their commercialization. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify a number of non-protein factors of wines, which exhibit a modulating effect upon haze formation and interfere with protein precipitation in white wines, applying stepwise multiple regression analysis. The influence of intrinsic non-protein factors, including surface and groundwater quality, on <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> formation assessed by the heat test was studied. Experiments were performed on 18 Sauvignon Blanc wines from six Chilean valleys. The influence of non-protein factors (pH, electrical conductivity [EC], total and volatile acidity, alcohol, free and total sulfur dioxide, total polyphenols, and chloride, sulfate, K, Na, Ca, Mg, and Fe concentrations) on haze response was evaluated by means of multiple regression analysis. Significant contribution (p < 0. 05) of EC, sulfate and Fe concentrations to <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> was found. Due to multi-collinearity between sulfate and Fe concentrations, the multi-linear model of haze response was reduced to: Haze = - 184 + 2. 95 x [Protein] - 62. 3 x [Fe] + 0. 17 x EC (r a = 0. 901). Electric conductivities of wine and surface water were correlated (p = 0. 037); good correlations were also found between sulfate concentrations in wine and surface water (p = 0. 003), and groundwater (p = 0. 022). No correlation was detected for Fe. This study elucidates that <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> formation in white wine is a multi-factorial process.

40|$|White wine clarity is essential, {{but it can}} be {{marred by}} the {{presence}} of a <b>protein</b> <b>haze.</b> This <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> is predominantly formed by grape-derived thaumatin-like proteins and chitinases, which can slowly denature and aggregate if left in bottled wines. Currently bentonite fining is used by the wine industry to prevent <b>protein</b> <b>haze.</b> Bentonite consists of fine clay particles that, when added to wine, bind and remove the haze-forming proteins. However this method is inconvenient, time-consuming, and causes significant losses of wine. It is estimated that this process costs the Australian wine industry $ 50 m annually in wine losses alone. Alternatives are thus being investigated. The principal objective of this thesis was to investigate the sensory effects on wine of an alternative method to bentonite fining: addition of haze protective factor 2, known as Hpf 2. Hpf 2 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannoprotein that has been shown to reduce <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> in wines. It is a highly mannosylated 180 kDa protein, of which approximately 75 % by weight is mannose. Previous work has shown that the addition of approximately 200 mg L⁻¹ Hpf 2 to wines reduces the visible haze in wine by approximately 50 %. Hpf 2 is naturally present in wines at concentrations of less than 10 ng L⁻¹, much lower than the concentration required for haze protection activity. However, the sensory impacts involved with the addition of such high concentrations of Hpf 2 in wine have never been studied. This knowledge is essential for the future commercial prospects of this alternative approach to protein stabilisation of wine. To undertake sensory studies, over 1 g of Hpf 2 would be required. Presently, the laboratory-scale process for the production of a 6 -histidine tagged version of the protein, 6 xHisHpf 2, in a laboratory yeast strain of S. cerevisiae, produces only milligram quantities. Consequently, the first challenge of this research was to scale up the existing process to produce sufficient quantities of Hpf 2. The first attempt to increase the production level was by over-expression in the bacteria Escherichia coli. Although several approaches were trialled, 6 xHisHpf 2 was unable to be successfully and consistently expressed in this system. The second method was by improving the original yeast expression system, and the expression level was able to be improved approximately 10 -fold. This improved expression method was scaled up to produce and then purify over 1 g of protein. Several quantification methods were assessed to determine the efficiencies of each purification step, with slot blot analysis proving successful. Sensory trials were conducted to establish the effect of 6 xHisHpf 2 on wines, with duo-trio studies conducted assessing both aroma and palate of the wines. Invertase, another yeast haze protective factor, was also trialled. It was found that the addition of an active level of 6 xHisHpf 2 or invertase did not cause {{a significant difference in the}} aroma or palate of wines. In addition to this main study, the role of the glycosylation was studied. 6 xHisHpf 2, produced in a different yeast, Pichia pastoris, was found to be 83 kDa, with only 50 % mannose. This protein was compared to the S. cerevisiae protein in its ability to reduce <b>protein</b> <b>haze,</b> and it was shown that the P. pastoris protein could reduce haze, but not as effectively as the S. cerevisiae protein. The finding that Hpf 2 does not affect the sensory properties of wine is essential if Hpf 2 is to be used commercially, as winemakers and wine consumers would most likely reject an additive that alters the wine aroma or palate.

These soluble pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are extracted from grape berries. However, their distribution in different grape tissues is not well documented. In this study, proteins were first separately extracted from the skin, pulp and seed of Sauvignon Blanc grapes, followed by trypsin digestion and analysis by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Proteins identified included 75 proteins from Sauvignon Blanc grape skin, 63 from grape pulp and 35 from grape seed, mostly functionally classified as associated with metabolism and energy. Some were present exclusively in specific grape tissues; for example, proteins involved in photosynthesis were only detected in grape skin and proteins found in alcoholic fermentation were only detected in grape pulp. Moreover, proteins identified in grape seed were less diverse than those identified in grape skin and pulp. TLPs and chitinases were identified in both Sauvignon Blanc grape skin and pulp, but not in the seed. To relatively quantify the PR proteins, the protein extracts of grape tissues were seperated by HPLC first and then analysed by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that the protein fractions eluted at 9. 3 min and 19. 2 min under the chromatographic conditions of this study confirmed that these corresponded to TLPs and chitinases seperately. Thus, the relative quantification of TLPs and chitinases in protein extracts was carried out by comparing the area of corresponding peaks against the area of a thamautin standard. The results presented in this study clearly demonstrated the distribution of haze-forming PR proteins in grape berries, and the relative quantification of TLPs and chitinases could be applied in fast tracking of changes in PR proteins during grape growth and determination of PR proteins in berries at harvest...|$|R

As first applications of the model, we have tested it against experimental turbidimetry data of three proteins relevant to the wine industry and biochemistry, namely, thaumatin, a thaumatinlike protein, and alpha -lactalbumin. The model is very robust and describes amorphous experimental data to a high degree of accuracy.

Field {{tests to}} {{evaluate}} in-line dosing with bentonite followed by centrifugation {{as an alternative}} to batch fining for <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> control in white wine or juice were undertaken. The tests were performed at a commercial winery with a Sultana wine and Gordo (Muscat of Alexandria) juice and using two types of bentonite: Vitiben and SIHA-Active-Bentonite G. Fining performance was monitored by heat testing and quantification of heat unstable protein by HPLC. Heat test turbidity and heat unstable protein concentration decreased to stable values between 30 s and 2 min after bentonite injection. Sensory evaluation of Sultana wine fined with Vitiben by balanced reference duo-trio difference tests detected no difference between untreated, in-line dosed, and batch fined wine. Furthermore the volume of wine or juice occluded in lees can be substantially reduced by centrifugal compaction. However, incomplete separation of bentonite from wine or juice during centrifugation produced a carryover of 30 % of the added bentonite into the clarified wine. This carryover problem may be mitigated, inter alia, by reducing operating flowrate through the centrifuge or using multiple centrifugation steps (in parallel or series). Therefore, in-line dosing followed by centrifugation provides a rapid processing method for <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> reduction in wine or juice with a decreased volume of lees.

In this study, Sauvignon Blanc grapes were harvested and processed in two vintages (2011 and 2012) by three different treatments: (1) hand harvesting with whole bunch press (H-WB); (2) hand harvesting with destem/crush and 3 h skin contact (H-DC- 3); and (3) machine harvesting with destem/crush and 3 h skin contact (M-DC- 3). The juices were collected at three pressure levels (0. 4 MPa, 0. 8 MPa and 1. 6 MPa), some juices were fermented in 750 mL of wine bottles to determine the bentonite requirement for the resulting wines. Results showed juices of M-DC- 3 had significantly lower concentration of proteins, including PR proteins, compared to those of H-DC- 3, likely due to the greater juice yield of M-DC- 3 and interactions between proteins and phenolics. Juices from the 0. 8 – 1. 6 MPa pressure and resultant wines had the highest concentration of phenolics but the lowest concentration of TLPs. This supported the view that TLPs are released at low pressure as they are mainly present in grape pulp but additional extraction of phenolics largely present in skin occurs at higher pressing pressure. Wine protein stability tests showed a positive linear correlation between bentonite requirement and the concentration of chitinases, indicating the possibility of predicting bentonite requirement by quantification of chitinases.

The study was carried out on five mammalian serum albumins, using various spectroscopic methods, dye binding assay, circular dichroism and electron microscopy. The thermodynamics of the binding of mammalian serum albumins to cationic rosin modified surfactant were established using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

40|$|Barley is an {{important}} crop {{for the production of}} malt and beer. However, crops such as rice and wheat are rarely used for malting. α-amylase is the key enzyme that degrades starch during malting. In this study, we compared the genomic properties, gene copies, and conserved promoter motifs of α-amylase genes in barley, rice, and wheat. In all three crops, α-amylase consists of four subfamilies designated amy 1, amy 2, amy 3, and amy 4. In wheat and barley, members of amy 1 and amy 2 genes are localized on chromosomes 6 and 7, respectively. In rice, members of amy 1 genes are found on chromosomes 1 and 2, and amy 2 genes on chromosome 6. The barley genome has six amy 1 members and three amy 2 members. The wheat B genome contains four amy 1 members and three amy 2 members, while the rice genome has three amy 1 members and one amy 2 member. The B genome has mostly amy 1 and amy 2 members among the three wheat genomes. Amy 1 promoters from all three crop genomes contain a GA-responsive complex consisting of a GA-responsive element (CAATAAA), pyrimidine box (CCTTTT) and TATCCAT/C box. This study has shown that amy 1 and amy 2 from both wheat and barley have similar genomic properties, including exon/intron structures and GA-responsive elements on promoters, but these differ in rice.

40|$|Stabilization against <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{positive}} properties attributed to yeast mannoproteins in winemaking. In previous work we demonstrated that deletion of KNR 4 leads to increased mannoprotein release in laboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. We have now constructed strains with KNR 4 deleted in two different industrial wine yeast backgrounds. This required replacement of two and three alleles of KNR 4 for the EC 1118 and T 73 - 4 backgrounds, respectively, and the use of three different selection markers for yeast genetic transformation. The actual effect of the genetic modification was dependent on both the genetic background and the culture conditions. The fermentation performance of T 73 - 4 derivatives was clearly impaired, and these derivatives did not contribute to the protein stability of the wine, even though they showed increased mannoprotein release in vitro. In contrast, the EC 1118 derivative with both alleles of KNR 4 deleted released increased amounts of mannoproteins both in vitro and during wine fermentation assays, and the resulting wines were consistently less susceptible to <b>protein</b> <b>haze.</b> The fermentation performance of this strain was slightly impaired, but only with must with a very high sugar content.

40|$|Grape thaumatin-like {{proteins}} (TLPs) play {{roles in}} plant-pathogen interactions {{and can cause}} <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> in white wine unless removed prior to bottling. Different isoforms of TLPs have different hazing potential and aggregation behavior. Here we present the elucidation of the molecular structures of three grape TLPs that display different hazing potential. The three TLPs have very similar structures despite belonging to two different classes (F 2 / 4 JRU is a thaumatin-like protein while I/ 4 L 5 H and H 2 / 4 MBT are VVTL 1), and having different unfolding temperatures (56 vs. 62 ˚C), with protein F 2 / 4 JRU being heat unstable and forming haze, while I/ 4 L 5 H does not. These differences in properties are attributable to the conformation of a single loop and the amino acid composition of its flanking regions...|$|E
40|$|Mannoproteins {{released}} {{during the}} fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a chemically defined synthetic grape juice medium were isolated by ethanol precipitation. The proteins from the medium were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography. Fractions containing mannoproteins {{were identified by}} their UV absorption spectra and {{by the presence of}} polymeric mannose. A mannoprotein designated HPF 2 was purified from one of the fractions by gel permeation chromatography, and had a high capacity to reduce heat-induced <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> formation in white wine. After electrophoretic separation and transfer to nitrocellulose, HPF 2 stained positively with an antibody (anti-HPFl) which had been raised against a previously isolated mannoprotein with known haze protective activity designated HPFL. Analysis of the carbohydrate portion of HPF 2 using methylation analysis confirmed the presence of (1 -> 2), (1 -> 3) and (1 -> 2, 1 -> 6) mannosyl residues and showed that it contained N-linked and possibly O-linked carbohydrate. Digestion of the mannoprotein with PNGase F resulted in a reduction in molecular weight, as measured by SDS-PAOE and confirmed the presence of N-linked carbohydrate. N-linked deglycosylation decreased the ability of HPF 2 to protect wine from heatinduced <b>protein</b> <b>haze.</b> Protein sequence analysis of the peptides derived from the HPF 2 mannoprotein obtained via digestion with endoproteinase Lys C led to the identification of the HPF 2 structural gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae followed by searching the Yeast Proteome Database for related sequences. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of HPF 2 from its structural gene indicated that HPF 2 possessed a secretion signal at the NH₂-terminus, a putative OPI anchor site at the COOH-terminus and also contained serine and threonine rich regions at both the NH₂-terminus and COOHterminus. These regions may contain O-linked carbohydrate. There were also 15 potential glycosylation sites, five of which were classified from the peptide mapping data as likely glycosylation sites. These characteristics, combined with the results from the carbohydrate analysis, indicate that HPF 2 was a mannoprotein derived from the yeast cell walls. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Bentonite is {{commonly}} used to remove grape <b>proteins</b> responsible for <b>haze</b> formation in white wines. Proteases potentially represent an alternative to bentonite, but so far none has shown satisfactory activity under winemaking conditions. A promising candidate is AGP, a mixture of Aspergillopepsins I and II.; a food grade, well characterized and inexpensive protease, active at wine pH and at high temperatures (60 - 80 °C). AGP was added to two clarified grape juices with and without heat treatments (75 °C, 1 min) prior to fermentation. AGP showed some activity at fermentation temperatures (≈ 20 % total protein reduction compared to control wine) and excellent activity when combined with juice heating (≈ 90 % total protein reduction). The more heat stable grape proteins, i. e. those not contributing to wine hazing, were not affected by the treatments and therefore accounted for the remaining 10 % of protein still in solution after the treatments. The main physicochemical parameters and sensorial characteristics of wines produced with AGP were not different from controls. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Sauvignon blanc often {{requires}} {{large amounts of}} bentonite in order to remove <b>haze</b> <b>proteins</b> and make the wine heat stable. However, large bentonite additions can affect the sensory perception of the wine. We studied {{the effect of adding}} small amounts of bentonite before fermentation on the subsequent amount required after fermentation to heat stabilize the wine. Protein stability was evaluated in two lots of Sauvignon blanc juice from two blocks of the same Edna Valley vineyard. Bentonite (Volclay KWK, American Colloid Co.), 4. 6 g suspended in 200 mL water, was added to 19 L of juice prior to fermentation. The control had 200 mL water added only. Juice treated with bentonite before fermentation required the lowest amounts of postfermentation bentonite to achieve protein stability, as determined by heat stability tests using a nephelometer. A correlation was observed between the turbidity of heated juices treated with different amounts of bentonite and protein measured by the Bradford Protein method. Sensory studies were conducted to ascertain if the effect of different bentonite additions and timing of additions changed the sensory perception of the resulting wine...|$|R
40|$|The {{fermentation}} of {{grape must}} to produce wine is a biologically complex process, carried on by yeasts and malolactic bacteria. The yeasts present in spontaneous fermentation may {{be divided into}} two groups, the Saccharomyces yeasts, particularly S. cerevisiae, and the non-Saccharomyces yeasts which include members of the genera Rhodotorula, Pichia, Candida, Debaryomyces, Metschtnikowia, Hansenula and Hanseniaspora. S. cerevisiae yeasts are able to convert sugar into ethanol and CO 2 via fermentation. They have been used for thousands of years by mankind for the production of fermented beverages and foods, including wine. Their enzymes provide interesting wine organoleptic characteristics. β-Glucosidase activity is involved in the release of terpenes to wine, thus contributing to varietal aroma. β-Xylosidase enzyme is also interesting in industry due to its involvement in the degradation of hemicellulose by hydrolyzing its main heteroglycan (xylan). The ability of yeasts to release proteases has been observed by many researchers because of their potential to degrade <b>haze</b> <b>proteins</b> in wine and to generate nutrient sources for microorganisms.

40|$|Heat induced <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> is {{a common}} problem in white wine. Grape derived {{pathogenesis}} related proteins slowly denature and aggregate during wine storage and this gives rise to light dispersing haze. <b>Protein</b> <b>haze</b> formation is currently prevented by removing proteins using bentonite, an aluminium silicate clay, but this method has drawbacks. A potential alternative or complementary method {{is the use of}} haze protective factors (HPF), specific mannoproteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that visually reduce <b>protein</b> <b>haze.</b> Hpf 1 p was originally isolated from Muscat Gordo Blanco wine and Hpf 2 p from a synthetic grape juice ferment. Based on partial amino acid sequences, putative structural genes, HPF 1 and HPF 2, for these proteins were identified. HPF 1 has a homologue, HPF 1 ', (71 % similarity) in S. cerevisiae. Sequence analysis suggests that Hpf 1 p, Hpf 1 ' p and Hpf 2 p are localised to the cell wall or plasma membrane. This study aimed to determine the biological function of the HPF genes in S. cerevisiae. HPF overexpression and deletion strains were constructed and analysed for cell wall related phenotypes. Under a number of conditions, including cold temperature and ethanol stress, the hpf 1 Δ hpf 1 ' Δ strain was more tolerant than the wild type strain. However, mating efficiency of the hpf 1 Δ hpf 1 ' Δ strain was significantly less than the wild type strain and this was found to be correlated with the persistence of a septum between the mating partners. The decreased mating efficiency was also mating type specific, only occurring in MAT α cells. This study also aimed to establish conclusively that the HPF genes do indeed encode proteins with haze protective properties. Haze protective activity of the material from ferment supernatants was assessed. Material from the HPF deletion strains exhibited significantly less haze protective activity than the wild type. Moreover, material derived from HPF 1 and HPF 1 ' overexpressors was more active than material from the wild type. A 6 xHis - tagged Hpf 2 p was expressed and purified using immobilised metal affinity chromatography. This Hpf 2 p had significant haze protective activity.

40|$|The {{bentonite}} use {{to remove}} proteins from white wine {{is a widespread}} practice that prevents <b>protein</b> <b>haze</b> formation after bottling. However, an excess of bentonite can have negative effects on both the aromatic profile of young white wines {{and the quality of}} the foam of sparkling wines. Therefore, the optimisation of bentonite amount to be used and the moment of its application during winemaking to minimise wine quality losses are of great interest for winemakers. This paper analyses how applying an equal bentonite dose at different stages (must clarification; beginning, middle and end of fermentation) on two scales (industrial and pilot) affects the protein content and stability, physical–chemical characteristics, aromatic profile and foam quality of the obtained wines. No important differences in the oenological parameters were observed between industrial and pilot scales, whereas the scale of the experimental treatments affected protein stability, aroma composition and foam quality of the wines...|$|E
40|$|Cell wall mannoproteins {{released}} by Saccharomyces cerevisiae during wine fermentation and aging have recently {{attracted the attention}} of enologists and researchers in enology due to their positive effect over a number of technological and quality properties of the wines, including protein and tartaric stability, aroma and color stability, astringency, mouthfeel, malolactic fermentation, or foam properties of sparkling wines. This work has investigated the effect of deletions involving genes related to cell wall biogenesis on the release of mannoproteins, as well as the effect of the released mannoproteins on wine protein stability. When available, the phenotypes have been studied in different genetic backgrounds, in haploid or diploid strains, and in homo- or heterozygosis. Strains deleted for GAS 1, GPI 7, or KNR 4 release higher amounts of mannoproteins and polysaccharides to the medium. These increased amounts of mannoproteins and polysaccharides lead to a stronger stability of Sauvignon Blanc wines against <b>protein</b> <b>haze.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Chitinase {{activity}} increased markedly at {{the onset}} of ripening in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) berries and continued to increase throughout the sugar accumulation phase of berry development. In contrast, beta- 1, 3 -glucanase activity was not detected in grape berries at any stage of development. Two closely related chitinase cDNAs (VvChi 4 A and VvChi 4 B) were cloned from grapes. Sequence and Southern analysis indicate that these two clones may represent alleles of the same gene. The predicted proteins are acidic and have a signal peptide followed by a cysteine-rich, chitin-binding domain and a catalytic region. An analysis of their sequences indicates that they are class IV chitinase. The deduced protein sequence of VvChi 4 A has a high level of identity with the 32 - and 28 -kD chitinases present as <b>haze</b> <b>proteins</b> in wine. Expression of VvChi 4 was high in berries and low in flowers but was not detected in leaves, roots, or seeds. No expression was detected in berries 2 to 8 weeks postflowering, but expression was high 12 to 16 weeks postflowering, which coincided with sugar accumulation and an increase in chitinase activity. Constitutive expression of VvChi 4 appears to be fruit-specific and induced at high levels in grapes during ripening...|$|R
40|$|During the storage, bottled white wines can {{manifest}} haziness {{due to the}} insolubilisation of {{the grape}} proteins that may ‘survive’ in the fermentation process. Although the exact mechanism of this occurrence is not fully understood, proteins and tannins are considered two of the key factors involved in wine hazing, since their aggregation leads {{to the formation of}} insoluble particles. To better understand this complex interaction, proteins and tannins from the same unfined Pinot grigio wine were separated. Wine proteins were then fractionated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). A significant correlation between hydrophobicity of the wine protein fractions and the haze formed after reacting with wine tannins was found, with the most reactive fractions revealing (by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC analyses) the predominant presence of thaumatin-like proteins. Moreover, the effects of both protein heating and disulfide bonds reduction (with dithiotreithol) on haze formation in the presence of tannins were assessed. These treatments generally resulted in an improved reactivity with tannins, and this phenomenon was related to both the surface hydrophobicity and composition of the <b>protein</b> fractions. Therefore, <b>haze</b> formation in wines seems to be related to hydrophobic interactions occurring among proteins and tannins. These interactions should occur on hydrophobic tannin-binding sites, whose exposition on the proteins can depend on both protein heating and reduction...|$|R
40|$|Slow {{denaturation}} of wine proteins {{is thought}} to lead to protein aggregation, flocculation into a hazy suspension and formation of precipitates. The majority of wine <b>proteins</b> responsible for <b>haze</b> are grapederived, have low isoelectric points and molecular weight. They are grape pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins that are expressed throughout the ripening period post véraison, and are highly resistant to low pH and enzymatic or non-enzymatic proteolysis. Protein levels in un-fined white wine differ by variety and range up to 300 mg/L. Infection with some common grapevine pathogens or skin contact, such as occurs during transport of mechanically harvested fruit, results in enhanced concentrations of some PR proteins in juice and wine. Oenological control of protein instability is achieved through adsorption of wine proteins onto bentonite. The adsorption of proteins onto bentonite occurs within several minutes, suggesting that a continuous contacting process could be developed. The addition of proteolytic enzyme during short term heat exposure, to induce PR protein denaturation, showed promise {{as an alternative to}} bentonite fining. The addition of haze-protective factors, yeast mannoproteins, to wines results in decreased particle size of haze, probably by competition with wine proteins for other non-proteinaceous wine components required for the formation of large insoluble aggregations of protein. Other wine components likely to influence haze formation are ethanol concentration, pH, metal ions and phenolic compounds. E. J. Waters, G. Alexander, R. Muhlack, K. F. Pocock, C. Colby, B. K.
