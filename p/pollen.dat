5|$|Low {{concentrations}} of <b>pollen</b> {{are found in}} sediments left by Lake Tauca in the Salar de Uyuni. Lake Minchin sediments contain more <b>pollen</b> (indicating {{that it may have}} had a more favourable climate), but the lack of <b>pollen</b> may be the product of a deeper lake. Polylepis may have thrived in favourable salinity and climatic conditions. Increased Polylepis and Acaena <b>pollen</b> is observed {{towards the end of the}} Tauca episode.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pollen</b> {{is removed}} from flowers {{deliberately}} or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees {{come in contact with}} the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of <b>pollen</b> from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae (<b>pollen</b> baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million <b>pollen</b> grains. Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect <b>pollen.</b> Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge <b>pollen</b> from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.|$|E

40|$|Objective To compare an ELISA {{measuring}} serum allergen-specific IgE with intradermal {{skin testing}} in canine atopic dermatitis. Procedure Eighty-four dogs with the clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis underwent intradermal skin testing and serum testing for allergen-specific IgE. Tests were {{performed in a}} blinded fashion. Positive reactions were compared and the sensitivity and specificity of the serum test (using intradermal skins test as the standard) were determined overall and for individual allergen groups (grass <b>pollens,</b> weed <b>pollens,</b> tree <b>pollens,</b> house dust mites and fleas). Results The sensitivity of the ELISA overall was 90. 4 %. Evaluating the individual allergen groups, the sensitivity for dust mite hypersensitivity was 95. 1 %, for fleas 85. 4 %, for tree <b>pollens</b> 84. 3 %, for grass <b>pollens</b> 95. 1 % and for weed <b>pollens</b> 96. 4 %. The specificity was 91. 6 % overall, for dust mites 96. 3 %, for fleas 92. 7 %, for tree <b>pollens</b> 95. 2 %, for grass <b>pollens</b> 94 % and for weed <b>pollens</b> 80. 7 %. Conclusion The evaluated ELISA seemed reliable for the diagnosis of atopy in practice and can be recommended as a screening test prior to intradermal skin testing or for use in dogs when immunotherapy is not a therapeutic option...|$|R

5|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of wasps play no role in pollination, a few species can effectively transport <b>pollen</b> and pollinate several plant species. Since wasps generally do not have a fur-like covering of soft hairs and a special body part for <b>pollen</b> storage (<b>Pollen</b> basket) as some bees do, <b>pollen</b> does not stick to them well. However {{it has been shown that}} even without hairs, several wasp species are able to effectively transport <b>pollen,</b> therefore contributing for potential pollination of several plant species.|$|E
5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several bee {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack <b>pollen</b> collecting structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of <b>pollen</b> collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's <b>pollen</b> ball, and often the host egg also. The Arctic bee species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have <b>pollen</b> baskets and often collect <b>pollen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Butterflies feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from <b>pollen,</b> tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, {{they do not}} carry as much <b>pollen</b> load as bees, but {{they are capable of}} moving <b>pollen</b> over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|E

5|$|Honeyeaters {{are clearly}} the most {{important}} pollination vector, as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit. Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving {{from tree to tree}} with significant loads of B.sessilis <b>pollen</b> on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against <b>pollen</b> presenters while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this <b>pollen</b> may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging.|$|E
5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters end up with large quantities of <b>pollen</b> on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their <b>pollen</b> within four hours of opening, and <b>pollen</b> is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with <b>pollen</b> lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found {{that a combination of}} pesticides has been contaminating the <b>pollen</b> bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected <b>pollen</b> from hives on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of <b>pollen.</b> Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to rich dinosaur fossils, {{there are also}} plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–Pg boundary. In the sediments below the K–Pg boundary the dominant plant remains are angiosperm <b>pollen</b> grains, but the boundary layer contains little <b>pollen</b> and is dominated by fern spores. More usual <b>pollen</b> levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bees are}} polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect <b>pollen</b> {{from a range}} of {{flowering}} plants, however, some are oligoleges (specialists), in that they only gather <b>pollen</b> from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants. Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of <b>pollen,</b> and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even electromagnetic fields. Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality and <b>pollen</b> taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.|$|E

5|$|The Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone, {{from where}} Euchambersia is known, {{represents}} a floodplain that {{was covered in}} many small, relatively straight streams. The water level in these streams was probably seasonally dependent. Judging from <b>pollen</b> preserved in the Cistecephalus AZ, the <b>pollen</b> taxon Pityosporites (which probably originated from a plant similar to Glossopteris) was very common, forming some 80% to 90% of the <b>pollen</b> discovered (although the prevalent sediments {{would not have been}} ideal for <b>pollen</b> preservation).|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorm asthma is the {{triggering}} of an asthma {{attack by}} environmental conditions directly {{caused by a}} local thunderstorm. During a thunderstorm, <b>pollen</b> grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger <b>pollen</b> grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller <b>pollen</b> fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.|$|E
5|$|To develop, {{the larvae}} must be fed both nectar for {{carbohydrates}} and <b>pollen</b> for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing {{a small hole}} in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar.

Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of <b>pollen</b> {{at the base of the}} brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves.

5|$|Various {{plants are}} known to have <b>pollen</b> which is toxic to honey bees, in some cases killing the adults (e.g., Toxicoscordion), in other cases {{creating}} a problem only when passed to the brood (e.g., Heliconia). Other plants which have toxic <b>pollen</b> are Spathodea campanulata and Ochroma lagopus. Both the <b>pollen</b> and nectar of the California Buckeye (Aesculus californica) are toxic to honeybees, and it is thought that other members of the Buckeye family are also.|$|E
5|$|A. pinnatum and {{the other}} three tree waratah species lie in the {{subtribe}} Embothriinae, along with the true waratahs (Telopea), Oreocallis and the Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red flowers that are terminal (arising at the ends of branches), and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predates the splitting of the supercontinent Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers suggest that they are bird-pollinated, and have been so since the radiation of nectar-feeding birds such as honeyeaters in the Eocene. Triporopollenites ambiguus is an ancient member of the proteaceae known only from <b>pollen</b> deposits, originally described from Eocene deposits in Victoria. The fossil <b>pollen</b> closely resembles that of the Tasmanian waratah (Telopea truncata), A. pinnatum and Oreocallis grandiflora. Cladistic analysis of morphological features within the Embothriinae showed A.pinnatum to be the earliest offshoot within the genus and sister to the other three species. Along with members of other genera in the Embothriinae, A.pinnatum has crimson <b>pollen,</b> while the other three Alloxylon species have yellow <b>pollen.</b> Hence {{it is likely that the}} ancestral <b>pollen</b> colour was red, and remained so with the emergence of the genus Alloxylon, yet changed to yellow after the divergence of A.pinnatum.|$|E
5|$|Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is thought}} to have adapted to a mixed diet. Its diet {{consists}} of nectar, <b>pollen,</b> fruit, seeds, honeydew, and insects. It is arboreal, foraging primarily among the foliage and flowers of trees, shrubs, and mistletoes, less often on branches and tree trunk, and rarely on the ground. Yellow-faced honeyeaters feed on nectar around 40% of the time, and on insects around 60% of the time. The yellow-faced honeyeater feeds on insects by gleaning, and by sallying or catching insects in flight or probing in bark crevices. The insects eaten are primarily Diptera (flies, mosquitoes, maggots, gnats, and midges), beetles and spiders. A study of the <b>pollen</b> on the bills and foreheads of captured birds found that 70% carried <b>pollen</b> from silver banksia (Banksia marginata), 61% from heath-leaved banksia (Banksia ericifolia), and 22% carried <b>pollen</b> from other plants in the area including fern-leaved banksia (Banksia oblongifolia), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa) and green spider flower (Grevillea mucronulata).|$|E
