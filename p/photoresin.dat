40|$|An {{ethoxylated}} bis-phenol-A dimethacrylate based <b>photoresin</b> BPE- 100 {{of relatively}} high photosensitivity and modulus {{is used for}} the creation of sub- 50 nm features. This is achieved by using the direct laser writing technique based on the single-photon photoinhibited polymerization. The super-resolution feature is realized by overlapping two laser beams of different wavelengths to enable the wavelength-controlled activation of photoinitiating and photoinhibiting processes in the polymerization. The increased photosensitivity of the <b>photoresin</b> promotes a fast curing speed and enhances the photopolymerization efficiency. Using the <b>photoresin</b> BPE- 100, we achieve 40 nm dots {{for the first time in}} the super-resolution fabrication technique based on the photoinhibited polymerization, and a minimum linewidth of 130 nm. The influence of the power of the inhibiting laser and the exposure time on the feature size is studied and the results agree well with the prediction obtained from a simulation based on a non-steady-state kinetic model...|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} of fabrication of miniaturized fluidic devices was developed using a <b>photoresin</b> based on urethane and acrylate (UA) oligomers used to platemaking for flexographic printers on graphic industry. Fluidic mixers and reactors modules measuring 10 × 10 mm² were manufactured, with channels width in the 0. 25 to 1. 00 mm range and 0. 75 mm depth. Top covers 4. 00 mm thick, with 1. 26 mm diameter inlet and outlet holes {{were used to}} seal the channels. The sealed channel structures were formed using a film of <b>photoresin</b> as adhesive. Interconnections of 1. 20 mm diameter and 10 mm long steel tubes were fixed into inlet and outlet holes. All fluidic modules were manufactured by photolithography of UA, sealed by ultraviolet cure of an UA adhesion layer, package in an UA container and successfully tested for leakage under 2 × 10 (5) Pascal air pressure...|$|E

In this way, microsystem technologies play an important role because they can be used to fabricate microparticle manipulators. This paper describes the design and fabrication of a microsystem to handle biological objects, based on the dielectrophoretic effects. The development of the right technological option among the possibilities at disposal is also discussed.

This {{is made possible}} by the design of photoinitiators with strong two-photon absorption cross sections. We analyze the influence of both material properties and irradiation conditions on the two-photon polymerization rate and show that resins based on our highly sensitive two-photon photoinitiator can be solidified with microlaser excitation, whereas commercial UV <b>photoresins</b> require ultrashort and intense laser pulses...|$|R

40|$|The {{experimental}} work demonstrating {{the feasibility of}} the MIDFILM process as a low cost means of applying solar cell collector metallization as reported. Cell efficiencies of above 14 % (AMl, 28 C) were achieved with fritted silver metallization. Environmental tests suggest that the metallization is slightly humidity sensitive and degradation is observed on cells with high series resistance. The major yield loss in the fabrication of cells was due to discontinuous grid lines, resulting in high series resitance. Standard lead-tin solder plated interconnections do not appear compatible with the MIDFILM contact. Copper, nickel and molybdemun base powder were investigated as low cost metallization systems. The copper based powder degraded the cell response. The nickel and molybdenum base powders oxidized when sintered in the oxidizing atmosphere necessary to ash the <b>photoresin...</b>|$|E

This paper describes the modeling and experimental verification of an interdigitated castellated microelectrode array intended to handle biological objects, based on the dielectrophoretic effects. The proposed design, a whole microsystem including electrical, optical and fluidic interfaces, was developed employing platinum deposited by lift-off, silicon micromachining, and <b>photoresin</b> patterning techniques. The fabricated electrodes have typical dimensions of 50, 70 and 90 µm, and were tested by means of polystyrene microspheres of 4. 2 µm in diameter.

40|$|The cornea is a {{transparent}} {{structure composed of}} three layers: the epithelium, the stroma and the endothelium. To maintain its ransparency the stroma remains {{in a constant state}} of dehydration. Consequently, any ion flow disorder through the covering layers can compromise the barrier function and, therefore the corneal homeostasis. Since ionic permeability has a fundamental impact on the passive electrical properties of living tissues, in this work it is proposed and demonstrated a diagnosis method based on tetrapolar impedance measurements performed by electrodes placed on the corneal surface. The contribution of each cornea layer to the total measured impedance has been analysed over a frequency range. Following the obtained guidelines, a flexible probe with integrated electrodes has been developed and manufactured using SU- 8 <b>photoresin.</b> The feasibility of the proposed method has been evaluated in vivo by monitoring corneal epithelium wound healing. Obtained impedance measurements have been compared with measurements of permeability to sodium fluorescein from different excised corneas. Successful results demonstrate the feasibility of this novel flexible sensor and its capability to quantify corneal permeability in vivo in a non-invasive way...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the modeling and experimental verification of a castellated microelectrode array intended tohandle biocells, based on common dielectrophoresis. The proposed microsystem was developed employing platinumelectrodes deposited by lift-off, silicon micromachining, and <b>photoresin</b> patterning techniques. Having fabricated the microdevice it was tested employing Escherichia coli as bioparticle model. Positive dielectrophoresis could be verified with the selected cells for frequencies above 100 kHz, and electrohydrodynamic effects were observed {{as the dominant}} phenomena when working at lower frequencies. As a result, negative dielectrophoresis could not be observed because its occurrence overlaps with electrohydrodynamic effects; i. e. the viscous drag force acting on the particles {{is greater than the}} dielectrophoretic force at frequencies where negative dielectrophoresis should occur. The experiments illustrate the convenience of this kind of microdevices to micro handling biological objects, opening the possibility for using these microarrays with other bioparticles. Additionally, liquid motion as a result of electrohydrodynamic effects {{must be taken into account}} when designing bioparticle micromanipulators, and could be used as mechanism to clean the electrode surfaces, that is one of the most important problems related to this kind of devices...|$|E
40|$|Common dielectrophoresis (c-DEP, i. e. {{neutral matter}} motion induced by {{non-uniform}} electric fields) {{has become a}} basic pheno-menon of biochips intended for medical, biological and chemical assays, especially when they imply bioparticle handling. This paper deals with modelling and experimental verification of a castellated, c-DEP-based, microelectrode array intended to handle biological objects. The proposed microsystem was developed employing platinum electrodes patterned by lift-off, silicon micro-machining and <b>photoresin</b> patterning techniques. Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used as test bioparticles for experimental verifi-cation. Yeast cells were repelled toward electrode bays and toward interelectrodic gaps tor frequencies around 20 MHz where there is minimum electric field strength, corresponding to a negative dielectrophoretic phenomenon. Yeast cell agglomerations were observed around electrode edges for frequencies of around 2 MHz where there is maximum electric field strength, thereby verifying the positive dielectrophoretic phenomenon. Bioparticles were separated from the electrode edges when the working fre-quency was reduced and they were dragged towards the electrode centre, remaining there while the frequency was low enough. Such atypical pattern may be explained due to the occurrence of positive dielectrophoresis overlap with electrohydrodynamic effects (i. e. the viscous drag force acting on the particles was greater than the dielectrophoretic force at frequencies where positi-ve dielectrophoresis should occur). The experiments illustrated microsystem convenience in microhandling biological objects, the-reby providing these microarrays’ possible use with other cells. Liquid motion resulting from electrohydrodynamic effects {{must also be taken}} into account when designing bioparticle micromanipulators, and {{could be used as a}} mechanism for cleaning electrode surfaces...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis aims to investigate the use of additive manufacturing (AM) as a novel manufacturing process {{for the production of}} milli-scale chemical reaction systems. Five well developed additive manufacturing techniques; stereolithography (SL), selective laser melting (SLM), fused deposition modelling (FDM), ultrasonic additive manufacture (UAM) and selective laser sintering (SLS) were used to manufacture a number of miniaturised flow devices which were tested using a range of organic and inorganic reactions. SL was used to manufacture a range of functioning milli-scale flow devices from Accura 60 <b>photoresin,</b> with both simple and complex internal channel networks. These devices were used to perform a range of organic and inorganic reactions, including aldehyde and ketone functional group interconversions. Conversion of products within these reactors, were shown to be comparable to commercially available milli-scale coil reactors. More complex designs, which allowed SL parts to be integrated to existing flow and analytical instrumentation, allowed us to develop an automated reaction analysis and optimisation platform. This platform allowed precise control over the reaction conditions, including flow rate, temperature and reagent composition. We also designed a simplex type reaction optimisation software package that could input data in the form of reaction conversions, peak intensities, and thermocouple data, and generate a new set of optimal reaction conditions. SL parts which incorporated embedded analytical components were also manufactured, which allowed us to perform inline reaction analysis as a feedback method for input into the optimisation platform. Stereolithography was shown to be a highly versatile manufacturing method for designing and producing these flow devices, however the process was shown to be still limited by the range of processable materials currently commercially available. SLM was also used to manufacture a number of functioning milli-scale flow devices from stainless steel and titanium, which had simplistic internal channel designs of diameters ranging from 1 to 3 mm. Again, SLM parts were manufactured which incorporated embedded analytical components, which could be integrated into an automated reaction platform. These devices, unlike parts produced via SL, could be attached to heating platforms to allow us to perform high temperature reactions. This control over the reaction temperature formed {{an essential part of the}} reaction optimisation platform. These parts were again used to perform a ketone functional group interconversion. Internal structures of these SLM parts were also visualised via micro computed tomography (µCT or microCT) scanning as well as optical microscopy. FDM was used throughout the project as an inexpensive method of prototyping parts which were to be manufactured via more expensive manufacturing processes. This prototyping allowed the optimisation of intricate design features, such as the manufacture of an inline spectroscopic flow cell for integration with a commercially available LC system. FDM was also proposed as a customisable approach to designing and manufacturing flow devices with embedded components, however the current limitations in build resolution and materials choices severely limited the use of FDM for this application. UAM was also proposed as a novel manufacturing process whereby the build process would allow discrete components to be embedded directly into a flow channel. This was demonstrated by embedding a type-k thermocouple across a 2 mm channel. The data from this thermocouple was monitored during a heated reaction, and used as a method of determining the exact reaction conditions the reaction medium was being exposed to. SLS was also proposed as a possible manufacturing method for milli-scale flow devices, however it proved difficult to remove un-sintered powder from parts with internal channel diameters as high as 5 mm. It was shown that this powder was forming a dense semi solid, due to the large degree of shrinkage upon cooling of the SLS parts, which was compressing the powder. More research into optimum processing conditions is required before SLS could be used for the production of intricate channel networks...|$|E
