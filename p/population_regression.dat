40|$|Two {{improvements}} in teaching linear regression are suggested. The {{first is to}} include the <b>population</b> <b>regression</b> model {{at the beginning of}} the topic. The second is to use a geometric approach: to interpret the regression estimate as an orthogonal projection and the estimation error as the distance (which is minimized by the projection). Linear regression in finance is described as an example of practical applications of the <b>population</b> <b>regression</b> model. The paper also describes a geometric approach to teaching the topic of finding an optimal portfolio in financial mathematics. The approach is to express the optimal portfolio through an orthogonal projection in Euclidean space. This allows replacing the traditional solution of the problem with a geometric solution, so the proof of the result is merely a reference to the basic properties of orthogonal projection. This method improves the teaching of the topic by avoiding tedious technical details of the traditional solution such as Lagrange multipliers and partial derivatives. The described method is illustrated by two numerical examples...|$|E

The objective was to determine levels of burnout in union and nonunion employees as well their perception of social support in the workplace. The theoretical synthesis consisted of conservation of resources theory and the theory of reasoned action. The Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and the Quality of Worklife Questionnaire were used to identify the characteristics of the workplace (job demands and job resources) and the level of burnout. Quantitative results confirmed the presence of burnout in both sample <b>populations.</b> <b>Regression</b> results for union participants identified both poor management and increased in job demands as significant predictors of burnout. Conversely, regression results for nonunion participants pointed to poor management only as a significant predictor of burnout. Qualitative descriptive and explanatory thematic results provided additional contextual support for the quantitative findings - specifically, that both union and nonunion participants identified management as a primary concern. In addition, union participants also identified manpower and support as primary concerns in the work environment. The findings point to the negative consequences of burnout for the employer and employee and to areas of concern {{that need to be addressed}} in the employment setting.
