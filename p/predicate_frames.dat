We also propose feature functions that naturally combine and weight these criteria, based on the training data.

6000|$|The {{most complex}} {{case of this}} sort of {{apparent}} inference is what is called the Conversion of propositions; which consists in turning the predicate into a subject, and the subject into a <b>predicate,</b> and <b>framing</b> out of the same terms thus reversed, another proposition, which must be true if the former is true. Thus, from the particular affirmative proposition, Some A is B, we may infer that Some B is A. From the universal negative, No A is B, we may conclude that No B is A. From the universal affirmative proposition, All A is B, it can not be inferred that all B is A; though all water is liquid, it is not implied that all liquid is water; but it is implied that some liquid is so; and hence the proposition, All A is B, is legitimately convertible into Some B is A. This process, which converts a universal proposition into a particular, is termed conversion per accidens. From the proposition, Some A is not B, we can not even infer that some B is not A; though some men are not Englishmen, it does not follow that some Englishmen are not men. The only mode usually recognized of converting a particular negative proposition, is in the form, Some A is not B, therefore something which is not B is A; and this is termed conversion by contraposition. In this case, however, the predicate and subject are not merely reversed, but one of them is changed. Instead of [A] and [B], the terms of the new proposition are [a thing which is not B], and [A]. The original proposition, Some A is not B, is first changed into a proposition equipollent with it, Some A is “a thing which is not B;” and the proposition, being now no longer a particular negative, but a particular affirmative, admits of conversion in the first mode, or as it is called, simple conversion.(48) ...|$|R
40|$|More than {{a century}} ago, G. E. Moore famously {{attempted}} to refute all versions of moral naturalism by offering an extended inference consisting of the open question argument followed by the charge that moral naturalism commits a “naturalistic fallacy. ” Although there is consensus that this extended inference fails to undermine all varieties of moral naturalism, the open question argument (OQA) is often vindicated as an argument against analytical moral naturalism. By contrast, the charge that analytical naturalism commits the naturalistic fallacy usually finds no takers at all. In this paper we argue that analytical naturalism of the sort recently proposed by Frank Jackson (1998, 2003) and Michael Smith (2000) does after all rest on a mistake – though perhaps not the one Moore {{had in mind when}} he made the naturalistic fallacy charge.

The analyses proposed make extensive use of the novel feature in FDG of separating lexemes from their <b>predicate</b> (now predication) <b>frames.</b> It is shown that the syntactic and semantic differences between the various verb-preposition constructions can be accounted for by assuming three different predication frames: the ‘composite predicate frame’, the ‘resultative frame’ and the ‘verb + prepositional complement frame’. Next the question is addressed of how to match lexemes and predication frames {{in such a way that}} both under- and overgeneration of verb-preposition constructions is prevented. It is suggested that the lexicon plays a crucial role here, in the sense that it is the information provided by or inferrable from the meaning definition of a lexeme that determines which combinations of lexemes and predication frame are acceptable. Finally, it is argued that the separate storage of lexemes and predication frames calls for a new perspective on the difference between arguments and modifiers. It is concluded that what matters is not the obligatory or optional expression of a participant as dictated by the predicate, but its presence - obligatory or optional - in the predication frame selected...|$|R
40|$|Separation Logic {{brought an}} advance to program {{verification}} of data structures through {{its use of}} (recursively defined) predicates to implicitly represent heaps, and the separation operator to construct heaps from disjoint subheaps. While this facilitated local reason-ing in program fragments, the consideration of subheaps that are disjoint meant that any form of sharing between predicates is prob-lematic and often requires manual proofs whose complexity may outweigh the core benefits of Separation Logic itself. With this as background motivation, we present an assertion language in which subheaps may be explicitly defined within predicates, {{and the effect of}} separation obtained by specifying that certain heaps are disjoint. Predicates can then be conjoined in the traditional way. We then present a new frame rule that is conditioned upon the heap-update operations of a program fragment. Essentially, a <b>predicate</b> can be <b>framed</b> over the program fragment if its footprint is disjoint from the updates. The main contribution is to demonstrate that the in-duced program verification method now provides local reasoning on problems that so far have not been adequately solved: • structure sharing in data structures, such as in cyclic graphs, where different program fragments act on different parts on these data structures; • summaries of program fragments where there is a recursively defined relationship between the global heap at the entry and exit program points of the fragment; and • incremental updates to complex data structures. Typically dif-ferent parts of a complex data structure is manipulated by differ-ent program fragments (and this depends on the stored values). 1...|$|R

With widespread electronic health record (EHR) system adoption throughout healthcare, operative reports are increasingly accessible in electronic format and are potential information sources which may be valuable {{for a wide variety}} of secondary functions including new medical knowledge development, decision support, and clinical research. But manual review of large number of reports is time consuming and limits our ability to provide timely evidence-based guide in clinical environment. Automatic extraction of techniques, instruments, materials, and other factors surrounding operative procedures from operative notes can provide an efficient way for physicians to acquire valuable information distilled from diverse experiences reported by clinicians and decide optimal technique approach for patients. To automate the representation and extraction of the rich information from operative notes, the goal of this research is to create domain specific resources needed for creating a semantic role labeling (SRL) system to extract information from operative notes. The coverage of existing domain-specific resources and general English resources for building a SRL system for operative notes were evaluated on a corpus obtained from the Fairview Health Services and the sublanguage used to describe surgical actions in operative notes was investigated. The results from the study show that general English resources are not adequate for building a SRL system for clinical text. Also the study shows some sublanguage characters of operative notes that can be used for parser adaption. Next, an existing unlexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parser, the Stanford PCFG parser, was adapted to clinical text for better syntactic parsing performance. Finally, domain specific <b>predicate</b> structure (PAS) <b>frames</b> were created for operative notes, as existing semantic frames for general English are not enough for operative notes.

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} the rhetorical style of Barack Obama {{throughout}} the 2008 presidential campaign and his contentious push for health care reform, {{in order to provide}} insight into Obama's post-inaugural political discourse. Drawing upon a variety of critical and rhetorical theories [...] e. g., fantasy-theme analysis (Borman, 1982), the narrative paradigm (Fisher, 1984), and Kenneth Burke's (1969) notion of identification [...] I argue that Barack Obama's rhetorical style changed drastically after he took office on January 20, 2009. This shift in rhetorical style is especially significant given the declining support for the president since he took office. A total of six speeches have been selected from both the 2008 presidential campaign and those delivered post-inauguration. Based upon an analysis of these speeches, I will argue that Obama employed a unique rhetorical vision throughout his campaign by combining two politically polarized myths to create a blended ideological frame that emphasized notions of bipartisanship. The reason Obama was able to portray such a convincing rhetorical vision that embodied two polarized ideologies is because of his blended racial heritage. Obama's own story of independent success alongside his intimate ties with a disenfranchised group of Americans allowed him recast the American Dream and set forth a unique rhetorical vision that resonated with constituents. This rhetorical vision embodied a moralistic <b>frame</b> <b>predicated</b> on specific values and principles. This analysis also revealed a distinct rhetorical shift in Obama's post-inaugural discourse with regards to his use of narrative elements. Obama's pre-inaugural narratives reveal clearly defined actors who are formed through common archetypal characterizations. Obama pits the narratives' protagonists and antagonists against one another by characterizing them as heroes and villains. The heroes and villains of these stories were ascribed specific character traits and motives, and this enabled Obama to present clear action themes of good versus evil. The specificity of these characters provided Obama's audience with central characters they could identify with. Obama's post-inaugural narratives fail to embrace archetypal character themes or concrete characterizations that expose a clear villain or hero within the drama. As a result, his speeches have lost their dramatic element. These characters were portrayed as vague, obscure figures that lacked basic character motivation and a guiding ideological principle. Instead, these narratives focused on the materialistic benefits of proposed policies and materialistic values as they relate to economic stability. These narratives provide evidence of a distinct shift from the moralistic frame that supported notions of collectivism to a materialistic frame that promotes notions of free enterprise and individual gain. Obama's tendency to cater to conservative constituents demonstrates a confounding ideological shift which depicts an entirely separate candidate from the confident, bi-partisan leader evident throughout the 2008 Presidential Campaign.   M.
