5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the <b>prompt</b> <b>neutron</b> flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E

40|$|The {{scheme of}} {{parametrization}} {{of the energy}} dependence of delayed neutron yields (DNY) in neutron induced fission is proposed. It is based on "microscopic " approach, where the DNY for each precursor is obtained {{as a product of}} cumulative yield (CY) of this precursor on neutron emission probability Pn. The dependence of cumulative yields from incident neutron energy can be obtained from independent yields calculated with account of the following factors having a physical sense: i) contributions from different chances of fission; ii) variation of mass independent yields with energy due to variations of contributions of different modes of fission (Symmetric, Standard I and Standard II); iii) washing out of even-odd effects in charge distribution of fission fragment yields with increase of the neutron energy; iv) shift of distribution of fragment mass yields for a given isotope formed after emission of <b>prompt</b> <b>neutrons</b> because of variation of number of <b>prompt</b> <b>neutrons</b> with energy [...] The analysis was done for the energy region of the first fission chance of 235 U and 237 Np nuclei (neutron energy below 5. 5 MeV).

40|$|In {{recent years}} digital {{processing}} technology is slowly replacing traditional analogue techniques. The main advantage is the digitalization {{of the signal}} shape which contains all {{the information on the}} particle, i. e. kinetic energy, emission angle and mass. This information is actually determined off-line by digital signal processing and opens up the possibility to modify the analysis procedure without repeating the experiment.
