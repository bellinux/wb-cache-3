50|$|When {{orange juice}} is heat treated {{there is an}} {{increase}} in the number of fine particles and decrease in that of coarse particles. The fine particles in particular are responsible for the appearance, color, and flavor of orange juice.

Heat treatment stabilizes the cloud through enzyme inactivation and enhances the turbidity of a stable cloud formation. The increase in serum viscosity is due to the extraction of <b>pectic</b> <b>substances</b> into the serum. Based on Stokeâ€™s law, the increase in serum viscosity is the cause for the enhanced cloud stability.

Hereto, the alcohol insoluble residues were extracted and sequentially fractionated using hot water, a chelating agent, sodium carbonate, and potassium hydroxide solutions to obtain different pectin fractions and a hemicellulose fraction. Chemical analyses were used to characterize these polysaccharide fractions. The results show that cell wall polysaccharides of the pulp and especially of the peel from white-flesh and red-flesh dragon fruits contain significant amounts of <b>pectic</b> <b>substances</b> that are lowly methyl-esterified. The cell wall polysaccharides of the peel {{as well as those}} of the pulp contain high amounts (38 - 47 %) of loosely bound (water-soluble) <b>pectic</b> <b>substances.</b> In the water-soluble fraction (WSF) of the peel samples, uronic acids are the predominant monomers.

40|$|Naturally-occurring {{cellulosic}} fibres {{appear to}} be a more or less intimate association of cellulose with other constituents, generally referred to as incrusting substances. A portion of these extraneous materials appears to be com-posed of uronic acids, presumably contained in the <b>pectic</b> <b>substance</b> of the fibres. Many of the important properties of these fibres, such as tensile strength, moisture and dye absorption, and viscosity in cuprammonium solution have frequently been considered as related to the presence of small quantities of pectin. In order to study this relation-ship in greater detail, it was necessary to develop a method for the quantitative estimation of pectin or its constituent uronic acids. Available methods, based on the evolution of carbon dioxide during treatment of the uronic acid with a boiling solution of hydrochloric acid, were found to fail when cellulose or other carbohydrate materials were present, since these substances also decompose with the evolution of some carbon dioxide. An investigation of the rates of evolution of carbon dioxide showed that pure uronic acids evolved carbon dioxide at a rapid rate and that the evolution of gas was complete in several hours. On the other hand, carbohydrates, free of uronic acids, evolved carbon dioxide at a much slower but approximately con-stant rate during the entire treatment.

The analyses of the brown-red wood revealed the destruction of hemicelluloses and noncrystalline cellulose as well as modifications in the pectic and ligninic wood fractions. The pectic fraction consisted of carbohydrates associated with polyphenols.

The degradation of hemicelluloses and noncrystalline cellulose in brown-red wood, where the pathogens Phaeoacremonium aleophilum and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora prevail with respect to the other fungus Fomitiporia mediterranea, was consistent with reports on the degradative activity of such fungi in vitro carried out on model substrates.

Therefore, in this work <b>pectic</b> <b>substances</b> were extracted from red currant, black currant, raspberry, blackberry and elderberry press residues by hot water and the composition, antioxidant activity, total phenol, anthocyanin content and the color coordinates of pectins were determined. The results show that the pectin colors fall in the range between reddish purple (black currant and elderberry) and yellow (citrus and apple). Moreover some of the pectins in a powder form have different color coordinates than in the form of aqueous solutions or gels. This might be very important when the pectins are selected for different production processes. The anthocyanin content of pectin preparations is lower than the values of fruit juices. It can be concluded that the colorants found in pectin preparations belong to the group of phenolics and have adequate antioxidant capacity, which is extremely beneficial for human health.
