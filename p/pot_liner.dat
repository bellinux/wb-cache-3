40|$|A {{method of}} {{processing}} spent aluminum <b>pot</b> <b>liner</b> containing carbon, cyanide compositions, fluorides and inorganic oxides. The spend aluminum <b>pot</b> <b>liner</b> is crushed, iron oxide {{is added to}} form an agglomerated material. The agglomerated material is melted in an electric arc furnace having the electrodes submerged in the molten material to provide a reducing environment during the furnace operation. In the reducing environment, <b>pot</b> <b>liner</b> is oxidized while the iron oxides are reduced to produce iron and a slag substantially free of cyanide compositions and fluorides. An off-gas including carbon oxides and fluorine is treated in an air pollution control system with an afterburner and a scrubber to produce NaF, water and a gas vented to the atmosphere free of cyanide compositions, fluorine, and CO...|$|E
40|$|An {{adsorbent}} {{has been}} prepared from spent <b>pot</b> <b>liner,</b> an aluminum industry solid waste. Surface activation of SPL {{is performed using}} leaching process. Leaching process employed variation factors like L/S ratio, acid-alkaliconcentration. Optimized leaching process is used for further adsorption study. Investigation {{has been made to}} explore the possibility of this adsorbent for liquid phase adsorptive removal of methylene blue (MB). Comparative study of raw and activated adsorbent has been performed to investigate effect of activation process. Optimization and designing of experiment is performed using response surface methodology. Initial dye concentration, adsorbentdose, contacttime, pH, temperature were found as significant factor for adsorption of MB dye. Optimization of raw and acidic-alkali treated SPL shows that treated SPL is effective and economical feasible compared to raw SPL. Adsorption isotherms study Experiment yields excellent fits for raw SPL adsorption asRedlich-Peterson>Freundlich>Langmuir>Temkin.

40|$|The {{production}} of primary metal from ores {{has long been}} a necessary, but environmentally devastating process. Over the past 20 years, in an effort to lessen environmental impacts, the metal processing industry has developed methods for recovering metal values from certain hazardous wastes. However, these processes leave residual molten slag that requires disposal in hazardous waste landfills. A new process recovers valuable metals, metal alloys, and metal oxides from hazardous wastes, such as electric arc furnace (EAF) dust from steel mills, mill scale, spent aluminum <b>pot</b> <b>liners,</b> and wastewater treatment sludge from electroplating. At the same time, the process does not create residual waste for disposal. This new method uses all wastes from metal production processes. These hazardous materials are converted to three valuable products - mineral wool, zinc oxide, and high-grade iron...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{literature}} {{on the presence of}} heavy metals in contaminated wastes is reviewed. Various categories of materials produced from domestic and industrial activities are included, but municipal solid waste, which is a more complex material, is excluded. This review considers among the most abundant the following materials - wood waste including demolition wood, phytoremediation scavengers and chromated copper arsenate (CCA) timber, sludges including de-inking sludge and sewage sludge, chicken litter and spent <b>pot</b> <b>liner.</b> The partitioning of the metals in the ashes after combustion or gasification follows conventional behaviour, with most metals retained, and higher concentrations in the finer sizes due to vaporisation and recondensation. The alkali metals have been shown to catalyse the biomass conversion, particularly lithium and potassium, although other metals are active to a lesser extent. The most prevalent in biomass is potassium, which is not only inherently active, but volatilises to become finely distributed throughout the char mass. Because the metals are predominantly found in the ash, the effectiveness of their removal depends on the efficiency of the collection of particulates. The potential for disposal into soil depends on the initial concentration in the feed material...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater {{contaminated}} with spent <b>pot</b> <b>liner</b> leachate (SPLL) {{was treated with}} calcite (CaCO₃) and CO₂ {{in a series of}} free drift batch reactor kinetic experiments with the aim of optimizing fluoride removal. In order to better understand the reaction kinetics for SPLL, the pseudo-second order (PSO), four and five parameter Hill (Hill 4 & Hill 5) models were applied to observed fluoride removal as a function of CO₂ partial pressure and stirring rate. To account for differences in the number of model parameters, model fitting was compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Schwartz Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the statistical F-test. In every case, the best fitting model order was found to be Hill 5 > Hill 4 > PSO due to the ability of the Hill models to accommodate sigmoidal kinetics. Removal of fluoride from SPLL under atmospheric CO 2 conditions was found to be inhibited with no removal occurring for the first 3000 min with the inhibition times, based on the reaction half-life, reducing with increased CO₂ partial pressure and stirring rate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the residual solid filtrate consisted of trona (Na₃(CO₃) (HCO₃) · 2 H₂O) a potentially valuable mineral kogarkoite (Na₃SO₄F) and fluorite (CaF₂) accounting for fluoride removal, and unreacted calcite (CaCO₃) ...|$|E
40|$|Cement {{manufacturing}} is {{an energy}} intensive and heavy pollutant emissions process with energy typically accounting for 50 % - 60 % {{of the production}} costs. It is accountable for CO 2, NOX, SO 2 emissions and some heavy metal discharge from the pre-calciner kiln system which causes severe greenhouse effects. Energy efficiency improvement and how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are thus most important areas of research. This paper focuses on reducing pollutants emissions by optimizing the usage of alternative fuels. A process model of the preheater tower calciner has been developed using Aspen Plus simulation software in this study based on the combustion mechanism. The model is verified against measured data from industry and data available in theliterature. This paper presents {{the effects of the}} flow rate of alternative fuels and tertiary air on the composition of the flue gas inthe preheater calciner. The effects of the fuel combustion on the NOx, and CO 2 concentrations in the flue gas are also investigated. Three different alternative fuels, namely waste tyre, spent <b>pot</b> <b>liner</b> and municipal solid waste are considered for the study. Substitution rate of conventional fuel by the alternative one is also taken in consideration to identify its effect on the pollutant emission. Simulation results presented in this paper are considered useful to the cement manufacturing stakeholders tochoose the right alternative fuel...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{contamination}} in solder alloys. The first source is trace elements {{from the primary}} metals used in the as-manufactured product, be that product in ingot, wire, or powder form. Their levels in the primary metal {{are determined by the}} refining process. While some of these trace elements are naturally occurring materials, additional contamination can result from the refining and/or forming processes. Sources include: furnace <b>pot</b> <b>liners,</b> debris on the cutting edges of shears, rolling mill rollers, etc. The types and levels of contaminants per solder alloy are set by recognized industrial, federal, military, and international specifications. For example, the 63 Sn- 37 Pb solder purchased to the ASTM B 32 standard can have maximum levels of contamination for the following metals: 0. 08 (wt.) %Cu, 0. 001 %Cd, 0. 005 %Al, 0. 25 %Bi, 0. 03 %As, 0. 02 %Fe, and 0. 005 %Zn. A second cause of contamination in solders, and solder baths in particular, is their actual use in soldering operations. Each time a workpiece is introduced into the bath, some dissolution of the joint base metal(s), protective or solderable coatings, and fixture metal takes place which adds to contamination levels in the solder. The potential impurities include Cu; Ni; Au or other noble metals used as protective finishes and Al; Fe; and Zn to name a few. Even dissolution of the <b>pot</b> wall or <b>liner</b> is a source of impurities, typically Fe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Aluminium {{titanate}} (Al 2 TiO 5) is {{an excellent}} oxide ceramic material with a very low thermal expand coefficient. Aiming at improving the bending strength Al 2 TiO 5, spodumene was used as additives for preparing Al 2 TiO 5 {{and the effect of}} adding spodumene on the mechanical properties of Al 2 TiO 5 was investigated in this paper. It was found that adding spodumene, instead of simple oxides, may significantly enhance the bending strength of Al 2 TiO 5. Aluminium titanate (Al 2 TiO 5) ceramics arouses commercial interest because of its low thermal expansion coefficient and excellent thermal shock resistance, compared to other materials [1]. Al 2 TiO 5 ceramics are presently used in many fields, such as exhaust <b>pot</b> <b>liners</b> in both petrol and diesel engines, refractory components of the non-ferrous metallurgical industries and so on. Al 2 TiO 5 is isomorphous with pseudobrookite, belonging to orthorhombic space group Cmcm. Al 2 TiO 5 is thermodynamically stable from 1280 °C to the melting temperature (Tm = 1860 °C). It decomposes into parent oxides α-Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 by a eutectoid reaction when the temperature is less than 1280 °C [2]. It has been well known that adding small amounts of oxide additives can restrain the decomposition and improve the strength of Al 2 TiO 5 [1]. In this letter, the effect of adding minerals on the bending strength of Al 2 TiO 5 was reported...|$|R
50|$|After World War II, various {{styles of}} {{camouflage}} cover were used at different times. In the 1960s through 1970s, the type commonly {{seen in the}} United States Army and Marine Corps was a reversible fabric cover called the Mitchell Pattern, with a leafy green pattern {{on one side and}} orange cloud pattern on the other. This type was nearly omnipresent in Vietnam, and where, for the first time, the army wore the cloth camouflage as general issue; whereas in World War II and the Korean War, the army traditionally wore their helmets only with nets, plain without anything on it, or with field-made, non-issue covers without camouflage. By contrast, United States Marines have consistently worn a cloth camouflage cover over their M-1 helmets in all three major wars—World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The Korean War (1950-1953) was largely fought using World War II weapons and equipment, and the Marine Corps helmets and camouflage covers were basically the same as those used during World War II. In Vietnam, the green portion of the reversible fabric camouflage was normally worn outermost. Helmet covers in the (European) woodland camouflage, were designed for fighting in the European Theater of Operations (NATO), and became the post-Vietnam (jungle pattern) camouflage cover used by the U.S. military from the late 1970s onward. The (European) Woodland pattern was not reversible; they were only printed on one side, though some rare desert camouflage examples do exist. These covers were all constructed from two semi-circular pieces of cloth stitched together to form a dome-like shape conforming to the helmet's shape. They were secured to the helmet by folding their open ends into the steel pot, and then placing the liner inside, trapping the cloth between the <b>pot</b> and the <b>liner.</b> An olive green elastic band, intended to hold additional camouflage materials, was often worn around the helmet to further hold the cover in place.|$|R
