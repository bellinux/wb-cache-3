5|$|An {{important}} event following {{the conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin, the Bavarians' murder of Kurszán, was recorded by the longer version of the Annals of Saint Gall, the Annales Alamannici and the Annals of Einsiedeln. The first places the event in 902, while the others date it to 904. The three chronicles unanimously state that the Bavarians invited the Hungarian leader to a dinner on the <b>pretext</b> <b>of</b> negotiating a peace treaty and treacherously assassinated him.

40|$|This article aims {{to explore}} and to apply what Gérard Genette refers to as kinds of transtextual {{relationships}} and what Ulrich Luz, in his application of these insights to the Gospel of Matthew, calls the encyclopaedia of the author or the original readers. The former enterprise entails exploring intertextuality at the synchronic level and the latter examines intertextuality at the diachronic level. The first pertains to Matthew’s pretexts. The second enterprise entails an engagement with pragmatical aspects such as {{the context of the}} intended readers and the sedimentation of prior texts designated by the notion intertextuality. In this article the pragmatical aspects concern a discussion of {{the manner in which the}} first readers could be addressed by the <b>pretexts</b> <b>of</b> the use of the word sōzō (‘to save’). It consists of three parts. The first represents a concise reflection on criteria and methods relevant to an investigation of intertextuality. The second exemplifies the ‘encyclopedia’ of Matthew’s intertextuality, that is ‘intertext’, ‘paratext’, ‘hypertext’, ‘hypotext’, ‘architext’, and ‘metatext’. The third part discusses the <b>pretexts</b> <b>of</b> the various occurrences of the word sōzō in Matthew...|$|R

5|$|As discussed, the Chalkidian League {{had made}} peace with Athens in 352 BC, in clear breach of their {{alliance}} with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, {{the next few years}} of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the <b>pretext</b> <b>of</b> attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.|$|E

Setting aside the false <b>pretexts</b> <b>of</b> {{weapons of mass destruction and}} the war against terrorism it is still relevant to assess the causes of the inevitability of the failure of the democratization process as such. Three crucial factors stand out in this respect: (1) the character of Middle East societies in general and of the artificial construct Iraq in particular; (2) the incredibility of the project based on a wrong assessment of Arab attitudes; and (3) the nature and self-image of the United States which may have the practical tools to export and impose programmes of modernization but does not have the right and balanced psychological orientation...|$|R

5|$|Dynastic infighting and misfortune quickly {{brought about}} {{the demise of the}} House of York. George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, plotted against his brother and was executed. Following Edward's {{premature}} death in 1483, his brother Richard had Parliament declare Edward's two sons illegitimate on the <b>pretext</b> <b>of</b> an alleged prior pre-contract to Lady Eleanor Talbot, leaving Edward's marriage invalid. Richard seized the throne, and the Princes in the Tower were never seen again. Richard's son predeceased him and Richard was killed in 1485 after an invasion of foreign mercenaries led by Henry Tudor, who claimed the throne through his mother Margaret Beaufort. Tudor assumed the throne as Henry VII, founding the Tudor dynasty and bringing the Plantagenet line of kings to an end.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, {{the use of}} the bathing scene {{reached its}} high point in classicism, realism and impressionism. Oriental themes and harem and turkish baths scenes became popular. These scenes were based on the artists' imagination, because access by men to Islamic women was not {{generally}} permitted. In {{the second half of the}} century, artists increasingly eschewed the <b>pretexts</b> <b>of</b> mythology and exoticism, and painted contemporary western women bathing. Edgar Degas, for example, painted over 100 paintings with a bathing theme. The subject of Bathers remained popular in avant-garde circles at the outset of the 20th century.|$|R

For this reason the hour chosen was one at which there were likely to be other visitors in the outer cloisters of San Marco.|$|R

This plan {{may have been}} hatched at the instigation of the Marathas, and Mu'azzam's own inclinations and sincerity are difficult to gauge. Anyway, Aurangzeb learned about the plot and sent Mu'azzam's mother Begum Nawab Bai (a Muslim Rajput princess by birth) to dissuade Mu'azzam from rebellion. Nawab Bai brought Mu'azzam back to the Mughal court, where {{he spent the next}} several years under Aurangzeb's supervision. However, Mu'azzam revolted in 1680 on the <b>pretext</b> <b>of</b> protesting Aurangzeb's treatment of Rajput chiefs.

Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal—the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)—to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law. Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.|$|E

40|$|Every {{year in the}} United States, {{thousands}} of employees are illegally fired for joining or supporting unions. These employees must bring their claims to the National Labor Relations Board (the “Board”), which applies its famous Wright Line standard to decide {{thousands of}} discrimination cases each year. Probably the most common issue in labor discrimination cases is “pretext. ” In virtually every case, an employer claims that it fired an employee not for an illegal anti-union motive, but for a legitimate business reason. The pretext issue arises when the evidence shows that the legitimate reason asserted by the employer was most likely not the true reason for firing the employee. The role such evidence <b>of</b> <b>pretext</b> can play in proving anti-union discrimination has been controversial. The Board 2 ̆ 7 s position on that issue has fluctuated over the years, and the federal circuit courts that review the Board 2 ̆ 7 s decisions have often disagreed with the Board. This Article explains how the Board has resolved the pretext issue and analyzes whether the Board 2 ̆ 7 s resolution is correct. Based on comprehensive research of hundreds of Board and court decisions, the Article provides the first complete discussion of the role <b>of</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>pretext</b> in discrimination cases. The Article identifies two fundamental questions {{at the heart of}} the controversy over evidence <b>of</b> <b>pretext,</b> and proposes solutions to both. The first question is whether evidence regarding the employer 2 ̆ 7 s reason for its action, particularly when presented by the employer, can be considered when deciding if the employee has proven discrimination. The Article explains that basic evidentiary principles from ordinary civil law, largely ignored in labor discrimination cases, make clear that the answer is yes. The second question is whether evidence <b>of</b> <b>pretext</b> can be the primary basis for finding discriminatory motivation. Here, the Article criticizes the Board and the courts for treating all types <b>of</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>pretext</b> as equal, and explains which types <b>of</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>pretext</b> provide a reasonable basis for finding discrimination...|$|R

Isabella and John Sigismund moved to Lippa (now Lipova in Romania). Before long, they took up residence in Gyulafehérvár in Transylvania (now Alba Iulia in Romania). John Sigismund's realm was administered by his father's treasurer, George Martinuzzi, who wanted to reunite Hungary {{under the rule of}} Ferdinand. Martinuzzi forced Isabella to renounce her son's realm in exchange for two Silesian duchies and 140,000 florins in 1551. John Sigismund and his mother settled in Poland, but she continued to negotiate for John Sigismund's restoration with Ferdinand's enemies.|$|E
