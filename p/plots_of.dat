5|$|A report {{written by}} Roger Travis and {{published}} by The Escapist compares Halo with the Latin epic Aeneid, written by classical Roman poet Virgil. Travis posits similarities between the <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> both works and compares the characters present in them, with the Flood and Covenant taking the role performed by the Carthaginians, and the Master Chief's role in the series to that of Aeneas.|$|E
5|$|Another source may be Aesop's Fables as {{published}} by William Caxton—scholar John MacQueen considers this {{more likely than}} Disciplina clericalis—although the tale itself is not Aesopic but rather of the beast fable (also beast-epic) genre. The <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> such works are more complicated than their Aesopic counterpart, tend more towards ribaldry, and feature the fox making {{a victim of the}} wolf.|$|E
5|$|Having been in {{excellent}} health, Vaughan Williams died suddenly {{in the early}} hours of 26 August 1958 at Hanover Terrace. Two days later, after a private funeral at Golders Green, he was cremated. On 19 September, at a crowded memorial service, his ashes were interred near the burial <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> Purcell and Stanford in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> {{the game}} is almost {{the same as the}} <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the film.|$|R

500|$|The film <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> The Lives of a Bengal Lancer bear little {{resemblance}} to the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the book. Reid noted in Award-Winning Films of the 1930s that [...] "None of the characters in the book appear in the screenplay, not even Yeats-Brown himself. The <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the film is also entirely different." ...|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the series}} {{consists}} of original content featuring new as well as established characters, but the second season is mostly based on the <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2. While traditionally animated, it includes non-outlined CGI elements for things such as Sonic's homing attack.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} debut on the soap opera, Dimitri became a complex leading man and {{took part in}} some of the most notable <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> the 1990s. Those storylines {{included}} popular romances with Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) and Alexandra Devane (Finola Hughes), as well as a loving yet antagonistic fraternal relationship with Edmund Grey (John Callahan).|$|E
5|$|With a few modifications, the <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> Adventure and Adventure 2 were reprised {{during the}} second season of the anime Sonic X (2003–06). American {{licensing}} corporation 4Kids Entertainment hired an entirely new voice cast for the English dub, but the Japanese cast from the games reprised their roles in the original version of the show.|$|E
500|$|In 2016, Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{expressed}} interest in using the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the video game [...] as the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> a sequel film.|$|R
50|$|Although set {{within the}} broader <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the Patternist series, the entire <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> Survivor is largely {{separated}} from {{the events of the}} other books in the series.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> Part I {{formed the}} primary <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the reimagined Battlestar Galactica miniseries, {{in which the}} Twelve Colonies are destroyed, and the {{survivors}} set out for Earth.|$|R
5|$|Agriculture {{dominates the}} {{northern}} shore, where many <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> land are still {{owned by the}} descendants of early settlers. The largely abandoned historical communities of Rosita and West Portland are also located in this area. To the west, the Odem Bay extension is formed, and is fed by Rincon Bayou and a large complex of marsh formed by the Nueces River delta. Just south of the mouth, are {{the remains of the}} abandoned Nuecestown settlement, which is now included in the Corpus Christi city limits.|$|E
5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend remembered that the <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him much, {{but as soon as the}} lights came on he would rush home to see if he could duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> {{the film}} bears a {{striking}} resemblance to the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the Warner Brothers talkie, One Way Passage (1932). This silent appears to have been more exotic.|$|R
40|$|Parody as {{a salient}} device in postmodern {{literature}} is extensively applied by Tom Stoppard in his plays. Having different layers of parody, Stoppard‟s “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead”, “The Real Inspector Hound”, and “Dogg‟s Hamlet, Cahoot‟s Macbeth ” exhibit his parodic application of other writers ‟ plots. The analytical-qualitative scrutiny <b>of</b> the <b>plot</b> lines <b>of</b> these plays not only corroborates their parodic nature but also demonstrates the techniques Stoppard employs in each play to parody the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> its hypotext. “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead ” dramatizes a specific parody <b>of</b> the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> “Hamlet ” both where it overlaps the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the tragedy and more intensely where it touches Shakespeare‟s plot tangentially. Stoppard‟s genre parody <b>of</b> the stock <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the crime genre is portrayed in “The Real Inspector Hound”. It simultaneously enjoys a parody <b>of</b> the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> Agatha Christie‟s “The Mousetrap”. The three-part {{performance in the}} first part of “Dogg‟s Hamlet, Cahoot‟s Macbeth ” displays a specific parody <b>of</b> the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare‟s “Hamlet”...|$|R

5|$|By the 1870s, Chicago {{had become}} the main {{financial}} center for the West, but in October 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed {{the majority of the}} wooden structures within city. The city was rebuilt on large <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> land in a new grid network and followed new city ordinances that prohibited construction in wood. These factors encouraged the building of taller properties in new innovative designs, which, like New York, saw a range of businesses and services being packed into single buildings.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Hertz (1887) {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated the}} resonance phenomena by building two resonant circuits, {{one of which}} was driven by a generator and the other was tunable and only coupled to the first electromagnetically (i.e., no circuit connection). Hertz showed that the response of the second circuit was at a maximum when it was in tune with the first. The diagrams produced by Hertz in this paper were the first published <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> an electrical resonant response.|$|E
5|$|Note: The {{short story}} {{takes place at}} an inn on the road from London to Norwich, but the play calls for Alsatian costumery. Otherwise, the <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> the short story and play are nearly identical. The summary below uses the names from the play and notes {{significant}} changes in plot between the play and short story. There are also various small changes {{to the order of}} events, not described.|$|E

50|$|The <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> Twilight at the Well of Souls is {{a direct}} {{continuation}} <b>of</b> the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> The Return of Nathan Brazil. As that novel concludes, guards at the South Zone of the Well World have killed Nathan Brazil.|$|R
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, L. Sprague de Camp {{considered}} Morris's fantasies {{to be not}} wholly successful, partly because Morris eschewed many literary techniques from later eras. In particular, De Camp argued the <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> the novels are heavily driven by coincidence; while many things just happened in the romances, the novels are still weakened by the dependence on it. Nevertheless, large subgenres {{of the field of}} fantasy have sprung from the romance genre, but indirectly, through their writers' imitation of William Morris.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda is {{a country}} of few natural resources, {{and the economy is}} based mostly on {{subsistence}} agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated 90% of the working population farms, and agriculture constituted an estimated 32.5% of GDP in 2014. Farming techniques are basic, with small <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> land and steep slopes. Since the mid-1980s, farm sizes and food production have been decreasing, {{due in part to the}} resettlement of displaced people. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with population growth, and food imports are required.|$|E
5|$|Santa's Little Helper {{has since}} {{appeared}} frequently on The Simpsons {{and is the}} center of the <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> many episodes. During the course of the show, he has fathered litters of puppies, passed obedience school, had surgery for bloat, replaced Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer, and been trained as a police dog at Springfield's Animal Police Academy. Some of the episodes that focus on Santa's Little Helper have been inspired by popular culture or real experiences that staff members of the show have gone through.|$|E

50|$|The novel {{features}} the recurring character of Colonel Race {{for his last}} appearance to solve the mysterious deaths of a married couple, exactly one year apart. The <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> this novel expands the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> a short story, Yellow Iris.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> {{the film}} is loosely based on the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> Casablanca. Barb Wire is set in 2017 during the [...] "Second American Civil War," [...] rather than World War II. Many of the roles had their gender switched.|$|R
5|$|The Corporation {{stipulated that}} several {{manufacturing}} industries should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or firm to dominate. It {{did not seek}} to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> land with room for expansion, allowing firms {{to build their own}} premises or rent ready-made buildings, and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Days of Ruin is {{considerably}} darker than, and unrelated to, the <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> previous games. Almost 90% of humanity {{has been killed}} off following devastating meteor strikes which have destroyed much of civilization and caused a massive dust cloud to blot out the sun, preventing photosynthesis and thereby preventing the growing of crops. Scattered survivors pick through the wreckage, and the remnants of several military superpowers patrol the ravaged landscape, some factions protecting the innocent while the others prey upon them.|$|E
5|$|The <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> the unmade serials also vary. A {{theme of}} a {{civilisation}} {{where women are}} dominant was proposed twice—once for The Hidden Planet, and again for The Prison in Space. In some cases, elements of unmade serials were adapted, or were moved from one serial to another; for example, Song of the Space Whale {{was intended to be}} the introduction of Vislor Turlough until it was repeatedly set back, causing Mawdryn Undead to be Turlough's first appearance.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is an attempt to read Mark 12 : 1 - 12 in terms <b>of</b> the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the Gospel. Firstly a brief survey is given of the {{development}} <b>of</b> the term <b>plot</b> from Aristotle to the present, thereafter an own methodological point <b>of</b> departure concerning <b>plot</b> is formulated in order to study the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> Mark. The conclusions made from this are used to indicate how Mark 12 : 1 - 12 fits into the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the Gospel and what functional role it plays in the development <b>of</b> the <b>plot.</b> The conclusion reached is that Mark 12 : 1 - 12 contains the <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> Mark in a nutshell...|$|R
50|$|A map between diffeological spaces {{is called}} {{differentiable}} if {{and only if}} composing it with every <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the first space is a <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> the second space.
