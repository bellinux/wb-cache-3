5|$|The Atlantic <b>puffin</b> is {{a species}} of seabird in the order Charadriiformes. It is in the auk family, Alcidae, which {{includes}} the guillemots, typical auks, murrelets, auklets, puffins and the razorbill. The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) and the puffins are closely related, together composing the tribe Fraterculini. The Atlantic <b>puffin</b> is the only species in the genus Fratercula {{to occur in the}} Atlantic Ocean. Two other species are known from the northeast Pacific, the tufted <b>puffin</b> (Fratercula cirrhata) and the horned <b>puffin</b> (Fratercula corniculata), the latter being the closest relative of the Atlantic <b>puffin.</b>|$|E

50|$|During the 1990s the Caledonian Sharks {{were set}} up by John Boland, but {{eventually}} folded. The first lasting Scottish club of the modern era {{was known as the}} Edinburgh <b>Puffins</b> in 2003 with informal matches held, and invitiationals of clubs from the British Australian Rules Football League. The Edinburgh <b>Puffins</b> and modern SARFL came about through the work of Andrew Butler and Richard Prentice, former players with BARFL side, North London Lions. Butler and Prentice began plans for the SARFL in the winter of 2002/2003. Intra city friendlies began in early 2003 and a combined rules match against Edinburgh Gaelic side Dunedin Connolleys. The <b>Puffins</b> made their debut in the 2003 Northern Cup tournament staged in St Helens. The side remained unbeaten against the then St Helens Miners and Wandsworth Demons. Later in 2003, the <b>Puffins</b> staged a home and away series against Oxford University winning both hard fought games. The inaugural SARFL season was held in 2004 with a league consisting of two sides in Edinburgh and one in Glasgow. The <b>Puffins</b> name, originally conceived by inaugural Edinburgh <b>Puffins</b> coach Gavin England was subsequently conferred upon the Scottish national team. Later in 2010 the Scottish <b>Puffins</b> were rebranded as the Scottish Clansmen.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Puffins</b> {{are caught}} by the {{traditional}} method of [...] "fleyging". This is catching the birds in flight by actively netting them with the hand-wielded [...] "fleygingarstong", a 3.6 metre-long pole with a small net at the end suspended between two rods, somewhat like a very long lacrosse stick. Fleyging is usually carried out on a cliff-top from a [...] "fleygises", or fleyging-seat, built of stones in a small depression so that the fleyger is concealed from overflying <b>puffins.</b> The <b>puffins</b> then have their necks snapped or their heads simply pulled off. Several hundred <b>puffins</b> may be caught in this way by one person in a day.|$|R

An edition by imprint Picture <b>Puffin</b> was published in London in 1978. Imperial Educational Resources produced {{a version of the}} story in 1980, as a filmstrip geared for children in primary school. It {{was published by}} Live Oak Media in 2004, and by Paw Prints in 2009. Gallaudet University produced a DVD video edition aimed at youth versed in sign language.|$|E
5|$|St. Seiriol {{established}} a cell {{and a community}} on <b>Puffin</b> Island (in Welsh, Ynys Seiriol or Seiriol's Island) {{half a mile from}} the coast {{at the same time as}} he founded the monastery. There is a tower of a 12th-century church on <b>Puffin</b> Island still. There is a tradition that St. Seiriol and perhaps Maelgwn Gwynedd (king of Gwynedd in the first half of the 6th century) were buried there. The island once had large numbers of puffins and guillemots. However, rats reduced the bird population to 40 in the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|The {{publisher}} of paperbacks, Penguin Books, introduced {{a range of}} books for children under the <b>Puffin</b> Books brand in 1939. At first these were non-fiction titles but these were soon followed by a fiction list of well-known authors. The demand {{was so great that}} <b>Puffin</b> Book Clubs were introduced in schools to encourage reading, and a children's magazine <b>Puffin</b> Post was established. There is a tradition on the Icelandic island of Heimaey for the children to rescue young puffins, a fact recorded in Bruce McMillan's photo-illustrated children's book Nights of the Pufflings (1995). The fledglings emerge from the nest and try to {{make their way to the}} sea but sometimes get confused, perhaps by the street lighting, ending up by landing in the village. The children collect them and liberate them to the safety of the sea.|$|E
5|$|Like many seabirds, the Atlantic <b>puffin</b> {{spends most}} of the year far from land in the open ocean and only visits coastal areas to breed. It is a sociable bird and it usually breeds in large colonies.|$|E

25|$|Rats were {{probably}} introduced via shipwrecks; supposedly, a coal boat that sank offshore {{was the first}} culprit and caused great harm to the nesting bird populations, with the <b>puffins</b> proving vulnerable {{to the extent of}} extinction as breeding birds. After a long campaign using pioneering techniques, the rats were eradicated in 1991, and now <b>puffins</b> are once again raising young on the island with many other benefits occurring to both the fauna and the flora. It is thought that the <b>puffins</b> recolonised Ailsa Craig from Glunimore and Sheep Islands.|$|R
50|$|The distantly related <b>puffins,</b> which {{live in the}} North Pacific and North Atlantic, {{developed}} similar {{characteristics to}} survive in the Arctic and sub-Arctic environments. Like the penguins, <b>puffins</b> have a white chest, black back and short stubby wings providing excellent swimming ability in icy water. But, unlike penguins, <b>puffins</b> can fly, as flightless birds would not survive alongside land-based predators such as polar bears and foxes; there are no such predators in the Antarctic. Their similarities indicate that similar environments, although at great distances, can result in similar evolutionary developments, i.e. convergent evolution.|$|R
50|$|The island's {{animals are}} mainly of the avian variety, {{although}} rabbits are long established here. The island has many <b>puffins</b> and some storm petrels. Although the latter have declined, {{they used to}} nest in the cottage's storm loft. Roderick Dobson in Birds of the Channel Islands said that <b>puffins</b> had been plentiful for over a century. The Birds of Guernsey (1878) by Cecil Smith states likewise. The <b>puffins</b> have had to compete with gulls, and in 1949, hundreds died from red mite infestation. The rabbit holes on the island make good nesting for them.|$|R
5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic <b>puffin</b> colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic <b>puffin</b> colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Dimorphodon {{has been}} envisioned as a <b>puffin</b> {{analogue}} in the past, but its jaw structure and gait, combined with its poor flight capabilities, {{indicate that it}} was a terrestrial/semiarboreal feeder. It {{seems to have been a}} predator of small mammals and squamates, and possibly also preyed on large insects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era avian life {{includes}} the corncrake, red-throated diver, rock dove, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic <b>puffin,</b> goldeneye, golden eagle and white-tailed sea eagle. The last named was re-introduced to Rùm in 1975 and has successfully spread to various neighbouring islands, including Mull. There is a small population of red-billed chough concentrated on the islands of Islay and Colonsay.|$|E
50|$|Young <b>puffins</b> from Great Island were transplanted to Eastern Egg Rock {{when they}} were about 10 - 14 days old. The young <b>puffins</b> were then nested in {{artificial}} sod burrows for about one month. Audubon biologists placed handfuls of vitamin-fortified fish in their burrows each day. As the young <b>puffins</b> reached fledging age, they received identification tags {{so they could be}} recognized in the future. After spending their first 2 - 3 years at sea, it was hoped they would return to establish a new colony at Eastern Egg Rock rather than Great Island.|$|R
50|$|Unusual for a tern, the {{roseate tern}} shows some kleptoparasitic behaviour, {{stealing}} fish from other seabirds, at British colonies most often from <b>puffins.</b> This habit greatly increases their food-collecting ability during bad weather when fish swim deeper, {{out of reach}} of plunge-diving terns, but still within reach of the deeper-diving <b>Puffins.</b>|$|R
25|$|Where rabbits breed, {{sometimes}} Atlantic <b>puffins</b> {{breed in}} rabbit burrows.|$|R
5|$|Otters, grey seals, {{killer whales}} and harbour {{porpoises}} are frequently seen on and around Papa Stour. Atlantic <b>puffin,</b> Arctic and common tern, bonxie and Arctic skua, northern fulmar, common guillemot, razorbill, curlew, wheatear, ringed plover and {{great black-backed gull}} all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|SOS <b>Puffin</b> is a {{conservation}} {{project at the}} Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. <b>Puffin</b> numbers {{on the island of}} Craigleith, once one of the largest colonies in Scotland with 28,000 pairs, have declined dramatically to just a few thousand due to the invasion of a large introduced plant, the tree mallow (Lavatera arborea). This has spread across the island in dense thickets and prevents the puffins from finding suitable sites for burrowing and breeding. The project has the support of over 700 volunteers and {{progress has been made in}} cutting back the plants, with puffins returning in greater numbers to breed. Another conservation measure undertaken by the Centre is to encourage motorists to check under their cars in late summer before driving off as young puffins, disorientated by the street lights, may land in the town and take shelter underneath the vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic <b>puffin</b> {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult <b>puffin.</b> They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{colonies of}} Atlantic puffins provide an {{interesting}} spectacle for both bird watchers and tourists. For example, four thousand puffins nest {{each year on}} islands {{off the coast of}} Maine and visitors can view them from tour boats which operate during the summer months. There is a Project <b>Puffin</b> Visitor Centre in Rockland providing information on the birds and their lives, and on the other conservation projects being undertaken by the National Audubon Society who run the centre. Similar tours operate in Iceland, the Hebrides, and Newfoundland.|$|E
25|$|Tufted <b>puffins</b> feed almost {{exclusively}} on fish, which they catch by diving from the surface. Adults may also feed on squid or other invertebrates. Feeding areas can be located far offshore from the nesting areas. <b>Puffins</b> can store large quantities of small fish in their bills and carry them to their chicks.|$|R
