40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new wind {{offering}} strategy {{in which a}} wind <b>power</b> <b>producer</b> employs demand response (DR) {{to cope with the}} power production uncertainty and market violations. To this end, the wind <b>power</b> <b>producer</b> sets demand response (DR) contracts with a DR aggregator. The DR aggregator behavior is modeled through a revenue function. In this way the aggregator aims to maximize its revenue through trading DR with the wind <b>power</b> <b>producer,</b> other market players and the day-ahead market. The problem is formulated in bilevel programming in which the upper level represents wind <b>power</b> <b>producer</b> decisions and the lower level models the DR aggregator behavior. The given bilevel problem is then transformed into a single-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and linearized using proper techniques. The feasibility of the given strategy is assessed on a case of the Nordic market...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} wind power {{offering}} strategies in day-ahead markets. A new plan is proposed {{in which a}} wind <b>power</b> <b>producer</b> participates in the day-ahead market while employing demand response (DR) to smooth its power variations. In this context, a new DR scheme is presented through which the wind <b>power</b> <b>producer</b> is able to achieve DR by establishing various DR agreements with DR aggregators. The proposed offering plan involves two stages: the first stage clears on the day-ahead market. The wind <b>power</b> <b>producer</b> decides on day-ahead offers as well as DR agreements with the aggregator. The second stage takes place on the balancing market. In a successive approach, the wind <b>power</b> <b>producer</b> determines its energy trading for each period until the whole day is covered. Additionally, proper DR agreements for each period are confirmed here. The proposed plan is formulated in a stochastic programming approach, where its validity is assessed on {{a case of the}} Nordic market...|$|R

25|$|Prior to the 1990s reform, the Dominican {{power sector}} {{was in the}} hands of the state-owned, vertically-integrated Corporación Dominicana de Electricidad (CDE). The {{operation}} of the company was characterized by large energy losses, poor bill collection and deficient operation and maintenance. During the 1990s, the rapid growth in the power sector mirrored the high economic growth experienced by the country. Total electricity demand increased at an annual rate of 7.5% in the years 1992-2001, while annual GDP growth was 5.9%. Generation capacity was not enough to meet peak demand, which translated into continuous supply constrains and widespread blackouts lasting up to 20 hours. In the mid-1990s, in order to address generation capacity shortages, several Independent <b>Power</b> <b>Producers</b> (IPPs) where encouraged by the government to sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the CDE. The result of these deals, often nontransparent and negotiated, was high electricity prices.|$|E
25|$|The Philippines {{then was}} {{experiencing}} widespread blackouts due to huge demand for electricity and antiquity of power plants, the abolishment of the Department of Energy and discontinuation of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant during the Aquino administration. During his State of the Nation address on July 27, 1992, he {{requested that the}} Congress enact {{a law that would}} create an Energy Department that would plan and manage the Philippines' energy demands. Congress not only created an Energy Department but gave him special emergency powers to resolve the power crisis. Using the powers given to him, Ramos issued licenses to independent <b>power</b> <b>producers</b> (IPP) to construct power plants within 24 months. Ramos issued supply contracts that guaranteed the government would buy whatever power the IPPs produced under the contract in U.S. dollars to entice investments in power plants. This became a problem during the East Asian Financial Crisis when the demand for electricity contracted and the Philippine peso lost half of its value.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{increasing}} demand for electricity {{and concerned about}} the low reserve situation, the government of Israel began taking steps to increase the supply of electricity and operating reserve, as well to reduce the monopoly position of the IEC and increase competition in the electricity market starting in {{second half of the}} 2000s decade. It instructed the IEC to construct several new power stations and encouraged private investment in the generation sector. By 2015, the IEC's share of total nationwide installed electric generation capacity had fallen to about 75%, with the company then possessing an installed generation capacity of about 13.6 gigawatts (GW). Since 2010, Independent <b>Power</b> <b>Producers</b> have constructed three new gas-fired combined cycle power stations with a total generation capacity of about 2.2 GW, while various industrial concerns constructed on-premises cogeneration facilities with a total electricity output of about 1 GW, and which are licensed by the electric authority to sell surplus electricity to the national grid at competitive rates. Also under construction is a 300 MW pumped storage facility, with two more in planning, plus several solar-powered plants.|$|E

25|$|Ramos {{personally}} {{pushed for}} the speedy approval {{of some of the}} most expensive power deals, and justified signing more contracts despite warnings from within the government and the World Bank that an impending oversupply of electricity could push up prices, a situation that persists in the Philippines up to the present. Individuals linked to Ramos lobbied for the approval of some of the contracts for independent <b>power</b> <b>producers</b> (IPPs), which came with numerous other deals, including lucrative legal, technical, and financial consultancies that were given to individuals and companies close to the former president. Among the deals tied to IPP projects were insurance contracts in which companies made millions of dollars in commissions alone. All the IPP contracts came with attractive incentives and guarantees. Every contract was designed to give IPP creditors some degree of comfort in financing ventures that would usually involve huge capital and risks. Most IPPs were funded by foreign loans secured with a form of government guarantee or performance undertaking, which meant that the Philippine government would pay for the loans if the IPPs defaulted. The Ramos government continued signing IPP contracts even after the power crisis had been considered solved by the end of 1993. The World Bank came up with a report in 1994 warning that power rates may rise if the government continued to enter into more IPP contracts that would mean excess power. The World Bank questioned the ambitious projections of the government on economic growth and power demand from 1994 to 1998. It also warned that the power generated by private utilities' IPPs could duplicate those of the National Power Corporation and create an overcapacity. The World Bank said that the factors create considerable uncertainty in power demand, like substantial overcapacity, particularly under take-or-pay conditions, would require considerable tariff increases that would be unpopular with the public. It was said that, presidents since Corazon Aquino catered mostly to the needs of big business for power and allowed the private sector to profit from this lucrative industry rather than craft an energy plan that would meet the needs of the Filipinos.|$|E
