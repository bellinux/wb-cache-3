5|$|When {{the album}} was due for release, Parker {{arranged}} Presley's return to performing live. He {{made a deal with}} Kirk Kerkorian, owner of the Las Vegas International Hotel for Presley to play the newly built, 2,000-seat showroom for four weeks (two shows per night, with Mondays off) for $400,000. For his appearance, he assembled a band later known as the TCB Band: James Burton (guitar), John Wilkinson (rhythm guitar), Jerry Scheff (bass-guitar), Ronnie Tutt (drums), Larry Muhoberac (piano) and Charlie Hodge (rhythm guitar, background vocals). The band was complimented by the backing vocals of The Sweet inspirations and The Imperials. His initial Las Vegas show attracted an audience of 101,500, setting a new Vegas <b>performance</b> <b>record.</b> By 1970, Presley began to tour the United States {{for the first time in}} thirteen years.|$|E

25|$|While the {{temporary}} replacement ROV (Kaikō7000II) has a remarkable <b>performance</b> <b>record,</b> {{it is only}} rated to 7,000 meters and cannot reach the deepest oceanic trenches. For this reason, JAMSTEC engineers began work on a new 11,000-meter class of ROV in April 2005. The project is called ABISMO (Automatic Bottom Inspection and Sampling Mobile), which translates to abyss in Spanish. Initial sea trials of ABISMO were conducted in 2007. The craft successfully reached a planned depth of 9,760-meters, the deepest part of Izu-Ogasawara Trench, where it collected core samples of sediment from the seabed. Plans are underway for a mission to the Challenger Deep.|$|E

25|$|A core that {{is growing}} in {{popularity}} is asphalt concrete. The majority of such dams are built with rock and/or gravel as the main fill material. Almost 100 dams of this design have now been built worldwide since the first such dam was completed in 1962. All asphalt-concrete core dams built so far have an excellent <b>performance</b> <b>record.</b> The type of asphalt used is a viscoelastic-plastic material that can adjust to the movements and deformations imposed on the embankment as a whole, and to settlements in the foundation. The flexible properties of the asphalt make such dams especially suited in earthquake regions.|$|E
25|$|At SL-1, {{control rods}} would {{get stuck in}} the control rod channel sporadically. Numerous {{procedures}} were conducted to evaluate control rods to ensure they were operating properly. There were rod drop tests and scram tests of each rod, in addition to periodic rod exercising and rod withdrawals for normal operation. From February 1959 to November 18, 1960, there were 40 cases of a stuck control rod for scram and rod drop tests and about a 2.5% failure rate. From November 18, 1960 to December 23, 1960, there was {{a dramatic increase in}} stuck rods, with 23 in that time period and a 13.0% failure rate. Besides these test failures, there were an additional 21 rod sticking incidents from February 1959 to December 1960; 4 of these had occurred in the last month of operation during routine rod withdrawal. The central control rod, No. 9, had the best operational <b>performance</b> <b>record</b> even though it was operated more frequently {{than any of the other}} rods.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, the FAA {{approved}} RB211-powered 757s for extended-range twin-engine {{operational performance}} standards (ETOPS) operations over the North Atlantic, following precedents {{set by the}} 767. Under ETOPS regulations, a set of safety standards governing twinjet flights over oceans and other areas without nearby suitable landing sites, airlines began using the aircraft for mid-range intercontinental routes. [...] Although the 757 was not originally intended for transoceanic flights, regulators based their decision on its reliable <b>performance</b> <b>record</b> on extended transcontinental U.S. services. ETOPS certification for 757s equipped with PW2000 series engines was granted in 1992.|$|E

500|$|... "Miss Alli" [...] from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an [...] "A–" [...] rating. Dan Phillips of IGN named [...] "Dwight's First Day Late" [...] as the tenth {{greatest}} prank on the show. He noted, [...] "Seeing a disheveled, unshaven Dwight run desperately towards {{the office in}} hopes of saving his perfect <b>performance</b> <b>record</b> was enough to land this prank on the list despite its lack of complexity." [...] Diane Holloway of the Austin American-Statesman wrote positively of the episode, and cited it {{as an example of}} how The Office, along with My Name is Earl, has [...] "restored the comedy hour to NBC". Michael Sciannamea of Huffpost TV wrote that he [...] "liked the idea of having a continuation of a storyline" [...] from [...] "The Client", but that the subplot of Dwight mistaking a Thursday for a Friday [...] "really didn't go anywhere." [...] He also noted that [...] "Dwight's behavior was over the top again", a fact which [...] "can really be disconcerting." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon named the entry the ninth best episode of the series, [...] praising the comedic confrontation between Michael and Jan, as well as being a [...] "strong Dwight episode". Furthermore, Seitz praised the cold opening, calling it [...] "a classic Jim prank".|$|E
500|$|Schwarzkopf was {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel and ordered to a second tour in Vietnam, leaving in June 1969. He was assigned as executive officer to {{the chief of staff}} at MACV headquarters, based at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon. Schwarzkopf later recalled this second tour of duty was very different from his first; there were 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam, the Vietnamization strategy was in effect, and recent events such as the Tet Offensive and My Lai Massacre put troops under increased political scrutiny. In December 1969 he gained his first field command, taking over the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry, 198th Infantry Brigade at Chu Lai. He later said these troops were initially demoralized and in poor condition, racked with rampant drug use and disciplinary problems as well as a lack of support from home. Despite the brigade's otherwise controversial <b>performance</b> <b>record,</b> Schwarzkopf was quickly regarded as one of its best combat commanders. He aggressively stepped up patrols and operations to counter Viet Cong infiltration in the battalion's sector. He developed his leadership attitudes during this command. Fellow commander Hal Moore later wrote that during his time in Vietnam Schwarzkopf acquired his well-known temper, while arguing via radio for passing American helicopters to land and pick up his wounded men. He also showed a preference of leading from the front and prided himself on avoiding the rear areas, which he called a [...] "cesspool".|$|E
2500|$|To {{perpetuate}} {{any given}} breed, some male horses must remain capable of reproduction. [...] Thus, animals {{considered to be}} the finest representatives are kept as stallions and used for mating. [...] Though the criteria used can be, in some places, rather subjective, a stallion should have a superior appearance, or phenotype; a superior pedigree, or genotype, and, ideally, a successful <b>performance</b> <b>record</b> in the area of specialty for that particular breed.|$|E

Tensing conducted an independent investigation of the incident, was described as being unhappy with the Cincinnati Police Department's handling of the case, and was noted for his aggressive attitude at the time. As a result of his investigation, the case against other combatants was dismissed.
