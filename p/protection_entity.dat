By {{carrying}} a portable mobile device with us all the time we are already living in partial Pervasive Computing Environment (PCE) that is waiting to be exploited very soon. One of the advantages of pervasive computing is that it strongly supports the deployment of Location-Based Service(s) (LBSs). In PCE, there would be many competitive service providers (SPs) trying to sell di#erent or similar LBSs to users. In order to avail a particular service, it becomes very di#cult for a low-computing and resourcepoor mobile device to handle many such SPs at a time, and to identify and securely communicate with only genuine ones. Our paper establishes a convincing trust model through which secure job delegation is accomplished. Secure Job delegation and cost e#ective cryptographic techniques largely help in reducing the burden on the mobile device to securely communicate with trusted SPs. Our protocol also provides users privacy protection, replay <b>protection,</b> <b>entity</b> authentication, and message authentication, integrity, and confidentiality. This paper explains our protocol by suggesting one of the LBSs namely "Secure Automated Taxi Calling Service"...|$|E

40|$|Notwithstanding {{the absence}} of {{explicit}} constitutional protections for corporations within the organic documents of the United States, the Supreme Court has extended constitutional <b>protections</b> to corporate <b>entities</b> {{in a variety of}} contexts.

Thus, the Court’s extant jurisprudence provides no framework for explaining the panoply of existing corporate constitutional rights, distinguishing extended constitutional rights from those which corporations cannot exercise, or prospectively adjudicating the extension of constitutional rights to incorporated entities. Drawing on both the Court’s jurisprudence as well as existing scholarship in the area, this Article argues a unifying framework can be achieved by tempering the three dominant theoretical conceptions of corporate existence, combining the resulting composite with agency-based contract principles, and then subjecting the yield to both a textual limitation and a functional limitation...|$|R

40|$|This study explores Security Sector Reform as {{a concept}} to address peace {{building}} or post-conflict reconstruction in a country attaining independence or emerging from a major conflict {{as in the case}} of South Sudan. Although various descriptions for a security sector exist, it is a common term applied to refer to structures, institutions, and personnel who are responsible for managing, providing, and overseeing security within a state. In general it refers to the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, national intelligence agencies, border control agencies, and civil <b>protection</b> <b>entities.</b> SSR refers to actions aimed at strengthening legitimate institutions and governance to provide citizens security, justice, and jobs which is crucial to break the cycle of violence. SSR is also conceptualised within the enlarged definition of security which includes human security. This emphasises the approach that SSR is not only restricted to defence and the role of law and order, but is also included in wider political, economic, and social issues. Within the concept of SSR, various prerequisites are stated for the effective execution of SSR within a state. For an analysis of effective SSR in South Sudan, the following aspects were identified to apply as a theoretical model to analyse the execution of SSR in South Sudan. These aspects were the necessity of a formalised peace agreement; the execution of a clear and effective DDR programme; the importance of foreign involvement and international military involvement; the importance of the institutionalisation of security sector structures, and civil oversight. The study concludes that certain aspects of the SSR plan contributed to peace building and post-conflict reconstruction such as certain provisions of the peace agreement, the involvement of the international community, and financial support. However, SSR in South Sudan mainly failed due to a failure of the DDR process, the inability of the international involvement to address outstanding security issues, a failure to address border demarcations, and a total failure to install effective security sectors and civil oversight mechanisms over the military. The study on the other hand suggests SSR {{as a concept}} for post-conflict reconstruction, specifically within a state acquiring independence such as South Sudan, should be viewed as a workable concept. As a model to address peace building or post-conflict reconstruction, SSR can indeed be effective. It provides for a wide spectrum of measures to address security, political, and economic disparities within a state emerging from a conflict and aspiring to democratise as a new state such {{as in the case of}} South Sudan. The failure of the SSR concept in South Sudan is not ascribed to an insufficient SSR process or plan, but due to the non-adherence of the provisions of the plan by the signatories of the plan and the socioeconomic, ethnic, and security challenges in independent South Sudan that would have complicated any SSR attempt. SSR as a concept can be applied for peacebuilding if certain conditions such as enforced DDR, commitment by international role players, the enforcement of provisions of the peace agreement, and effective measures to institute the de-politisation of the military are provided.

30|$|One of {{the most}} widely {{prevailing}} applications for microsphere use is as a drug delivery vehicle. By specifically selecting biocompatible materials, tailoring the physical structure (i.e. inclusion of interconnected pores for example) and selecting a convenient method of drug incorporation (e.g. incorporation during or after synthesis/fabrication), it is possible to control the rate of drug release. In particular, microspheres are hugely advantageous for encapsulation of fragile drugs such as nucleic acids and proteins (Berkland et al. 2004; Kim and Pack 2006; Xia et al. 2013) by providing <b>protection</b> for biological <b>entities</b> that would otherwise be rapidly destroyed by the body. Other applications have included use of microspheres as controlled release vehicles for vaccines, since their spherical shapes are ideal for take up by antigen-presenting cells.

An important role in environmental protection is played by the European Union, which is placing particularly emphasis on systematic approaches so as to prevent devastation of the environment. Wi thin the framework of environmental <b>protection,</b> entrepreneurial <b>entities</b> (not only) in the Czech Republic utilize statutory and voluntary environmental tools. Implementation of one of the voluntary environmental tools – e nvironmental m anagement a ccounting (EMA) – has become an important part of internal cost management. EMA is a very important environmental policy tool. Its application leads to reducing the negative impacts of an enterprise’s activities on the environment, to increasing the efficiency in th e utilization of production inputs and to improving the enterprise’s economic management. A great advantage of EMA lies in its versatility; it can be, therefore, used in large, medium - sized and small enterprises, in various industries as well as in the ser vice sector. EMA makes it possible to accurately establish what part of the total costs is related to environmental issues. In management accounting, environmental costs are hidden as a part of overhead costs. Their correct identification is important for the purpose of costing with respect to individual products. Questionnaire responses were used to examine whether enterprises utilize internal accounting and whether they monitor environmental costs within the framework of their internal accounting. A ccepta nce environmental costs was analysed on the basis of a division of the enterprises from the following points of view: ownership of the enterprise, the number of employees and the field of business...|$|R

There are obvious ties between the sheltering and <b>protection</b> of <b>entities,</b> {{but there are other}} complex relationships such as the translation of form from 2 D flat materials into built 3 D forms, that offer a great richness to architecture - especially in today’s age of computer aided design, drawing, and construction practices. Pattern making is a simple methodology (adopted from clothing design and construction), which allows one to design, manipulate, and adapt certain ideas by an iterative process. A pattern is easily constructed, modified and re-modified time and time again, providing a designer with a 'collection' of pieces from a specific range. As an architect uses a site (plan or model) to investigate the options and design possibilities latent in a place, the clothing designer has their mannequin. This project adopts this use of a 'mannequin' as a formal type of scaffolding, around which surfaces are distorted and manipulated through an iterative process, to see the possible solutions that this discipline can offer an architectural problem. In this scenario, the site is a place of industrial ruins - a deteriorating 1900 's meat works factory {{at the head of the}} Whangarei Harbour. The ruins provide rich skeletal formwork, in which an architectural intervention is readily accepted.
