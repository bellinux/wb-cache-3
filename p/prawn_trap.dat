40|$|In 1999 trap {{fishermen}} {{and environmental groups}} testified at a Fish and Game Commission (Commission) meeting that {{they were concerned about}} high levels of bycatch in the spot prawn trawl fishery. Environmental representatives requested that the Commission consider adopting regulations that would phase out the spot prawn trawl fishery by 2004 and convert spot prawn trawl permits to spot <b>prawn</b> <b>trap</b> permits. Also in 1999 the Department reported to the Commission the results of six observed spot prawn trawl tows in March 1999, including the ratio of weight of finfish bycatch to weight of spot prawns (7. 4 to 1). Based primarily on the above factors, the Commission initially directed the Department to develop, as part of a package of regulatory proposals for the spot <b>prawn</b> <b>trap</b> and trawl fisheries, a proposal to phase out the spot prawn trawl fishery and convert trawl permits to trap permits. Subsequently the Department recommended that, instead of phasing out the spot prawn trawl fishery, information on the relative amount and type of bycatch in the trawl and trap fisheries be determined through an on-board observer program. An observer fee structure was proposed and adopted, and an observer program was in effect for all vessels landing spot prawns from July 14, 2000 to March 31, 2001. Vessels were required to purchase and possess a spot prawn observer fee permit in order to take and land spot prawns. Funds from the program were used to support on board observers and to digitize and analyze the data. Some fishing trips were observed after the requirement for the observer fee had expired. A total of 86 spot prawn trawl tows (71 from northern California-based vessels and 15 from southern California- based vessels) was observed on nine vessels during the period September 26, 2000 to September 19, 2001. Observed vessels fished from the ports of Fort Bragg, San Francisco, Monterey, Morro Bay, and Ventura. For northern California trawl vessels, the top five finfish species observed in the bycatch, in decreasing frequency of occurrence, were Pacific hake (whiting), Dover sole, sablefish, English sole, and splitnose rockfish, comprising 53. 9...|$|E
40|$|Spot prawns {{may only}} be taken by trawl nets for {{commercial}} purposes pursuant to subsection 120. 3 (g) of these regulations, or by traps, pursuant to sections 180, 180. 2, 180. 5 and this section. (a) No trap {{may be used to}} take spot prawns from November 1 through January 31, between a line drawn due west from Point Arguello, Santa Barbara County and the United States [...] Mexico boundary. No trap may be used to take spot prawns from May 1 through July 31 between a line drawn due west from Point Arguello, Santa Barbara County, and the California-Oregon boundary. (1) Spot prawn traps may be set and baited no earlier than 0600 hours (6 : 00 a. m.) on January 31 in waters south of a line drawn due west from Point Arguello, and no earlier than 0600 hours (6 : 00 a. m.) on July 31 in waters north of a line drawn due west from Point Arguello. (2) In areas in which the season closure begins November 1, all traps must be removed from the water prior to November 1, weather and sea conditions permitting. In areas in which the season closure begins May 1, all traps must be removed from the water prior to May 1, weather and sea conditions permitting. In the event that a permittee is unable to comply with this subdivision, then that person must notify the nearest department office via telephone or FAX and certified mail not later than 1600 hours (4 : 00 p. m.) on November 1 or May 1, whichever is applicable, stating the reason for the delay and the anticipated date of trap removal. Notification does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for complying with this subdivision unless approved by the department. (3) All spot prawns taken in any trap during the closed season shall be immediately returned to the water and no spot prawn may be possessed aboard, or landed from, any vessel operating under authority of a spot <b>prawn</b> <b>trap</b> permit in any area during the closed season in that area. (b) All spot prawn traps shall be made of plastic or wire mesh with a minimum inside measurement of 7 / 8 inch by 7 / 8 inch, such that a 7 / 8 inch square peg passes through the mesh without stretching the mesh.

40|$|Understanding how {{fishing gear}} catches target species is an {{important}} part of understanding the impacts of commercial fishing. Here, we use underwater video to investigate the catch dynamics of spot <b>prawn</b> (Pandalus platyceros) <b>traps,</b> a fishing gear used in a large commercial fishery in British Columbia, Canada. We report, for the first time, interactions that occur as <b>prawns</b> accumulate in <b>traps</b> during the first eight hours of trap deployment at depths between 75 and 100 m, and test whether catchability of prawns depends on the density of prawns in and around traps. We found that prawn catchability decreased as the number of <b>prawns</b> in the <b>trap</b> increased. This process was driven by a diminishing proportion of approaching prawns that made entry attempts, as well as a reduced likelihood of entry attempts being successful as <b>traps</b> filled with <b>prawns.</b> Very few <b>prawns</b> exited <b>traps</b> during observations, but final catch rates demonstrated that exits must have occurred after the termination of our videos. Recording and examining the full 24 hours of a typical soak would clarify how trap saturation is achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{commercial}} fishing extend far beyond direct effects on targeted species. As much as 40 % of global marine catch {{is attributable to}} bycatch, or the capture of non-target organisms which occurs during fishing. The amount of bycatch in a fishery is determined {{in part by the}} selectivity of the industry’s fishing gear, and bycatch mitigation often focuses on improving the selectivity of these gears. This thesis explores bycatch mitigation through the design and evaluation of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), or fishing gear modifications aimed specifically at reducing non-target catch while maintaining the catch of target species. I examine BRDs using a three-pronged assessment, which tests a modified gear’s effects on non-target catch, on target catch, and on practicality for use in commercial fisheries (all relative to unmodified gear). I first perform a global-scale meta-analysis on technologies designed to protect elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) from longline fisheries. I show that most technologies are broadly ineffective at reducing elasmobranch bycatch, and that many studies fail to adequately assess novel BRDs across all three dimensions of gear performance. The remainder of my thesis focuses on the research and development of BRDs for a British Columbia fishery which employs trapping gear to capture spot prawns (Pandalus platyceros). Using data from fishery-independent surveys, I show that these traps catch rockfish (Sebastes spp.) as bycatch, a multi-species genus which is depleted due to overfishing and which suffers high discard mortality due to barotrauma incurred during the fishing process. I demonstrate that a novel underwater camera system can be used to study <b>prawn</b> <b>traps</b> in situ, and use insights from this analysis to inform the design of BRDs for <b>prawn</b> <b>traps.</b> I conclude my thesis with an assessment of BRDs of my own design, using both catch data and in situ observations conducted using my underwater camera apparatus. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the challenges in designing effective BRDs, and provides a framework for assessment that {{can be used as a}} template in future studies of fishing gear design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Canada’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans {{seeks to}} manage British Columbia’s prawn fishery by {{limiting}} the season length, vessel entry, {{and the number of}} <b>prawn</b> <b>traps</b> per vessel. However, fishers can still adjust their effort by increasing the number of trap lifts during the season. This study examines the effect of trap soak-time on size-selectivity, looks at how it translates to by-kill, and reviews the traditional management responses. The management recommendations in this paper focus on optimizing the interaction between CPUE, by-kill, enforcement costs, and fisher responses. Peer’s law (the solution to a problem changes the problem) predicts that trying to solve a fishery common-property resource problem only changes the problem’s expression. Thus, limiting entry changes a too-many-fishers issue to a capital-stuffing problem, limiting gear changes a capital-stuffing problem to a gear-use issue, and regulating gear use leads to other problems and ever more micro-management. Thus, regulation and related costs have become part of the problem of rent dissipation and poverty in fishery dependent communities. Efforts to fine-tune regulations in BC’s prawn fishery have led to an ever expanding spiral of costly, clumsy, and intrusive regulations, enforcement, and related procedures that dissipate resource rents, frustrate fishers, and ultimately are ineffective in protecting the resource and/or the associated jobs. The best way out of this morass appears to be for managers of sedentary species to confine their efforts to macro-management regulations that focus on limiting the consequences of fishing and ensuring that individual fishers endure the consequences of their actions...|$|R
50|$|Selective {{harvest of}} large prawns by seining {{during a period}} of four to six weeks prior to final harvest has been practiced with the intent of {{increasing}} total yield from a pond during a growing season. Selection of the mesh size of the seine (one to two inches) will be dependent upon the desired harvest size of the prawn. Selective harvest may also be accomplished with properly designed <b>traps.</b> <b>Prawns</b> have been <b>trapped</b> using a wide array of traps traditionally designed for the harvest of crayfish. The reduction in population density caused by a partial seine or trap harvest results in an increase in the growth rate of the smaller prawns that remain. Through selective harvest, a freshly harvested product is available {{over a longer period of}} time. Insufficient research has been performed to determine conclusively whether a selective harvest practice is cost effective relative to a traditional, single bulk harvest at the conclusion of the growing season.Now we are host a website, which helps to collect all the details about our chellanam village.|$|R
