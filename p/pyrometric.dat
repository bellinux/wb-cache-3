50|$|The {{bottle oven}} kiln is {{protected}} by an outer hovel, which helps to create an updraught. The biscuit kiln was filled with clay sealed saggars of green (un-fired) flatwares (bedded in flint) by placers. The doors (clammins) were bricked up and the firing began. Each firing took 14 tons of coal. Fires were lit in the firemouths and baited every four hours, flames rose up inside the kilns, heat passed between the bungs of saggars. They controlled {{the temperature of the}} firing using dampers in the crown. The temperature was gauged by watching the contraction of bullers rings (a <b>pyrometric</b> device placed in the kiln). A kiln would be fired to 1250C.|$|E
50|$|Kilns are an {{essential}} part of the manufacture of all ceramics. Ceramics require heat at high temperatures so chemical and physical reactions will occur to permanently alter the unfired body. In the case of pottery, clay materials are shaped, dried and then fired in a kiln. The final characteristics are determined by the composition and preparation of the clay body, by the temperature at which it is fired. After a first firing glazes may be used and the ware is fired a second time to fuse the glaze into the body. A third firing at a lower temperature may be required to fix overglaze decoration. Modern kilns often have sophisticated electrical control systems to firing regime, although <b>pyrometric</b> devices are often also used.|$|E

[...] This new form sold extremely well across Europe. In 1766, Wedgwood bought Etruria, a large Staffordshire estate, as both a home and factory site. Wedgwood developed a number of further industrial innovations for his company, notably a way of measuring kiln temperatures accurately and the new ware types Black Basalt and Jasper Ware.Wedgwood's best known product is jasperware created to look like ancient cameo glass. It was inspired by the Portland Vase, a Roman vessel which is now a museum piece. The first jasperware color was Portland Blue, an innovation that required experiments with more than 3,000 samples. In recognition of the importance of his <b>pyrometric</b> beads (pyrometer), Josiah Wedgwood was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1783.

Within a year at Calcutta, he was sent by his superior, the eminent orientalist Horace Hayman Wilson, to work as assay master at the Benares mint. He stayed at Benares until the closure of that mint in 1830. He then moved back to Calcutta as deputy assay master and when Wilson resigned in 1832, he was made assay master (overruling Wilson's nominee for that position, James Atkinson) at the new silver mint designed in Greek revival style by Major W. N. Forbes. He married Harriet Sophia Aubert, elder daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Jeremiah Aubert (grandson of Alexander Aubert) of the Bengal army and his wife Hannah, at the cathedral in Calcutta on 25 April 1835. They had a daughter Eliza in 1837 who {{was to be the}} only child to survive.His work as assay master led him to conduct many scientific studies. He worked on means for measuring high temperatures in furnaces accurately. The publication of his technique in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1828 led to his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society. He suggested the possibility of visual <b>pyrometric</b> measurement using a calibrated series of mica plates as well as using the thermal expansion of platinum but considered that a practical approach was to use calibrated combinations of platinum, gold and silver alloys placed in a cupel or crucible and observe their melting. He also described a pyrometer that measured the expansion of a small amount of air held within a gold bulb. In 1833 he called for reforms to Indian weights and measures and advocated a uniform coinage based on the new silver rupee of the East India Company. He also devised a balance so delicate as to measure three-thousandth of a grain (≈0.19 mg).|$|E

40|$|The surface {{temperature}} distribution of high temperature solar materials {{is a key}} parameter in concentrating solar thermal applications.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} integration and miniaturisation of microelectronic circuits laser radiation is a suitable tool for joining in microfabrication, which has the advantages of a controlled local limited heat input, reduced thermal and mechanical stress compared to conventional techniques. Today Laser Beam Soldering (LBS) is a non-standard manufacturing process for electronic packaging and interconnection technology, {{because of the high}} investment and the unsophisticated technology. To establish LBS as a widespread technology for industrial applications it is necessary to obtain a highly stable and reproducible joining process with respect to quality assurance considerations. For this reason we conducted experiments with the aim to acquire basic knowledge of the physical and technological phenomena. Moreover we developed a sensor which enables us to detect signals from characteristic process stages related to LBS. Previous work applying acoustical or optical sensors showed that only the solid liquid phase transition of the solder alloy could be identified. However this single feature is not enough to optimize the process parameters or to control the heat deposition for a reproducible process and high quality joints. To obtain more significant process stages we examined secondary emissions from the beam solid interaction area with a <b>pyrometric</b> sensor. The intention of our experiments was to correlate the recorded <b>pyrometric</b> signals of process emissions with the processes sequencing in the interaction zone. Consequently we performed parallel recordings of <b>pyrometric</b> signals and high speed photography. As a result we could identify different process sequences, well known from reflow soldering, in the <b>pyrometric</b> signal, for example activation and evaporation of the flux, melting of the solder alloy and wetting of the devices. The knowledge about the temporal stages of the LBS process was used in further experiments to optimize the process parameters with respect to soldering time and high solder joint quality. Basing on the developed <b>pyrometric</b> sensor and the results of our measurements {{it will be possible to}} implement a closed loop control to increase the stability and the reproducibility of the LBS process...|$|E

40|$|Both thermovision and <b>pyrometric</b> {{measuring}} {{are widely}} used for the control of industrial process thermo modes, the technical service and diagnostics of equipment {{as well as the}} works on security and safety provision. The objective of thermovision measuring is the visualization and research of an object thermo field on the basis of temperature gradient identification at defined temperature sensitivity. The main purpose of <b>pyrometric</b> measuring is the identification of temperature values in certain object points with certain accuracy. Nowadays, it is expediently to solve the complex task based on both methods advantages ’ unification in many technological processes: identification of object thermo field point temperature values with the needed accuracy. For this purpose it is necessary to integrate the methods of thermography and pyrometry on the basis of usage of these methods ’ advantages as well as common disadvantages ’ correction. Both thermovision and <b>pyrometric</b> measuring are tightly connected between themselves. When different tasks are available, they are based on common laws, have similar principles of measuring system construction, and moreover, they have common problems. Along with small values of measuring means, reaching (0, 1 ÷ 1, 0) % [1], and their high temperature sensitivity, up to (0, 5 ÷ 1, 0) °К [1, 2], the uncertainty of measurement results can make hundreds of degrees. The low accuracy of temperature identification as a result of non-adequacy of the accepted mathematical model of a temperature measurement object due to eradiation and real physical phenomena belongs to shared disadvantages.
