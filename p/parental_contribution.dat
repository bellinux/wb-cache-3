40|$|In 2009 Rwanda {{introduced}} 9 Years Basic Education (9 YBE) {{and progress}} on access to primary education {{in recent years}} has been highly impressive. However, the challenges still faced by the Rwandan education system remain significant. These include the need to ensure adequate funding, improvements in quality and ensuring great equity. One key part of responding to these challenges requires an efficient and fair school funding system. School funding comes from either public or private sources – for example, <b>parental</b> <b>contributions.</b> These <b>parental</b> <b>contributions</b> can either be for indirect costs of schooling, such uniforms, or for direct costs in the form of financial payments to schools. This research assesses the impact on school funding of the direct financial <b>parental</b> <b>contributions</b> in two contrasting Rwandan Districts – one in a relatively better off urban area and one in a poorer rural area. It demonstrates a clear difference between the two areas. In the wealthier area, <b>parental</b> <b>contributions</b> more than double schools' non-salary spending. In contrast, in the rural area, voluntary <b>parental</b> <b>contributions</b> have a marginal impact on school budgets. These findings raise issues about both equity of funding and whether the Rwandan school system is helping to achieve greater equality of opportunity. The research suggests that schools with pupils with more need are actually worse funded than schools with pupils with less need. This acts against achieving greater equality of opportunity. It is important that the issue of school illegally turning pupils away because their parents do not make a financial contribution – something for which we find some evidence – is addressed. However, more fundamentally, the Rwandan government should develop a more targeted state funding system, with more funding being allocated to schools which have the highest levels of need and least ability to attract additional <b>parental</b> <b>contributions.</b> Africa Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDefining the {{contributions}} and interactions of paternal and maternal genomes during embryo development {{is critical to}} understand the fundamental processes involved in hybrid vigor, hybrid sterility, and reproductive isolation. To determine the <b>parental</b> <b>contributions</b> and their regulation during Arabidopsis embryogenesis, we combined deep-sequencing-based RNA profiling and genetic analyses. At the 2 - 4 cell stage there is a strong, genome-wide dominance of maternal transcripts, although transcripts are contributed by both parental genomes. At the globular stage the relative paternal contribution is higher, largely due to a gradual activation of the paternal genome. We identified two antagonistic maternal pathways that control these <b>parental</b> <b>contributions.</b> Paternal alleles are initially downregulated by the chromatin siRNA pathway, linked to DNA and histone methylation, whereas transcriptional activation requires maternal activity of the histone chaperone complex CAF 1. Our results define maternal epigenetic pathways controlling the <b>parental</b> <b>contributions</b> in plant embryos, which are distinct from those regulating genomic imprinting...|$|R
40|$|The {{expectation}} of the <b>parental</b> genome <b>contribution</b> to inbred lines derived from biparental crosses or backcrosses is well known, but no theoretical results exist for its variance. Our {{objective was to}} derive the variance of the <b>parental</b> genome <b>contribution</b> to inbred lines developed by the single-seed descent or double haploid method from biparental crosses or backcrosses. We derived formulas and tabulated results for the variance of the <b>parental</b> genome <b>contribution</b> depending on the chromosome lengths and the mating scheme used for inbred line development. A normal approximation of the probability distribution function of the <b>parental</b> genome <b>contribution</b> fitted well the exact distribution obtained from computer simulations. We determined upper and lower quantiles of the <b>parental</b> genome <b>contribution</b> for model genomes of sugar beet, maize, and wheat using normal approximations. These can be employed to detect essentially derived varieties {{in the context of}} plant variety protection. Furthermore, we outlined the application of our results to predict the response to selection.

50|$|It is {{believed}} that bi-parental care had {{an important role in}} the evolution of monogamy. Because mammalian females undergo periods of gestation and lactation, they are well adapted to take care of their young for a long period of time, as opposed to their male partners who do not necessarily contribute to this rearing process. Such differences in <b>parental</b> <b>contribution</b> could be a result of the male's drive to seek other females in order to increase their reproductive success, which may prevent them from spending extra time helping raise their offspring. Helping a female in young rearing could potentially jeopardize a male’s fitness and result in the loss of mating opportunities. There are some monogamous species that exhibit this type of care mainly to improve their offspring’s survivorship; however it does not occur in more than 5% of all mammals.|$|E

The study revealed that, parental income affects <b>parental</b> <b>contribution</b> to school fund. The results showed that many parents either did not contribute all or contributed little because of their low income. The study also found that majority of parents was not satisfied with the system of contributing fees to schools though their dissatisfaction did not affect their contribution to school fund. Furthermore, the study found that parents were not involved in the school budgeting process, but this also does not affect their contributions to school fund. The study also found that, the announcement ‘education is free’ by the government did not cause low <b>parental</b> <b>contribution</b> to school fund. However, the study further found that some parents considered the school contribution as not compulsory, and therefore they were not obligated to contribute. The study recommended that government should provide support to parents to improve their economic activities, especially farming and fishing to increase their income. It also recommended that more education should be provided to reduce misconceptions towards fund contribution among many parents. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} impact of the parental contribution—introduced during the welfare reform of 1989 —on rates of {{participation}} in social assistance. From a statistical perspective, this reform allows us to identify a control group comprising single individuals aged 30 and older. Our study groups consist of single persons under 30 subdivided into several age groups. Our empirical approach is based on “difference- in-difference” estimators often applied to natural experiments. This methodology can be generalized to account for other variables which may have differential impacts on the participation rates of the study and the control groups. Our results indicate that the <b>parental</b> <b>contribution</b> reduces the mean participation rate of the 20 and younger cohort by 19. 4 %. This impact falls to 12. 1 % for 21 year olds, and becomes insignificant for the over 21 group.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} debate about a reform of the Dutch system of student support, in which grants will be (partly) replaced by loans. The discussion focuses on the effects on student enrollment decisions. Surprisingly, no study has yet analysed the effect of receiving a grant on <b>parental</b> <b>contribution.</b> Parents may decrease their contribution when their child receives a grant, in which case subsidies meant for the students unintentionally {{end up with the}} parents. Understanding the corresponding parental behaviour will contribute to a more in-depth discussion on the financial aid system. This paper focuses on the effect of the supplementary grant on the <b>parental</b> <b>contribution</b> in the Netherlands. The supplementary grant is meant to support students from disadvantaged families. Parents from students with the supplementary grant have less disposable income, which probably implies a lower contribution. Our identification strategy separates this income effect from the effect due to the payments of the supplementary grant. The results suggest substantial substitution. Each additional euro spent on supplementary grant reduces the <b>parental</b> <b>contribution</b> with approximately 20 - 60 cents. A broad range of sensitivity analyses support our main estimation results. Nevertheless, some caution in interpreting the results is needed because of data limitations. ...|$|E

We present results on spawning patterns during one entire reproductive season of wild Common sole, Solea solea, kept in two broodstock groups (28 animals in broodstock A; 20 animals in broodstock B) under semi-natural conditions. Batches of eggs were collected daily and incubated separately. First, we performed a parentage analysis on parents and samples of 24 newly hatched larvae from all batches, using 10 polymorphic microsatellite markers. As expected, contribution of parents to offspring was highly skewed. In both broodstocks, five or less parental pairs produced {{more than half of}} the total progeny. Natural spawning and unequal contributions of parents to offspring resulted in significant deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibria. Furthermore, few alleles were lost and levels of heterozygosity in offspring population increased. Next, we calculated relatedness between parents that mated successfully based on estimates of molecular similarity. Mean coefficients of coancestry in offspring were determined using <b>parental</b> relatedness and <b>contributions.</b> Levels of coancestry in progeny were substantially high. These results show that due to different <b>parental</b> <b>contributions,</b> natural mating in groups can result in significant inbreeding in future generations despite of limited loss of alleles and high levels of heterozygosity in first generation progeny. This shows that using loss of alleles and levels of heterozygosity alone can be misleading for estimation of genetic diversity...|$|R
