5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} {{located at the}} sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera).</b>|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera.</b> The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E
25|$|Many camerae obscurae use a lens {{rather than}} a pinhole (as in a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera)</b> because it allows a larger aperture, giving a usable {{brightness}} while maintaining focus.|$|E

25|$|Photography is {{the result}} of {{combining}} several technical discoveries. Long before the first photographs were made, ancient Han Chinese philosopher Mo Di from the Mohist School of Logic was the first to discover and develop the scientific principles of optics, camera obscura, and <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera.</b> Later Greek mathematicians Aristotle and Euclid also independently described a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera</b> in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. In the 6th century CE, Byzantine mathematician Anthemius of Tralles used a type of camera obscura in his experiments. Both the Han Chinese polymath Shen Kuo (1031–95) and Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) (965–1040) independently invented the camera obscura and <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera,</b> Albertus Magnus (1193–1280) discovered silver nitrate, and Georg Fabricius (1516–71) discovered silver chloride. Shen Kuo explains the science of camera obscura and optical physics in his scientific work Dream Pool Essays while the techniques described in Ibn al-Haytham's Book of Optics are capable of producing primitive photographs using medieval materials.|$|E
25|$|The first X-ray {{telescope}} in astronomy {{was used to}} observe the Sun. The first X-ray picture (taken with a grazing incidence telescope) of the Sun was taken in 1963, by a rocket-borne telescope. On April 19, 1960 the very first X-ray image of the sun was taken using a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera</b> on an Aerobee-Hi rocket.|$|E
25|$|Projection is {{not limited}} to {{perspective}} projections, such as those resulting from casting a shadow on a screen, or the rectilinear image produced by a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera</b> on a flat film plate. Rather, any mathematical function transforming coordinates from the curved surface to the plane is a projection. Few projections in actual use are perspective.|$|E
50|$|In the following, it {{is assumed}} that {{triangulation}} is made on corresponding image points from two views generated by <b>pinhole</b> <b>cameras.</b> Generalization from these assumptions are discussed here.|$|R
50|$|In June 2013, her Bowness {{home was}} {{submerged}} when the Bow River flooded. She lost {{her collection of}} homemade <b>pinhole</b> <b>cameras,</b> her darkroom and studio as well as hundreds of printed images.|$|R
50|$|A non-focusing coded-aperture {{optical system}} may {{be thought of as}} {{multiple}} <b>pinhole</b> <b>cameras</b> in conjunction. By adding pinholes, light throughput and thus sensitivity are increased. However, multiple images are formed, usually requiring computer deconvolution.|$|R
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the camera obscura that provides {{an image of a}} scene dates back to ancient China. Leonardo da Vinci mentions natural camera obscura that are formed by dark caves {{on the edge of a}} sunlit valley. A hole in the cave wall will act as a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera</b> and project a laterally reversed, upside down image on a piece of paper. So the birth of photography was primarily concerned with inventing means to capture and keep the image produced by the camera obscura.|$|E
25|$|The cathedral has a {{heliometer}} (solar observatory) {{dating to}} 1690, {{one of a}} number built in Italy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera,</b> projecting an image of the sun onto the floor at solar noon (12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer). There is a bronze line, la Meridiana, on the floor, running precisely north–south. The ends of the line mark the positions as at the summer and winter solstices; signs of the zodiac show the various other dates throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, an {{abandoned}} F-18 hangar in Irvine California was sealed to create, in effect, a giant <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera,</b> and a panoramic {{print of the}} El Toro Air Station was formed on a light-sensitive muslin cloth measuring 111 feet wide, 32 feet high. Under the direction of Laguna Beach photographer Jacques Garnier, the image, known as “The Great Picture”, was originally produced {{as part of the}} Legacy Project - a photographic and historical record of the base before being transformed into what is now the Orange County Great Park. This {{is believed to be the}} largest photographic image ever taken by a camera.|$|E

50|$|The All-sky monitor (ASM) was two {{one-dimensional}} <b>pinhole</b> <b>cameras</b> scanned {{most of the}} sky every spacecraft revolution. The {{angular resolution}} was 10 x 10°, with an effective area of abbr=on 3 cm2, and a bandpass of 3-6 keV.|$|R
25|$|So far {{all points}} in the 3D world have been {{represented}} in a camera centered coordinate system, that is, a coordinate system which has its origin at the camera center (the location of the pinhole of a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera).</b> In practice however, the 3D points may be represented in terms of coordinates relative to an arbitrary coordinate system (X1',X2',X3'). Assuming that the camera coordinate axes (X1,X2,X3) and the axes (X1',X2',X3') are of Euclidean type (orthogonal and isotropic), there is a unique Euclidean 3D transformation (rotation and translation) between the two coordinate systems. In other words, the camera is not necessarily at the origin looking along the z axis.|$|E
25|$|The facial pit {{actually}} visualizes {{thermal radiation}} {{using the same}} optical principles as a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera,</b> wherein {{the location of a}} source of thermal radiation is determined by the location of the radiation on the membrane of the heat pit. However, studies that have visualized the thermal images seen by the facial pit using computer analysis have suggested that the resolution is actually extremely poor. The size of the opening of the pit results in poor resolution of small, warm objects, and coupled with the pit's small size and subsequent poor heat conduction, the image produced is of extremely low resolution and contrast. It is known that some focusing and sharpening of the image occurs in the lateral descending trigeminal tract, and {{it is possible that the}} visual and infrared integration that occurs in the tectum may also be used to help sharpen the image. In addition, snakes may deliberately choose ambush sites with low thermal background radiation (colder areas) to maximize the contrast of their warm prey in order to achieve such a high degree of accuracy from their thermal “vision”.|$|E
25|$|Snow goggles (niguak ~ niiguak dual or nigaugek dual nigauget pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, igguag in Cup'ig) is old-style snow goggles {{made out}} of wood with narrow slits, which admit only a little light. Snow goggles were carved from {{driftwood}} (esp. spruce), walrus ivory, bone or caribou antler, and sometimes made with coarse seashore grass. They always paint the inside of goggles black, so our eyes won’t be bothered by the glare and can stay wide open. goggles were created in various styles by artists from different regions, and they often resembled animals underscoring a pervasive Native theme of human-animal transformation. Some snow goggles are carved {{in the form of}} an animal mask. Arctic foxes have keen eyesight for hunting on the land and sea ice, a quality that the mask/goggles may have been intended to transfer to the person wearing them. The goggles with narrow slits not only protect the eyes from excess light, but also sharpen and focus vision, like a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera.</b> Some goggles have large eye openings and are blackened with soot inside to eliminate reflections. Snow goggles are an ancient element of Eskimo hunting cultures, appearing in archaeological sites up to 2000 years old.|$|E

Hunt said his intention was to [...] "move fast and push it along the whole time, while giving it a certain style", and added that the fast pacing would help audiences not notice any writing problems. As title artist Maurice Binder was creating the credits, he had an idea for the introduction that would appear in all subsequent Bond films, the James Bond gun barrel sequence. It was filmed in sepia by putting a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera</b> inside an actual [...]38 calibre gun barrel, with Bob Simmons playing Bond. Binder also designed a highly stylised main title sequence, a theme that has been repeated in the subsequent Eon-produced Bond films.

500|$|All of the Eon Bond films {{feature the}} unique gun barrel sequence, created by graphic artist Maurice Binder, {{which has been}} called by British media {{historian}} James Chapman [...] "the trademark motif of the series".

Bond wheels around and shoots directly at the gun/viewer, followed by the assassin's blood spilling down the barrel/screen. It was originally filmed in sepia by putting a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera</b> inside an actual [...]38 calibre gun barrel, with stunt man Bob Simmons playing the part of Bond. The remake of the sequence for the wide-screen Thunderball featured Connery as Bond.

[...] Using a fitting metaphor, Shen compared optical image inversion to an oarlock and waisted drum. He also discussed focal points and noted that the image in a concave mirror is inverted. Shen, who never asserted that {{he was the first to}} experiment with camera obscura, hints in his writing that camera obscura was dealt with in the Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written by Duan Chengshi (d. 863) during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), in regard to the inverted image of a Chinese pagoda by a seashore.|$|E

500|$|Pinhole camera: The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{observed}} that the spaces between the leaves of trees acted as tiny pinholes which cast {{the image of a}} partial solar eclipse onto the ground. He also used a metal plate with a small pinhole to project an image of a solar eclipse onto the ground. The ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi (c. 470 BC– c. 391 BC)—founder of Mohism during the establishment of the Hundred Schools of Thought—lived just before the time of Aristotle and it was in his Mojing (perhaps compiled by his disciples) that a <b>pinhole</b> <b>camera</b> was described. The Mojing stated that the [...] "collecting place" [...] (pinhole) was an empty hole [...] "like the sun and moon depicted on the imperial flags," [...] where an image could be inverted at an intersecting point which [...] "affects the size of the image." [...] The Mojing seems to be in line with the Epicurean theory of light traveling into the eye (and not vice versa like in Pythagoreanism), since the Mojing states that the reflected light shining forth from an [...] "illuminated person" [...] becomes inverted when passing through the pinhole, i.e. [...] "The bottom part of the man becomes the top part (of the image) and the top part of the man becomes the bottom part (of the image)." [...] In his Book of Optics (1021), Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) wrote of his experimentation with camera obscura, which was followed by Shen Kuo (1031–1095), the latter who alluded that the Tang Dynasty (618–907) author Duan Chengshi (died 863)—in his Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang—described inverted images of Chinese pagodas.|$|E
