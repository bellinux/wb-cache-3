2500|$|In 2001, church {{president}} W. Grant McMurray {{reflected on}} increasing {{questions about the}} Book of Mormon: [...] "The proper use of the Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, {{in part because of}} long-standing questions about its historicity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity." [...] In the introduction he qualified his statements: [...] "I cannot speak for each person within our community, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say some words on behalf of our community." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{keep out}} of their way, {{especially}} Snap's. Mescal, you've forgotten Silvermane, and how he can run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I've {{thought of}} that. If {{he can take}} hold, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get father to consent. Did you say Sam Barringford was going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, if you please, Grandfather Frog," [...] cried Peter. [...] "If you please. I should love dearly to {{hear about}} it. <b>Perhaps</b> then <b>I</b> <b>can</b> learn to swim." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{must not}} die! The wind, the mountains, the clear air, the good, sweet water, the {{fragrant}} pines, the splendid sun--these things must help her. [...] "And <b>I,</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>I,</b> too, <b>can</b> help her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you really?" [...] John Creedy went on. [...] "It is {{not good}} for man to live alone; he wants a helpmate. Oh, Miss Ethel, may I venture to hope that <b>perhaps,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> try to deserve you, you will be mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear this. Will you please {{tell me more about}} your {{troubles}} with the Skeezers? Then <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{a glimpse}} of a large enclosure, with some big buildings. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> look at them better as I go back to Boston." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{and see me}} and <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help you. I'm very {{different}} from what I was in that phase. I've advanced a great deal since then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Miss Dora. [...] "In {{another moment}} {{she would have}} pulled me into the dirt. <b>Perhaps</b> now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make her walk up on the clean straw. Come, come," [...] she {{continued}} persuasively to the mare, which, however, obstinately declined to advance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Eighteen to-morrow,' {{replied the}} boy. 'Fifty years of it, <b>perhaps!</b> <b>I</b> know God <b>can</b> help me through with it, {{but it is}} a long time to be patient!' ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{they walked}} {{together}} this evening, Tito said--"The {{business of the}} day is not yet quite ended for me. I shall conduct you to our door, my Romola, and then I must fulfil another commission, which will take me an hour, <b>perhaps,</b> before <b>I</b> <b>can</b> return and rest, as I very much need to do." ...|$|R
60|$|CATHERINE. Oh, Paul, can't you spare Sergius {{for a few}} moments? Raina {{has hardly}} seen him yet. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help you to settle about the regiments.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{me how it}} all happened, Dick," [...] {{said the}} princess; [...] "I'm sure it's not so bad as you make out. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} of a plan. I'm stronger than you and <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get her along alone, after she recovers. Can you find the house from here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How is this?' said Linton, {{addressing}} her; 'what {{notion of}} propriety must {{you have to}} remain here, after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, <b>perhaps,</b> imagine <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{get used to it}} too!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, my dear. I {{consider}} the trapping of innocent bystanders to be--eh--er--highly reprehensible, and <b>perhaps</b> worse. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> discover what picture manager {{was guilty of}} the act, I shall--shall--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why shouldn't I, just {{to punish}} you?" [...] she demanded. [...] "There are scores {{of men who}} fancy {{themselves}} in love with me. If <b>I</b> choose, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep them all their lives hanging to the hem of my skirt, praying for a word, a touch. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make them furious one day and penitent the next--wretched always, <b>perhaps,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep them there. Why should I not treat your brother in the same way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Bert, suit yourself," [...] {{answered}} the mother. [...] "But {{if you wish}} to dance, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> introduce your friends to some of the young ladies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not just yet, Laura. It will be {{time enough}} to worry them after I have seen Mr. Wecks and Mr. Dickley. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> settle the matter myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it {{must not}} get over," [...] cried Lord John; [...] "but hold your fire to the last. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make {{something}} of the fellow. I'll chance it, anyhow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{issue no}} {{positive}} guarantee. <b>Perhaps</b> if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep {{my mind off}} it ... I have had good results {{for the last ten}} minutes by thinking steadily of the Sahara. There," [...] said Eustace Hignett with enthusiasm, [...] "is a place for you! That is something like a spot! Miles and miles of sand and not a drop of water anywhere!" ...|$|R
60|$|Carvil (Snarls). It's mine, <b>perhaps.</b> <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> help being blind? You fret {{because you}} want to be gadding about--with a {{helpless}} man left all alone at home. Your own father too.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he is not; not exactly. But <b>perhaps,</b> Mr. Mollett, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do as well. You {{have known}} me before, you know, {{and you may}} say to me openly {{anything}} {{you have to say}} to Sir Thomas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since {{we talked}} I have been thinking," [...] she said. [...] "Edward has {{let me come}} to you alone. And I feel <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> talk better to you alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on a moment, sir, if you please; I'll come {{on board}} you. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help {{you out of your}} difficulty; for I happen to know {{something}} of that ship." ...|$|E
60|$|GAYNOR. Well, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get the Society to pay {{half for}} your daughter--if you're really as hard {{up as you}} pretend. They're {{willing to do that}} where it seems necessary.|$|E
6000|$|Nares slowly {{shook his}} head. [...] "I don't think I {{have much to}} regret," [...] he said {{without a trace of}} bitterness. [...] "I was sent here to save men's souls, and it seems that I have failed. Still, I think I should have stayed and healed their bodies--had it been permitted--but there is, <b>perhaps,</b> work <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do {{elsewhere}} since that is not the case." [...] He stopped a moment with the faintest sigh. [...] "We will not mention this again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost none. Being weighty, it sinks {{downwards}} {{through the}} loose earth, and settles on the rock. I see, gentlemen, {{that you are}} strangers, and, if I mistake not, Englishmen. I am a countryman, hailing from Cornwall, and, {{if you have no}} objection, will accompany you in your inspection of the diggings. My experience may be of service to you, <b>perhaps,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> at all events guard you from the scoundrels who make a livelihood by deceiving and cheating newcomers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} won't {{have much}} money," [...] Olsen agreed. [...] "It's {{going to cost}} him all he can raise to turn Alvarez out, but he'll have something to give at the country's expense; sugar and coffee concessions, and <b>perhaps</b> monopolies. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get my share, it will pay my employers well and I allow they're generous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a loose board up there," [...] he cried, as he {{was feeling}} his way along. [...] "Hold me a little higher, Luke, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> shove it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My master Chiron," [...] replied Jason, [...] "taught me, long ago, {{the story}} of Cadmus. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> manage the quarrelsome sons of the dragon's teeth as well as Cadmus did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But there's no gentleman there," [...] {{returned}} the landlord. [...] "It's shut up--been shut up this fortnight. What gentleman {{is it you}} want? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> let {{you know where to}} find him." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{would like}} to be able to draw two swans in two minutes and a half yourselves. <b>Perhaps</b> so, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> show you how; but it will need twenty years' work all day long. First, in the meantime, you must draw them rightly, if it takes two hours instead of two minutes; and, above all, {{remember}} that they are black and white.|$|R
6000|$|... "You shan't go there; yet, wait. Yes, <b>perhaps</b> for to-night; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{do nothing}} better--worse luck! Sleep there to-night, {{and stay there}} to-morrow. Monday is the first free day I have; and on Monday morning, at ten exactly, meet me on Grey's Bridge {{just out of the}} town. I'll bring all the money <b>I</b> <b>can</b> muster. You shan't want--I'll see that, Fanny; then I'll get you a lodging somewhere. Good-bye till then. I am a brute--but good-bye!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she cried, [...] "I {{may take}} him abroad? <b>Perhaps</b> to Japan? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{go to any}} part of the world which you think best for him." [...] Her voice rang joy. Color ran into her cheeks. [...] "You have been so good to me--so patient with my own impatience. And I knew that you could save him! Something told me that first awful morning that you would help me, that you would be my friend." ...|$|R
