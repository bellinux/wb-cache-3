40|$|BACKGROUND: Estimating the {{incidence}} of medical conditions using claims data often requires constructing a <b>prevalence</b> <b>period</b> that predates an event of interest, for instance the diagnosis of cancer, to exclude those with pre-existing conditions from {{the incidence}} risk set. Those conditions missed during the <b>prevalence</b> <b>period</b> may be misclassified as incident conditions (false positives) after the event of interest. Using Medicare claims, we examined the impact of selecting shorter versus longer <b>prevalence</b> <b>periods</b> on the incidence and misclassification of 12 relatively common conditions in older persons. METHODS: The source of {{data for this study}} was the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry linked to Medicare claims. Two cohorts of women were included: 33, 731 diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2002, who had ≥ 36 months of Medicare eligibility prior to cancer, the event of interest; and 101, 649 without cancer meeting the same Medicare eligibility criterion. Cancer patients were followed from 36 months before cancer diagnosis (<b>prevalence</b> <b>period)</b> up to 3 months after diagnosis (incidence period). Non-cancer patients were followed for up to 39 months after the beginning of Medicare eligibility. A sham date was inserted after 36 months to separate the <b>prevalence</b> and incidence <b>periods.</b> Using 36 months as the gold standard, the <b>prevalence</b> <b>period</b> was then shortened in 6 -month increments to examine the impact on the number of conditions first detected during the incidence period. RESULTS: In the breast cancer cohort, shortening the <b>prevalence</b> <b>period</b> from 36 to 6 months increased the incidence rates (per 1, 000 patients) of all conditions; for example: hypertension 196 to 243; diabetes 34 to 76; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 29 to 46; osteoarthritis 27 to 36; congestive heart failure 20 to 36; osteoporosis 22 to 29; and cerebrovascular disease 13 to 21. Shortening the <b>prevalence</b> <b>period</b> has less impact on those without cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Selecting a short <b>prevalence</b> <b>period</b> to rule out pre-existing conditions can, through misclassification, substantially inflate estimates of incident conditions. In incidence studies based on Medicare claims, selecting a <b>prevalence</b> <b>period</b> of ≥ 24 months balances the need to exclude pre-existing conditions with retaining the largest possible cohort...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} {{changes in}} the spatial distribution of schistosomiasis in Mali following a decade of donor-funded control and a further 12 years without control. Methodology/Principal Findings: National pre-intervention cross-sectional schistosomiasis surveys were conducted in Mali in 1984 – 1989 (in communities) and again in 2004 – 2006 (in schools).

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The {{prevalence}} and morbidity of asthma vary greatly among different ethnic communities and geographical locations, but {{the roles of}} environmental and genetic factors are not fully understood. The differences in prevalence of adult asthma among Chinese, Malay, and Indian ethnic groups in Singapore were examined, {{and the extent to}} which these could be explained by personal and environmental factors were investigated. METHODS [...] A stratified disproportionate random sample (n = 2868) of Chinese (n = 1018), Malays (n = 967), and Indians (n = 883) of both sexes was drawn from households in five public housing estates, and an interviewer administered questionnaire was used to determine cumulative and current prevalence of "physician diagnosed asthma" (symptoms with a physician diagnosis of asthma). RESULTS [...] Lifetime cumulative prevalence (standardised to the general population) of "physician diagnosed asthma" was 4. 7 % in men and 4. 3 % in women; 12 month <b>period</b> <b>prevalences</b> were 2. 4 % and 2. 0 %, respectively. Cumulative prevalence of asthma was significantly higher in Indians (6. 6 %) and Malays (6. 0 %) than in Chinese (3. 0 %); <b>period</b> <b>prevalences</b> of asthma were 4. 5 % in Indians, 3. 3 % in Malays, and 0. 9 % in Chinese. Ownership of cats or dogs was more frequent in Malays (15. 4 %) and Indians (11. 2 %) than in Chinese (8. 8 %). Rugs and carpets were also more frequently used by Malays (52. 2 %) and Indians (40. 7 %) than by Chinese (8. 9 %). Current smoking prevalences were higher in Malays (27. 3 %) than in Indians (19. 4 %) and Chinese (23. 0 %). Malays and Indians did not have higher rates of atopy (11. 1 % and 15. 2 %, respectively) than Chinese (15. 4 %). Adjustment for these factors in multivariate analyses reduced the greater odds of asthma in Malays and Indians, but not to a significant extent. CONCLUSIONS [...] There are ethnic differences in the prevalence of asthma in Singapore which are not entirely explained by differences in smoking, atopy, or other risk factors. Other unmeasured environmental factors or genetic influences are likely to account for residual differences in the prevalence of asthma...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantity}} and quality of adolescents’ sleep may have changed due to new technologies. At the same time, the prevalence of neck, shoulder and low back pain has increased. However, only a few studies have investigated insufficient {{quantity and}} quality of sleep as possible risk factors for musculoskeletal pain among adolescents. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess whether insufficient {{quantity and quality}} of sleep are risk factors for neck (NP), shoulder (SP) and low back pain (LBP). A 2 -year follow-up survey among adolescents aged 15 – 19  years was (2001 – 2003) carried out in a subcohort of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (n =  1, 773). The outcome measures were 6 -month <b>period</b> <b>prevalences</b> of NP, SP and LBP. The {{quantity and quality of}} sleep were categorized into sufficient, intermediate or insufficient, based on average hours spent sleeping, and whether or not the subject suffered from nightmares, tiredness and sleeping problems. The odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for having musculoskeletal pain were obtained through logistic regression analysis, adjusted for previously suggested risk factors and finally adjusted for specific pain status at 16  years. The 6 -month <b>period</b> <b>prevalences</b> of neck, shoulder and low back pain were higher at the age of 18 than at 16  years. Insufficient quantity or quality of sleep at 16  years predicted NP in both girls (OR 4. 4; CI 2. 2 – 9. 0) and boys (2. 2; 1. 2 – 4. 1). Similarly, insufficient sleep at 16  years predicted LBP in both girls (2. 9; 1. 7 – 5. 2) and boys (2. 4; 1. 3 – 4. 5), but SP only in girls (2. 3; 1. 2 – 4. 4). After adjustment for pain status, insufficient sleep at 16  years predicted significantly only NP (3. 2; 1. 5 – 6. 7) and LBP (2. 4; 1. 3 – 4. 3) in girls. Insufficient sleep quantity or quality was an independent risk factor for NP and LBP among girls.

40|$|Although {{the natural}} history of {{vestibular}} schwannomas (VS) has been previously studied, few studies have investigated associated epidemiological factors, primarily {{because of the lack of}} large available cohorts. The objective of this study was to perform a multi-scale geographical analysis of the <b>period</b> <b>prevalence</b> of VS in West Scotland from 2000 to 2015. Adults diagnosed with sporadic VS were identified through the National Health Services of West Scotland database and geocoded to the unit postcode. To assess whether the cohort of VS cases could be pooled into a <b>period</b> <b>prevalence</b> measure, the locations of VS cases were analyzed by sex using Cross-L and Difference-K functions. VS <b>period</b> <b>prevalence</b> was examined at two aggregate spatial scales: the postcode district and a coarser scale of NHS Health Boards. The spatial structure of <b>period</b> <b>prevalence</b> within each level of spatial aggregation was measured using univariate global and local Moran's I. Bivariate local Moran's I was used to examine the between-scale variability in <b>period</b> <b>prevalence</b> from the postcode district level to the NHS Health Boards levels. Prior to spatial autocorrelation analyses, the <b>period</b> <b>prevalence</b> at the postcode district was tested for stratified spatial heterogeneity within the NHS Health Boards using Wang's q-Statistic. A total of 512 sporadic VS were identified in a population of over 3. 1 million. Between 2000 and 2015, VS <b>period</b> <b>prevalence</b> was highest within the NHS Health Boards of Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Ayrshire and Arran and the Western Isles. However, at the NHS scale, <b>period</b> <b>prevalence</b> exhibited no spatial autocorrelation globally or locally.

This prospective study included {{a convenience sample of}} 249 adult kidney transplant patients > 1 year post-transplant. Non-adherence was monitored electronically using MEMS(R). Selected socio-economic, therapy-, patient-, condition- and healthcare team-related risk factors for non-adherence were assessed. <b>Period</b> <b>prevalences</b> were expressed as the percent of prescribed doses taken (taking adherence), the percent of correctly dosed days (dosing adherence), the percentage of inter-dose intervals not exceeding 25 % of the prescribed interval (timing adherence), and the number of drug holidays per 100 days (no intake for > 48 h if once daily or for > 24 h if twice daily intake). Testing occurred by simple mixed logistic regression analysis. Factors significant after correction for multiple testing were entered into a multiple logistic regression model. Mean taking, dosing, timing adherence, and drug holidays were 98 %, 96 %, 93 %, and 1. 1 days, respectively. Non-adherence was associated with lower self-efficacy, higher self-reported non-adherence, no pillbox usage, and male gender. Adherence declined between Monday and Sunday. This study provides a framework for identifying patients at risk for non-adherence and for developing adherence-enhancing interventions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{changes in}} the spatial distribution of schistosomiasis in Mali following a decade of donor-funded control and a further 12 years without control. National pre-intervention cross-sectional schistosomiasis surveys were conducted in Mali in 1984 - 1989 (in communities) and again in 2004 - 2006 (in schools). Bayesian geostatistical models were built separately for each time period and on the datasets combined across time periods. In the former, data from one period were used to predict prevalence of schistosome infections for the other period, and in the latter, the models {{were used to determine}} whether spatial autocorrelation and covariate effects were consistent across <b>periods.</b> Schistosoma haematobium <b>prevalence</b> was 25. 7 % in 1984 - 1989 and 38. 3 % in 2004 - 2006; S. mansoni prevalence was 7. 4 % in 1984 - 1989 and 6. 7 % in 2004 - 2006 (note the models showed no significant difference in mean prevalence of either infection between time <b>periods).</b> <b>Prevalence</b> of both infections showed a focal spatial pattern and negative associations with distance from perennial waterbodies, which was consistent across time periods. Spatial models developed using 1984 - 1989 data were able to predict the distributions of both schistosome species in 2004 - 2006 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was typically > 0. 7) and vice versa. A decade after the apparently successful conclusion of a donor-funded schistosomiasis control programme from 1982 - 1992, national prevalence of schistosomiasis had rebounded to pre-intervention levels. Clusters of schistosome infections occurred in generally the same areas accross time periods, although the precise locations varied. To achieve long-term control, it is essential to plan for sustainability of ongoing interventions, including stengthening endemic country health systems...|$|R
40|$|Musculoskeletal {{complaints}} (MSC) {{are common}} among children, often persist into adolescence, {{and increase the}} risk of MSC in adulthood. Knowledge regarding determinants of MSC among children is limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of MSC at age 11 years and to examine associations with sociodemographic factors, growth and development factors, mental health, tiredness, and lifestyle. Data from a Netherlands birth cohort study, the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) Study (n = 2, 638), were used (1996 - 2009). MSC were defined as complaints about the back, an upper extremity, a lower extremity, or any of these sites. Logistic regression analyses using a forward stepwise procedure were performed on multiply imputed data. The 1 -year <b>period</b> <b>prevalences</b> of back, upper extremity, and lower extremity complaints that lasted at least 1 month were 2. 8 %, 4. 8 %, and 10. 9 %, respectively. Only poorer mental health was consistently associated with all 3 types of complaints. Poorer mental health, daytime tiredness, early pubertal development, being physically active at age 11 years, and weight-for-height z score were associated with having any MSC. This study showed that MSC, especially lower extremity complaints, are common among 11 -year old-children and that only poorer mental health status is associated with MSC at all anatomic sites. © 2011 The Author...|$|R
