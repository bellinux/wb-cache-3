Although integrated in the larger Egyptian nation state, the Copts have survived as a distinct religious community forming around 10 to 20 percent of the population, though estimates vary. They <b>pride</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> the apostolicity of the Egyptian Church whose founder was the first in an unbroken chain of patriarchs. The main body for 16 centuries has been out of communion with both the Roman Catholic Church (in Rome) and the various Eastern orthodox churches.|$|E
25|$|Z-Link and Kaza both <b>pride</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> {{horizontal}} integration of their in-house management, where the artists are given full control over all {{steps of the}} publication of their product – from creation, to editing, publishing and distribution. Z-Link goes even further, working to foster new talent until it can gain a truly public following: traditional calls for submission are supplemented by scouting of unpublished works on blogs, Facebook pages and other collective platforms used by fan communities online. Aspiring artists are encouraged {{to reach out to}} an audience, so that budding amateurs, who previously created for friends, can develop a wider fanbase and become published artists. Typically, new artists first publish short installments in Z-Link's monthly manga and gaming magazine, Laabstore, before being commissioned to produce a small print run (500–1,000 copies) of an independent volume. This structure permits Z-Link to reconfigure the traditional publishing channels and capitalize on its position between conventional publication and self-production. It provides the infrastructure for autonomous artists to achieve local print runs at a reasonable cost. Since their creation, Z-Link and Kaza have developed an enthusiastic and loyal following. Their catalogs, however, remain limited in number and difficult to procure, as the works are still distributed through a capillary network including a few bookstores in Algiers, Oran and Constantine.|$|E
500|$|Richard Scudamore {{defended the}} plan as {{consolidating}} the Premier League's global reputation, saying [...] "if we didn't do it, another sport {{will come and}} do it to us". Scudamore said that the chairmen of all 20 Premier League clubs supported the proposal, and disputed claims by the Daily Mail that Randy Lerner of Aston Villa and Dave Whelan of Wigan Athletic were opposed. David Gold, chairman of Birmingham City, endorsed the plan {{in part because the}} larger clubs have in any case already been exploiting foreign markets, with pre-season and even mid-season tours; Game 39 would distribute its revenue among all the clubs. [...] On 15 February, Liverpool F.C. chief executive Rick Parry stated that the proposal had [...] "never been on Liverpool's club agenda" [...] and acknowledged the concern of the club's fans and manager. [...] Paul Hayward, writing in The Guardian, said that the proposal would destroy the balance of the home-and-away round-robin league. The Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) condemned the proposal as being motivated by money, and dubbed it Gam£39. [...] It launched a petition, {{with the support of the}} Daily Mail, to oppose the [...] "outrageous desecration of the national game". In March 2008, the campaign was ended as the FSF declared the proposal [...] "effectively dead". [...] Many die-hard fans who <b>pride</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> travelling to all their teams' away matches would have been unable to travel abroad for [...] "Game 39". [...] On the other hand, exotic foreign venues would potentially be more appealing destinations for fans than a mundane English city. [...] Managers of Premier League clubs reported to be opposed to or sceptical of the plans included Steve Bruce, Roy Hodgson, Gareth Southgate, and Rafael Benítez. [...] Alex Ferguson criticised the club owners for lack of consultation with managers. [...] Arsène Wenger, Roy Keane, Kevin Keegan, and Avram Grant supported the proposal. [...] 'Game 39' was also defended as a move to head off plans for a World League involving only elite clubs such as those formerly in the G-14 group.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} mixed {{entities}} were formed, called instituti or enti nazionali, whose purpose {{it was to}} bring together representatives {{of the government and}} of the major businesses.

The government considered this arrangement to be a success, and Italian Fascists soon began to <b>pride</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> this outcome, saying they had survived the Great Depression without infringing on private property. In 1934, the Fascist Minister of Agriculture said: [...] "While nearly everywhere else private property was bearing the major burdens and suffering from the hardest blows of the depression, in Italy, thanks to the actions of this Fascist government, private property not only has been saved, but has also been strengthened." ...|$|E

[...] Of a 1962 production by The Lyric Theater Company of Washington, D.C., The Washington Post wrote, [...] "the difficulties were worth surmounting, for the work is a delight. ...

2500|$|In 1954, {{there was}} a crabbers strike. Because of {{the large amount of}} crabs in the Bay, the price had been so reduced that the {{fishermen}} weren't making any money off their catches. Therefore, the crabbers went on strike. Usually strikes are organized by a union who would conduct negotiations in order to improve conditions. [...] For this strike, there wasn’t any organized union which promoted the strike but just a tight-knit group of fishermen who wanted their voices heard. Because this strike was not employed by a union, a Baltimore Sun editorial portrayed the crabbers as lazy, uncivilized and uncooperative. In response to this editorial, the Organization of the Volunteer Fire Company sent an eloquent response. This response addressed the negative press the fishermen and the communities received, showing how the fishermen and the communities <b>pride</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> keeping up with modern ideas, that they were civilized and did not need to utilize unions to work together and make improvement to their lives.|$|E

2500|$|Gus van Go {{was known}} for having helmed the debut album by the Stills, whom he managed and whose success felt reassuring for Priestess. Heppner told the Montreal Mirror in December 2005 that he trusted van Go's {{judgment}} and that the producer [...] "had every drum sound and guitar sound already figured out before he even pressed 'record'". The producer employed such things as shakers, tambourines, and vocal treatments, and Heppner has also stated that piano was occasionally used on the album for its [...] "percussive" [...] quality. In particular, cowbell was used on [...] "Run Home". Even though the polished sound of the record was initially welcomed by the band as being something [...] "different" [...] for a hard rock record, the result of van Go emulating the sounds of well-known older metal records, the group came to be rather dissatisfied with it over time. While initially liking the idea, Heppner later described the album as merely being twelve of their songs in recorded form, and not actually intended to represent the group's live sound; the band <b>pride</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> their concert performances the most.

2500|$|Aqua {{commenced}} {{the recording}} of Megalomania {{at the beginning of}} 2010, scheduled for a release in the spring of 2011. Aqua released the album's lead single, [...] "How R U Doin?" [...] on 14 March 2011, after a preview of the song was posted onto the band's official Facebook page on 10 March 2011. Co-written by Thomas Troelsen, the song peaked at number four in Denmark, becoming the band's tenth top-ten single. It has since been certified gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry for sales of 15,000 copies in Denmark. Aqua were originally set to release their third studio album on 14 July 2011, however the release was pushed back to 5 September 2011 with the record label citing bad timing. The album, titled Megalomania, was then further rescheduled to be released on 3 October 2011. On 7 September 2011 Aqua released a preview of their new single, [...] "Playmate to Jesus", on their official Facebook page, which was released on 12 September 2011. On 8 September 2011 it was announced that [...] "Like a Robot" [...] would also be released as a single on 12 September, and would battle against [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] in the charts.
