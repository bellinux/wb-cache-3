25|$|The {{choice of}} chain {{extender}} also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They {{are all suitable}} for thermoplastic polyurethanes {{with the exception of}} ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels. Diethanolamine and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity. Diethyltoluenediamine is used extensively in RIM, and in polyurethane and <b>polyurea</b> elastomer formulations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{balance between}} gellation and blowing is {{sensitive}} to operating parameters including the concentrations of water and catalyst. The reaction to generate carbon dioxide involves water reacting with an isocyanate first forming an unstable carbamic acid, which then decomposes into carbon dioxide and an amine. The amine reacts with more isocyanate to give a substituted urea. Water has a very low molecular weight, so even though the weight percent of water may be small, the molar proportion of water may be high and considerable amounts of urea produced. The urea is not very soluble in the reaction mixture and tends to form separate [...] "hard segment" [...] phases consisting mostly of <b>polyurea.</b> The concentration and organization of these <b>polyurea</b> phases can {{have a significant impact}} on the properties of the polyurethane foam.|$|E
2500|$|Polyols for {{flexible}} applications use low functionality initiators such as {{dipropylene glycol}} (f=2), glycerine (f=3), or a sorbitol/water solution (f=2.75). Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as sucrose (f=8), sorbitol (f=6), toluenediamine (f=4), and Mannich bases (f=4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide {{is added to}} the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styrene–acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or <b>polyurea</b> (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone. [...] A special class of polyether polyols, poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, which are made by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran, are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.|$|E

5000|$|The word <b>polyurea</b> {{is derived}} from the Greek words πολυ- - poly- meaning [...] "many"; and ουρίας - oûron meaning [...] "to urinate". The latter term refers to the {{substance}} urea, found in urine, rather than urine itself. Urea or carbamide is an organic compound with the chemical formula (NH2)2CO. The molecule has two amine groups (-NH2) joined by a carbonyl functional group (C=O). In a <b>polyurea,</b> alternating monomer units of isocyanates and amines react with each other to form urea linkages. Ureas can also be formed from the reaction of isocyanates and water which forms a carbamic acid intermediate. This acid quickly decomposes by splitting off carbon dioxide and leaving behind an amine. This amine then reacts with another isocyanate group to form the <b>polyurea</b> linkage. This two step reaction is used in what is commonly but improperly called polyurethane foams. The carbon dioxide that is liberated in this reaction is the primary blowing (foaming) agent especially in many polyurethane foams which more precisely should be called polyurethane/urea foams.|$|E

Molecular dynamics in these systems were investigated by combining Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Currents (TSDC) and broadband Dielectric Relaxation Spectroscopy (DRS) techniques. High conductivity contribution in dielectric loss does not allow {{the study of the}} segmental a relaxation associated with the glass transition. In the glassy state two secondary relaxation mechanisms have been investigated, the gamma and the beta mechanism. The gamma relaxation mechanism, at low temperatures/high frequencies, is attributed to motions of the end groups (-OH for polyurethanes and -NH 2 for <b>polyureas),</b> and has been found faster in the hyperbranched <b>polyureas.</b> in addition, our results reveal that gamma relaxation mechanism in both series depends on the chemical structure, being faster for aliphatic structures. The beta relaxation mechanism, at higher temperatures/lower frequencies, is attributed to the motions of branched ends with polar groups. Our study suggests that this mechanism may be a typical relaxation process for hyperbranched polyurethanes structures, not existed in the linear counterparts. All the systems exhibit dc conductivity at temperatures higher than T-g which shows Arrhenius-like temperature dependence and is characterized by rather high activation energies (in the order of 200 kJ/mol). At temperatures lower than T-g all the systems studied exhibit remarkably high charge mobility.
