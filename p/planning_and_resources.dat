These systems should improve quality of the core business of higher education i. e. teaching and learning, research and community engagement. It should yield reliable information for internal planning as well as external monitoring purposes. The integration of quality management with <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> allocation within a framework of continuous improvement is viewed as fundamental elements for successful quality management of institutions {{of higher learning}}. A key assumption {{of this research is}} that quality management models should be underpinned by the systems theory in order to enhance the integration of quality management, <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> allocation on institutional strategic, tactical and operational levels. This study utilised the key elements and phases of the PDCA and ADRI models to develop a model for the integration of quality management, <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> allocation within a context of continuous improvement This model will be suitable for implementation by one of the institutions of higher learning in South Africa that fails, according to its latest HEQC audit to integrate quality management, <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> allocation. It offers also a conceptual framework for any institution of higher learning that fails to integrate quality management, <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> allocation. Doctora...|$|R
