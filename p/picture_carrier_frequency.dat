40|$|Abstract — Since <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> offset destroys user’s sig-nal {{orthogonality}} in Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplex-ing Access (OFDMA) uplink transmission, {{resulting in}} an interference-limited system, its estimation/correction is very im-portant. The residual <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> offset of each user contributes Inter-Carrier-Interference (ICI) and Multiple-User-Interference (MUI) to other users. In this paper, {{the effect of the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> offset on OFDMA uplink is analyzed. We first analyze the average uplink capacity losses as well as the Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) reduction due to the <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> offsets, and then discuss the capacity increases by using adaptive power allocation.

The NEC protocol {{is used by the}} vast majority of Japanese-manufactured consumer electronics. The Philips RC-5 and RC-6 protocols both specify a <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> of 36 kHz. However, the early RC-5 encoding chips divided the master frequency of the 4-bit microcontroller by 12. This required a ceramic resonator of 432 kHz to achieve a 36 kHz carrier, which was not widely available. Many companies therefore used a 455 kHz ceramic resonator, which is commonplace due to that frequency being used in the intermediate frequency stages of AM broadcasting radios, resulting in a <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> of 37.92 kHz (essentially 38 kHz). Even documentation for Philips' own controller chips recommended an easier-to-obtain 429 kHz ceramic resonator, yielding a <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> of 35.75 kHz.

The main goal is to modify a conventional method as an at-tempt to develop a different approach and then to compare {{the performance of the}} modified method with the per-formance of the conventional one. The conventional ap-proach is here represented by the gradient optimization method called the steepest descent. It is the base for the modification which utilizes Newton’s method for the indi-rect carrier offset estimation.

This study aims to determine the rate of 35 delG <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> in Iran. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from a total of 550 unaffected unrelated subjects from 4 provinces of Iran following the standard phenol chloroform procedure. The one base pair deletion (35 delG) was analysed using a nested PCR procedure; 35 delG mutation carriers were subsequently confirmed by sequence analysis. Moreover, using the Binomial probability distribution, we compared the 35 delG <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> of Iranian population with the various Middle Eastern and overall European populations. Results: Of the four populations studied, we found a high <b>carrier</b> <b>frequency</b> of 2. 8 % in Gilan province in the north of Iran.
