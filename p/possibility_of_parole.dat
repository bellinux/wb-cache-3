On April 17 the plea was made public when Debora Green appeared in court to plead no contest to five charges—two counts of capital murder, one of arson, and two of attempted first-degree murder. In exchange for avoiding the death penalty, the no contest plea called for Green to accept a prison sentence of a minimum of forty years without the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole.</b> Green denied being {{under the influence of}} any drug which would affect her judgment in making her plea or her ability to understand the proceedings in which she was participating.|$|E

However, before the trial was concluded, Meinhof was found hanged by a rope, fashioned from a towel, in her cell in the Stammheim Prison on 9 May 1976.
