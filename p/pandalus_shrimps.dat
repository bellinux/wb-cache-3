40|$|As upper-level predatory fishes become overfished, mesopredators rise {{to become}} the new ‘top ’ predators of over-exploited marine communities. To gain insight into ensuing {{mechanisms}} that might alter indirect species interactions, we examined how behavioural responses to an upper-level predatory fish might differ between mesopredator species with different life histories. In rocky reefs of the northeast Pacific Ocean, adult lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) are upper-level predators that use a sit-and-wait hunting mode. Reef mesopredators that are prey to adult lingcod include kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus), younger lingcod, copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and quillback rockfish (S. maliger). Across these mesopredators species, longevity and age at maturity increases and, consequently, the annual proportion of lifetime reproductive output decreases in the order just listed. Therefore, we hypothesized {{that the level of}} risk taken to acquire resources would vary interspecifically in that same order. During field experiments we manipulated predation risk with a model adult lingcod and used fixed video cameras to quantify interactions between mesopredators and tethered prey (<b>Pandalus</b> <b>shrimps).</b> We predicted that the probabilities of inspecting and attacking tethered prey would rank from highest to lowest and the timing of these behaviours would rank from earliest to latest as follows: kelp greenling, lingcod, copper rockfish, and quillback rockfish. We also predicted that responses to the model lingcod, such as avoidance of interactions with tethered prey, would rank from weakest to strongest in the same order.

40|$|The {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} shrimp larvae were studied along four transects off West Greenland in June–July 1996. Zooplankton samples and vertical profiles of tem-perature, salinity, and fluorescence were obtained along the transects in order to relate larval distribution to hydrographical and biological characteristics. Eight species of shrimp larvae occurred in the samples; Pandalus montagui and Pandalus borealis were the most numerous constituting 61 and 29 % of the larvae, respectively. Other species of shrimp larvae were, in declining order of abundance, Sabinea septemcarinata, Lebbeus groenlandicus, Spirontocaris spinus, Eualus galmardi, Pontophilus (norvegicus?), and Argis dentata. <b>Pandalus</b> <b>shrimp</b> larval density showed a significant positive association with mean fluorescence (5 – 80 m), but no association with mean temperature, or densities of copepod eggs and nauplii. However, most larvae were caught in water columns with tem-peratures and salinities of ~ 2 ° C. and ~ 33 psu, respectively.

40|$|Black spot {{development}} or "melanosis" {{is a common}} defect in fresh shrimp which results in product being devalued and rejected by consumers. Currently, sulfiting agents are used to control melanosis in shrimp. However, with increasing regulatory and consumer concerns {{about the safety of}} sulphites as a method of melanosis control, the shrimp processing industry is actively seeking alternative methods to control melanosis on, and extend the shelf life of, fresh shrimp. One method which has the potential to fulfill both objectives is glucose oxidase (GOX) /glucose dipping solutions in conjunction with Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP). Preliminary studies have shown that black spot development can be controlled for 14 days at 4 $ sp circ$C in white <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Pandalus</b> occidentalis) and pink <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Pandalus</b> borealis) using GOX/glucose or GOX/glucose/ascorbic acid in conjunction with gas packaging (60 % CO$ sb 2 $: 40 % N$ sb 2 $).

This study has shown that the combined use of two or more "barriers" can be used to extend the shelf life of, and control melanosis on, fresh shrimp.
