40|$|Abstract – One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems of traditional A. I. planning methods such as non-linear planning is the control of the planning process itself. A non-linear planner confronts many choice points in different steps of the planning process (i. e., selection of the next goal to work on, selection of an action to achieve the goal, and selection of the right order to resolve a conflict), and ideally, it should choose the best option in each case. The partial ordered planner (POP) introduced by Weld in 1994, assumes a magical function called "Choose " to select the best option in each planning step. There have been some previous efforts for the realization of this function; however, most of these efforts ignore the valuable information that can be extracted from the problem’s domain. This paper introduces several general heuristics for extracting useful information contained in problem domains by an automatic preprocessing. These heuristics have been incorporated into a planner called H 2 <b>POP,</b> and <b>tested</b> on a number of different domains...|$|R

40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} {{and natural}} history of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) are poorly understood. Consequently, our approaches to treatment of POP are limited. Alterations in the extracellular matrix components of pelvic support ligaments and vaginal tissue, including collagen and elastin, {{have been associated with}} the development of POP in animals and women. Prior studies have shown the protease MMP- 9, a key player of ECM degradation, is upregulated in vaginal tissues from both mice and women with POP. On the other hand, fibulin- 5, an elastogenic organizer, has been found to inhibit MMP- 9 in the vaginal wall. Hence, we hypothesized that prolonged release of fibulin- 5 may delay progression of <b>POP.</b> To <b>test</b> the hypothesis, oligo (ethylene glycol) -based thermosensitive hydrogels were fabricated, characterized and then used to deliver fibulin- 5 to the vaginal wall and inhibit MMP- 9 activity.

However, the potential accumulation of very small microplastic particles along food webs ending with vertebrate models has not been investigated so far. Therefore, a simple artificial food chain with Artemia sp. nauplii and zebrafish (Danio rerio) was established to analyze the transfer of microplastic particles and associated persistent organic pollutants (POPs) between different trophic levels. Very small (1 – 20 [*]μm) microplastic particles accumulated in Artemia nauplii and were subsequently transferred to fish. Virgin particles not loaded with POPs did not cause any observable physical harm in the intestinal tracts of zebrafish, although parts of the particles were retained within the mucus of intestinal villi and might even have been taken up by epithelial cells. The transfer of associated <b>POPs</b> was <b>tested</b> with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene and an ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay for CYP 1 A induction in zebrafish liver as well as via fluorescence analyses. Whereas a significant induction in the EROD assay could not be shown, because of high individual variation and low sensitivity regarding substance concentration, the fluorescence tracking of benzo[a]pyrene indicates that food-borne microplastic-associated POPs may actually desorb in the intestine of fish and are thus transferred to the intestinal epithelium and liver...|$|R

To assess (i) cola acidity and buffering capacity in vitro, (ii) tooth erosion after swishing with colas in vivo (iii) scanning electron microscopic effects on teeth of colas, and tooth-brush abrasion, and (iv) report a clinical case of erosion from cola consumption. Materials and Methods. (i) We measured six commercially available pop “Cola beverages”, pH, and buffering capacities using a pH-Mettler Automatic Titrator, with weak solution of Sodium Hydroxide (ii) two cohorts, one with teeth, the second without teeth rinsed with aliquots of Cola for 60 seconds. Swished cola samples tested for calcium and phosphorus contents using standardized chemical analytical methods (iii) enamel, dentine, and the enamel-cemental junction from unerupted extracted wisdom teeth were examined with a scanning electron microscope after exposure to colas, and tested for tooth-brush abrasion; (iv) a clinical case of pop cola erosion presentation, are all described. Results. Comparisons among <b>pop</b> colas <b>tested</b> in vitro reveal high acidity with very low pH.

40|$|Ubiquitous {{persistent}} {{organic pollutants}} (POPs) can accumulate in humans where they might influence differentiation of adipocytes. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether DNA methylation is one of the underlying mechanisms by which POPs affect adipocyte differentiation, and to what extent DNA methylation can be related to gene transcription. Adipocyte differentiation was induced in two human cell models with continuous exposure to different POPs throughout differentiation. From the seven <b>tested</b> <b>POPs,</b> perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) decreased lipid accumulation, while tributyltin (TBT) increased lipid accumulation. In human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), TCDD and TBT induced opposite gene expression profiles, whereas after PFOS exposure gene expression remained relatively stable. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis showed that all three POPs affected DNA methylation patterns in adipogenic and other genes, possibly related to the phenotypic outcome, but without concomitant gene expression changes. Differential methylation was predominantly detected in intergenic regions, where the biological relevance of alterations in DNA methylation is unclear. This study demonstrates that POPs, at environmentally relevant levels, are able to induce differential DNA methylation in human differentiating adipocytes. </p...|$|R

An experimental study was designed in which control and two levels of <b>POP</b> signage were <b>tested</b> in two grocery store environments in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. Ten stores were involved; six from an upscale chain and four from a discount/warehouse chain. A customer intercept interview method was used to determine the perceptions of approximately 400 customers in each store; and sales data were tracked for 14 selected organic food items. Results revealed that customers in upscale stores were more likely than discount/warehouse store customers to recognize signs designating organic foods. Younger people, women and those having larger household sizes recognized organic signage most often. In both chains, signage increased the proportion of customers who reported ever buying and planning to buy organic foods. Sales data suggest a positive effect of POP signage on volume of sales for some, but not all tracked foods. Signage significantly increased the sales of skim milk, butter, eggs, deli bread, fresh carrots, spaghetti and flaked cereal in the discount/warehouse stores. In the upscale stores, significant effects of POP signage were found for skim milk, spaghetti, peach nectar and fresh carrots when the sales figures were adjusted for the store's weekly sales volume.

40|$|The Parallel Ocean Program (POP), {{the ocean}} model {{component}} of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), is widely used in climate research. Most current work in CESM-POP focuses on improving the model's efficiency or accuracy, such as improving numerical methods, advancing parameterization, porting to new architectures, or increasing parallelism. Since ocean dynamics are chaotic in nature, achieving bit-for-bit (BFB) identical results in ocean solutions cannot be guaranteed for even tiny code modifications, and determining whether modifications are admissible (i. e., statistically consistent with the original results) is non-trivial. In recent work, an ensemble-based statistical approach was shown to work well for software verification (i. e., quality assurance) on atmospheric model data. The general idea of the ensemble-based statistical consistency testing {{is to use a}} qualitative measurement of the variability of the ensemble of simulations as a metric with which to compare future simulations and make a determination of statistical distinguishability. The capability to determine consistency without BFB results boosts model confidence and provides the flexibility needed, for example, for more aggressive code optimizations and the use of heterogeneous execution environments. Since ocean and atmosphere models have differing characteristics in term of dynamics, spatial variability, and timescales, we present a new statistical method to evaluate ocean model simulation data that requires the evaluation of ensemble means and deviations in a spatial manner. In particular, the statistical distribution from an ensemble of CESM-POP simulations is used to determine the standard score of any new model solution at each grid point. Then the percentage of points that have scores greater than a specified threshold indicates whether the new model simulation is statistically distinguishable from the ensemble simulations. Both ensemble size and composition are important. Our experiments indicate that the new <b>POP</b> ensemble consistency <b>test</b> (POP-ECT) tool is capable of distinguishing cases that should be statistically consistent with the ensemble and those that should not, as well as providing a simple, subjective and systematic way to detect errors in CESM-POP due to the hardware or software stack, positively contributing to quality assurance for the CESM-POP code...|$|R
