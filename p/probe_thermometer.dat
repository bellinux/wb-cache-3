Milne-Redh (Asteraceae) {{has been}} used as a {{medicine}} for the treatment of epilepsy, insomnia, dementia and psychotic disorders in Cameroonian traditional medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was designed to examine whether the aqueous extract and the alkaloid fraction prepared from the leaves of Crassocephalum bauchiense possess antipsychotic and sedative properties in rodents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rectal temperature of mice was recorded with a <b>probe</b> <b>thermometer</b> at a constant depth. Novelty-induced rearing behavior is used to evaluate a central excitatory locomotor behavior in mice. The antipsychotic effects of the extracts were assessed using the apomorphine animal model of psychosis. The catalepsy test was tested based on the ability of the leaves extracts of Crassocephalum bauchiense to alter the duration of akinesia by placing the naive mice with both forelegs over a horizontal bar. The extracts of Crassocephalum bauchiense effects were evaluated on sodium pentobarbital-induced sleeping time. In addition, gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations in the brain treated mice were also estimated. RESULTS: The aqueous extract and the alkaloid fraction from Crassocephalum bauchiense caused dose-dependent inhibition of novelty-induced rearing behavior, decreased the apomorphine-induced stereotypy and fighting, and had significant fall of the body temperature. The aqueous extract prolonged the sodium pentobarbital sleeping time. This prolongation was not reversed by bicuculline, a light-sensitive competitive antagonist of GABA(A) receptors complex. However, the effect of the aqueous extract on sodium pentobarbital-induced sleeping time was blocked by N-methyl-β-carboline- 3 -carboxamide, a partial inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine site in the GABA(A) receptor complex and flumazenil, a specific antagonist of the benzodiazepine site in the GABAA receptor complex. In biochemical experiments, the concentration of the inhibitory amino acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, was significantly increased in the brain of animals treated with the aqueous extract of Crassocephalum bauchiense and sodium valproate. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the antipsychotic and sedative properties of Crassocephalum bauchiense are possibly mediated via the blockade of dopamine D- 2 receptors and GABAergic activation, respectively. However, pharmacological and chemical studies are continuing in order to characterize the mechanism(s) responsible for these neuropharmacological actions and also to identify the active substances present in the extracts of Crassocephalum bauchiense...|$|E

The purpose of this investigation was to create a varicocele model in animals and to study the subsequent alterations in testicular physiology. Secondary dilatation of the left internal spermatic vein was achieved either by partial ligation of the left renal vein in rats and dogs or by surgical destruction of the valve of the left testicular vein in a second group of dogs. 1 mo after partial ligation in the rats and 3 mo after partial ligation or valve destruction in the dogs, testicular blood flow was measured using Strontium 85 (SR- 85) -labeled microspheres (15 +/- 1. 1 micrometer). Intratesticular temperature was measured with a Bailey needle <b>probe</b> <b>thermometer</b> and biopsies were obtained for histologic sections. Mean testicular blood flow in milliliters per minute per 100 g was significantly greater in the partially ligated rats; right testis control 26 +/- 2, left testis control 24 +/- 2 compared to right testis experimental 35 +/- 3, left testis experimental 35 +/- 4 (p less than 0. 02). Dogs undergoing either partial vein ligation or valve destruction showed similar increases in mean testicular blood flow; right testis control 8 +/- 1, left testis control 8 +/- 1 vs. right testis experimental 16 +/- 3, left testis experimental 18 +/- 4 (p less than 0. 01). The mean difference between intratesticular and intraperitoneal temperature in control rats was significantly higher (4. 02 +/- 0. 25 degrees C right testis, 3. 77 +/- 0. 14 degrees C left testis), than rats who underwent partial vein ligation (right testis 2. 14 +/- 0. 09 degrees C, left testis 2. 34 +/- 0. 12 degrees C) (p less than 0. 001). Control dogs also had a significantly higher mean difference between intratesticular and rectal temperatures; (right testis control 3. 61 +/- 0. 42 degrees C, left testis control 3. 60 +/- 0. 40 degrees C) than the partially ligated or valve destruction dogs (right testis 2. 31 +/- 0. 17 degrees C, left testis 2. 67 +/- 0. 32 degrees C) (p less than 0. 05). In addition, histologic evaluation revealed abnormalities in spermatogenesis in some of the animals. Thus, venous dilatation secondary to partial vein ligation or testicular vein valve obliteration is followed by large bilateral increases in testicular blood flow in these two species. A consequence of this increased flow is an elevation in bilateral testicular temperature, which it is postulated, leads to impaired spermatogenesis in some of the animals. In selected men varicocele may impair spermatogenesis by a similar physiologic mechanism...|$|E
30|$|Healthy male C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice, 8 – 12  weeks {{of age and}} {{weighing}} 20 – 25  g, were randomized to either CLP surgery to induce sepsis (n =[*] 23 for moderate severity CLP, n =[*] 17 for severe CLP; n =[*] 3 – 4 per group per experiment) or sham surgery as a non-septic control (n =[*] 18 total, 3 per experiment). These sample sizes were calculated to detect a 30 % or greater difference in survival between CLP groups with 80 % power and α[*]=[*] 0.05. Since the majority of CLP studies are conducted using male mice, female mice {{were not used to}} reduce the total number of mice needed in this study and to control for the potential effects of estrogen on modulating sepsis severity [16]. In accordance with Rittirsch et al. (Nature Protocols, [17]), we used the C 57 Bl/ 6 mouse strain which is most commonly used in CLP sepsis because most genetically manipulated (knockout or transgenic) mice are on this genetic background. Methods for randomization and experimenter blinding were used to reduce allocation, selection, and experimenter biases according to Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines [18]. The CLP model used in these studies was adapted from protocols by others [17, 19, 20], and has been extensively utilized by our group [21 – 23]. Briefly, under isofluorane anesthesia, the abdominal area of the mouse was shaved and sterilized with iodine and 70 % ethanol. All mice underwent laparotomy prior to exteriorization of the cecum onto the sterilized abdominal surface. In CLP mice, 1  cm of the cecum was ligated and punctured through-and-through using a sterile 18 -gauge needle. For the moderate severity of CLP, 0.5  cm of fecal matter was extruded from each puncture hole to ensure patency, whereas 1  cm of fecal matter was extruded from each puncture hole for the severe CLP model, after which the cecum was returned and both layers of the incision were closed with suture. In sham-operated mice, the cecum was exteriorized and returned to the peritoneal cavity without ligation or puncture. Buprenorphine (0.1  mg/kg, Temgesic) and Ringer’s lactate (1  mL) were administered subcutaneously pre-operatively and every 4  h post-operatively for pain relief and fluid resuscitation, respectively. Following surgery, mice were kept 3 /cage together with mice of the same treatment group. Since previous reports show that correction of hypothermia post-CLP surgery affects mortality [24], external heat was provided for all mice through heating blankets placed below half of each cage to allow mice to regulate their own body temperature. Mice were monitored every 4  h until 24  h post-surgery, or until reaching endpoint as characterized by complete inability to ambulate (since death is not acceptable as an endpoint in accordance with CCAC ethics standards).

40|$|Background Infrared ear {{thermometry}} {{is frequently}} used in children, {{because this is}} a quick method of taking temperature and the ear is easily accessible. Our aim was to evaluate agreement between temperature measured at the rectum and ear in children. Methods We did a systematic review of studies comparing temperature measured at the rectum (the reference site) using mercury, electronic, or indwelling <b>probe</b> <b>thermometers,</b> with temperature measured at the ear (the test site) using infrared ear thermometers. Heterogeneity between studies was investigated by exploring subgroups according to the mode of the infrared ear thermometer. Findings 44 studies containing 58 comparisons (5935 children) were eligible for inclusion in this review. Outcome data were available in reports from 12 comparisons (2312 [39 %] children), and data on individual patients were obtained for a further 19 comparisons (2129 [36 %] children). 31 comparisons (4441 [75 %] children) were therefore included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean temperature difference (rectal minus ear) was 0 · 29 °C (95 % limits of agreement − 0 · 74 to 1 · 32). We pooled data by ear device mode and the mean temperature differences were rectal mode 0 · 15 °C (− 0 · 95 to 1 · 25), actual 0 · 70 °C (− 0 · 20 to 1 · 60), core 0 · 25 °C (− 0 · 78 to 1 · 27), oral 0 · 34 °C (− 0 · 86 to 1 · 54), tympanic 0 · 62 °C (− 0 · 40 to 1 · 64) and mode not stated 0 · 32 °C (− 0 · 57 to 1 · 21). There was significant residual heterogeneity in both mean differences and sample SDs within the groups of ear device mode. Interpretation Although the mean differences between rectal and ear temperature measurements were small, the wide limits of agreement mean that ear temperature is not a good approximation of rectal temperature, even when the ear thermometer is used in rectal mode.

40|$|It is "conventional wisdom" {{that the}} {{uncertainty}} of local temperature measurements on equilibrium systems diverges exponentially fast as their temperature T drops to zero. In contrast, some exactly solvable models showcase a more benign power-law-like scaling, when only a small non-equilibrium fragment of the equilibrium system is measured. Does this mean that a part may contain {{more information about the}} global temperature than the whole? Certainly not. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox. First, we prove that local quantum thermometry at low T is exponentially inefficient in non-critical, gapped, and infinite spin and harmonic lattices. In contrast, we show through an open-system analysis, that the thermal sensitivity of a harmonic <b>thermometer</b> (<b>probe)</b> jointly equilibrated with a reservoir (sample) by means of an Ohmic coupling scheme, displays a distinctive power-law-like behavior as T → 0. To reconcile these two results, we exploit the fact that local thermometry on a harmonic chain may be viewed as a temperature measurement on an oscillator in a discretized harmonic environment: A gapped translationally invariant chain (for which low [...] T thermometry is indeed exponentially inefficient) maps into a non-standard open-system model where the low-frequency modes of the sample decouple from the probe. On the contrary, a gapless instance of such chain gives rise to the canonical Ohmic probe-sample interaction, which does include sample modes of arbitrarily low frequency. In this way, we show that the power-law-like thermometric performance observed in typical dissipative models {{stems from the fact that}} these are gapless and, as such, not subjected to the exponential limitations of their gapped counterparts. The key feature of many-body systems, when it comes to the ultimate limitations of low [...] T thermometry, is thus whether or not their energy spectrum is gapped.

The results are correlated with classical friction factor and Reynolds number analysis. The flow impedance reduction of the CEA conductor is described by measures of a developed flow model. Thermally induced flow in the CEA conductor has been studied with an inductive heating method. The induced velocity in the central channel is measured by a Pitot tube with steady state Reynolds number up to {approximately} 7000. The transient pressure wave propagation has been recorded with pressure transducers placed equally along the conductor. The supercritical helium temperature in the central channel has been measured with the <b>thermometer</b> <b>probe.</b> However, the reduction of the central channel area significantly affects the overall thermal hydraulic characteristics of the conductor. The results suggest the importance of the central channel. A transient heat transfer experiment studied the. transverse heat transfer mechanism in the CEA conductor. The temperatures in the central channel and bundle region were measured with different sized heat pulses. The results are discussed in terms of a heat transfer model which is based upon the communication of the helium in the central channel and bundle...|$|R
40|$|The observation, {{recording}} and appraisal of an individual’s vital signs, namely temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2), are key {{components in the}} assessment of their health and wellbeing. Measurements provide valuable diagnostic data, facilitating clinical diagnosis, management and monitoring. Respiratory rate sensing is perhaps the most under-utilised of all the vital signs, being routinely assessed by observation or estimated algorithmically from respiratory-induced beat-to-beat variation in heart rate. Moreover there is an unmet need for wearable devices that can measure all or most of the vital signs. This project therefore aims to a) develop a device that can measure respiratory rate and b) develop a wearable device that can measure all or most of the vital signs. An accelerometer-based clavicular respiratory motion sensor was developed and compared with a similar thoracic motion sensor and reference using exhalatory flow. Pilot study results established that the clavicle sensor accurately tracked the reference in monitoring respiratory rate and outperformed the thoracic device. An Ear-worn Patient Monitoring System (EPMS) was also developed, providing a discrete telemonitoring device capable of rapidly measuring tympanic temperature, heart rate, SpO 2 and activity level. The results of a comparative pilot study against reference instruments revealed that heart rate matched the reference for accuracy, while temperature under read (< 1 °C) and SpO 2 was inconsistent with poor correlation. In conclusion, both of the prototype devices require further development. The respiratory sensor would benefit from product engineering and larger scale testing to fully exploit the technology, but could find use in both hospital and community-based The design and evaluation of discrete wearable medical devices for vital signs monitoring DG Pitts ii Cranfield University monitoring. The EPMS has potential for clinical and community use, having demonstrated its capability of rapidly capturing and wirelessly transmitting vital signs readings. Further development is nevertheless required to improve the <b>thermometer</b> <b>probe</b> and resolve outstanding issues with SpO 2 readings...|$|R
