5|$|MDOT assigns {{the numbers}} for a <b>parallel</b> <b>system</b> of county-designated {{highways}} in the state; the numbers are assigned in a grid system by the department. These highways, while signed from connecting trunklines and shown on the official MDOT map, are maintained by the various counties. They were started in 1970 {{as a supplement to}} the main trunkline system and carry a letter-number combination on the national standard pentagon-shaped marker in blue and yellow. The letter component of the name corresponds to a zone of the state; zones A–F are in the Lower Peninsula while G and H are in the Upper Peninsula. The numbers correspond to a numbered grid within each lettered zone. Other county systems are designated and maintained in each of the 83counties, and signage and numbering practices vary. The state's 533incorporated cities and villages also maintain their own street networks, but townships in the state have no jurisdiction over roads.|$|E

The AIF was administered separately from the home-based army in Australia, and a <b>parallel</b> <b>system</b> was set up to deal with non-operational matters including record-keeping, finance, ordnance, personnel, quartermaster and other issues. The AIF also had separate conditions of service, rules regarding promotion and seniority, and graduation list for officers. This responsibility initially fell to Bridges, in addition to his duties as its commander; however, an Administrative Headquarters was later set up in Cairo in Egypt. Following the redeployment of the Australian infantry divisions to the Western Front it was relocated to London.

40|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>systems</b> have {{received}} increasing attention with numerous recent {{applications such as}} fork-join systems, load-balancing, and l-out-of-k redundancy.

These synchronization constraints make the analysis of <b>parallel</b> <b>systems</b> challenging and few explicit results are known. In this work, we model <b>parallel</b> <b>systems</b> using a max-plus approach that enables us to derive statistical bounds of waiting and sojourn times.

25|$|The clan {{system in}} South Asia, {{involving}} various clans and sects, {{has always been}} a ground for segregated skill development. In the region, occupational clans evolved over time providing specific skills to the society through hereditary exclusion from others. Being a blacksmith, goldsmith, shoemaker, or gardener etc. Thus, became hereditary professions of specific communities. Over time, a professional clan which favoured the society with services of prostitution also evolved. Men and women belonging to the community committed themselves to the sex trade, where men stayed as supportive influences and women were the main workers. The non-elite had a <b>parallel</b> <b>system,</b> that of brothels, which evolved much later when they no longer were controlled by the kings and nobility was loosened. It coincided with the growth of sea-trade where sailors became good clientele for the low-ranking prostitutes. During the British Raj, the earlier nobility was replaced by a new nobility composed of those who showed loyalty for the British. This new nobility was incapable of taking the role of patrons like earlier kings, and so the British provided much need patronage for the profession to grow and regulated the trade.|$|E

It was laid down that artillery supporting a neighbouring division was to come {{under the command of}} that division. For the first time all artillery was integrated into one plan. Planning for the Battle of Arras showed that command relationships, especially within the artillery (which had evolved a <b>parallel</b> <b>system</b> of command, so that General Officers Commanding, Royal Artillery at corps and division were much more closely integrated) and standardisation, had become more evident between armies, corps and divisions. Analysis and codification of the lessons of the Somme and the process of supplying the armies, made the BEF much less dependent on improvisation. Discussion and dissent between army, corps and division was tolerated, although it was not uniformly evident. Staffs were more experienced and were able to use a formula for set-piece attacks, although the means for a higher tempo of operations had not been achieved, because of the artillery's reliance on observed fire, which took time to complete. The loss of communication with troops once they advanced, still left their commanders ignorant of events when their decisions were most needed.|$|E
