2500|$|National Assembly {{elections}} {{were held in}} Bhutan {{for the first time}} on 24 March 2008. Two parties were registered by the Election Commission of Bhutan to contest the election: the Bhutan Peace and <b>Prosperity</b> <b>Party</b> (DPT, for Druk Phuensum Tshogpa), which was formed by the [...] merger of the previously established Bhutan People's United Party and All People's Party and is led by Jigme Y. Thinley, and the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The third political party, the Bhutan National Party (BNP), had its application for the registration canceled.|$|E
2500|$|Turnout reached nearly 80% by {{the time}} the polls closed, and the Bhutan Peace and <b>Prosperity</b> <b>Party</b> {{reportedly}} won 44 seats, with the People's Democratic Party winning only three seats (Phuentsholing in Chhukha, Goenkhatoe-Laya in Gasa and Sombeykha in Haa). The PDP's leader, Sangay Ngedup, who was also the ruling king's uncle, lost his own constituency by 380 votes. Reportedly, there were few differences between the platforms of the two parties, which might explain the unexpectedly uneven results; analysts are worried that the small representation of the opposition may obstruct the functioning of the newly founded democratic system. Both parties had pledged to follow the king's guidelines of [...] "pursuing Gross National Happiness", and both party leaders had previously served in governments.|$|E

They attainted the Earl of Strafford, and thereby made the king cut off his right hand to save his left, and yet not save it neither.

5000|$|Populism was a farmers' {{movement}} of the early 1890s that emerged {{in a period of}} simultaneous crises in agriculture and politics. Farmers who attempted to raise corn and hogs in the dry regions of Nebraska faced economic disaster when drought unexpectedly occurred. When they sought relief through political means, they found the Republican Party complacent, resting on its past achievement of <b>prosperity.</b> The Democratic <b>Party,</b> meanwhile, was preoccupied with the prohibition issue. The farmers turn to radical politicians leading the Populist party, but it became so enmeshed in vehement battles that it accomplished little for the farmers. Omaha was the location of the 1892 convention that formed the Populist Party, with its aptly titled Omaha Platform written by [...] "radical farmers" [...] from throughout the Midwest.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the politics of}} Islamic law of Partai Keadilan Sejahtera (<b>Prosperity</b> and Justice <b>Party,</b> PKS) 1998 – 2004 by analyzing the formulation of Law No. 38 / 1999 on Zakat Management, and Law No. 23 / 2011 on Zakat Management. It shows {{that there has been}} a shifting ideological expression in the evolution of the PKS that began to appear when this party morphed from Partai Keadilan (Justice Party) to PKS in 2002 because it had failed to pass the parliamentary threshold for the 1999 election, and had a practical political agenda for obtaining an increase of electoral votes. The ideological shift, among others, is shown through the process of the formulation of the Zakat Management Law which was influenced by several motives, among others ideological and practical political interests. PKS’s politics on Islamic law show that if its ideological interests contradict with its practical political interests, then the party opts for practical political interests.

40|$|The Augustan England was {{an august}} {{society in which}} the Puritans' moral heat was still there while the libertinism of the Restoration, {{followed}} by religious and political incertitude, the increasing wealth and <b>prosperity,</b> the <b>party</b> strife, the intermittent wars, etc., formed a neoclassical background for the flourishing of satire. As a neoclassical Augustan, Pope was a satirist and moralist whose life experience helped to mold his satirical inclination and whose poetical career showed his moral consciousness. Besides trying to revive the classical style and attitude, neoclassicists like Pope wished to uphold virtues while attacking vices and ridiculing follies. They advocated {{a good number of}} values, among which antiquity, rules, decorum, generality, order, moderation, restraint, reason, harmony, proportion, balance, correctness, artfulness, etc., were those often associated with neoclassicism. In examining some typical works of Pope's, however, we find Pope also recognized the importance of genius, nature, passion, and fancy, that is, the values often associated with romanticism. This fact leads us to the conclusion that Pope was actually a middle-of-the-roader believing in the doctrine of golden mean. For him the sense of moderation was the primary virtue. By logical reasoning it is capable of coordinating other values. From textual and critical evidence, moderation proves to be the one central virtue, too, among so many neoclassical values, which make up what Pope and other Augustans call good sense. Our ending remark is: Pope is a humanist seeking truth, like a romantic prophet, for mankind. And his ultimate truth might be: moderation is the golden means by which to achieve enduring human happiness and to create a golden time. With this understanding, one might hesitate to call him without modification a typical neoclassicist in the Age of Enlightenment. 十八世紀的英國是一個清教徒的嚴謹道德規範仍舊存在的社會。此時，一些重大的社會問題，如宗教上和政治上的不安定、與日俱增的財富和繁榮、黨派鬥爭、頻繁的戰爭等，促使新古典時期諷刺文學大為盛行。身為一位諷刺家及道德家，波普的生活經驗造就了他的諷刺創作，而他的詩人生涯更顯示出他的道德意識。除了復興古典的文體和觀念，新古典主義者在抨擊人類的愚蠢與邪惡時，也不忘褒揚許多和新古典主義有關的價值，如規則、合宜、普遍性、次序、中庸、克制、理性、和諧、均衡、正確、技巧等。然而，在探討波普的一些具有代表性的作品時，我們發現到他也重視一些與浪漫主義有關的價值，如天賦、自然、情感、和想像力。因此，我們可以推論出波普實際上是一位相信中庸之道的新古典主義作家。對他而言，中庸是最主要的一大德行。根據邏輯推理，中庸能夠調和其他的價值。而且從文本和批判性的證據來看，中庸確實是構成波普和其他同時期文學家所認為好見識之一大主要德行。我們的結論是：波普是一位為全人類尋求真理的人道主義者。而他的真理可能是：中庸是實現人類的幸福和創造一個全盛時代的最好方法。在這樣的了解之下，我們很難將波普全然歸類為極端的或是典型的新古典主義者。Contents page Acknowledgments	i Abstract	ii Chapter One: Introduction The Augustan England	 1 Chapter Two The Imaginary Invalid	 11 Chapter Three The Feigning Satyr	 29 Chapter Four The General Examples	 46 Chapter Five The Golden Mean	 70 Chapter Six: Conclusion The Enduring End	 85 Bibliography	 9...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} number of {{companies}} that are, in its operations and dealings with consumers, turning to the Internet and using huge opportunities that it provides. Therefore, Internet marketing is now experiencing extreme expansion and it is considered to be the marketing segment that is vulnerable to intensive and continuous change. Along with the positive effects brought to both businesses and consumers, there are some negatives associated with this form of marketing, {{and one of them is}} the insufficient protection of privacy. The fact is that we must raise the level of data protection, and improve its quality. Intense changes have to be taken on the normative level, because there are still plenty of reasons for the dissatisfaction of consumers when it comes to protecting their privacy. Thus, the legislation must play a key role in building consumer confidence as well as in the establishment of a positive relationship with marketers. The aim of this paper is to show the importance of the construction of such levels of private data protection which will establish longterm partnerships between consumers, marketers and other participants in the market, since only the aforementioned relations can bring <b>prosperity</b> to all <b>parties.</b> The paper will make a comparative analysis of the legislative framework in this field in the United States, the European Union and Serbia, as well as stress still present significant backlog of Serbia in relation to the aforementioned developed countries...|$|R
