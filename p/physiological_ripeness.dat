30|$|The loss or {{reduction}} of germination capacity {{is one of}} the primary problem that is faced by farmers. It has been proposed that seeds have the highest vigor during <b>physiological</b> <b>ripeness,</b> which decreases slowly during storage (Goel and Sheoran 2003). Various factors affect seed viability during events that precede sowing, such as the degree of maturity, state of seed development, and mechanical damage that is caused during harvesting (Eskandari 2012) or storage. The loss of seed viability is an inevitable consequence of storage and depends primarily on the temperature and relative humidity of the storage conditions, the moisture content of the seed, the duration of storage, and the type and initial quality of the seeds (Daniel 2007).|$|E
40|$|Grape {{polyphenols}} {{are characterized}} by a large range of structures diversely distributed {{in every part of}} the berry. The knowledge on the phenolic composition of grapes and its evolution during ripening is thus of crucial importance in relation to wine quality. Among them, anthocyanins, located in the skins, are responsible for the red colour of the grapes, while flavonoids and especially flavan- 3 -ols intervene in their taste, astringency and bitterness. In this study, total polyphenols, flavonoids, flavan- 3 -ols and anthocyanins were determined in the pulp, skins and seeds of Vranec grapes in three ripening stages: veraison, technological and <b>physiological</b> <b>ripeness,</b> applying standardized spectrophotometric methods [1, 2]. Extraction of phenolic compounds from grape pulp, seeds and skins was performed with acetone/water mixture (80 / 20, v/v). Results showed that the concentration of total phenolics in skins increased during ripening (21. 21 mg/g, 48. 17 mg/g, 61. 55 mg/g, {{at the beginning of the}} ripeness, at technological and <b>physiological</b> <b>ripeness,</b> respectively), but they slightly decreased in the seeds. Concentration of the total flavonoids in skins and seeds increased during the ripening process, as well as the anthocyanin content in skins, which was highest in the late harvested grapes. Flavan- 3 -ols in the seeds were present in highest concentration at the verasion phase, while in the skins their content increased during ripening reaching highest amount at the technological stage. Vranec grapes presented high content of phenolics, flavonoids, anthocyanins and flavan- 3 -ols, which are main antioxidant components in the wines. This traditional domestic variety, rich in polyphenols and colour, dominates in the Macedonian vineyards and possesses a strong capacity for making a high quality wine recognizable in the world...|$|E
40|$|Pescabivona [Prunus persica (L.) Batch] is {{the name}} of an {{autochthonous}} peach population of the Middle-West of Sicily. Samples of the four Pescabivona landraces (Murtiddara, Bianca, Agostina, and Settembrina) were harvested at three different altitudes and analysed for chemical, physico-chemical, and sensory descriptors. The data obtained have supported the application for registration of Pescabivona as Protected Geographical Indication (P. G. I.). Statistic data processing outlined a substantial match in the composition of the four landraces at the different altitudes, highlighting high values of flesh firmness corresponding to balanced sugar/acidity ratios, in particular for the late ripening landraces (Agostina and Settembrina). In addition, a large content of lactones (the key odorant molecules) was found. A good agreement between sensory evaluation and composition was observed. In particular, the sensory liking was correlated with the main ripeness parameters, {{as well as with the}} pulp firmness.

40|$|Wine {{is made up}} of {{more than}} one {{thousand}} compounds, the majority of which, such as vitamins and minerals, come from the grapes, while others, like ethanol and glycerol, are products of the winemaking process. Although sugars are either partially or completely transformed, sugar import and accumulation into the ripening berry is a major parameter of wine quality. Sugar status {{is directly related to the}} final alcoholic content of wine, and regulates several genes responsible for the development of its aromatic and organoleptic properties. <b>Physiological</b> <b>ripeness</b> is reached when the grapes achieve sufficiently high sugar levels without loosing too much acidity; however, aromatic and phenolic compound content must also be taken into account. Softening and water content are other essential characteristics of a ripe berry. From a winemaker point of view, optimal grape maturity is essential for wine quality, but is difficult to assess because it is under multifactorial control, involving grapevine cultivar variety and environmental parameters such as soil, temperature, exposure to sun, and hormonal regulation.

A number of pigment indices were calculated using these spectra, targeting chlorophyll, carotenoids and xanthophylls. Some of these measures were clearly lower in pale bananas grown under paper bunch covers but converged after day 5 of ripening.

40|$|The {{composition}} of polyphenols in the skin, seed and pulp extracts of the grapes of Vranec and Smederevka varieties, and Merlot and Chardonnay as well, was analyzed by liquid chromatography-diode array detectionmass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) and MS/MS techniques. Thirty-one phenolic compounds, including anthocyanins, flavonols and flavan- 3 -ols, {{as well as}} phenolic acids derivatives, {{have been identified in}} the extracts prepared from the grapes at physiological maturity, by mass spectrometry applying electrospray ionization operated in alternating ion mode and by performing tandem MS experiments in the ion trap mass analyzer. Grapes were analyzed at three different phases: (i) veraison, (ii) <b>physiological</b> <b>ripeness</b> and (iii) late harvest, in order to follow the evolution of polyphenolic content during berry development, applying spectrophotometric methods. Vranec had a higher polyphenolic content compared to Merlot due to the higher levels of total phenolics and flavonoids in the skins and seeds as well as a higher content of flavan- 3 -ols and anthocyanins in the skins, allowing discriminating the varieties. HPLC-DAD-MS analysis presented significantly higher relative amounts of anthocyanin monoglucosides and p-coumaroylglucosides in Vranec grapes. Smederevka seeds had a higher amount of flavan- 3 -ols than Chardonnay, while a higher content of total phenolics and flavonoids was found in the skins of the Chardonnay variety.

In the study the influence of this factor on the content of chlorogenic acid (CGA), ascorbic acid (AA), total polyphenols (TPC) and antioxidant capacity (TAC) in six potato cultivars (Viola, Malvina, Evelin, Arlet, Megan, Timea) was investigated. Potatoes were grown in vitro on peat substrate in a greenhouse and were harvested in the stage of <b>physiological</b> <b>ripeness.</b> The content of CGA, AA and the TAC were determined in fresh matter of potato tubers. CGA content was determined using standard HPLC gradient method. The lowest CGA amount was determined in cv. Viola (18. 49 mg/kg FM) and the highest one in cv. Megan (46. 73 mg/kg FM). The determined AA content was in interval 5. 40 mg/ 100 g FM (cv. Evelin) – 20. 10 mg/ 100 g FM (cv. Viola). Total antioxidant capacity expressed as mg eqv. Trolox/kg FM was the lowest in cv.

40|$|The {{effects of}} crop load and berry {{exposure}} on {{the composition of}} Marlborough Sauvignon blanc grapes and wine from the Brancott vineyard, Blenheim, were explored. Commercially grown, 2 -cane and 4 -cane Sauvignon blanc vines were used with a row orientation of north-south. Two exposure treatments were imposed in the following manner: complete leaf removal was undertaken in the fruit zone and 50 % shade cloth was erected to give a uniform shading treatment to half the trial vines. Weekly thirty-berry and whole bunch samples were taken {{from each of the}} 32 plots {{with the exception of the}} veraison period when two samples per week were taken. Vine vigour was assessed using pruning and leaf area per vine data. Harvest occurred on different dates for 2 -cane and 4 -cane pruned vines so that fruit attained from both treatments had similar °Brix. Fruit was processed at the Lincoln University winery. Must analysis and wine analysis were undertaken. As expected, 4 -cane vines had almost double the yield of 2 -cane vines. Higher crop load significantly reduced leaf area per shoot and shoot thickness. Lower leaf area to fruit ratio for 4 -cane berries resulted in delayed onset of veraison and slowed the rate of sugar accumulation. Crop load, which limited leaf area to fruit ratio, appeared to be the dominant factor in determining timing of grape <b>physiological</b> <b>ripeness</b> as expressed by °Brix over other factors such as fruit exposure. Malic acid, tartaric acid, IPMP (iso-propylmethoxypyrazine) and IBMP (iso-butyl-methoxypyrazine) were lower at equivalent °Brix in 4 -cane compared with 2 -cane berries. Significantly higher concentrations of quercetin were found in exposed compared to shaded berries. Must analysis showed a significant influence of crop load on berry titratable acidity and pH, reflecting berry ripening results. Exposure significantly increased the concentrations of nitrogenous compounds in 4 -cane must yet showed no influence on 2 -cane must. After wine processing lower malic acid concentrations in wines made from 100 % exposed fruit became evident in lower wine titratable acidity but showed no influence on wine pH. Bentonite addition to wines had a small but statistically significant influence on wine by reducing pH, titratable acidity and alcohol. Bound sulphur concentrations were significantly higher in 4 -cane versus 2 -cane wines. At harvest, methoxypyrazine levels in grapes and wines were very low; IBMP concentrations where significantly lower than those normally found in Sauvignon blanc wines from Marlborough. This was attributed to the absence of basal leaves from the shoots of ripening berries. The results suggest that leaf area to fruit ratio is a powerful determinant of grape and wine quality...|$|E
40|$|Overview of projects, project results, funding {{bodies and}} {{partners}} in 2002 {{and plans for}} 2003 Including: SOIL MANAGEMENT * Evaluation of leaf analysis in organic fruit growing {{as a tool for}} measuring the uptake of nutrients: Consultants and researchers exchanged practical experiences and the LBI hopes to work with target values. * Impact of sulphur stress: The fruit quality seemed to be better in the reduced sulphur treatment (27 kg /ha instead of 60 kg /ha after flowering). * Fertilisation: In a late summer fertilisation trial with Elstar, trees fertilised late summer/autumn have a higher nitrogen content in the bud the following spring. And fertilising just before winter leads to increased growth of weeds in the next season. * Ground cover: The key to white clover undergrowth is to ‘do it properly or not at all’. It is difficult for an organic grower to restore undergrowth which has been invaded by grasses to bare earth. Undergrowth is definitely not the answer for fruit growers who have any difficulty with mechanical weeding. The management of ground cover requires at least as much mechanisation as the bare tree strip. REGULATING GROWTH AND CROP * Steps to counter biennialism in Elstar: A trial was set up at three orchards combining various measures: thinning or not thinning with two or three applications of lime sulphur, adapted pruning, 3 levels of fruit bearing (30, 40, 50 tonne/ha) and early or late manual thinning. This trial should demonstrate the relative significance of the various measures. Flowering will be evaluated in the spring of 2003. * Fruiting spur pruning in Elstar: To obtain better insight into the effect of different pruning methods three pruning treatments were used: standard pruning, removal of an extra large amount of fruiting spurs, and removal of extra fruiting spurs but sparing smooth one-year-old shoots. The production of the trees has been estimated and the blossom will be evaluated in the spring of 2003. * Effect of thinning times, fertilisation and bearing on regularity of production and fruit quality in Elstar: Ripening was delayed by the high nitrogen dose and associated higher acid content. Despite the late ripening the firmness was still lower, the calcium content lower and the nitrogen content higher. All three factors pro- duce a clear deterioration in quality. On the other hand, the sugar and acidity were higher in this case, but both these values fall within the target band. The trial will continue in 2003 CANKER * Administering calcium hydroxide against Cancer through the sprinkler irrigation system: Despite its effectiveness, sprinkling with calcium hydroxide cannot as yet be generally recommended for practical application. All the difficulties stem {{from the fact that the}} agent does not really dissolve, and the suspension formed very rapidly settles out. FRUIT QUALITY * Optimum picking time for Santana: Santana is a relatively new variety, and further investigation is required into optimising cultivation and storage. The apples only developed their full flavour when picked some time after the point of <b>physiological</b> <b>ripeness.</b> * Sprinkling to combat sunscald: By sprinkling under specific conditions an average of 1. 38 fruits per tree was protected from sunscald. Per hectare sprinkling on these three days yielded around € 621 per ha. (Assuming: 3000 trees/ha, 6 fruits/kg, price € 1. 10 or € 0. 20 for industrial use). * Rot resistance test: The Louis Bolk Instituut is attempting to develop a test for the evaluation of the natural resistance of the fruit. This demonstrates, for example that apples with a high nitrogen content have more and larger areas of rot than apples with a lower nitrogen content. * Prospects offered by calcium chloride (CaCl 2) before or after harvest: A pilot experiment was carried out on a farm to look into the prospects of spraying with CaCl 2 before the harvest or rinsing with CaCl 2 after harvest to reduce fruit rot. Neither treatment led to a reduction in fruit rot, but rather to an increase. * International association for ‘Organic Food, Quality and Health’ (FQH) : The purpose of the group of researchers and traders brought together under the FQH banner is to develop a new concept of quality based on life processes and to select and further develop relevant methods of measurement. ...|$|E
