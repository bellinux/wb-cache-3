At the Macro level, NPA’S have choked off the supply line of credit to the potential borrowers, thereby having a negative effect on capital formation and arresting the economic activity in the country. At the Micro level, the unsustainable level of NPA’s has eroded the profitability of banks through reduced interest income and <b>provisioning</b> <b>requirements,</b> besides restricting the recycling of funds leading to serious asset-liability mismatches...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of having in place a financial regulatory framework that includes macro-prudential regulations was fully recognized during the recent global financial crisis. A central lesson from that episode was that relying on regulations that solely assessed the risks that financial institutions were taking on their individual balance sheets (a micro-prudential approach) was inadequate to preserve financial system stability. This policy brief deals with advances in the Andean countries regarding the implementation of macro-prudential financial regulations; that is, regulations that take into account risks at the systemic level. We focus specially on three regulatory tools: liquidity requirements, counter-cyclical capital requirements and counter-cyclical loan-loss <b>provisioning</b> <b>requirements.</b> ...|$|E

However, the performance of legacy TCP applications over differentiated services is still influenced by bursty packet loss behavior.

We present the marker design and resulting performance improvements in terms of improved predictability of service, reduced <b>provisioning</b> <b>requirements,</b> better fairness and fewer TCP timeouts. Though the marker improves assured service performance predictability compared to a simple token bucket marker, the performance is still dependent to some extent on TCP dynamics. 1 Introduction There is a distinct need to move towards providing service differentiation (diff-serv) in the Internet.

And virtual machine migration is key enabler for dynamic resource management in cloud-based systems. Live virtual machine migration transfers the “state ” of a virtual machine from one physical machine to another thereby can mitigate overloaded conditions and enables uninterrupted maintenance activities. In this paper we will come across three main scenarios in virtual machine migration: when, which and where to migrate. Main discussion area in this paper is the scenario, “where to migrate”, to choose the destination node to which virtual machine get migrated. A bad choice would lead to a cascade in migration and thereby will create a cyclic effect. So we have to select the better node in order to minimize further migration. For this, we propose a MVMM algorithm to minimize the virtual machine migration...|$|E

Since SLAs specify the performance that an ISP guarantees to its customers, they provide critical context for many configuration and provisioning decisions and have specific relevance to buffer sizing. We use a controlled laboratory environment to explore the tradeoffs between buffer size and a set of performance metrics over a range of traffic mixtures for three different router designs. Our empirical study reveals performance profiles that are surprisingly robust to differences in router architecture and traffic mix and suggests a design space within which buffer sizing decisions can be made in practice. We then present a preliminary approach for making buffer sizing decisions within this framework that relates directly to performance and <b>provisioning</b> <b>requirements</b> in SLAs...|$|E

40|$|Supporting {{independent}} VCR-like interactivity in true-video-on-demand {{requires the}} allocation of channel to each interactive user. In the worst case, the system must be provisioned with a unique channel for each user. A variety of techniques have been proposed to ease this requirement by aggregating users into groups. Bridging of the temporal skew between users viewing the same content is one such technique that achieves this result. In this paper we describe a prototype video-on-demand system that delivers continuous media content to multiple clients using a bridging technique called dynamic service aggregation. Rate adaptation and content insertion are used to achieve resource reclamation on-the-fly, thus improving performance and <b>provisioning</b> <b>requirements</b> in interactive scenarios.

Resource multiplexing is done through the virtualization technology in cloud computing.

However, due to the availability of finite resources, it is very challenging for cloud service providers to facilitate all the demanded services efficiently. From the cloud service provider’s perspective, cloud resources must be allocated in a fair manner. This paper addresses the existing techniques for resource allocation in cloud computing and proposes the dynamic resource allocation technique to mitigate overloads. It also focuses on energy consumption issue of cloud data centres and devised technique for lower energy consumption in order to achieve green cloud computing...|$|E

40|$|Most {{explanations}} of the crisis of 2007 - 2009 emphasize {{the role of the}} preceding boom in real estate and asset markets in a variety of advanced countries. As a result, an idea that is gaining support among various groups is how to make Basel II or any regulatory regime less pro-cyclical. This paper addresses the rationale for and likely contribution of such policies. Making provisioning (or capital) requirements countercyclical is one way potentially to address pro-cyclicality, and accordingly it looks at the efforts of the authorities in Spain and Colombia, two countries in which countercyclical provisioning has been tried, to see what the track record has been. As explained there, these experiments have been at best too recent and limited to put much weight on them, but they are much less favorable for supporting this practice than is commonly admitted. The paper then addresses concerns and implementation issues with countercyclical capital or <b>provisioning</b> <b>requirements,</b> including why their impact might be expected to be limited, and concludes with recommendations for developing country officials who want to learn how to make their financial systems less exposed to crises.

40|$|Many {{observers}} have proposed new regulatory content, specifically macro prudential regulatory powers, which would vary prudential standards {{over time to}} rein in financial system risks before they become too inflated. Others have pointed to problems in the existing structure of regulation, especially the need to divest the Fed of its day-to-day authority over regulation and supervision. The Fed should {{be removed from the}} day-to-day micro supervision and regulation to avoid its politicization, which threatens the independence of monetary policy and the effectiveness of regulation.

That model would describe how time-varying financial risk is measured, and how moments of high risk are identified. The framework would delineate how minimum capital requirements, <b>provisioning</b> <b>requirements,</b> and reserve requirements would respond to significant perceived increases in system-wide risk.
