Unlike the last two singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, the artwork doesn't follow the <b>picture-in-picture</b> theme.|$|E

2500|$|Time {{magazine}} {{praised the}} series, saying [...] "Forget sleeping through this one--you won't {{even want to}} blink. 24 is the most distinctive, addictive new TV series this season. As an old-fashioned thriller, it's relentless, tense and deliciously paranoiac, with more twists than a Twizzler. But it's also boldly different. Most notably, there's its clever visual signature: <b>picture-in-picture</b> screens that show two, three and even four different scenes simultaneously." [...] Time also noted that [...] "The show takes {{to the next level}} the trend of serial story 'arcs', which began with '80s dramas like Hill Street Blues and Wiseguy and which continues on The West Wing and The Sopranos." [...] Time also praised the performances of Kiefer Sutherland and Dennis Haysbert, saying that [...] "It helps that there's a strong cast driving the train. Haysbert is commanding, if a tad underutilized in the pilot, as an idealist with a dangerous secret. And Sutherland plays the gravel-voiced Bauer with an assurance that belies his teen-movie-star past; his overstressed agent is stalwart but weary, a haunted spook." ...|$|E
2500|$|The camera app {{implements}} numerous {{new features}} (some {{of which were}} first seen on the Galaxy Camera), including an updated interface, and new modes such as [...] "Drama" [...] (which composes a moving element from multiple shots into a single photo), [...] "Eraser" [...] (which takes multiple shots and allows the user to remove unnecessary elements from a picture), [...] "Dual Shot" [...] (which uses the front-facing camera for a <b>picture-in-picture</b> effect), [...] "Sound and Shot" [...] (which allows the user to record a voice clip alongside a photo), [...] "Animated Photo", and [...] "Story Album" [...] among others.
