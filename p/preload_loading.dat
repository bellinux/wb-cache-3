According to the {{monitoring}} results of soft clay treated by preloading with plastic drainage pipe, the consolidation settlement effect of soft clay with 50 kPa <b>preloading</b> <b>load,</b> 21 m plastic pipe, 1. 2 m and 1. 5 m distance was {{compared with that}} of 30 kPa <b>preloading</b> <b>load,</b> 6 m plastic pipe, 1. 5 m and 2. 0 m distance. The analysis showed that, the preloading method with deep plastic drainage pipe can accelerate the dissipation of excess pore water pressure in deep soft soil.

In order to study the variation of pore water pressure, the full-scale field tests were performed. It was indicated that the variation of pore water pressure was influenced by water pressures on the sealing membrane and negative pressures in sand cushion. The variation of stress in soil was equal {{to the difference between}} the values of pore pressure before and during vacuum preloading, indicating that water pressures on the sealing membrane could act as <b>preloading</b> <b>loads.</b> When the depth of water on membrane increased, the positive pore pressure would be induced in soil which, and it similar to the surcharge load. The distribution of negative pore pressure in soil was not uniform, causing differential settlement and strength increase. 孔隙水壓力的量測和分析對研究水下真空預壓法具有重要意義。在已經完成的水下真空預壓現場試驗中,把孔隙水壓力做為主要研究對象進行了監測。結果顯示孔隙水壓力的變化受膜上水壓和膜下負壓的影響。水下真空預壓期間土體中各點應力的改變等于加固前孔壓與加固過程中孔壓之差。膜上水壓可以做為預壓荷載。當膜上水壓增大時,增加的水壓使土體產生正的超靜孔隙水壓力,相當于堆載。水下真空預壓過程中負超靜孔壓分布的不均勻使加固區內產生差異沉降和不均勻的強度增長。link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

METHODS: Radiodense markers were inserted into bones at the attachment sites of the cruciate ligaments in sixteen cadaveric stifles of adult dogs. Each stifle was then mounted in a testing apparatus. The distances between the markers were measured on mediolateral radiographs, performed on each stifle under three different situations: intact, after CrCL transection, and after performing a TTA. Stifles were loaded to create a constant tibiofemoral reaction force by maintaining the load parallel to the patellar ligament. Radiographs were taken in a <b>preloaded</b> and <b>loaded</b> state in the intact stifle and only in a loaded state after CrCL transection, and after performing a TTA. RESULTS: Loading the stifle joints after transection of the CrCL resulted in a mean lengthening of the CrCL marker distance of 22. 4 %. Loading the transected CrCL stifles after performing a TTA resulted in a mean shortening of the CrCL marker distance by 3. 0 % compared to the loaded intact condition.
