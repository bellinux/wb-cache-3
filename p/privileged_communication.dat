2500|$|On June21, Bradley {{discovered}} that a flaw in his software misread the forensic data and that the word [...] "chloroform" [...] had been searched for only one time and the website in question offered information {{on the use of}} chloroform in the 19th century. On June 23, Baez called Cindy Anthony to the stand, who told jurors she had been the one who performed the [...] "chloroform" [...] search on the family computer in March 2008. The prosecution alleged that only Casey Anthony could have conducted this search and the others because {{she was the only one}} home at the time. When asked by prosecutors how she could have made the Internet searches when employment records show she was at work, Cindy Anthony said despite what her work time sheet indicates, she was at home during these time periods because she left from work early during the days in question. Bradley alerted prosecutor Linda Burdick and Sgt. Kevin Stenger of the Sheriff's Office the weekend of June 25 about the discrepancy in his software, and volunteered to fly to Orlando at his own expense to show them. On the same day, the judge temporarily halted proceedings when the defense filed a motion to determine if Anthony was competent to proceed with trial. The motion states the defense received a <b>privileged</b> <b>communication</b> from their client which caused them to believe [...] "...Ms. Anthony is not competent to aid and assist in her own defense". The trial resumed on June27 when the judge announced that the results of the psychological evaluations showed Anthony was competent to proceed. Later, in testimony about air samples, Dr. Ken Furton, a professor of chemistry at Florida International University, stated that there is no consensus in the field on what chemicals are typical of human decomposition. Judge Perry ruled that the jury would not get to smell air samples taken from the trunk.|$|E

The effectiveness of one-way communication, however, remains unaffected even though compliance with a sender's suggestion to cooperate generates unfavorable payoff inequalities for message receivers.

5000|$|Prior to the decision, {{a circuit}} split existed {{on the issue}} of attorney-client {{privilege}} in corporate representations. The dominant view was the [...] "control group" [...] test, under which privilege between an attorney and a corporation only extended to communications with decision-makers (i.e. senior executives) of the company, the rationale being that (1) only those individuals could cause the company to act on the lawyer's advice; (2) an expansive privilege would make it easy for corporations to shield themselves from discovery; and (3) a bright line between <b>privileged</b> and non-privileged <b>communication</b> would allow corporations and judges to easily determine who could and could not exercise privilege. This view was followed consistently by the federal courts until 1970, when the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit adopted a [...] "subject matter" [...] test under which other employees' communications with company lawyers could be subject to privilege, if made in relation to their employment and at the direction of superiors. Some other federal courts adopted this view during the 1970s, with some maintaining the control group test and others adopting a hybrid of the two.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Natural {{language}} interfaces {{will provide}} a <b>privileged</b> line of <b>communication</b> between humans and cognitive robots. In this context, the current research demonstrates that a system that perceives visual scenes and speech can use associative learning to construct a mapping between structure in visual scenes, and the grammatical structure of sentences that describe those scenes. This learned mapping allows the system to processes natural language sentences in order to reconstruct complex internal representations of the visual scenes that those sentences describe. In the system, low level perceptual processes of speech segmentation and visual object recognition and tracking are provided by commercial software. Structure is then further extracted from these representations, and a novel associative learning technique is employed to establish the mappings between different grammatical structures and the corresponding event structure of the paired visual scene. During post-learning sentence interpretation, the appropriate mapping of grammatical structure to scene structure is retrieved based on grammatical markers inherent to the sentence. The system demonstrates error free performance for a rich subset of English that includes complex hierarchical grammatical structure. The benefits of the novel approach to scene analysis and language learning, and their interaction, are discussed.

40|$|In {{studies of}} how drug {{advertising}} influences doctors 2 ̆ 7 behaviour, little attention {{is given to}} visual and linguistic imagery. The authors argue that myth is often deployed in drug adverts to depict exaggerated therapeutic efficacy and that doctors {{should be aware of}} this.

There is evidence that advertising influences doctors 2 ̆ 7 behaviour more than they might think. Important pockets of research exist in this area but tend to focus on the scientific validity of the text and rarely give much attention to visual and linguistic imagery. If advertising influences beliefs and behaviour and images are used in advertising, then images must contribute to influencing beliefs and behaviour. One of a range of methods to promote pharmaceutical products, advertising in medical journals offers a <b>privileged</b> channel of <b>communication</b> from drug companies to doctors. Concerns have been expressed about the extent of its influence on prescribing. The industry has been accused of medicalising normal phenomena and promoting drugs as solutions to social problems.

40|$|Taking as its {{starting}} point four Slovenian novels {{published in the}} last fifteen years, each one focussing on a different form of diversity, this work seeks to present certain aspects of this small nation’s contemporary fiction – aspects which reflect cultural tendencies also present in other European countries but which also, however, are not without characteristics deriving from a specific local context.

Basing analysis on considerations which have been influenced by imagology, that is to say the study {{of the way in which}} individuals and groups are perceived and represented by another culture, it is evident that recent Slovenian fiction is not exempt from the presentation of prejudices, stereotypes and clichés that diminish and belittle the “other” in favour of the “self”. At the same time, however, we may discern the possibility that these prejudices may be overcome: in all the four novels under examination it is the ‘outsider’ who narrates his/her own story, thus unavoidably creating a <b>privileged</b> channel of <b>communication</b> with the reader...|$|R
40|$|Information has gained, in {{the last}} decade, a huge importance. It is an {{extremely}} valuable social resource, for it generates wealth and it leads to scientific progress. Due to the new information technologies and the World Wide Web – the new <b>privileged</b> means of <b>communication</b> – information has acquired a digital basis which has made its production, distribution and diffusion easier, fulfilling the growing needs of organizations and individuals. However, because it is too vulnerable, digital information presents new challenges {{when we think of}} its preservation. The fast degradation of the media and the technological obsolescence and dependence make this kind of information unlikely to endure. For that reason, thinking about the preservation of digital information is, perhaps, more important than considering the preservation of analogical information, not only because of its economical value but also because its uniqueness demands ongoing and more complex actions and preservation strategies. Although the preservation of digital information is a task for a multitude of entities (such as authors/producers, hardware and software engineers, publishers/distributors, governments, users/consumers, etc.), libraries are still the irreplaceable agents to ensure that the cultural, literary and scientific heritage remains imperishable, now in a digital basis. Assuming this thought as a starting point, this essay presents the main features, concepts, strategies and challenges placed by the preservation of digital information, through the libraries perspective...|$|R

Documents may be {{classified}} according to their producers as secular (imperial and private documents) or sacred (patriarchal and episcopal documents), or according to their means of preservation (the originals, imitations, or simple copies). Imperial documents may be divided into those that promulgate law (types: edikton, typos, pragmatikos typos, thespisma, neara, nomos, sakra; mandatum principis), present decisions regarding specific cases (Epistula type: epistule, sakra; Subscriptio type: lysis taxes, semeiosis), documents of foreign policy (treaties, letters to foreign rulers) (types: sakrai, grammata, basilikon, chrysobullos horismos, chrysobullon sigillon, prokuratorikon chrysobullon) and administrative documents (types: prostagmata, horismoi, sigillia, codicilli).

An overall observation of the existing municipal Web sites obviously shows the great variety of the objectives at stake, and of the technological solutions implemented. Despite the increasing number of researches dealing with the democratization of e-information addressed to citizens and e-governments, it is still difficult to clearly identify the current <b>privileged</b> means of <b>communication</b> between cities and citizens on the basis of cartographic data. This difficulty is related to the absence of formal and effective frameworks to characterize and classify the various ways to diffuse geospatial information on municipal Web sites. On the basis of the above, the present research aims at remedying this ignorance by elaborating a new classification framework to effectively describe GIS-based Web sites in municipal contexts. The adopted strategy consists in analysing the already existing partial approaches of classification, in order to pursue with the development of a more comprehensive pragmatic classification framework. This framework is then the subject of an experimentation consisting of a detailed analysis of the contents and functioning of a hundred existing municipal Web sites in Canada. Finally, this experimentation makes it possible to draw initial conclusions regarding the usability of the new classification mode proposed, as well as to identify some further research pathways...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} white-male elite understandings {{of diversity and}} leadership to consider possibilities for exploring articulations of white masculinity. Sixteen semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} white-male leaders in their organizations who by virtue of their race, gender, class, and education, exercise much power and control in their organization. I used grounded theory methodology to highlight the communication strategies that white-male elites employed when talking about leadership and diversity. Techniques in grounded theory methodology yielded concepts, descriptors, and semantic moves that were articulated to intersecting discourses of race, gender, and sexuality. Through the intersectional matrix, I posited that multiple functions of social identities of white-male elites are essential in (re) producing positions of power. Nuanced talk on leadership and diversity (re) produced discourses of white masculinity as intersecting discourses operating within particular functions of white hegemonic masculinity—white, heterosexual, and patriarchal power. White-male elites in this study used four communication strategies when discussing leadership and diversity: some white-male elites highlighted the significance of race in society, while others denounced race for more appropriate observations outside of racial identity categories; many white-male elites approved binary categories between men and women; some white-male elites buttressed race transcendent ideas; and some white-male elites verified their own <b>privileged</b> positioning. These <b>communication</b> strategies revealed the contradictory meanings of race and gender in white-male elite discourses on leadership and diversity. Thus, theorizing white masculinity constitutes the negotiation of identity politics within social anxieties of the multicultural context. The notion of studying up is important in revealing the context in which I, a black heterosexual male researcher, construct meanings about white heterosexual male bodies. This context provides a unique location within the intersectional matrix to observe the process of communication operating in the creative engagement, management, and negotiation of meanings in co-creating, reproducing, and reaffirming whiteness, heterosexuality, and masculinity ideologies.
