2500|$|Compared {{to single}} data rate (SDR) SDRAM, the DDR SDRAM {{interface}} makes higher transfer rates possible by more strict {{control of the}} timing of the electrical data and clock signals. Implementations often have to use schemes such as <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loops</b> and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy. The interface uses double pumping (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency down is that it reduces the signal integrity requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name [...] "double data rate" [...] refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the bandwidth of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this double pumping.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 65) This {{paper is}} {{about the nature of}} the <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> circuit and its applications. The emphasis is on describing the operation of the <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> as a frequency synthesizer. The principle of the <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> has been known since the early 1930 's and was first used in the 1940 's for the synchronization of the horizontal and vertical sweep oscillators in television receivers. Because of the prohibitive cost, however, widespread use of the principle did not begin until the development of the monolithic integrated circuit and the incorporation of complete phaselocked loop circuits in low-cost IC packages. This paper is an introduction to the theory, design, and implementation of the <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> frequency synthesizer, using both CMOS and ECL devices. The paper begins with an introduction to the phaselocked loop principle, followed by a description of the loop elements, with particular emphasis on low pass filters, which often control the loop performance. Succeeding sections then discuss different applications of the <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> circuit and its common terminology. The final sections cover the design of the PLL frequency synthesizers and certain important experimental results...|$|R

A voltage controlled oscil-lator is directly tuned by this phase mismatch and synthesizes an harmonic signal for actuation. Therefore, the frequency of the signal synthesized by the <b>phase-locked</b> <b>loop</b> will gradually be adjusted to the resonance frequency of the Coriolis mass flow sensor, making it more robust to disturbances. Besides, waveform shape and amplitude can be easily altered.
