40|$|Aim. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to estimate an influence of <b>parachute</b> <b>jumps</b> on the level of ACTH and cortizol hormones among professional soldiers from air-borne forces. Methods. The investigation was carried out on 46 professional soldiers from 16 Air-Borne Battalion, patients of the outpatient department – SPZOZ JW. 4495, men at 20 to 45 age, healthy – admitted to <b>parachute</b> <b>jumping</b> in air-borne forces. They were divided into groups according to their knowledge and an experience in parachuting. Venous blood samples were taken to examine the level of ACTH and cortizol hormones three times during experiment: on a free day, day of <b>parachute</b> <b>jumping</b> and 24 hrs after jump. Additionally in order to estimate the level of nervous tension and mental stress, in every stage of the experiment, personal questionnaires in accordance with STAI were carried out. Results. The results show the influence of psychological stress related to <b>parachute</b> <b>jumps</b> on the level of ACTH and cortizol hormones depending on experience in parachuting...|$|R
