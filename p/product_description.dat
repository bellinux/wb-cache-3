Although willing to credit Moore and Gair with the rebirth of bodypainting in a San Francisco Chronicle story, the [...] "makeup artist, wig maker and stylist" [...] Jim Ponder had difficulty calling interest in bodypainting a trend because it traces back to the [...] "beginnings of man." [...] Joanne Gair has described the painting as a stylized reference to Botticelli, since the sinuous pose {{is reminiscent of the}} central figures in both Primavera and The Birth of Venus. The Amazon.com <b>product</b> <b>description</b> for Gair's book calls her participation in this photoshoot as her [...] "defining moment." [...] Soon after the release of the magazine Gair became such a pop culture icon that she was considered for an Absolut Vodka Absolut Gair ad campaign according to a story in The New York Times. The work is considered to be an example from the most sophisticated end of the bodypainting spectrum which extends all the way to Henna tattoos.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{shopping}} agent with a robust inductive learning method that automatically constructs wrappers for semistructured online stores. Strong biases assumed in many existing systems are weakened {{so that the}} real stores with reasonably complex document structures can be handled. Our method treats a logical line as a basic unit, and recognizes the position {{and the structure of}} <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> by finding the most frequent pattern from the sequence of logical line information in output HTML pages. This method is capable of analyzing <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> that comprise multiple logical lines, and even those with extra or missing attributes. Experimental tests on over 60 sites show that it successfully constructs correct wrappers for most real stores. 1 Introduction A shopping agent is a mediator system that extracts the <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> from several online stores on a user's behalf. Since the stores are heterogeneous, a procedure for extracting the cont [...] ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{product line}} engineering, domain {{analysis}} {{is the process}} of analyzing related products to identify their common and variable features. This process is generally carried out by experts on the basis of existing <b>product</b> <b>descriptions,</b> which are expressed in a more or less structured way. Modeling and reasoning about <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> are error-prone and time consuming tasks. Feature models (FMs) constitute popular means to specify product commonalities and variabilities in a compact way, and to provide automated support to the domain analysis process. This paper aims at easing the transition from <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> expressed in a tabular format to FMs accurately representing them. This process is parameterized through a dedicated language and high-level directives (e. g., products/features scoping). We guarantee that the resulting FM represents the set of legal feature combinations supported by the considered products and has a readable tree hierarchy together with variability information. We report on our experiments based on public data and characterize the properties of the derived FMs...|$|R

A common solution is that a catalogue specialist manually maps different classifications onto each other. Our approach avoids unnecessary manual work for mapping and automatically generates mappings between different classifications wherever possible. This allows us to run E-procurement applications on different catalogues with significantly reduced manual work needed for mapping, what we consider {{to be an important}} step towards enterprise application integration...|$|R

40|$|In {{the world}} of {{recommender}} systems, so-called content-based methods are {{an important approach that}} rely on the availability of detailed <b>product</b> or item <b>descriptions</b> to drive the recommendation process. For example, recommendations can be generated for a target user by selecting unseen products that are similar to the products that the target user has liked or purchased in the past. To do this, content-based methods must be able to compute the similarity between pairs of products (unseen products and liked products, for example) and typically this is achieved by comparing product features or other descriptive elements. The approach works well when <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> are readily available and when they are detailed enough to afford an effective similarity comparison. But this is not always the case. Detailed <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> may not be available since they can be expensive to create and maintain. In this article we consider another source of <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{in the form of the}} user-generated reviews that frequently accompany products on the web. We ask whether it is possible to mine these reviews, unstructured and noisy as they are, to produce useful <b>product</b> <b>descriptions</b> that can be used in a recommendation system. In particular we describe a novel approach to product recommendation that harnesses not only the features that can be mined from user-generated reviews but also the expressions of sentiment that are associated with these features. We present a recommendation ranking strategy that combines similarity and sentiment to suggest products that are similar but superior to a query product according to the opinion of reviewers, and we demonstrate the practical benefits of this approach across a variety of Amazon product domains...|$|R
