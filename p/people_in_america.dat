5|$|She {{used her}} access {{to form a}} {{coalition}} of leaders from black organizations called the Federal Council of Negro Affairs, but which {{came to be known}} as the Black Cabinet. It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing black <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>America.</b> It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly men, who had been appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of black people working in higher positions in government. It suggested to voters that the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they did not directly create public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters; they influenced political appointments and disbursement of funds to organizations that would benefit black people.|$|E

[...] Richard Pryor's approval helped retain the segment in the film. The studio became more enthusiastic about the film when Reitman showed executives and sales managers of various regions in the country a 10-minute production reel that was put together in two days. The reaction was positive and the studio sent 20 copies out to exhibitors. The first preview screening for Animal House was held in Denver four months before it opened nationwide.

500|$|Another {{group of}} <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> {{had their own}} risky {{crossings}} over the Niagara Gorge as they fled over the border into Canada. [...] They were enslaved African-Americans who sought freedom by escaping to a country that declared the liberation of any slave who entered it. [...] The bridge {{was part of the}} Underground Railroad, a network of routes designed to smuggle slaves in the United States to freedom in Canada. [...] Before the American Civil War, fleeing slaves had only four main routes into Canada, of which one was crossing the Niagara River. [...] Slaves who escaped along the Niagara route had help from several quarters. [...] The state of New York generally favored granting freedom to slaves; this attitude emboldened African-American workers in Niagara, who frequently helped slaves flee to Canada. [...] Before the Suspension Bridge was completed, fugitives either crossed the raging river on a boat or risked their lives by swimming at calmer points of the river. [...] The Suspension Bridge made escape across the river easier and safer, although there was still risk. [...] To avoid getting caught and sent back to their owners, slaves had to sneak across on foot or hide aboard trains and oxcarts. [...] Antislavery activist Harriet Tubman guided fugitives at night and bribed custom officials to turn a blind eye. [...] As a result, many slaves crossed the Suspension Bridge to freedom before the United States was engulfed in civil war.|$|E
