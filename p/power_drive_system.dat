The evolution of servomotors {{and the recent}} arrival on the market of power drive systems including safety functions have contributed to their emergence. For example, servomotors are used {{to participate in the}} "safe" stopping of the slide when protective devices are actuated. There is still no European or international standard for these specific presses, though a draft is scheduled at ISO standardization level. This document presents an inventory of specific servopress techniques and the results of their detailed study in normal operation {{and in the case of}} failure. In particular, it points out that a safety-related <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system,</b> when affected by a failure, reacts to the latter by initiating a failsafe position which may be different from the initially intended safety function performances.

On 3 rd December 2014 at 05 : 22 CEST, an H IIA launch vehicle lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center and the Hayabusa 2 spacecraft together with its MASCOT lander began their journey through space. After a cruise of almost four years, Hayabusa 2 with MASCOT will reach their target, where MASCOT will descend to the surface of the Asteroid 1999 JU 3. The innovative hopping mechanism, which was developed at the Robotics and Mechatronics Center (RMC) allows the lander to upright to nominal position and to relocate on asteroid surface by hopping. A big advantage of this movement principle is the independence of the surrounding environment on th e asteroid like rocks, craters and so on. Based on Multi-Body-System simulation the drive was developed and verified by a zero-g flight campaign. Based on the DEXHAND experience, the high <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> could be realized in a very space saving way.
