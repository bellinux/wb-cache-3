5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{contributes}} to modeling a simple social accounting method with cumulative product lifetime distributions and argues how product lifetime extension affects income flow {{throughout the entire}} economic system. Empirical analysis focusing on automobile use (ordinary <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle,</b> small <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and light <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle)</b> in Japan revealed that {{if all of the}} additional income gain from product lifetime extension flows into the investment sector, a one-year lifetime extension during the ten years of the study period (1990 – 2000) would have led to an increase in income in 2000 amounting to + 7  billion yen, as well as contributing to savings in energy amounting to − 4 × 106 GJ. That is, longer-term <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicle</b> use increases income and decreases energy consumption under special cases. We also found that in the general case when less than 93 % of additional income resulting from vehicle lifetime extension is directed to the investment sector, a + 1  year automobile lifetime extension increases income at the expense of energy consumption.

5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles</b> and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E
5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system method of tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike. With the ticket system, a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting. If a motorist loses the ticket, the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where the motorist leaves. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. E-ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas. As of 2017, it costs a passenger vehicle $12.10 to travel {{the length of the}} Northeast Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $8.54 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $1.45 using cash and $0.81 using E-ZPass for <b>passenger</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|E
