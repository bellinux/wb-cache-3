5000|$|The {{machine was}} built {{up from the}} {{backplane}} mounted {{on the right-hand side}} panel of the case, with ten 50-pin card slots. The first and last slots were spaced differently from the rest. Also, the power supplies occupied some of the space needed for the last (which meant that the last card not only had to accommodate the narrow spacing but also could not be full-length), leaving eight [...] "standard" [...] slots available for full-length cards. The front <b>panel</b> <b>plugged</b> into the first slot and the CPU plugged into the second, leaving seven for further expansion. The card slots were arranged on an angle, which allowed the case to be reduced in height. Each card contained its own voltage regulators, using the Z-shaped mounting bracket as a heat-sink. (Power distribution on the backplane was unregulated +8V and +/-18V; the cards regulated these to their requirements, typically +5V and +/- 12V.) ...|$|R

We are a conservative nation, and even more so as we reflect our values onto the facades of our houses. Mobility and Architecture with a capital A have rarely gone together in history.

50|$|Memory was {{addressed}} by words, which were 48 bits long. Each word {{was divided into}} eight 6-bit bytes. A 6-bit byte, {{as opposed to the}} 8-bit byte in common use today, was common in IBM and other scientific computers of the time. The address space provided a maximum of 256K words. The prototype was equipped with 128k words (48 bits plus two parity bits) of memory that was oil and water cooled. Also considered as part of the memory subsystem in that they were addressed via fixed reserved memory addresses, were 4 48 position switch banks, in which a short program could be inserted, and a <b>plug</b> <b>panel,</b> similar to the one used in IBM Unit-Record equipment, that had the capacity of 32 words, so longer bootstrap or diagnostic programs could be installed in <b>plug</b> <b>panels</b> which could then be inserted into the receptacle and used as a primitive ROM. The memory had a cycle time of 2.5 microseconds, and the lack of memory management was a limitation in the computer.|$|R
5000|$|Treasure Planet: In Treasure Planet, {{the portal}} (also {{referred}} to as [...] "a 'big door' opening and closing") is an enormous energy doorway that allows practical, rapid travel between two distant locations anywhere in the universe. The spherical map (holographic projector) that led to Treasure Planet also worked as the portal's control <b>panel</b> once <b>plugged</b> into a keyhole and would project an orbital list of locations. One touch {{on one of the}} projected destinations and the portal would instantly open a doorway to that destination, large enough for a ship to pass through. It is possible that the portal was built by the ancient alien race that created the map and the planet itself (which is actually a large, spherical mechanism composed of incredibly advanced technology).|$|R
2500|$|Colossus {{included}} {{the first ever}} use of shift registers and systolic arrays, enabling five simultaneous tests, each involving up to 100 Boolean calculations, {{on each of the}} five channels on the punched tape (although in normal operation only one or two channels were examined in any run). Initially Colossus was only used to determine the initial wheel positions used for a particular message (termed wheel setting). [...] The Mark 2 included mechanisms intended to help determine pin patterns (wheel breaking). Both models were programmable using switches and <b>plug</b> <b>panels</b> in a way their predecessors had not been.|$|R

Also considered {{as part of the}} memory subsystem in that they were addressed via fixed reserved memory addresses, were four 48 position switch banks, in which a short program could be inserted, and a plugboard, similar to the one used in IBM unit record equipment, that had the capacity of 32 words, so longer bootstrap or diagnostic programs could be installed in <b>plug</b> <b>panels</b> which could then be inserted into the receptacle and used.

50|$|For the dSolar sensor, {{there are}} two 9V {{versions}} with different wattages: a 2W and a 4W model, both of which can power the NXT system or a user's robot. Dexter Industries also produces three additional adapters {{that relate to the}} solar sensor. The first is an optional capacitor bank that serves as a mini-battery; it provides continuous power for NXT projects if the system runs under a shadow or cloud. Second, there is an adapter that allows three solar <b>panels</b> to be <b>plugged</b> in simultaneously; this can provide up to 750 mA at 10 volts. The third adapter is a battery pack that can recharge the NXT battery pack utilizing solar power.|$|R
50|$|In practice, no {{one used}} the {{original}} design concept, and the Solarlok connectors were simply {{one of a number}} of connectors offered by most manufacturers. In these cases a Solarlok connector was placed at the end of the panel's permanent wiring, and in order to allow the <b>panels</b> to be <b>plugged</b> together, they were arranged as plug on one wire and socket on the other. Unfortunately there was no standard for which of these should be positive and which negative, and manufacturers selected them seemingly at random. It was not at all uncommon to find that extension cables would not <b>plug</b> into <b>panels</b> in the field because they had the wrong keys, requiring the cables to be rebuilt with the opposing polarity connectors. Other standards of the era, like MC3, always defined the male to be positive and the socket to be negative, eliminating this issue.|$|R
40|$|I {{have worked}} on my {{examination}} project at Turnhill AB [1], Skellefte√•. The purpose {{of the project was}} to document the network, to tidy up among the network cables in the network room, and to come up with two solutions for a VPN-solution. In the documenting phase I first encountered problems when trying to figure out which devices were plugged in to which ports of the firewall and switch. However, this was solved with time and patience. To simplify this process for future changes, I made two documents, one of which explains what devices are plugged in to which ports on the firewall/switch, and the other explains where the cables plugged in to the patch <b>panel</b> are <b>plugged</b> in to the firewall/switch. With future updates of these lists when changes are made, there should not be any trouble keeping the network neat and tidy. In my research for suitable VPN-solutions I stumbled upon the freeware Logmein Hamachi, which satisfied the needs by far. In consultation with my supervisor we chose to implement it, which did not cause any trouble. For this solution to be available when I am not longer accessible, I made an installation guide so that the employees of the company can use it on their own. When I was to tidy up among the cables I replaced some of the poor cables and shortened some with the help of cable ties, and I also used those to fix the cables in a neat fashion. My conclusions while working on this project were that if Turnhill were to expand their network they will need more switches. Also, if expansion is relevant there should be a reorganization of the cables in the firewall/switch ports, since the network does not look organized at this moment.

40|$|The {{spread of}} {{techniques}} of industrialization in building (great load-bearing panels systems, tunnels and banches-tables with <b>plugging</b> <b>panels,</b> steel structures and mixed steel-in situ concrete) in Italy {{was limited to}} high-densely populated urban areas where important interventions of residential building were made thanks to agreement and public aid. These techniques were also used to resolve emergencies such as the necessity of re-building the building estate after the 1980 earthquake in Campania and Basilicata. This made it easier {{the application of the}} diagnostic method worked out by CIB W 86 Building Pathology Board, because these interventions were realized in few big cities interested also by similar and not usual administrative procedures. Thanks to a deep analysis of 14 interventions, for an amount of about 4. 500 flats, it was noticed a structural lack of quality control processes both on the project and the realization, which is typical of the administrative instruments used for these works, especially the Italian systens of awarding of contract ‚Äúconcessione di sola costruzione‚Äù and ‚Äúappalto concorso‚Äù. This seems {{to be one of the}} main causes of quick decay and bad durability that characterizes the most part of these interventions, corroborating the negative experience of other European Countries, such as England. By a specifically technical point of view, all interventions were studied considering aging state, quality performance, functional defects or anomalies, decay situations and more frequent pathologies, trying to find out causes and possible solutions by the analysis of single cases and the diagnosis of decay process. New failure cases came out, which are worth of attention from specialists, in order to avoid their recurrence. It was also noticed that a correct project and realization can make durable and efficient as for performance also these building systems and neither prejudices and unconditioned enthusiasm are justified. In other words, it is unavoidable a deeper investigation in knowledge and data about the performance in time of this building systems...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} technical {{opportunities to}} serve as parts of a technological roadmap for Shoals Technologies Group in power electronics for PV applications. There are many different power converter circuits {{that can be used}} for solar inverter applications. The present applications do not take advantage of the potential for using common modules. We envision that the development of a power electronics module could enable higher reliability by being durable and flexible. Modules would have fault current limiting features and detection circuits such that they can limit the current through the module from external faults and can identify and isolate internal faults such that the remaining modules can continue to operate with only minimal disturbance to the utility or customer. Development of a reliable, efficient, low-cost, power electronics module will be a key enabling technology for harnessing more power from solar <b>panels</b> and enable <b>plug</b> and play operation. Power electronics for computer power supplies, communication equipment, and transportation have all targeted reliability and modularity as key requirements and have begun concerted efforts to replace monolithic components with collections of common smart modules. This is happening on several levels including (1) device level with intelligent control, (2) functional module level, and (3) system module. This same effort is needed in power electronics for solar applications. Development of modular units will result in standard power electronic converters that will have a lower installed and operating cost for the overall system. These units will lead to increased adaptability and flexibility of solar inverters. Incorporating autonomous fault current limiting and reconfiguration capabilities into the modules and having redundant modules will lead to a durable converter that can withstand the rigors of solar power generation for more than 30 years. Our vision for the technology roadmap is that there is no need for detailed design of new power converters for each new application or installation. One set of modules and controllers can be pre-developed and the only design question would be how many modules need to be in series or parallel for the specific power requirement. Then, a designer can put the modules together and add the intelligent reconfigurable controller. The controller determines how many modules are connected, but it might also ask for user input for the specific application during setup. The modules include protection against faults and can reset it, if necessary. In case of a power device failure, the controller reconfigures itself to continue limited operation until repair which might be as simple as taking the faulty module out and inserting a new module. The result is cost savings in design, maintenance, repair, and a grid that is more reliable and available. This concept would be a perfect fit for the recently announced funding opportunity announcement (DE-FOA- 0000653) on Plug and Play Photovoltaics...|$|R
