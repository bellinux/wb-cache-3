500|$|... "Can't B Good" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by D. DoRohn Gough and Ne-Yo. It was recorded between 2007 and 2008 at SouthSide Studios, in Atlanta, Georgia. Although Jackson didn't write the song, Jackson described [...] "Can't B Good" [...] as a song reflecting her seven-year relationship with songwriter/producer Jermaine Dupri, saying, [...] "I'd been hurt before, and I {{was trying to}} <b>protect</b> <b>myself.</b> I'm glad I allowed myself to accept it. He's very attentive and affectionate, a beautiful soul".|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye" [...] {{served as}} the album's thirteenth track, and also {{composed}} by Carey and Stargate. An [...] "inspirational power ballad", it is influenced by R and pop music genres. The song is built on an understated and simple piano-driven melody, that is decorated with a soft bass-line. Lyrically, the song was described by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", and finds Carey remembering both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. While the verses are dedicated to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". While listing several forms of loss, Carey encourages to never let go, and always live with their memory, and put their hands up if they ever lost someone, 'cause we won't ever say bye bye'. Serving as the album's closing number, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] was compared to the closing number on Mimi, [...] "Fly Like a Bird". Similarly, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] incorporates gospel influence into its melody of [...] "rousing piano waltz", that [...] "extends forgiveness to those who have wronged her in the past and is pretty much interchangeable with its predecessors." [...] Extensively making use of the whistle register, she references Mottola in another light than [...] "Side Effects": [...] "'I Wish You Well's' message to Mottola is similarly striking. Accompanied by a piano and some multi-tracked backing vocals, Carey sings: [...] "Still bruised, still walk on eggshells / Same frightened child, hide to <b>protect</b> <b>myself</b> / But you can't manipulate me like before." [...] She then prescribes Bible study and says, [...] "I wish you well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foot {{stayed at}} the Daily Mirror for {{fourteen}} years, managing to survive at the paper during the years Robert Maxwell was in control from 1984. Foot wrote in 2000: [...] "Maxwell demeaned everyone who worked for him, myself included, but I was able by sheltering behind the editor to <b>protect</b> <b>myself</b> from his more monstrous excesses”. He finally fell out with the new Mirror editor, David Banks in March 1993, nearly seventeen months after Maxwell's death. Banks, he claimed, had {{accused him of being}} [...] "mad", and a contemporaneous boardroom coup had introduced, according to Foot, a [...] "systematic campaign of union-busting" [...] at the company. He left the Mirror in 1993 when the paper refused to print articles critical of its new management and placed him on sick leave. [...] "This is Stalinist psychiatry," [...] he said at the time. [...] "If you don't agree with us you must be mad." [...] Banks also revealed Foot's salary as being £55,000 {{at the time of the}} row over the unpublished column, although Foot himself said that it was actually a few thousand less.|$|E

2500|$|Controversy {{followed}} the fight when Jones demanded that his loss be [...] "overturned to a disqualification victory, citing illegal use of hand wraps." [...] Jones labelled Green a cheater and filed a formal complaint to the NSW Combat Sports Authority (NSWCSA). In the {{months following the}} fight, Jones also claimed that the referee stopped the fight too early. In March 2010 Green responded to the allegations with {{an open letter to}} Jones, stating [...] "THE hand wraps were the same wraps I used in five previous world title fights, in Germany, Montreal, Australia ..." [...] and [...] "MY hand wraps were personally inspected by three independent inspectors of the NSW Combat Sports Authority and they each certified that my wraps were legal and gave me no advantage whatsoever." [...] The NSWCSA dismissed the matter, however Green claimed that he had [...] "spent {{tens of thousands of dollars}} on legal representation and fees in an attempt to <b>protect</b> <b>myself</b> from unsubstantiated claims that should've been ignored from the outset."

And being the youngest in the family I was isolated - I had no-one to confide in. So I invented my own world, my own reality.

40|$|Women’s use of {{violence}} in intimate relationships is not well understood. This study examined women’s violence {{in relation to their}} male partners’violence against them. The sample consisted of 108 women who had used physical violence with a male partner in the previous 6 months. Almost all the women experienced physical abuse from their male partners. Whereas the women in the sample used more emotional abuse and mod-erate physical violence than their partners, the women were more often victims of sexual violence, injury, and coercive control. Three types of relationships were identified: women as victims (34 %), women as aggressors (12 %), and mixed relationships (50 %), which were of two subtypes—mixed-male coercive (32 %) and mixed-female coercive (18 %). The study illustrates that women’s violence needs to be examined within the con-text of male violence and abuse. The implications of the findings are discussed for researchers and practitioners who work with domestically violent women. He came home drunk one night and started harassing and abusing me.

5000|$|In modern times, the Czech Republic {{practices}} surgically castrating convicted sex offenders. According to {{the reports}} compiled by Council of Europe, a human-rights forum, the central European country physically castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to April 2008. The Czech Republic defends this procedure as voluntary and effective. According to Dr. Martin Hollý, {{director of the}} Psychiatric Hospital Bohnice in Prague, none of the nearly 100 sex offenders who had been physically castrated had committed further offences. One serial offender stated that being castrated was the [...] "best decision" [...] he ever made: [...] "On the one hand you have to protect the potential victims {{and on the other}} hand I wanted to be <b>protected</b> from <b>myself,</b> I wanted to live like a normal person."

40|$|Bubbles {{generally}} are perceptible {{only after the}} fact. To spot a bubble in advance requires a judgment that {{hundreds of thousands of}} informed investors have it all wrong. Betting against markets is usually precarious at best. ” Alan Greenspan (June 1999) i “Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to <b>protect</b> shareholder’s equity (<b>myself</b> especially) {{are in a state of}} shocked disbelief ” Alan Greenspan (October 2008). ii These two quotes may be seen as bookends to the bubble economy of the last decade or so. They indicate the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to inhibit the irrational exuberance of investors at the beginning and its alarm that, after the fact, market forces had allowed two successive bubbles to happen at all. This faith in the judgment of the market and self-interest of bankers as a self-regulating force will be referred to as market fundamentalism in this essay. Market fundamentalism, I will argue, is poorly suited to diagnose or prescribe a remedy for bubbles. I will argue further that it is market fundamentalism that underlies the Fed’s role in inflating the bubble economy and its reluctance to restrain it. My goal is to explore how such an ideology was adopted and the confluence of ideas, interests, and events that explain its adoption. The underlying premise of the essay is institutional, i. e. that organizations are constituted by the narratives, logics of action, and ideologies that exist in a particular field (Phillips, et. al. 2004). My argument relies on work in organizational and historical institutionalism that shows how economic and managerial theories come to be adopted i...|$|R
6000|$|Of {{the next}} three days I know nothing. I have learned since that, so far from my being the first {{discoverer}} of the Martian overthrow, several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the previous night. One man--the first--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand, and, while I sheltered in the cabmen's hut, had contrived to telegraph to Paris. Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the verge of the pit. Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard, shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout, were making up trains, even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London. The church bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news, until all England was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced, unkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance, shouting to gaunt, staring figures of despair. And for the food! Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and meat were tearing to our relief. All the shipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days. But of all this I have no memory. I drifted--a demented man. I found myself in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood. They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about [...] "The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah! The Last Man Left Alive!" [...] Troubled as they were with their own affairs, these people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, sheltered me, and <b>protected</b> me from <b>myself.</b> Apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse.|$|R
