5000|$|AT&T's initial <b>Picturephone</b> 'Mod I' (Model No. 1) {{and then}} its {{upgraded}} 'Mod II' programs, were {{a continuation of}} its many years of prior research during the 1920s, 1930s, late-1940s and the 1950s. Both <b>Picturephone</b> programs, like their experimental AT&T predecessors, were researched principally at its Bell Labs, formally spanned some 15 years and consumed more than US$500 million, eventually meeting with commercial failure. AT&T concluded that its early <b>Picturephone</b> was a [...] "concept looking for a market" [...] and discontinued its 'Mod II' service in the late 1970s.|$|E

50|$|<b>Picturephones</b> {{were also}} later {{installed}} {{in the offices of}} Westinghouse and Alcoa in Pittsburgh, as well as other technology companies in that city. AT&T's commercial service in Pittsburgh started on June 30, 1970 with 38 <b>Picturephones</b> at eight companies, at a lease rate of $160 per month ($947/month in 2012 dollars) for the service, which provided for 30 minutes of videocalling time per month, with extra minutes costing 25 cents each.|$|R
50|$|During the mid-1950s, its {{laboratory}} {{work had}} produced another early test prototype capable of transmitting still images every two seconds over regular analog PSTN telephone lines. The images were {{captured by the}} <b>Picturephone's</b> compact Vidicon camera and then transferred to a storage tube or magnetic drum for transmission over regular phone lines at two-second intervals to the receiving unit, which displayed them on a small cathode-ray television tube. AT&T had earlier promoted its experimental video for telephone service at the 1939 New York World's Fair.|$|R

50|$|Color on AT&T's <b>Picturephone</b> was not {{employed}} {{with their}} early models. These <b>Picturephone</b> units packaged Plumbicon cameras and small CRT displays within their housings. The cameras were located atop their screens to help users {{see eye to}} eye. Later generation display screens were larger than in the original demonstration units, approximately six inches (15 cm) square in a roughly cubical cabinet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Picturephone</b> {{arrived in}} the early 1970s. 1ESS switch was already going into service and {{provided}} a more sophisticated basis for advanced services, but was not yet as widely available, so 5XB was designated as the switching vehicle. Every <b>Picturephone</b> line has six wires: the old talking pair plus a video transmission pair and a video receiving pair. A new wideband switching fabric was designed using a 6-wire version of Type B crossbar switches, two of the wires being grounded, thus diminishing crosstalk for the two video pairs. When completing a <b>Picturephone</b> call, the completing marker first picked the line or trunk to which the audio portion of the call would be completed, and then set up both the audio switches and the video ones. Wideband remote switches (WBRS) were installed in smaller exchanges, as video concentrators for lines that were beyond video range from a larger exchange that {{had been given the}} <b>Picturephone</b> feature.|$|E
5000|$|No date {{is given}} for the events, but {{they are in a}} near future America where Ambrose Bierce (born 1842) is said to be over 100 years old. Europe and Asia have {{suffered}} a [...] "collapse" [...] and the only significant technological advances mentioned are <b>Picturephones</b> and a [...] "pocketphone". The story relates the rediscovery of psychic powers by a trio from a California university (a woman student, and two male friends, an MD/instructor at the medical college and a Psychology professor), and the attempts of a corrupt elite to silence them.|$|R
5000|$|The more {{advanced}} <b>Picturephone</b> Mod I's early promotion included public evaluation displays at Disneyland and the 1964 New York World's Fair, {{with the first}} transcontinental videocall between the two venues made on April 20, 1964. The first <b>Picturephone</b> 'Mod I' (Model No. 1) demonstration units used small oval housings on swivel stands, intended to stand on desks. Similar AT&T <b>Picturephone</b> units were also featured at the Telephone Pavilion (also called the [...] "Bell Telephone Pavilion") at Expo 67, an International World's Fair held in Montreal, Canada in 1967. Demonstration units were available at the fairs {{for the public to}} test, with fairgoers permitted to make videophone calls to volunteer recipients at other locations.|$|E

50|$|To deploy <b>Picturephone</b> service new {{wideband}} crossbar switches {{were designed}} and installed into the Bell System's 5XB switch offices, {{this being the}} most widespread of the relatively modern kind. Hundreds of technicians attended schools to learn to operate the Cable Equalizer Test Set and other equipment, and to install Picturephones.|$|E

50|$|Modern digital {{telephone}} {{systems have}} less {{trouble in the}} voice frequency range as only the local line to the subscriber now remains in analog format, but DSL circuits operating in the MHz range on those same wires may suffer severe attenuation distortion, which is dealt with by automatic equalization or by abandoning the worst frequencies. <b>Picturephone</b> circuits also had equalizers.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>Picturephone</b> {{system used}} contemporary crossbar and multi-frequency operation. Lines and trunks were six wire, one pair each way for video and one pair two way for audio. MF address signaling on the audio pair was supplemented by a Video Supervisory Signal (VSS) looping {{around on the}} video quad to ensure continuity. More complex protocols were later adopted for conferencing.|$|E
50|$|Other {{names for}} {{videophone}} {{that have been}} used in English are: Viewphone (the British Telecom equivalent to AT&T's <b>Picturephone),</b> and visiophone, a common French translation that has also crept into limited English usage, as well as over twenty less common names and expressions. Latin-based translations of videophone in other languages include vidéophone (French), Bildtelefon (German), videotelefono (Italian), both videófono and videoteléfono (Spanish), both beeldtelefoon and videofoon (Dutch), and videofonía (Catalan).|$|E
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s, several {{countries}} worldwide sought to compete with AT&T's advanced development of its <b>Picturephone</b> service in the United States. However such projects were research and capital intensive, and fraught with difficulties in being deployed commercially. This time period also saw the research, development and commercial roll-out of what would become powerful video compression and decompression software codecs, which would eventually lead to low cost videotelephony in the early 2000s.|$|E
5000|$|The Bell System (prior to its {{break up}} into {{regional}} companies) hosted a 15-minute ride in moving armchairs depicting {{the history of}} communications in dioramas and film. Other Bell exhibits included the <b>Picturephone</b> {{as well as a}} demonstration of the computer modem. DuPont presented a musical review by composer Michael Brown called [...] "The Wonderful World of Chemistry". At Parker Pen's exhibit, a computer would make a match to an international penpal.|$|E
50|$|In the United States AT&T's Bell Labs {{conducted}} {{extensive research}} and development of videophones, eventually leading to public demonstrations of its trademarked <b>Picturephone</b> product and service in the 1960s. Its large Manhattan experimental laboratory devoted years of technical research during the 1930s, led by Dr. Herbert Ives along with his team of more than 200 scientists, engineers and technicians. The Bell Labs early experimental model of 1930 had transmitted uncompressed video through multiple phone lines, a highly impractical and expensive method unsuitable for commercial use.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its first launch, AT&T foresaw a hundred {{thousand}} Picturephones in use across the Bell System by 1975 [...] However, by the end of July 1974, only five Picturephones were being leased in Pittsburgh, and U.S.-wide {{there were only a few}} hundred, mostly in Chicago. Unrelated difficulties at New York Telephone also slowed AT&T's efforts, and few customers signed up for the service in either city. At its peak <b>Picturephone</b> service had only about 500 subscribers, with the service fading away through the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "videophone" [...] {{never became}} as {{standardized}} as its earlier counterpart [...] "telephone", {{resulting in a}} variety of names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country. Videophones are also known as [...] "video phones", [...] "videotelephones" [...] (or [...] "video telephones") and often by an early trademarked name <b>Picturephone,</b> which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume. The compound name [...] "videophone" [...] slowly entered into general use after 1950,although [...] "video telephone" [...] likely entered the lexicon earlier after video was coined in 1935.|$|E
5000|$|Instead of {{entertainment}} television, Baird {{might have had}} point-to-point communication in mind. Another television system followed that reasoning. The 1927 system developed by Herbert E. Ives at AT&T's Bell Laboratories was a large-screen television system and the most advanced television of its day. The Ives 50-line system also produced a vertical [...] "portrait" [...] picture. Since AT&T intended to use television for telephony, the vertical shape was logical: phone calls are usually conversations between just two people. A <b>picturephone</b> system would depict one person {{on each side of}} the line.|$|E
50|$|Videoconferencing saw its {{earliest}} use with AT&T's <b>Picturephone</b> {{service in the}} early 1970s. Transmissions were analog over short distances, but converted to digital forms for longer calls, again using telephone transmission technology. Popular corporate video-conferencing systems in the present day have migrated almost exclusively to digital ISDN and IP transmission modes due {{to the need to}} convey the very large amounts of data generated by their cameras and microphones. These systems are often intended for use in conference mode, that is by many people in several different locations, all of whom can be viewed by every participant at each location.|$|E
5000|$|The Picturephone's video {{bandwidth}} was 1 MHz with {{a vertical}} scan rate of 30 Hz, horizontal scan rate of 8 kHz, and about 250 visible scan lines. The equipment included a speakerphone (hands free telephone), with an added box to control picture transmission. Each <b>Picturephone</b> line used three twisted pairs of ordinary telephone cable, two pairs for video {{and one for}} audio and signaling. [...] Cable amplifiers were spaced about a mile apart (1.6 kilometres) with built-in six-band adjustable equalization filters. For distances {{of more than a}} few miles, the signal was digitized at 2 MHz and 3 bits per sample DPCM, and transmitted on a T-2 carrier.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were also}} other public demonstrations of [...] "two-way television-telephone" [...] systems {{during this period}} by inventors and {{entrepreneurs}} who sought to compete with AT&T, although none appeared capable {{of dealing with the}} technical issues of signal compression that Bell Labs would eventually resolve. Signal compression, and its later sibling data compression were fundamental to the issue of transmitting the very large bandwidth of low-resolution black and white video through the very limited capacity of low-speed copper PSTN telephone lines (higher resolution colour videophones would require even far greater capabilities). After the Second World War, Bell Labs resumed its efforts during the 1950s and 1960s, eventually leading to AT&T's <b>Picturephone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 195 Broadway is a 29-story {{building}} on Broadway in the Financial District of the New York City borough of Manhattan. It was the longtime headquarters of American Telephone and Telegraph, {{as well as}} Western Union for a time. It occupies almost an entire block {{on one side of}} Broadway, running from Dey Street to Fulton Street. It also has the address 15 Dey Street, and is well known as the site of one end of the first transcontinental telephone call. The same building, using the [...] "195 Broadway" [...] address, was the New York end of the first intercity <b>Picturephone</b> call in 1927 and of the first transatlantic telephone call, made to London, England, also in 1927.|$|E
5000|$|France's {{post office}} {{telecommunications}} branch had earlier {{set up a}} commercial videophone system similar to the German Reichspost public videophone system of the late 1930s. [...] In 1972 the defense and electronics manufacturer Matra {{was one of three}} French companies that sought to develop advanced videophones in the early 1970s, spurred by the AT&T's <b>Picturephone</b> in the United States. Initial plans by Matra included the deployment of 25 units to France's Centre national d'études des télécommunications (CNET of France Télécom) for their internal use. CNET intended to guide its initial use towards the business sector, to be later followed by personal home usage. Its estimated unit cost in 1971 was the equivalent of £325, with a monthly usage subscription charge of £3.35.|$|E
5000|$|Bell Telephone Pavilion, {{also known}} as the [...] "Telephone Pavilion". The pavilion's feature {{attraction}} was the exciting Walt Disney Imagineering Circle-Vision 360° documentary film Canada '67. From the Expo '67 Guide Book: [...] "You're on centre stage for the RCMP Musical Ride... on centre ice for hockey... on the track at the Stampede! CIRCLE-VISION 360° surrounds you with all the fun and excitement of Canada's most thrilling events and its scenic beauty. And then, take your children to the Enchanted Forest... see exciting new communication services for the future... all in the Telephone Pavilion!" [...] The pavilion also offered many of the public their first look at AT&T's state-of-the-art videophone called the <b>Picturephone,</b> the product of US$500 Million of research and development.|$|E
5000|$|The United States {{would not}} see its first public {{videophone}} booths until 1964, when AT&T installed their earliest commercial videophone units, the <b>Picturephone</b> [...] "Mod I", in booths that were set up in New York's Grand Central Terminal, Washington D.C., and Chicago. Its system {{was the result of}} decades of research and development at Bell Labs, its principal supplier, Western Electric, plus other researchers working under contract to the Bell Labs. [...] However the use of reservation time slots and their cost of US$16 (Washington, D.C. to New York) to $27 (New York to Chicago) (equivalent to $118 to $200 in 2012 dollars) for a three-minute call at the public videophone booths greatly limited their appeal resulting in their closure by 1968.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, Bell Labs {{developed}} {{higher rate}} systems. T-1C {{with a more}} sophisticated modulation scheme carried 3 Mbit/s, on those balanced pair cables that could support it. T-2 carried 6.312 Mbit/s, requiring a special low-capacitance cable with foam insulation. This was standard for <b>Picturephone.</b> T-4 and T-5 used coaxial cables, similar to the old L-carriers used by AT&T Long Lines. TD microwave radio relay systems were also fitted with high rate modems {{to allow them to}} carry a DS1 signal in a portion of their FM spectrum that had too poor quality for voice service. Later they carried DS3 and DS4 signals. During the 1980s companies such as RLH Industries, Inc. developed T1 over optical fiber. The industry soon developed and evolved with multiplexed T1 transmission schemes.|$|E
