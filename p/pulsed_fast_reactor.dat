50|$|In 1968-69, P. K. Iyengar {{visited the}} Soviet Union with three colleagues and toured the nuclear {{research}} facilities at Dubna, Russia. During his visit, Iyengar {{was impressed by}} the plutonium-fueled <b>pulsed</b> <b>fast</b> <b>reactor.</b> Upon his return to India, Iyengar set about developing plutonium reactors approved by the Indian political leadership in January 1969. The secret plutonium plant was known as Purnima, and construction began in March 1969. The plant's leadership included Iyengar, Ramanna, Homi Sethna, and Sarabhai. Sarabhai's presence indicates that, with or without formal approval, the work on nuclear weapons at Trombay had been commenced.|$|E

40|$|The fuel {{elements}} of a repetitively <b>pulsed</b> <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> are subjected to rapid heating in a time short {{with respect to their}} mechanical response time. As a result, vibration of the {{fuel elements}} occurs and, under certain conditions, these vibrations may be amplified considerably. This work is an experimental investigation of the amplification which occurs when a thin wall, hollow, stainless steel cylinder is repetitively heated internally by Joule heating. The results, which compare well with a theoretical analysis of this problem performed by another author, show that significant amplification of the vibrations can occur. The experimental technique is a variation of the resonance method for measuring natural frequency and internal damping. The apparatus could be adapted for use as a materials testing facility for high cycle, low stress fatigue studies since relatively large stresses could be induced with a rather small energy deposition per pulse...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1950 s, {{vigorous}} <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> R&D and technology development programs were pursued worldwide, {{leading to the}} construction and operation of experimental and prototype fast reactors: the USA were the first, with Clementine becoming critical in 1946, and the first nuclear electricity kilowatt-hours produced in December 1951 by a <b>fast</b> <b>reactor,</b> the 21. 6. 2010 R(7) EBR-I in Idaho. The USA program continued with basic R&D and construction of <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> of increasing power (EBR-II, FERMI, and FFTF). The USSR (BR- 10, BOR- 60), the UK (DFR), and France (RAPSODIE) also initiated <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> development programs and built their own experimental <b>fast</b> <b>reactors.</b> A few years later, Germany and Japan started their national <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> development programs and constructed experimental <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> (JOYO and KNK, respectively). In the next years, the pace of <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> development picked up, and the programs were at their peaks by 1980. The experimental reactors were operating in many countries, providing the R&D tools (mainly as irradiation facilities) for the various commercial size prototype <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> development programs, e. g. Phénix, Superphénix in France, SNR- 300 in Germany...|$|R
40|$|Experience in {{applying}} activation analysis with epithermal neutrons to environmental {{studies at the}} IBR- 2 <b>pulsed</b> <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> in Dubna is reviewed. The principal units of the pneumatic system REGATA are described {{as well as the}} main present-day parameters of the irradiation channels. Examples from two challenging areas: analysis of airborne particulate matter and analysis of the biomonitors of atmospheric deposition, where the feasibility of ENAA related to non-nuclear muli-element techniques has been shown, are given. ENAA is presently being used in several projects carried out at FLNP JINR that involve the analysis of aerosol filters. For these studies, instrumental neutron activation analysis cannot feasibly be replaced by any non-nuclear analytical technique at the present state of art {{due to the fact that}} the total mass of the aerosol collected on filter samples is often rather small. This favours direct instrumental techniques rather than those depending on dissolving the sample prior to analysis. The dominant part of air pollution studies at FLNP JINR is based on the use of the moss biomonitoring technique resulting in a final product- maps of the atmospheric deposition of heavy metals, rare-earths, actinides (U and Th), etc., constructed by the GIS (geographical information system) technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{alternative}} path in {{the development}} atomic energy is the uranium-thorium circle. In connection with this, the measurements of the 232 Th neutron capture and total cross-sections and its resonance self-shielding coefficients. in resonance energy range are necessary because of theirs insufficient accuracy. In this work, {{the results of the}} investigations of the thorium- 232 neutron cross-sections are presented. The measurements have been carried out the gamma-ray multisection liquid detector and neutron de-tector as a battery of boron counters on the 120 m flight path of the <b>pulsed</b> <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> IBR- 30. As the filter samples were used the metallic disks of various thickness and diameter of 45 mm. Two plates from metallic thorium with thickness of 0, 2 mm and with the square of 4, 54, 5 cm 2 were used as the radiator samples. The group neutron total and capture cross-sections within the accuracy of 2 - 7 % in the energy range of (10 eV – 10 keV) were obtained from the transmissions and the sum spectra of -rays from the fourth multiplicity to the seventh one. The neutron capture group cross-sections of 238 U were used as the standard ones for obtaining of thorium ones. Analogous values were calculated on the GRUCON code with the ENDF/B- 6, JENDL- 3 evaluated data libraries. Within the limits of experi-mental errors there is observed an agreement between the experiment and calculation, but in some groups the experimental values are larger than the calculated ones...|$|E

40|$|Sodium <b>Fast</b> <b>Reactors</b> {{are one of}} {{the three}} {{candidates}} of GEN-IV <b>fast</b> <b>reactors.</b> <b>Fast</b> <b>reactors</b> {{play an important role in}} saving uranium resources and reducing nuclear wastes. Conventional <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> rely on transuranic fuels from reprocessing facilities, which are not available in the U. S. Thus, deployment of <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> requires decoupling from reprocessing facilities. This motivates the design and deployment of Uranium Startup sodium <b>Fast</b> <b>Reactors</b> (USFR) on a once-through fuel cycle in order to facilitate the transition to <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> by reducing their plant costs and increase capacity factor. Three different fuel types including uranium carbide (UC), metal (UZr) and uranium oxide (U 0 2) are investigated and analyzed using the ERANOS code for potential use in USFR designs. A key enabling factor is use of high-albedo MgO or Zr reflectors in place of fertile blankets to reduce uranium enrichment and improve non-proliferation resistance. The different compositions in different fuel types result in different neutronic performance. The softer spectrum and lower allowable fuel volume fractions of oxide fuel have shorter fuel cycle length due to reactivity constraints, whereas fast neutron fluence plays an important role i...|$|R
40|$|Group on <b>Fast</b> <b>Reactors</b> (TWG-FR), and {{according}} to the expressed needs of the TWG-FR Member States to maintain and increase the present knowledge and expertise in <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> science and technology, the IAEA established its initiative seeking to establish a comprehensive, international inventory of <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> data and knowledge. More generally, at the IAEA meeting of senior officials convened to address issues of nuclear knowledge management underlying the safe and economic use of nuclear science and technology (Vienna, 17 – 19 June 2002), there was widespread agreement that, for sustainability reasons for fissile sources and waste management, long-term development of nuclear power {{as a part of the}} world’s future energy mix will require the <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> technology. Furthermore, given the decline in <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> development projects, data retrieval and knowledge preservation efforts in this area are of particular importance. This consensus concluded from the recognition of immediate need gave support to the IAEA initiative for <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> data and knowledge presevation. To implement the IAEA initiative, the scope of <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> knowledge preservation activities and a road map for implementation have been developed.

40|$|Historically, {{unprotected}} transients {{have been}} viewed as design basis events that can significantly challenge sodium-cooled <b>fast</b> <b>reactors.</b> The perceived potential consequences of a severe unprotected transient in a sodium-cooled <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> include an energetic core disruptive accident, vessel failure, and a large early release. These consequences can be avoided if unprotected transients are properly defended against, potentially improving the economics of sodium <b>fast</b> <b>reactors.</b> One way to defend against such accidents is to include a highly reliable reactor protection system. The perceived undesirability of the consequences arising from an unprotected transient has led some sodium <b>fast</b> <b>reactor</b> designers to consider incorporating several design modifications to the reactor protection system, including: self-actuated shutdown systems, articulated control rods, and seismic anticipatory scram systems.
