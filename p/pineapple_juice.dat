25|$|Del Monte Kenya Limited is a Kenyan food {{processing}} company that operates in the cultivation, production, and canning of pineapple products. The company produces canned solid <b>pineapple,</b> <b>juice</b> concentrates, mill juice sugar and cattle feed. Kenya's largest single manufactured export is canned pineapple, {{and the country}} ranks {{among the top five}} pineapple exporters in the world, both of which feats are direct results of the company's existence and operations. In the past, the company received negative publicity stemming from conflicts with workers and human rights groups, and the company has been targeted by human rights groups for hazardous conditions at the facility, poor living and working conditions for workers and for intimidating trade union groups. In 2001, the company took significant steps to address and correct matters per these concerns.|$|E
40|$|The main {{component}} {{that contributes to}} the high value of pineapple is bromelain which is a proteolytic enzyme and has been scientifically identified as a therapeutic agent. This study was conducted to obtain high quantity of bromelain from pineapple and to investigate the anticarcinogenic activity of fresh <b>pineapple</b> <b>juices</b> against A 2780 ovarian and HT 29 colon cancer cell lines. It was found that homogenization, ultrafiltration, precipitation and dialysis contributed to heavy loss of bromelain. Therefore, fresh <b>pineapple</b> <b>juices</b> from the flesh (PJ-F), core (PJ-C) and stem (PJ-S) were selected as a source of crude bromelain. Various bromelain concentrations of PJ-F, PJ-C and PJ-S (1 mu g/ml, 10 mu g/ml, 100 mu g/ml and 1000 mu g/ml) were exposed to the cancer cells and the cell viability was determined using Methylthiazol Tetrazolium Assay (MTT assay) after 24, 48 and 72 h. Besides, IC 50 values were measured. Using normal cell (HSF 1184) comparison, it was found that a 100 mu g/ml concentration of bromelain would efficiently inhibit the cancer cells without affecting the surrounding normal cells. Microscopic examinations were carried out to elucidate the modes of cell death on the basis of morphological alterations using florescent and inverted phase contrast microscopes. Furthermore, the colony forming abilities of fresh <b>pineapple</b> <b>juices</b> on A 2780 and HT 29 cells were examined. The results demonstrated that PJ-F, PJ-C and PJ-S effectively suppressed the colony formation in cancer cells. The findings suggest that PJ-F, PJ-C and PJ-S may have the potential to induce anticarcinogenic effects through an apoptosis to A 2780 and HT 29 cells in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bioethanol {{is widely}} used as {{renewable}} resource due to its safe to produce and environmentally friendly. However, knowledge on ethanol production from <b>pineapple</b> peel <b>juice</b> (Pattawia spp) is far from sufficient. In this work, <b>pineapple</b> peel <b>juice</b> (initial pH at 5) was fermented at various yeast contents (1, 3 and 5 % by wt.) and fermentation times (3, 5 and 7 days) in order to investigate ethanol production characteristics. Yeast, Sacchromyces cerevisiae was grown on <b>pineapple</b> peel <b>juice.</b> The squeezed juice contained 11 % of total sugar and 5 % of reducing sugar. The {{results indicated that the}} optimum ethanol production was yeast contents of 5 % by wt. and fermentation times of 5 days which gave the ethanol production of 9. 08 g/l.

2500|$|In 1980, Melbourne chapter {{founding}} members Peter Hill and Raymond Hamment flew to California to visit Oakland chapter president Kenny Walton in prison. Walton taught {{them how to}} manufacture amphetamines, {{paving the way for}} the drug's introduction into Australia, and in return, the Australians supplied the Oakland chapter with 300 litres of the chemical phenylacetone, enough to produce $50 million worth of amphetamines. Hill posted the phenylacetone in three-litre <b>pineapple</b> <b>juice</b> tins to his closest US contact, James Patton [...] "Sleepy Jim" [...] Brandes. The Hells Angels rented a farmhouse in Melbourne's northeast, near Hurstbridge, where they produced amphetamines in 50 pound (22.7 kilogram) batches worth $600,000. The drug lab was raided by the Special Operations Group on March 10, 1982, and Hill and three other Hells Angels were arrested. Eventually, investigators arrested 19 people and seized three kilograms of amphetamines, as well as cash, explosives, handguns and a machine-gun. This sparked an internal feud over the gang's operations that led to around 40 violent incidents. Hill and another member, Roger Biddlestone, cut their ties with the Hells Angels and cooperated with police, prompting the club to put a contract on their lives. Nine Hells Angels were charged with conspiring to murder Hill and Biddlestone, but Biddlestone refused to testify and the charges against his former club mates were dropped; he was subsequently convicted of contempt of court. Hill was convicted on drugs charges in 1987 and jailed alongside a number of others. During the investigation, codenamed Omega Two, the police tracked club members' movements ferociously, prompting Jim Brandes, the Melbourne Hells Angels' American contact, to try to assassinate Bob Armstrong, a detective on the case. Brandes, who had previously been acquitted of the 1978 attempted murder two police officers in the US, flew to Melbourne but was immediately deported.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the competitiveness of}} countries exporting fruit juices into Japan through market structure analysis (MSA) {{within the context of}} the theory of consumer demand using the relative price version of the Rotterdam model and the block-wise dependent uniform substitute Rotterdam model. The models were estimated for six different types of fruit juices (orange, grapefruit, other citrus, apple, <b>pineapple</b> and grape <b>juices</b> imported from 18 countries) on monthly per capita data over the period December, 1995, to May, 2005, using the non-linear least squares (LSQ) in the Time Series Processor (TSP) program. Results indicate that the market structure underlying the competition for the Japanese fruit juice market is non-uniformly competitive, and most of the cross price elasticities are below one. Consequently, an exporter cant take market share from another exporter quickly through price reductions. Nonetheless, the United States and the Philippines appear to have a competitive advantage in the export of orange and <b>pineapple</b> <b>juices,</b> respectively. Brazil has the most to gain from an increase in the size of the Japanese fruit juice market. The demand for fruit juices imported into Japan is projected to increase at a decreasing rate over the next decade or so because of the absolute decline in population growth. The results of the study have important implications to countries exporting fruit juices to Japan for making marketing strategies such as price reduction, product differentiation as well as export supply plan.

40|$|Apple, {{orange and}} <b>pineapple</b> <b>juices</b> {{were used to}} prepare {{thickened}} fluids from six Australian commercially available food thickeners {{that are based on}} guar gum, modified starch and xanthan gum. Using a strain-controlled rheometer, changes in shear stress with the rate of shear (1 – 100 s− 1) at 20 °C were independent of the thickener or fruit juice. As the solids content of the fluids increased, so were the viscosity, density and extrapolated yield stress. The density, yield stress and viscosity of the thickened fluids were not significantly influenced (p > 0. 05) by fruit juice, but the type of thickener significantly (p < 0. 05) affected these properties. The Herschel–Bulkley model was found to be the most suitable in describing the rheological data of the thickeners in the fruit juices. The relevant parameters obtained for the recommended models can be used to obtain a known viscosity of the thickened fluids, match to fluids used in videofluoroscopy and obtain objective classification of the thickened fluids.

40|$|Background: High fruit intake {{is known}} to be {{associated}} with reduced riskof coronary heart disease. Our objective was {{to determine the effects of}} acute and chronic juice [grapefruit,orange, and pineapple] intake on plasma lipid profile and lipoprotein metabolism in normolipidemic rats. Material/Methods: The effects of acute juice intake were studied after three hours of a single juice-lipidload instilled intragastrically. In the chronic study, blood samples from fasted animals were subjectedto analyses after six months of either water [control] or water-juice [1 : 1] intake. Results: In the acutestudy, pineapple and grapefruit significantly decreased plasma triacylglycerol [TAG], and chylomicron[CM] TAG and cholesterol concentrations concomitantly with delayed gastric emptying. Plasma cholesterollevels and very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL] secretion and metabolism were not affected. In the chronicstudy, only grapefruit significantly decreased plasma and VLDL TAG concentrations and relative VLDL particlesize with respect to other groups. All juices significantly increased VLDL apolipoprotein B [apoB] secretion,but plasma total apoB concentrations were highest in the grapefruit group and lowest in the orange andpineapple groups. No effect on blood cholesterol levels was observed. Conclusions: The cardioprotectivebenefit of chronic juice intake in normolipidemic rat may be chiefly through mechanisms independent ofa direct effect on blood lipid profile, although orange and pineapple, but not grapefruit, relativelyimproved the metabolism and clearance of blood lipoprotein particles. As a result of delayed gastricemptying, grapefruit and <b>pineapple</b> <b>juices</b> may moderate sharp increases in postprandial plasma TAG concentrationsaccompanying peak digestion and absorption.
