5|$|A {{security}} vulnerability {{was reported}} on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used {{the phone number}} of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing. The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account. Within {{a few weeks of}} this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (<b>PIN)</b> that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.|$|E

5|$|Passport Acquisition: Any time a Lebanese Identity Card holder applies for a passport, their <b>Personal</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>PIN)</b> is {{captured}} on the passport and their personal information cross-checked {{with the existing}} data in the National Identification System. A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{may not be able}} to acquire a passport if they do not possess a Lebanese Identity Card. This is because only people who qualify to hold Lebanese Passports will be issued with one since the individual’s nationality can be properly checked from the National Identification System.|$|E
5|$|Any Croatian citizen aged 18 or over {{may become}} a {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local elections. In order to become an official candidate, 10,000 signatures from Croatian citizens aged 18 or over must be collected and submitted to the State Electoral Commission. This must be done within 12 days following {{the publication of the}} decision to hold elections in Narodne Novine, the official gazette of the Republic of Croatia. The endorsements are made in a list comprising name, address and <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (<b>PIN)</b> of each of the citizens supporting a particular candidate. Each citizen may only endorse a single candidate. The election commission verifies the endorsement lists, publishes the candidate list in all daily newspapers in Croatia (and on Croatian Radiotelevision) and delivers it to the Croatian diplomatic missions for publication.|$|E

To unlock or lock the car, you entered a <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (<b>PIN)</b> on a keypad in the driver's side door, similar to that of Ford's Securicode system. Once inside, to start the car, no key was needed, nor was there a key slot. In the center console, there was a keypad on which the driver again entered the PIN to start the vehicle.|$|E

25|$|The {{credit card}} issuer issues {{a credit card}} to a {{customer}} at the time or after an account has {{been approved by the}} credit provider, which need not be the same entity as the card issuer. The cardholders can then use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card. When a purchase is made, the cardholder agrees to pay the card issuer. The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a receipt with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (<b>PIN).</b> Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a card not present transaction (CNP).|$|E
500|$|Acquisition of Driver’s License: The <b>Personal</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>PIN)</b> {{is one of}} the {{required}} information the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) demands as soon as the Lebanese Identity Card is issued to applicants. The PIN is captured on a Lebanese Identity Card holder's driver’s license and vehicle registration documents. The personal information is also verified from the NIA to determine [...] a persons true identity for license acquisition and establish the true identities of vehicle owners. A time will come when a person {{may not be able to}} make new registration or renewal at the DVLA without their Lebanese Identity Card.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2006, RFID tags {{included}} in new United States passports will store {{the same information}} that is printed within the passport, and include a digital picture of the owner.

The department will also implement Basic Access Control (BAC), which functions as a <b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (<b>PIN)</b> in the form of characters printed on the passport data page. Before a passport's tag can be read, this PIN must be entered into an RFID reader. The BAC also enables the encryption of any communication between the chip and interrogator. As noted in the section below on security, there are many situations in which these protections have been shown to be insufficient, and passports have been cloned based on scans of them while they were being delivered in the mail.|$|E

We evaluate several dictionary-based methods of choosing a PIN.

We also discuss two methods for constructing easy to memorize PIN words for randomly chosen PINs. Comment: 13 page...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To access {{automated}} voice services, Voice over IP (VoIP) users {{sometimes are}} required to provide their <b>Personal</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Numbers</b> (<b>PIN)</b> for authentication. Therefore when they enter PINs, their user-agents generate packets for each key pressed and send them im-mediately over the networks. This paper shows that a malicious intermediary can recover the inter-keystroke time delay for each PIN input even if the standard encryption mechanism has been applied. The inter-keystroke delay can leak information {{of what has been}} typed: Our experiments show that the average search space of a brute force attack on PIN can be reduced by around 80 %. ...|$|R

This article explains why this proposal is fundamentally flawed. The article identifies three basic requirements for a signature and examines whether they are satisfied by digital signatures and PINs. It concludes that while a digital signature has built into it all the elements necessary for compliance with the requirements, a PIN can only be used for the purpose of authorisation and cannot be elevated to the status of a signature as required by the ETO. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
