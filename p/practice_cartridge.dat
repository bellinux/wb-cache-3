5000|$|M50A3 Training / <b>Practice</b> <b>Cartridge</b> (TP) 3.15 lb (1.43 kg): This {{practice}} {{shell is}} ballistically matched to the M49A4 HE shell, {{making it easier}} to train. They are the same size and weight, only differing in that the M50A3 is inert and emits a puff of white smoke on impact.|$|E
5000|$|Full Range <b>Practice</b> <b>Cartridges</b> (FRPC): Designation M769. This round is {{used for}} {{practice}} or clearing misfires.|$|R
50|$|The MK281 is a {{new type}} of 40 mm grenade {{ammunition}} that has been accepted for use into the United States Marine Corps and the United States Army. The Rheinmetall MK281 Mod 0 and Mod 1 40×53mm <b>Practice</b> <b>cartridges</b> are precision, high-velocity training and <b>practice</b> <b>cartridges.</b> The MK281 uses a patented Rheinmetall propulsion unit that is designed to produce a very low standard deviation in muzzle velocity for improved accuracy. The MK281 round is compatible with all types of automatic grenade launchers, including the MK19, the MK47 and the HK GMG, and comes in two different types: 40×53mm Cartridge MK281 Mod0 Impact Marker and 40×53mm Cartridge MK281 Mod1 Day/Night Marker. The MK281 is manufactured by an American subsidiary of the Rheinmetall Group. The MOD1 cartridge allows operators to train at night; the cartridge marking is visible to both the naked eye and when using night vision equipment. As an additional option, a tracer is available for both variants of the cartridge. This tracer has a burn time of six seconds and allows the user to observe the ammunition’s trajectory as it approaches the target.|$|R
5000|$|The AT4 {{requires}} little {{training and}} is quite simple to use, making it suitable for general issue. However, {{as the cost}} of each launcher makes regular live-fire training very expensive, practice versions exist that are identical in operation but fire reloadable 9×19mm or 20mm tracer ammunition. Both <b>practice</b> <b>cartridges</b> are unique to their respective weapons, with their trajectory matched to that of the live round. The 20mm version also has a recoilless weapon effect with the same high noise and back blast as the AT4 firing and is favoured by the Swedish army because of the added realism of the back blast as compared to the [...] "plonk" [...] sound of the 9mm round (similar to the sound of a finger tapping on an empty can).|$|R
5000|$|Frangible, T44/M22 (April 1945): The bullet disintegrates upon {{striking}} a hard or armored target, leaving a pencil-like mark {{to indicate a}} hit during bomber aerial gunnery <b>practice.</b> The <b>cartridge</b> is identified by a green bullet tip with a white ring {{to the rear of}} the green color.|$|R
50|$|Several sub-types of the NATO 25 mm {{ammunition}} are available—the {{most common}} being armor-piercing, high-explosive, sabot, tracer, and <b>practice</b> rounds. <b>Cartridges</b> are usually {{composed of a}} combination of the aforementioned categories. For example, the M791 pictured to the right is an armor-piercing discarding sabot with tracer (APDS-T) round. It is used against lightly armored vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and aerial targets such as helicopters and slow-moving fixed-wing aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Until 1971 the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force {{used the}} island for target <b>practice,</b> and spent <b>cartridges</b> from these bombardments can still be found on Filfla today. It became a bird reserve in 1980. The Filfla Natural Reserve Act, enacted in 1988, {{provided}} for further restrictions on access and use, including a prohibition on fishing within one nautical mile (1.9 km) around the island due {{to the possibility of}} encountering unexploded ordnance.|$|R
25|$|Australia {{had been}} {{interested}} in the Canberra early on, which had led to the aircraft being named after the Australian capital city. Particular interest had at one time been expressed in a potential Rolls-Royce Tay powered version of the aircraft. The Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) locally assembled 48 for the Royal Australian Air Force. These aircraft were broadly similar to the British B.2. Changes included {{the adoption of a}} modified leading edge, increased fuel capacity and room for three starter <b>cartridges,</b> although in <b>practice</b> all three <b>cartridges</b> would sometimes fire, leading to the triple starter units being loaded singly. In addition, Australian built Canberras used a higher proportion of Australian and US sourced components.|$|R
50|$|CH Haygarth & Sons, gun and rifle makers, are {{situated}} on the A836 {{on the eastern side}} of the village. It is Scotland's oldest <b>practicing</b> Gunmakers and <b>cartridge</b> loaders, and the only full-time Gunshop North of Inverness. The business was started in nearby Thurso by Colin Haygarth in April 1957. They are unusual in that it is still family owned and run by Colin's second son, Ross, marking the business's third generation of ownership by the Haygarth Clan. They were the Queen Mother's Gunsmiths from 1965 until her death in 2002. The building was the site of the original village shop, owned by the Begg family, which closed in the mid-1950s. The property was built in 1900.|$|R

5000|$|The {{cartridge}} brass {{case was}} around 4 in long, and contained {{three types of}} loads: light at 12 drams, 14 drams at regular, and 16 drams of powder at heavy load. (Note: 1 dram = 27.34375 grains in the avoirdupois system, since 256 drams = 7000 grains = 1 pound of powder. Shotgun shells are still rated {{in terms of the}} same archaic dram measurements, relative to their equivalence of smokeless powder load to a black-powder load weighed in drams.) John [...] "Pondoro" [...] Taylor mentioned in his book African Rifles and Cartridges that the 12 drams (328 gr., 3/4 oz.) charge would propel the projectile at around 1330 ft/s. A double barreled rifle that would fire such a calibre would weigh around 22-24 lb bare, while the single-barreled version would be around 17-18 lb. In common <b>practice,</b> the <b>cartridge</b> cases were not typically reloaded, as reliability was of the utmost importance, more important than a possible false cost savings from an attempt at reloading that might cost a hunter his life. Bullet lubrication was typically mostly beeswax based, such that in hot tropical climes there could be no possibility of a bullet lube melting {{from the base of the}} bullet, ruining the charge of powder within the cartridge. Reliability was the utmost concern.|$|R
40|$|Gunshot Residue (GSR) is {{residual}} {{material from the}} discharge of a firearm, which frequently provides crucial information in criminal investigations. Changes in ammunition manufacturing are gradually phasing out the heavy metals on which current forensic GSR analysis is based, and the latest Heavy Metal Free (HMF) primers urgently demand new forensic solutions. Proton scanning microbeam Ion Beam Analysis (IBA), {{in conjunction with the}} Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS), can be introduced into forensic analysis to solve both new and old problems, with a procedure entirely commensurate with current forensic <b>practice.</b> Six <b>cartridges</b> producing GSR particles known to be interesting in casework by both experience and the literature were selected for this study. A standard procedure to relocate the same particles previously analysed by SEM-EDS, based on both secondary electron (SE) and X-ray imaging was developed and tested. Elemental Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) mapping of the emitted X-rays allowed relocation in a scan of 10 μm× 10 μm of even a 1 μm GSR particle. The comparison between spectra from the same particle obtained by SEM-EDS and IBA-PIXE showed that the latter is much more sensitive at mid-high energies. Results that are very interesting in a forensic context were obtained with particles from a cartridge containing mercury fulminate in the primer. Particle-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE) maps of a particles from HMF cartridges allowed identification of Boron and Sodium in particles from hands using the B(p,αγ) Be, B(p,pγ) B and Na(p,pγ) Na reactions, which is extraordinary in a forensic context. The capability for quantitative analysis of elements within individual particles by IBA was also demonstrated, giving the opportunity to begin a new chapter in the research on GSR particles. The integrated procedure that was developed, which makes use of all the IBA signals, has unprecedented characterisation and discrimination power for GSR samples. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R
