50|$|The {{primary power}} in local {{government}} were the town council and court (Rat und Gericht). The council handled the town's daily affairs while the court exercised civil jurisdiction {{in the town}} and jurisdiction of non-capital criminal affairs for the entire district. Though the bailiff was originally charged with appointing members of either organization in the 15th century, {{the membership of the}} council and court were, {{by the end of the}} 16th century, made up completely by the town's notables, people like rich artisans, merchants, and local guild members. One of the leading officials in the local government was a kind of village mayor called the Schultheiss. The origins of this <b>position</b> <b>date</b> back to the 13th century, the first recorded instances being in Rottweil in 1222 and in Tübingen in 1247. In that time, the town's lord (Stadtherr) chose the Schultheiss from a pool of 30 to 50 men and he governed the town according to the lord's interests. When the interests of the Scultheiss came to share those of the town's elite rather than the lord's, he created the position of bailiff in order to maintain his interests in the community. These two officials would work together for a time, but during the 15th century, the authority of the Schultheiss eroded. Despite this, he could still preside over the district court in the absence of the bailiff. Subordinate to the Schultheiss was the town's Burgomaster (Burgermeister), the only official to be elected by the citizenry and another office with its origins in the 13th century (the first documented one in Rottweil in 1283). However, popular election was still a rarity and he was typically appointed by the town council and normally from the town's notables. The Burgomaster often came into conflict with the Schultheiss as the former upheld the interests of the town council and the latter of the lord. His chief duties were the accounting of taxes, fines and other town incomes and to present an annual accounting (Gemeinderechnung) before the junior bailiff, whom he assisted in daily local administration. The amount of Burgomasters throughout the Duchy was wildly inconsistent, as each town's constitution mandated how many Burgomasters the town could have and how long they served (most terms ranged from one year to a decade). In some instances, no Burgomasters were present in town and thus they only had a Schultheiss. The final office in local government was the town clerk (Stadtschreiber), who wrote up important documents for the council and would sometimes supervise the taxation of the populace. The town clerk was the link between the local and central governments, as he had to, for example, write all requests to be sent to the Duke by the citizenry (these would also have to be approved by the junior bailiff), making him one of the most important people in local government. He would also be expected to have a specific knowledge of the territory of the Duchy and the laws that governed it, and this would be tested by the chancery in Stuttgart whenever the clerk visited the capital.|$|E

40|$|Transportation of {{dangerous}} goods {{is one of}} the main security applications in the transportation sector. Every day, dangerous goods like chemical substances or inflammable material are circulated through various modes of transportation including road, railways, waterways and air. Transportation {{of dangerous}} goods by road is the most common mode. It is also one of the most critical from the safety point of view, because roads are present in urban areas where the high density of population can increase the risk of civilian casualties in case of an accident. Like many other critical infrastructures, the transportation sector has been increasingly dependent on ICT components and services to improve the exchange of information. Because mobility is an important aspect of this sector, the services of positioning and navigation, like the one provided by GNSS, are particularly important. The paper presents the results of the FP 6 MENTORE project in the area of transportation of dangerous goods by road. MENTORE project implemented and deployed a pilot project where GNSS (GPS/EGNOS enabled) devices integrating door sensors, are mounted on the vehicle to collect information on <b>position,</b> <b>date</b> and time, and door opening/closing events. The information is then transmitted through a commercial communication system (GSM/GPRS and satellite) to a control centre, where these data are compared against a predefined path. Any deviation generates an automatic alarm to notify law-enforcement agencies. Systems for the transportation of dangerous can present vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by attackers with criminal intentions. GPS or GSM/GPRS signals could be jammed to cause Denial of Service (DoS) or spoofed to provide a false position. The paper identifies the main vulnerabilities of systems of transportation of dangerous goods and describes the related mitigation solutions or best practices, which can be adopted to minimize the risk for the population.

40|$|Measurements {{of cloud}} ice crystal size {{distributions}} {{have been made}} by a backscatter cloud probe (BCP) mounted on five commercial airliners flying international routes that cross five continents. Bulk cloud parameters were also derived from the size distributions. As of 31 December 2014, a total of 4399 flights had accumulated data from 665 hours in more than 19 000 cirrus clouds larger than 5 km in length. The BCP measures the equivalent optical diameter (EOD) of individual crystals in the 5 – 90 µm range from which size distributions are derived and recorded every 4 seconds. The cirrus cloud property database, an ongoing development stemming from these measurements, registers the total crystal number and mass concentration, effective and median volume diameters and extinction coefficients derived from the size distribution. This information is accompanied by the environmental temperature, pressure, aircraft <b>position,</b> <b>date</b> and time of each sample. The seasonal variations of the cirrus cloud properties measured from 2012 to 2014 are determined for six geographic regions in the tropics and extratropics. Number concentrations range from a few per litre for thin cirrus to several hundreds of thousands for heavy cirrus. Temperatures range from 205 to 250 K and effective radii from 12 to 20 µm. A comparison of the regional and seasonal number and mass size distributions, and the bulk microphysical properties derived from them, demonstrates that cirrus properties cannot be easily parameterised by temperature or by latitude. The seasonal changes in the size distributions from the extratropical Atlantic and Eurasian air routes are distinctly different, showing shifts from mono-modal to bi-modal spectra out of phase with one another. This phase difference may be linked to the timing of deep convection and cold fronts that lead to the cirrus formation. Likewise, the size spectra of cirrus over the tropical Atlantic and Eastern Brazil differ from each other although they were measured in adjoining regions. The cirrus crystals in the maritime continental tropical region over Malaysia form tri-modal spectra that are not found in any of the other regions measured by the IAGOS aircraft so far, a feature that is possibly linked to biomass burning or dust. Frequent measurements of ice crystal concentrations greater than 1 × 105 L− 1, often accompanied by anomalously warm temperature and erratic airspeed readings, suggest that aircraft often experience conditions that affect their sensors. This new instrument, if used operationally, has the potential of providing real-time and valuable information to assist in flight operations as well as providing real-time information for along-track nowcasting...|$|E
