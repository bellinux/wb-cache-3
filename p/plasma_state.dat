5|$|Hydrogen is a {{chemical}} element with symbol H and atomic number1. With a standard atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) {{is the most}} abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars {{are mainly composed of}} hydrogen in the <b>plasma</b> <b>state.</b> The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has one proton and no neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Most {{extraterrestrial}} helium {{is found}} in a <b>plasma</b> <b>state,</b> with properties quite {{different from those of}} atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in the monomer table, many simple {{monomers}} {{are readily}} polymerized by this method, but most must be smaller ionizable species because they have to be able to go into the <b>plasma</b> <b>state.</b> Though monomers with multiple bonds polymerize readily, it is not a necessary requirement, as ethane, silicones and many others polymerize also.|$|E

The magnitude, critical threshold, and frequency dependence of some eight propagation effects for an S-band propagation path passing within 4 solar radii of the Sun are described. The theory and observation of propagation in extraterrestrial plasmas are discussed and the various <b>plasma</b> <b>states</b> along a near solar propagation path are illustrated. Classical magnetoionic theory (cold anisotropic plasma) is examined for its applicability to the path in question. The characteristics of the <b>plasma</b> <b>states</b> found along the path are summarized and the errors {{in some of the}} standard approximations are indicated.

40|$|Triggering vacuum {{breakdown}} at {{the upcoming}} laser facilities can provide rapid electron-positron pair production for studies in laboratory astrophysics and fundamental physics. However, {{the density of}} the emerging plasma should seemingly stop rising at the relativistic critical density, when the plasma becomes opaque. Here we identify the opportunity of breaking this limit using optimal beam configuration of petawatt-class lasers. Tightly focused laser fields allow plasma generation in a small focal volume much less than λ^ 3, and creating extreme <b>plasma</b> <b>states</b> in terms of density and produced currents. These states can be regarded as a new object of nonlinear plasma physics. Using 3 D QED-PIC simulations we demonstrate the possibility of reaching densities of more than 10 ^ 25 cm^- 3, which is an order of magnitude higher than previously expected. Controlling the process via the initial target parameters gives the opportunity to reach the discovered <b>plasma</b> <b>states</b> at the upcoming laser facilities...|$|R
25|$|In {{inertial}} confinement reactors, lasers are fired at a pellet of fuel (often {{made from a}} combination of deuterium and tritium) with the goal of compressing, heating, and igniting the fusion fuel and creating a propagating burn through the compressed fuel plasma so as to burn approximately 30 percent before the compressed fuel, now in a very high temperature <b>plasma</b> <b>state,</b> itself disassembles.|$|E
25|$|Deconfinement was {{claimed in}} 2000 at CERN SPS in heavy-ion collisions, and it implies {{a new state}} of matter: quark–gluon plasma, less {{interacting}} than in the nucleus, almost as in a liquid. It was found at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven in the years 2004–2010 by four contemporaneous experiments. A quark–gluon <b>plasma</b> <b>state</b> has been confirmed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the three experiments ALICE, ATLAS and CMS in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Operation: The monomer gas {{comes into}} the Bell type reactor as a gaseous species, and then is put into the <b>plasma</b> <b>state</b> by the electrodes, in which the plasma may consist of radicals, anions and cations. These {{monomers}} are then polymerized on the cathode surface, or some other surface placed in the apparatus by different mechanisms of which details are discussed below. The deposited polymers then propagate off the surface and form growing chains with seemingly uniform consistency.|$|E

25|$|In polymerization, both {{gas phase}} and surface {{reactions}} occur, but mechanism differs {{between high and}} low frequencies. At high frequencies it occurs in reactive intermediates, whereas at low frequencies polymerization happens mainly on surfaces. As polymerization occurs, the pressure inside the chamber decreases in a closed system, since gas phase monomers go to solid polymers. An example diagram of the ways that polymerization can take place is shown in Figure 2, wherein the most abundant pathway is shown in blue with double arrows, with side pathways shown in black. The ablation occurs by gas formation during polymerization. Polymerization has two pathways, either the <b>plasma</b> <b>state</b> or plasma induced processes, which both lead to deposited polymer.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of a plasma for polymerization depends {{on many of the}} following. An electron energy of 1–10 eV is required, with electron densities of 109 to 1012 per cubic centimeter, in order to form the desired <b>plasma</b> <b>state.</b> The {{formation of}} a low-temperature plasma is important; the electron temperatures are not equal to the gas temperatures and have a ratio of Te/Tg of 10 to 100, so that this process can occur at near ambient temperatures, which is advantageous because polymers degrade at high temperatures, so if a high-temperature plasma was used the polymers would degrade after formation or would never be formed. This entails non-equilibrium plasmas, which means that charged monomer species have more kinetic energy than neutral monomer species, and cause the transfer of energy to a substrate instead of an uncharged monomer.|$|E
25|$|Big Bang {{nucleosynthesis}} {{occurred within}} the first three minutes {{of the beginning of}} the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of 1H (protium), 2H (D, deuterium), 3He (helium-3), and 4He (helium-4). Although 4He continues to be produced by stellar fusion and alpha decays and trace amounts of 1H continue to be produced by spallation and certain types of radioactive decay, most of the mass of the isotopes in the universe are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The nuclei of these elements, along with some 7Li and 7Be are considered to have been formed between 100 and 300 seconds after the Big Bang when the primordial quark–gluon plasma froze out to form protons and neutrons. Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than beryllium (or possibly boron) could be formed. Elements formed during this time were in the <b>plasma</b> <b>state,</b> and did not cool to the state of neutral atoms until much later.|$|E

40|$|A one-dimension {{model for}} positive-column plasma is analyzed. In the {{framework}} of this model, a complete, self-consistent set of equations for the plasma column is proposed and justified. Basic prerequisites for the model and the equations used in it are discussed at length to clarify the mathematics and physics that underlie the proposed generalized description of <b>plasma</b> <b>states.</b> A study of the equations has unveiled the existence of two structurally stable types of steady states and three integrals of motion in the plasma system. The first type of states corresponds to spatially homogeneous plasma, and the second type, to the self-forming plasma structure with striations. Analysis of spatio-temporal plasma structures (spatially homogeneous and stratified stationary <b>plasma</b> <b>states)</b> and their attendant phenomena is given in detail. It is shown that the equations offer a more penetrating insight into the physical states and properties of positive-column plasma in dc-driven gas discharges, and into the various phenomena proceeding in the discharge system.

The theoretical results are compared to experimental data {{and can be used}} for to place the great body of experimental data in their proper framework.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of new x-ray light-sources worldwide, the {{creation}} of dense, uniformly heated <b>plasma</b> <b>states</b> arising from intense x-ray irradiation of solids has been made possible. In {{the early stages of}} x-ray solid heating, before significant hydrodynamic motion occurs, the matter exists in a highly non-equilibrium state. A method based on wavefront sensing is proposed to probe some of the fundamental properties of these states. The deflection and absorption of a high harmonic probe beam propagated through the plasma can be measured with a wavefront sensor, and allow for the determination of the complex refractive index (RI) of the plasma, giving a 2 D map of the optical properties as function of time in a pump-probe arrangement. A solid heating model has been used to estimate the expected temperatures of x-ray heated thin foils, and these temperatures are used in three separate models to estimate the changes in the refractive index. The calculations show the changes induced on an extreme ultra-violet (XUV) probe beam by a solid density thin foil plasma are significant, in terms of deflection angle and absorption, to be measured by already existing XUV Hartmann wavefront sensors. The method is applicable {{to a wide range of}} photon energies in the XUV (10 s to several 100 s of eV) and plasma parameters, and can add much needed experimental data to the fundamental properties of such dense <b>plasma</b> <b>states.</b> © 2013 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
