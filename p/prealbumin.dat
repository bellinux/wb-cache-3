T3 and T4, {{although}} being lipophilic, {{are not able}} to passively diffuse through the phospholipid bilayers of target cells, instead relying on transmembrane iodothyronine transporters. The lipophilicity of T3 and T4 requires their binding to the [...] protein carrier thyroid-binding protein (TBG) (thyroxine-binding globulins, thyroxine binding <b>prealbumins,</b> and albumins) for transport in the blood. The thyroid receptors bind to response elements in gene promoters, thus enabling them to activate or inhibit transcription.

40|$|Summary. Fluids were {{obtained}} from 185 rabbit uteri 1 to 20 weeks after uterine ligation. The uterine fluid proteins were concentrated with an ultrafilter and characterized by diffusion in agar gel, moving boundary electrophoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis. Eight electrophoretic components were identified by means of moving boundary electro-phoresis. One which migrated as a pre-albumin and another which migrated as an alpha-globulin were not found in blood sera. Agar-gel diffusion tests revealed thirteen antigenic components in uterine fluid. Three precipitin lines appeared to be specific to uterine fluid after absorption ofguinea-pig antisera to rabbit uterine fluid with rabbit blood sera. However, at least five antigens {{which could not be}} found in blood sera were identified in uterine fluid by means of immunoelectrophoresis. The mobilities of two were similar to <b>prealbumins</b> and the mobilities of the remaining three were similar to beta-globulins. The results indicated that at least two classes of proteins, which do not exist in rabbit blood serum, may be found in uterine fluids obtained by ligation...|$|R
50|$|Albumin is {{a protein}} made {{specifically}} by the liver, {{and can be}} measured cheaply and easily. It is the main constituent of total protein (the remaining from globulins). Albumin levels are decreased in chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis. It is also decreased in nephrotic syndrome, where it is lost through the urine. The consequence of low albumin can be edema since the intravascular Oncotic pressure becomes lower than the extravascular space. An alternative to albumin measurement is <b>prealbumin,</b> which is better at detecting acute changes (half-life of albumin and <b>prealbumin</b> is about 2 weeks and about 2 days, respectively).|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{two classes}} of blood {{proteins}} are considered: serum albumin and globulin. They are generally equal in proportion, but albumin as a molecule is much smaller and lightly, negatively-charged, leading to an accumulation of albumin on the electrophoretic gel. A small band before albumin represents transthyretin (also named <b>prealbumin).</b> Some forms of medication or body chemicals can cause their own band, but it usually is small. Abnormal bands (spikes) are seen in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and multiple myeloma, and are useful in the diagnosis of these conditions.|$|E

These drawings were made in pen on tracing paper over a printout of a Cα trace of the atomic coordinates; they preserved positions, smoothed the backbone path, and incorporated small local shifts to disambiguate the visual appearance. As well as the TIM ribbon drawing at the right, other hand-drawn examples are for <b>prealbumin,</b> flavodoxin, and Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase.|$|E

40|$|The {{marmosets}} (F. Callithricidae), {{in common}} with other South American primates, do not menstruate. This is a major disadvantage in animals which otherwise have many attributes as experimental models for studies in repro-ductive physiology. The conventional methods of determining {{the stage of the}} ovarian cycle by means of vaginal smear cytology do not work for the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The presence of spermatozoa in the vaginal smear is no indication of oestrus because marmosets mate frequently and apparently indiscriminately throughout the cycle and early pregnancy (Hearn & Lunn, 1974). The patterns ofLH, oestradiol and progesterone in the peripheral plasma of the common marmoset show that this species has a clearly defined ovarian cycle of 16 =. =+-=. days (Hearn & Lunn, 1974), and it seemed possible that some change in the cervical or vaginal mucus might be used to monitor the ovarian cycle. We have examined samples of vaginal lavage for pH, peroxidase activity(Linford, 1974), vaginal cytology and protein composition. Only the protein patterns showed any correlation with the hormonal cycle. These changes were restricted to the <b>prealbumins,</b> a group of small proteins which appear betwee...|$|R
40|$|The Greek key beta-barrel {{topology}} is {{a folding}} motif observed in many proteins of widespread evolutionary origin. The arthropodan hemocyanins also {{have such a}} Greek key beta-barrel, which forms {{the core of the}} third domain of this protein. The hemocyanin beta-barrel was found to be structurally very similar to the beta-barrels of the immunoglobulin domains, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase and the chromophore carrying antitumor proteins. The structural similarity within this group of protein families is not accompanied by an evolutionary or functional relationship. It is therefore possible to study structure-sequence relations without bias from nonstructural constraints. The present study reports a conserved pattern of features in these Greek key beta-barrels that is strongly suggestive of a folding nucleation site. This proposed nucleation site, which we call a "beta-zipper," shows a pattern of well-conserved, large hydrophobic residues on two sequential beta-strands joined by a short loop. Each beta-zipper strand is near the center of one of the beta-sheets, so that the two strands face each other from opposite sides of the barrel and interact through their hydrophobic side chains, rather than forming a hydrogen-bonded beta-hairpin. Other protein families with Greek key beta-barrels that do not as strongly resemble the immunoglobulin fold - such as the azurins, plastocyanins, crystallins, and <b>prealbumins</b> - also contain the beta-zipper pattern, which might therefore be a universal feature of Greek key beta-barrel proteins...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} polypeptidic hormones, mainly {{expressed}} in the intestine or the pancreas, belong {{to a group of}} these structurally related peptides. One such hormone, glucagon, is widely distributed and produced in the alpha-cells of pancreatic islets. It affects glucose metabolism in the liver by inhibiting glycogen synthesis, stimulating glycogenolysis and enchancing gluconeogenesis. It also increases mobilisation of glucose, free fatty acids and ketone bodies, which are metabolites produced in excess in diabetes mellitus. Glucagon is produced, like other peptide hormones, {{as part of a larger}} precursor (preproglucagon), which is cleaved to produce glucagon, glucagon-like protein I, glucagon-like protein II, and glicentin. The structure of glucagon itself is fully conserved in all mammalian species in which it has been studied. Other members of the structurally similar group include secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), <b>prealbumin,</b> peptide HI-27 and growth hormone releasing factor.|$|E
40|$|<b>Prealbumin</b> is as {{important}} as albumin in the nutritional assessment of hemodialysis patients. BackgroundAlthough serum <b>prealbumin</b> is considered a valid indicator of nutritional status in hemodialysis patients, there is relatively little evidence that its determination is of major prognostic significance. In this study, we aimed to determine the independent association of serum <b>prealbumin</b> with survival in hemodialysis patients, after adjusting for serum albumin and other indicators of protein energy nutritional status. MethodsSerum <b>prealbumin</b> was measured in more than 1600 maintenance hemodialysis patients. We determined the correlations among <b>prealbumin</b> and other indicators of nutritional status, including serum albumin, and bioimpedance-derived indicators of body composition. The relationship between serum <b>prealbumin</b> and survival was determined using proportional hazards regression. ResultsThe serum albumin was directly correlated with the serum <b>prealbumin</b> (r = 0. 47, P < 0. 0001), but still explained < 25 % of the variability in <b>prealbumin.</b> <b>Prealbumin</b> was inversely related to mortality, with a relative risk reduction of 6 % per 1 mg/dL increase in <b>prealbumin,</b> even after adjusting for case mix, serum albumin, and other nutritional indicators. The increase in risk with lower serum <b>prealbumin</b> concentrations was observed whether the serum albumin was high or low. ConclusionIn hemodialysis patients, the serum <b>prealbumin</b> provides prognostic value independent of the serum albumin and other established predictors of mortality in this population...|$|E

40|$|After injury the acute-phase {{response}} of the organism activates mechanisms which imply the release of cytokines, stress hormones, and mediators of pain and inflammation. The main function of the acutephase response is to hinder further damage of the injured tissue by activating reparative processes. The increase in the concentration of acute phase proteins and the concurrent decrease in albumins and <b>prealbumins</b> indicate {{that there is a}} strong link between the liver and the traumatized site. Considering bleeding to be a major injury it can be supposed that it can result in changes in acute phase proteins concentrations {{despite the fact that it}} is not directly related to inflammatory reactions. In order to confirm this presumption the concentration changes in negative and positive acute phase proteins in Wistar rats' blood plasma were measured during a 10 day period after controlled bleeding. The result of the therapeutic effects of transfusion on acute phase proteins was estimated in a group of rats in the so called "hospital stage" at which the blood loss was recovered by citrate blood transfusions. At the end of the 10 th day the rats were monitored for an additional 10 day period. The obtained results confirm that bleeding is an impressive trauma and the acute phase response results in a significant change in acute phase proteins. These changes arise quickly, the highest concentrations were achieved within the first 24 to 72 h and thereon they slowly declined...|$|R

Little in the resulting data from 472 birds seriously contests the present classification of the Procellariiformes; {{much of the}} biochemical evidence supports, confirms, and clarifies the proposals of conventional taxonomic methodology. The biochemical data give fresh insights into the interrelationships of procellariiform taxa, and highlight intriguing new problems. Sex, season, age, and other sources of non-genetic protein variation are insignificant for taxonomic purposes. Proteins of comparable value include the transferrins, some α and β globulins, albumins, <b>prealbumins,</b> and non-specific esterases. Genetic variations in the mobility of these proteins are useful at the genus-group level and below.

40|$|Background/Aims: The {{neurological}} sequelae {{resulting from}} untreated phenylketonuria are diminished {{by the success}} of early introduced and continued dietary treatment. Nowadays, nutritional status is gaining importance in the follow-up of these patients. The aim of this work was to study the relevance of <b>prealbumin</b> concentration as biomarker of protein nutritional status of phenylketonuric patients. Methods: We collected data from 69 phenylketonuric patients on food intake, blood <b>prealbumin</b> and blood phenylalanine concentrations. Protein insufficiency was defined as <b>prealbumin</b> z-scores below the 5 th percentile of reference population. Additionally, we considered a <b>prealbumin</b> concentration of 20 mg/dl as a threshold level. Results: Nine patients (13 %) showed signs of protein insufficiency. When the threshold of 20 mg/dl for <b>prealbumin</b> was used, we found 38 patients (55 %) with low <b>prealbumin</b> concentrations. Conclusion: A significant group presented signs of protein insufficiency either using <b>prealbumin</b> z-scores or <b>prealbumin</b> concentration threshold, especially in milder forms of the disease. The results of this seem to confirm the already described threshold level for <b>prealbumin</b> concentration, suggesting that its measurement may be important for nutritional status evaluation, preventing protein insufficiency in milder forms of phenylketonuria.

40|$|<b>Prealbumin,</b> mortality, and cause-specific {{hospitalization}} in hemodialysis patients. BackgroundPrealbumin (transthyretin) is {{a hepatic}} secretory protein {{thought to be}} important in the evaluation of nutritional deficiency and nutrition support. Prior studies have suggested that the serum <b>prealbumin</b> concentration is independently associated with mortality in hemodialysis patients, even with adjustment for serum albumin and other nutritional parameters. MethodsTo determine whether <b>prealbumin</b> was independently associated with mortality and morbidity (cause-specific hospitalization) in hemodialysis patients, we analyzed data on 7815 hemodialysis patients with at least one determination of serum <b>prealbumin</b> during the last three months of 1997. Unadjusted, case mix-adjusted, and multivariable-adjusted relative risks of death were calculated for categories of serum <b>prealbumin</b> using proportional hazards regression. We also determined whether the <b>prealbumin</b> concentration was associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, infection-related, and vascular access-related hospitalization. ResultsThe relative risk (RR) of death was inversely related to the serum <b>prealbumin</b> concentration. Relative to <b>prealbumin</b> ≥ 40 mg/dL, the adjusted RRs of death were 2. 41, 1. 85, 1. 49, and 1. 23 for <b>prealbumin</b> < 15, 15 - 20, 20 - 25, and 25 - 30 mg/dL, respectively. The adjusted RRs of hospitalization due to infection were 2. 97, 1. 95, 1. 81, and 1. 61 for <b>prealbumin</b> < 15, 15 - 20, 20 - 25, and 25 - 30 mg/dL, respectively. The adjusted RRs of vascular access-related hospitalization were 0. 48, 0. 52, 0. 58, and 0. 71 for <b>prealbumin</b> < 15, 15 - 20, 20 - 25, and 25 - 30 mg/dL, respectively. While serum albumin was strongly associated with mortality and all-cause hospitalization, it was not associated with hospitalization due to infection, and lower levels were associated with higher rather than lower rates of vascular access-related hospitalization. ConclusionIn hemodialysis patients, lower <b>prealbumin</b> concentrations were associated with mortality and hospitalization due to infection, independent of serum albumin and other clinical characteristics. Higher <b>prealbumin</b> concentrations were associated with vascular access-related hospitalization. In light of these findings, more intensive study into the determinants and biological actions of <b>prealbumin</b> (transthyretin) in end-stage renal disease is warranted...|$|E
40|$|<b>Prealbumin</b> from an {{individual}} with heredofamilial amyloid polyneuropathy of Swedish origin was isolated from plasma by using a three-step procedure involving ion exchange, Affi-gel Blue affinity chromatography, and gel filtration. This <b>prealbumin</b> and its associated amyloid fibril subunit protein were digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. Comparison with normal <b>prealbumin</b> peptides showed that an amino acid substitution of a methionine for a valine had occurred at position 30. In the plasma <b>prealbumin,</b> the abnormal residue accounted for 1 / 3 rd of the material while in the amyloid fibrils it accounted for 2 / 3 rds. From this sequence information and the known three-dimensional structure of the <b>prealbumin</b> molecule, a mechanism for the amyloid formation is proposed. It involves formation of the amyloid fibrils by addition of <b>prealbumin</b> dimers or tetramers to the aggregate. Each dimer must contain at least one variant peptide chain while the tetramer must contain at least two abnormal chains. Either of these models can account for the observed amount of normal <b>prealbumin</b> in amyloid fibrils.

40|$|Background: <b>Prealbumin,</b> a {{sensitive}} marker for protein–energy status, {{is also known}} as an independent risk factor for mortality in hemodialysis patients. We investigated the impact of <b>prealbumin</b> on survival in incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Methods: In total, 136 incident PD patients (mean age, 53. 0  ±  15. 8  years) between 2002 and 2007 were enrolled in the study. Laboratory data, dialysis adequacy, and nutritional parameters were assessed 3  months after PD initiation. Patients were classified into 2 groups according to <b>prealbumin</b> level: high <b>prealbumin</b> (≥  40  mg/dL) and low <b>prealbumin</b> (<  40  mg/dL). Results: The patients in the low-prealbumin group were older and had more comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases compared with the patients in the high-prealbumin group. Mean subjective global assessment scores were lower, and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were higher in the low-prealbumin group. Serum creatinine, albumin, and transferrin levels; percent lean body mass; and normalized protein catabolic rate were positively associated, whereas subjective global assessment scores and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were negatively associated with <b>prealbumin</b> concentration. During the median follow-up of 49  months, patients in the lower <b>prealbumin</b> group had a higher mortality rate. Multivariate analysis revealed that <b>prealbumin</b> <  40  mg/dL (hazard ratio, 2. 30; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 14 – 4. 64) was an independent risk factor for mortality.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for detecting carriers of a variant plasma <b>prealbumin</b> that {{is associated with}} familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type I. It is based on the finding of an extra methionine in the variant <b>prealbumin,</b> at position 30 from the amino terminals. Since normal <b>prealbumin</b> has only one methionine (position 13), treatment with cyanogen bromide (CNBr), which cleaves only at methionines, results in two peptides. CNBr treatment of the variant <b>prealbumin</b> gives three peptides. The extra can then be detected in two ways: by HPLC using a reverse phase C 18 column, and by sequential Edman degradation. Each method can detect as little as 1 % variant <b>prealbumin</b> in isolated plasma <b>prealbumin,</b> and therefore, can identify carriers of the gene for the variant protein. Since FAP type I usually is not manifest until after the childbearing years, this method to identify carriers of the gene offers a new approach for genetic counseling of families with this disease. To date, kindreds with hereditary amyloidosis that could benefit from these studies include those with FAP type I of Swedish, Japanese, and Portuguese origins...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} of protein electrophoresis suitable for routine use which ensures good {{separation of the}} <b>prealbumin</b> fraction is described. The clinical value of visually estimating this protein fraction from the electrophoretic strip is shown with reference to 134 cases. Low levels of <b>prealbumin</b> {{were found to be}} associated with liver disorders, malignancy, collagen diseases, congestive cardiac failure, and burns. Finally, pitfalls in electrophoretic technique which may cause failure to visualize the <b>prealbumin</b> fraction are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundPrealbumin, a {{sensitive}} marker for protein–energy status, {{is also known}} as an independent risk factor for mortality in hemodialysis patients. We investigated the impact of <b>prealbumin</b> on survival in incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. MethodsIn total, 136 incident PD patients (mean age, 53. 0  ±  15. 8  years) between 2002 and 2007 were enrolled in the study. Laboratory data, dialysis adequacy, and nutritional parameters were assessed 3  months after PD initiation. Patients were classified into 2 groups according to <b>prealbumin</b> level: high <b>prealbumin</b> (≥ 40  mg/dL) and low <b>prealbumin</b> (< 40  mg/dL). ResultsThe patients in the low-prealbumin group were older and had more comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases compared with the patients in the high-prealbumin group. Mean subjective global assessment scores were lower, and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were higher in the low-prealbumin group. Serum creatinine, albumin, and transferrin levels; percent lean body mass; and normalized protein catabolic rate were positively associated, whereas subjective global assessment scores and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were negatively associated with <b>prealbumin</b> concentration. During the median follow-up of 49  months, patients in the lower <b>prealbumin</b> group had a higher mortality rate. Multivariate analysis revealed that <b>prealbumin</b> < 40  mg/dL (hazard ratio, 2. 30; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 14 – 4. 64) was an independent risk factor for mortality. In receiver operating characteristic curves, the area under the curve of <b>prealbumin</b> for mortality was the largest among the parameters. ConclusionPrealbumin levels were an independent and sensitive predictor for mortality in incident PD patients, showing a good correlation with nutritional and inflammatory markers...|$|E
40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} amyloidosis of the Indiana/Swiss type is a late-onset disorder {{characterized by}} carpal tunnel syndrome, progressive peripheral neuropathy, vitreous deposits, and cardiomyopathy. This disorder was originally {{described in a}} large Indiana family of Swiss descent and {{is also known as}} familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) type II. In the Indiana family, the genetic basis of the disease is a variant of plasma <b>prealbumin</b> (transthyretin), which has a serine-for-isoleucine substitution at amino acid 84 of the 127 -residue <b>prealbumin</b> molecule. We predicted that the corresponding mutation in the <b>prealbumin</b> gene consisted of a T-to-G change in codon 84 (which created an AluI recognition site) and then demonstrated the extra AluI site in the DNA of patients by Southern blot analysis with a genomic <b>prealbumin</b> probe. This verifies the protein findings at the DNA level and provides a direct, reliable DNA test for the Ser- 84 <b>prealbumin</b> gene associated with Indiana/Swiss hereditary amyloidosis...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} the first to report about a patient with high <b>prealbumin</b> level [56. 8 mg/dL (reference range 22. 0 - 40. 0 mg/dL) ] {{following}} elevation in thyroid hormones levels. Among the thyroid hormones, tetraiodothyronine (free T 4 and total T 4) level showed an elevation. Triiodothyronine (free T 3 and total T 3) level was within normal limits. Since <b>prealbumin</b> mainly transports T 4, the elevation of <b>prealbumin</b> level along with T 4 level is reaso- nable. When patients have chronic hyperthyroidism without thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody (TRAb), a diagnosis will be Negative Graves’ disease. However, a part of patients with Negative Graves’ disease may be High <b>prealbumin</b> syndrome. </p...|$|E
