The second experimental diet was high in fruits-and-vegetables and in low-fat dairy products, as well as lower in overall fat and saturated fat, with higher fiber and higher protein compared with the control diet—this diet has been called “the DASH Diet”. The DASH diet (or combination diet) was rich in potassium, magnesium and calcium—a nutrient profile roughly equivalent with the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{veterinary}} medicine and animal husbandry, {{there is a}} need for tools allowing the early warning of diseases. Preferably, tests should be available that warn farmers and veterinarians during the incubation periods of disease and before the onset of clinical signs. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of serum <b>protein</b> <b>profiles</b> as an early biomarker for infectious disease status. Serum samples were obtained from an experimental pig model for porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), consisting of Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) infection in combination with either Porcine Parvovirus (PPV) or Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV). Sera were collected before and after onset of clinical signs at day 0, 5 and 19 post infection. Serum <b>protein</b> <b>profiles</b> were evaluated against sera from non-infected control animals. Results <b>Protein</b> <b>profiles</b> were generated by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry in combination with the Proteominer™ technology to enrich for low-abundance proteins. Based on these <b>protein</b> <b>profiles,</b> the experimentally infected pigs could be classified according to their infectious disease status. Before the onset of clinical signs 88 % of the infected animals could be classified correctly, after the onset of clinical sigs 93 %. The sensitivity of the classification appeared to be high. The <b>protein</b> <b>profiles</b> could distinguish between separate infection models, although specificity was moderate to low. Classification of PCV 2 /PRRSV infected animals was superior compared to PCV 2 /PPV infected animals. Limiting the number of <b>proteins</b> in the <b>profiles</b> (ranging from 568 to 10) had only minor effects on the classification performance. Conclusions This study shows that serum <b>protein</b> <b>profiles</b> have potential for detection and identification of viral infections in pigs before clinical signs of the disease become visible. </p...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{parasitic}} nematodes {{are difficult}} to identify because different species are morphologically similar, and this makes their control more difficult. The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} rapid, simple method to identify plant parasitic nemal:odes, based on analysis of <b>protein</b> <b>profiles</b> of nematodes generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). Two methods have been used: grinding and direct analysis of intact nematodes. Both methods were standardised using the nematode Anguina tritici (wheat seed-gall nematode) as a model. Development of the approach involved optimisation of experimental parameters to generate reproducible diagnostic <b>protein</b> <b>profiles</b> for plant parasitic nematodes. With α-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as the matrix, the most effective solvent extraction was with 90 % acetone. With sinapinic acid (SA) as matrix, 90 % ethanol was most effective. When intact nematodes were analysed directly by mixing with the matrix solution, 40 min extraction with CHCA matrix solution generated the best <b>protein</b> <b>profiles.</b> The standardised methods were applied to analyse the seed-gall nematodes A. tritici and A. funesta and to the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne javanica, which infects many horticultural crops. Typical <b>protein</b> <b>profiles</b> and diagnostic peaks were identified for these nematode species and for mixtures of Anguina species.

Nine susceptible mares aged between 7 and 18  years were used. After checking for signs of estrus, mares were subjected to four treatments: C: mares received no treatment and served as control; D: mares received 40 -mg dexamethasone at breeding, with collection of samples after 6  hours; I- 6 and I- 24 : intrauterine infusion of 1  ×  109 Streptococcus zooepidemicus/mL and samples collected after 6 and 24  hours; I/D- 6 and I/D- 24 : intrauterine infusion of 1  ×  109 S zooepidemicus/mL and 40 -mg dexamethasone, collecting the sample after 6 and 24  hours.
