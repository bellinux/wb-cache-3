He spoke {{about the loss of}} his father and how he had played a Thirty Seconds to Mars song at the funeral. After Leto again met the German fan again at a concert in Austria, he asked him to share his story on camera. Leto explained, [...] "At the show in Austria, where there were tens of thousands of <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ran into him and interviewed him; he was the first interview of the summer, and he shared this story about losing his father, and what it taught him, it was really an organic and serendipitous and beautiful way to begin.

500|$|She {{read the}} {{foundational}} text [...] by Scientology founder, science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, {{and came to}} believe [...] "it was a solution for helping other people".

Christman was quoted with a positive comment about Scientology, in the 1992 edition of the Church of Scientology International-produced book What is Scientology?. She stated in the book, [...] "I find life just gets better and better." [...] Christman has a son.|$|E
500|$|Frank {{was criticized}} by {{conservative}} organizations for campaign contributions totaling $42,350 between 1989 and 2008. Bill Sammon, the Washington {{managing editor for}} Fox News Channel, claimed the donations from Fannie and Freddie influenced his support of their lending programs, and said that Frank did not play a strong enough role in reforming the institutions in the {{years leading up to}} the economic crisis of 2008. In 2006, a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they [...] "did not participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005." [...] In response to criticism, Frank said, [...] "In 2004, it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages, because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low-income <b>people.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> said at the time, 'Hey—(a) this is going to jeopardize their profitability, but (b) it's going to put people in homes they can't afford, and they're gonna lose them.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In her youth, Thompson was {{intrigued}} by language and literature, a trait which she attributes to her father, who shared her love of words. In 1977, she began studying for an English degree at Newnham College, University of Cambridge. Thompson believes that {{it was inevitable that}} she would become an actress, commenting that she was [...] "surrounded by creative <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don’t think it would ever have gone any other way, really". While there, she had a [...] "seminal moment" [...] that turned her to feminism and inspired her to take up performing. She explained in an interview in 2007 how she discovered the book The Madwoman in the Attic, [...] "which is about Victorian female writers and the disguises they took on in order to express what they wanted to express. That completely changed my life." [...] She became a self-professed [...] "punk rocker", with short red hair and a motorbike, and aspired to be a comedian like Lily Tomlin.|$|E
500|$|In September 1941, Presley entered {{first grade}} at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his {{instructors}} regarded him as [...] "average". He {{was encouraged to}} enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley's country song [...] "Old Shep" [...] during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. Ten-year-old Presley was dressed as a cowboy; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang [...] "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, [...] "I took the guitar, and I watched <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> learned {{to play a little}} bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Inspired by the film, baroque {{pop singer}} Lana Del Rey {{recorded}} a cover version of Bobby Vinton's classic {{rendition of the}} song [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] in 2012. Used to endorse clothing line H, a music video accompanied the track and aired as a television commercial. Filmed in Post-war Americana, the video drew influence from Lynch and Blue Velvet. In the video, Del Rey {{plays the role of}} Dorothy Vallens, performing a private concert similar to the scene where Ben (Dean Stockwell) pantomimes [...] "In Dreams" [...] for Frank Booth. Del Rey's version, however, has her lip-syncing [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] when a little person dressed as Frank Sinatra approaches and unplugs a hidden Victrola, revealing Del Rey as a fraud. When Lynch heard of the music video, he praised it, telling Artinfo: [...] "Lana Del Rey, she's got some fantastic charisma and—this is a very interesting thing—it's like she's born out of another time. She's got something that's very appealing to <b>people.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> didn't know she was influenced by me!" ...|$|E

Cover art was unveiled on November 30, 2006. A commercial to promote the album was released on January 4, 2007. Pre-orders were taken starting January 16. The album was released in the US on January 22, while the UK release occurred a week later, on January 29. On March 8, the band released the music video for [...] "The Plot to Bomb the Panhandle", which featured Ron Jeremy. The video was filmed in Los Angeles. After being asked how they got Jeremy to appear, McKinnon said [...] "It was pretty much some that we were kicking around. We were kicking around different <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think, Tony threw that out there, out of nowhere and we were like 'That'd be cool, that'd be funny, people will be into that.'".|$|E
500|$|Sargent's moral {{character}} attracted comment throughout his life. Early on, {{he developed a}} taste for luxury: Adrian Boult commented on his travelling to college by taxi, but Sargent rejoined, [...] "All the more room for you, Adrian, on the bus." [...] Despite Sargent's vanities and rivalries, he had many friends. Sir Thomas Armstrong in a 1994 broadcast interview stressed that Sargent [...] "had many good generous virtues; he was kind to many <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> loved him...." [...] Nevertheless, even friends such as Sir Rupert Hart-Davis, Secretary of the Literary Society, considered him a [...] "bounder", and the composer-suffragette Dame Ethel Smyth called him a [...] "cad". Yet despite his philandering and ambition, Sargent was a deeply religious man all his life and was comforted on his deathbed by visits from the Anglican Archbishop of York, Donald Coggan and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Heenan. He also received calls from Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, and had a reconciliation with his son, Peter, from whom he had been estranged for a year.|$|E

500|$|When Johnston {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1877, {{he was involved in}} the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's Texas and Pacific Railway, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill. Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, [...] "...what I have done about the Pacific road is before the <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> cannot recall it if I would. It would not be policy to retreat from my position nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & I think that I was right & am therefore ready to take the consequences. I intend to fight it out on that line." [...] William Mahone worked to prevent his re-election. Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected.|$|E
500|$|Coghill {{has been}} {{described}} by Powderfinger lead singer Bernard Fanning as [...] "psycho", stating [...] "There's a constant battle between Cogsy and I as to who's the biggest psycho in the band" [...] on numerous occasions. Fanning has also said of Coghill [...] "He likes to antagonise <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't mean that in a mean way", and continued to say jokingly that [...] "It makes me want to smash him sometimes." [...] Guitarist Darren Middleton says of Coghill [...] "Jon likes movies with explosions in them", and has also described him as stubborn. Fellow guitarist Ian Haug says Coghill is an excellent arranger, explaining [...] "he can listen to it all, just sort of sit back and go, 'Okay, that's a really good bit.'" [...] Coghill himself has described himself as a [...] "superhero". He has also stated that he shares the band's hatred of band photos. Coghill says he shares the stereotype of drummers being the most [...] "out there" [...] member of the band. He says this is true because [...] "We have so much energy...We’re stuck up the back and we’re more likely to do stupid shit to get rid of it." [...] In 2008, Coghill studied a mixture of politics and law at Griffith University. He is currently a journalist for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.|$|E
500|$|Greenwalt {{discusses}} how Cordelia [...] "is sort {{of forced}} {{to become a}} deeper character" [...] when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, [...] "She's sort of living with {{one foot in the}} world of 'I want to be an actress' and with another foot in the world of 'I want to save and help <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have a deeper purpose and mission.'" [...] Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a [...] "vainglorious high schooler to someone who's almost like a superhero"; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress. From the tenth episode, [...] "Parting Gifts", Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The first-season finale saw Cordelia's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter was relieved when it was over. The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating [...] "I saw the world and there's so much pain. We have to help them." [...] Carpenter explains, [...] "Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what's important in life." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the 1960s, Makeba {{strengthened}} {{her involvement}} {{with a range}} of black-centred political movements, including the civil rights, anti-apartheid, Black Consciousness, and Black Power movements. She briefly met the Trinidadian-American activist Stokely Carmichael—the leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and a prominent figure in the Black Panther Party—after Belafonte invited him to one of Makeba's concerts; they met again in Conakry six years later. They entered a relationship, initially kept secret from all but their closest friends and family. Makeba participated in fundraising activities for various civil rights groups, including a benefit concert for the 1962 Southern Christian Leadership Conference that civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. referred to as the [...] "event of the year." [...] Following a concert and rally in Atlanta in support of King, Makeba and others were denied entrance to a restaurant as a result of Jim Crow laws, leading to a televised protest in front of the establishment. She also criticised King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference for its investment in South African companies, informing press that [...] "Now my friend of long standing supports the country's persecution of my <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must find a new idol". Her identity as an African woman in the US civil rights movement helped create [...] "an emerging liberal consensus" [...] that extreme racial discrimination, whether domestically or internationally, was harmful. In 1964 she testified at the UN for a second time, quoting a song by Vanessa Redgrave in calling for quick action against the South African government.|$|E
500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E
