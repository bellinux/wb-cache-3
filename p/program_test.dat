500|$|The Griffins invite {{their neighbors}} over for game night. While playing Trivial Pursuit, Lois uses {{questions}} from the preschool edition for Peter in order to let him win. When Peter wins, he brags to everyone, believing himself to be smarter than everyone else. Irritated at Peter's arrogance, Brian challenges Peter to take the MacArthur Fellows <b>Program</b> <b>test</b> to prove he is a genius. The results of the test show that Peter is not a genius; in fact, the results show that, technically speaking, Peter is [...] "mentally retarded." [...] Peter sinks into depression after being publicly labeled as retarded. While driving home with Lois, Peter accidentally knocks down Tom Tucker. Tucker, recognizing Peter as [...] "the retarded fellow," [...] does not press charges, and Peter realizes his condition means he {{can get away with}} anything.|$|E

[...] The FCC granted the station a new construction permit to authorize these changes on July 14, 2005. [...] KDCQ made the switch to 92.9 MHz on January 28, 2006, operating under the <b>program</b> <b>test</b> authority granted by the construction permit.
