40|$|BACKGROUND: Public-private {{partnerships}} (PPP) {{could be}} effective in scaling up services. We estimated cost and cost-effectiveness of different PPP arrangements {{in the provision of}} tuberculosis (TB) treatment, and the financing required for the different models {{from the perspective of the}} provincial TB <b>programme,</b> <b>provider,</b> and the patient. METHODS: Two different models of TB provider partnerships are evaluated, relative to sole public provision: public-private workplace (PWP) and public-private non-government (PNP). Cost and effectiveness data were collected at six sites providing directly observed treatment (DOT). Effectiveness for a 12 -month cohort of new sputum positive patients was measured using cure and treatment success rates. Provider and patient costs were estimated, and analysed according to sources of financing. Cost-effectiveness is estimated from the perspective of the provider, patient and society in terms of the cost per TB case cured and cost per case successfully treated. RESULTS: Cost per case cured was significantly lower in PNP (US $ 354 - 446), and comparable between PWP (US $ 788 - 979) and public sites (US $ 700 - 1000). PPP models could significantly reduce costs to the patient by 64 - 100 %. Relative to pure public sector provision and financing, expansion of PPPs could reduce government financing required per TB patient treated from $ 609 - 690 to $ 130 - 139 in PNP and $ 36 - 46 in PWP. CONCLUSION: There is a strong economic case for expanding PPP in TB treatment and potentially for other types of health services. Where PPPs are tailored to target groups and supported by the public sector, scaling up of effective services could occur at much lower cost than solely relying on public sector models...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Undernutrition affects ∼ 165 million {{children}} globally and contributes up to 45 % of all child deaths. India {{has the highest}} proportion of global undernutrition-related morbidity and mortality. This protocol describes the planned economic evaluation of a community-based intervention to improve growth in children under 2  years of age in two rural districts of eastern India. The intervention is being evaluated through a cluster-randomised controlled trial (cRCT, the CARING trial). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis nested within a cRCT will be conducted from a societal perspective, measuring <b>programme,</b> <b>provider,</b> household and societal costs. Programme costs will be collected prospectively from project accounts using a standardised tool. These will be supplemented with time sheets and key informant interviews to inform the allocation of joint costs. Direct and indirect costs incurred by providers will be collected using key informant interviews and time use surveys. Direct and indirect household costs will be collected prospectively, using time use and consumption surveys. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated for the primary outcome measure, that is, cases of stunting prevented, and other outcomes such as cases of wasting prevented, cases of infant mortality averted, life years saved and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of results. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: There {{is a shortage of}} robust evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of strategies to improve early child growth. As this economic evaluation is nested within a large scale, cRCT, it will contribute to understanding the fiscal space for investment in early child growth, and the relative (in) efficiency of prioritising resources to this intervention over others to prevent stunting in this and other comparable contexts. The protocol has all necessary ethical approvals and the findings will be disseminated within academia and the wider policy sphere. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 51505201; pre-results...|$|E

There is an expectation that by including compensatory cultural components to address assumed weak cultural links through Māori cultural activities, these programmes will be able to rectify the impacts of colonising activities. In this research 23 young Māori people who had attended a community youth programme and 19 parents/caregivers were interviewed about what was important to them and about the place of Māori cultural activities in their lives. Interviews with 14 <b>programme</b> <b>provider</b> staff, four New Zealand Police staff, five community stakeholders and a Judge from a Rangatahi Court explored what they saw were the experiences for the young people and their families. The interviews were semi-structured and interview data was analysed using Grounded Theory to generate a Theory of Māori cultural learning and model of a Māori cultural framework within which Māori cultural socialisation occurs. Findings identified three family composition groups as reflecting aspects of multi-realities for the participant families which were highlighted by membership of whanau family groups; presence of family leadership; participation in Māori cultural community and location of family residence. The differences between the family composition groups had resulted from a breakdown of Māori community and disruption to the function of Māori cultural activities which also impacted on the structures and process of Māori cultural socialisation and transmission.

40|$|Northern Ghana {{presents}} an interesting {{case of the}} limitations of the conventional school system in reaching underserved and deprived populations with basic education. Due to the peculiar nature of its demographic characteristics and the socio-economic challenges that confront this area of Ghana, conventional school systems are unable to thrive and make an impact in remote areas. Many of these communities are sparsely populated and scattered making distance a hindrance to school. attendance. A major barrier to access and participation is also the cost. In poor deprived communities whether or not children attend school usually depends on the direct or indirect costs to families. Direct costs arises from schooling accessories such as uniforms, books and writing materials whilst the indirect costs are largely in the form of income lost from the child’s potential employment or contribution to household income through direct labor. Yet another obstacle is the official school calendar which usually conflicts with families’ economic activities to which the child is a crucial contributor. A growing number of NGOs and civil society organizations are introducing basic education initiatives that have been adjusted to reflect these demographic and socio-economic realities. Many of the NGOs try to promote the spirit of self-help efforts among poor rural people using strategies that encourage community participation and ownership of the basic education initiative. This paper describes and analyses the effort of one such NGO education programme known as the “School for Life” (SFL) in Northern Ghana. The paper examines {{the extent to which the}} activities of this organization are actually promoting self-help efforts in sustaining an aid initiated basic education programme. The acid test for aid effectiveness is what happens when it phases out - in that case is the initiative sustainable? The paper argues that for true sustainability to be achieved there is the need for a concerted working relationship between the aid <b>programme</b> <b>provider</b> and local government institutions because of the potential benefits that this relationship can bring in sustaining the programme once external support ends. Finally, using the SFL programme as an example, it argues that the key to promoting greater participation and commitment among rural communities towards basic education, is by showing that it can actually open up access to higher levels of education without conflicting with the socio-cultural and economic activities of the society...|$|E
40|$|This Project {{addresses}} {{the future of}} Workplace Counselling and concludes {{that there might be}} benefits if Workplace Counselling were to become an established Professional Specialism or “a sophisticated activity”, (Lees 2004), one with its own professional discourse and its own professional knowledge and skills-base. Investigations were undertaken to discover if such a proposal might be acceptable within the general workplace counselling community as defined by the Employee Assistance <b>Programme</b> <b>Provider,</b> (EAPs). Enquiries were also undertaken into ways that such a specialisation might be achieved and these investigations have led to the suggestions offered in this Project Report about possible ways to educate and train the putative Specialist Workplace Counselling Practitioners that developing such a proposed new professional specialism might generate. There are 2 main strands to these enquiries: Strand 1) : A series of investigations into: i) The professional developmental potential for workplace counsellors; ii) The possibility that promoting workplace counselling as a new specialism might be a way forward that is acceptable to those likely to employ such practitioners, (e. g. the Employee Assistance Providers); iii) The sorts of specialist training that might be valued by the workplace counselling community; iv) New ways of modelling workplace counselling, including approaches that might sometimes place the psychological welfare of the organisation before that of the individual worker. Strand 2) : An investigation into the academic requirements of Higher Education when offering specialist, postgraduate, workplace counselling training provisions. This has included an enquiry into the nature of knowledge {{from the perspective of the}} Learning Professional generally, (Gibbons et al., 1994; Scott, Brown, Lunt and Thorne, 2004), and the Workplace Counselling Specialist in particular. The importance of reflexivity and criticality, (Barnett, 1997; Eraut, 1994; Merriam, 2001; Sachs, 2000; Schon, 1987), in any disciplinary discourse are discussed and ways of inculcating these qualities into the education of workplace counsellors are considered. The conclusion reached is that the Learning Professional's discourse, although anchored in an original discipline, (in this case that of the Workplace Counsellor), is also transdisciplinary in that innovative, discipline-free, solutions may well be sought to resolve professionally unboundaried issues that will often require interdisciplinary, multiple-aspect, investigations. These enquiries are summarised in the form of two specific outcomes: a) A designed and validated Workplace Counselling Postgraduate Programme, culminating in an MSc award that will begin in October 2006. This Programme is built on an evaluation of the theoretical foundations underpinning knowledge-gain in most disciplinary discourses at postgraduate learning levels generally, which are then related and equated to similar constructs underpinning the proposed postgraduate education of the workplace counselling specialist. In this Postgraduate Programme, the student will not be trained in isolation from other disciplines but will sometimes be learning alongside students from parallel disciplines within the university's School of Social Sciences. b) Proposals for some new ways of modelling workplace counselling theory. The whole of these enquiries and the resultant discussion has been set out in a book proposal: "The Workplace Counsellor - a Professional Specialist' that is currently being considered by various publishers. The style of this book is intended to be "user friendly' in order to appeal to the interested layman whilst at the same time retaining its academic rigour so as to provide a useful textbook for the professional counsellor...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Evaluation of {{employment}} skills programmes (ESP) delivered by work integration social enterprises (WISEs) {{for the benefit}} of young people not in employment, education or training (NEET) is often undertaken by the <b>programme</b> <b>providers.</b> This method of evaluation often lacks objectivity and academic rigour and tends to focus exclusively on output. The current study reveals programme outcome benefits for NEET participants after completing a six-week ESP, delivered by a WISE. The study highlights the participant perspective and adds an objective dimension to programme evaluation through an innovative, inductive evaluation process. Design/methodology/approach - The research adopted an intervention method, within a qualitative paradigm, employing semi-structured interviews conducted pre-and post participant engagement in the ESP. NEET participants were also asked to complete questionnaires designed to measure general self-efficacy and attitude to enterprise. The questionnaires were introduced in order to test the suitability of this type of questionnaire with NEET groups in future larger-scale studies. Findings - Analysis of the interview data revealed ten overall participant perception themes: ‘experience’, ‘self-confidence’, ‘the programme’, ‘perceived barriers’ and ‘maturity’ at Time 1 and ‘experience’, ‘self-confidence’, ‘the programme’, ‘enterprise’ and ‘future’ at Time 2. Outcome benefits are demonstrated through differences in participant perception themes revealed at Time 1 and Time 2. Relationships between participant perception themes and questionnaire constructs are discussed in the context of future larger-scale evaluations. Originality/value – Adopting an intervention method employing semi-structured interviews, allowed the participant’s to articulate the outcome benefits that were important for them rather than merely providing affirmation of <b>programme</b> <b>provider’s</b> expectations.

Values-based practice requires {{high levels of}} cultural competence achieved through service user participation in professional preparation. The degree of service user participation remains dependent on the values of <b>programme</b> <b>providers.</b> In this paper, we consider whether strategies to involve service users in mental health professional education can support the principles of valuesbased practice. To do this, we have drawn on the findings from qualitative studies of educators' practices and their views regarding service user involvement. Values-based practice requires self-awareness of values impacting on decisions and knowledge derived from service users' personal accounts. The studies suggest that while opportunities exist for service users to present their accounts, few examples of service user involvement facilitated deeper examination of values underpinning decision-making. Enabling service users to influence values-based practice development requires more authentic participatory approaches. Educators valued the contribution of service users' experiential knowledge to the learning process, but there was less evidence of educators' values base that would model commitment to the empowerment of service users...|$|R

40|$|In {{community}} health development (CHD) settings there is {{increased demand for}} more robust evaluation by funders of health and wellbeing initiatives who want to ensure that money is wisely invested and meets community needs. Evaluation of these initiatives is not always contracted to external professional evaluators, and increasingly more robust evaluation is expected of agencies and providers of the CHD initiatives. Therefore, within this setting there is a range of ways of doing evaluation and various perceptions about what kinds of evaluation are most appropriate. This research aimed to explore how evaluation is practised by those evaluating community based CHD in New Zealand. The perspectives {{of those who do}} evaluation, including external evaluators, <b>programme</b> <b>providers,</b> and funders were explored. Of interest were answers to the questions: ‘what kind of evaluation is being practised?’; and ‘what are the elements of successful CHD evaluation?’. This small study offers a contribution to previous research by not only considering the values and valuing experiences of professional evaluators who come from their own theoretical background, but also including the perspectives of CHD workers, providers and funders who evaluate their own programmes in CHD settings in New Zealand. Appreciative inquiry was used as a framework for conducting individual interviews with a small sample of evaluators, <b>programme</b> <b>providers</b> and a funder. Findings show differences in the three groups in that providers, because of their project management roles and accountabilities to external funders, were more focussed on project evaluation that would provide evidence of project outcomes and improved service delivery. As external agents evaluators in this study encouraged and supported providers to build their evaluative skills and capacity to carry out evaluation. The funder while concerned with accountability was still aiming to build providers capacities. It was found that although evaluation was always required, the evaluation skills in provider organisations and the funding for evaluation were often inadequate. These factors impacted on what evaluation was possible. Given that some of the concepts and values important to both CHD and evaluation are connected and overlap, and the increased demand for funders, providers and community groups to evaluate their own initiatives, it is hoped that these results will provide insights into some of the considerations for building evaluative capacity within this context, in order to advance empowerment, social justice and equity in New Zealand...|$|R
