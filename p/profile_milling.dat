In this paper, we present a method for the effective localisation of cutting edges of inserts in digital images of an edge <b>profile</b> <b>milling</b> head.

40|$|Determination of optimal {{machining}} parameters [...] spindle rate, feed rate, {{and depth}} of cut [...] has been a research topic for decades. Since the parameters of CNC machining significantly influence part machining time, part surface quality, and tool life, techniques of determining optimal machining parameters are in high demand in manufacturing industry. Usually the depth of cut and spindle rate are determined according to machinist manuals before machining; and the feed rate is determined subjectively either by CNC machine operators or programmers. As a result, the feed rate is not optimal {{in terms of the}} machining condition at every cutter location, and it is fixed at a conservative value causing longer machining time or shorter tool life. In this work, a generic and intelligent approach of feed rate determination for CNC <b>profile</b> <b>milling</b> is proposed. First a two-dimension chip load model is introduced and an example database of machining parameters is presented. Second a fuzzy rule-based system is established to predict the cutting force based on the radial and axial depths of cut, and the assumed feed rate.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the contributions made by individual size fractions of hammer-milled barley and sorghum grains to average bulk compositional, hydration, rheological, and enzyme susceptibility properties. Barley and sorghum grains were each hammer-milled through a 4 mm screen and subsequently fractionated on a set of eight sieves ranging from 0. 125 mm to 2. 8 mm. Individual fractions were characterised for (1) starch, aNDF, and water content, (2) water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSI), (3) viscosity profile during cooking and cooling in excess water, and (4) in vitro starch digestibility. Weighted average values based on fraction yields and property values for WAI, WSI, and starch digestibility were not significantly different from values obtained for non-fractionated ground grains of both barley and sorghum. Glucose yields from starch digestion varied about ten-fold between the smallest and largest particle fractions, and WAI and WSI had value ranges of 1. 9 - 2. 8 g/g (sorghum), 2. 1 - 4. 0 g/g (barley) and 1. 3 - 4. 5 % (sorghum), 0. 7 - 10. 3 % (barley), respectively. Viscosity <b>profiles</b> for <b>milled</b> sorghum grain fractions were dominated by starch swelling which became increasingly restricted as {{particle size}}s increased.

This interest in the production of advanced, high power density electrical machines that are small in size has heightened the need for flexible manufacturing processes to produce their laminated components during short batch and prototyping production runs. A means of cost effective, accelerated prototyping of these machines will have a substantial impact on their design and optimization, reducing time requirements to produce and test a given design. A review of the current manufacturing methods for prototyping electric machines was conducted.

Also, successful {{implementation of}} pavement preservation program requires knowledge {{of the performance of}} preservation surface treatments over time, which is critical to the select of candidate projects and the development of performance models for pavement management analysis. In addition, preservation surface treatments, such as chip seal, fog seal, microsurfacing, 4. 75 mm thin or ultra-thin overlay, can not only repair certain pavement surface defects, but also change the surface characteristics of pavement and therefore affect pavement surface friction performance. Nevertheless, such information is currently not available but is essential for the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} pavement preservation surface treatments. As a concentrated effort, this study focused on the long-term friction performance of preservation surface treatments, particularly those have been widely used and those have seen increasing use by INDOT. Based on the selected field pavement test sections, this study aimed to evaluate the surface characteristics, particularly the long-term friction performance for those surface treatments that have been widely used and have seen increasing use by INDOT, including chip seal, fog-chip, fog seal, rejuvenating seal, microsurfacing, ultrathin bonded wearing course (UBWC), 4. 75 -mm hot mix asphalt (HMA) thin overlay, and <b>profile</b> <b>milling</b> (or diamond grinding). The test sections for each type of surface treatment covered a wide range of traffic volume from light to high. The service life for the selected test sections varied from 6 months to 60 months.

Pavement roughness and noise tests were also conducted to address the smoothness and noise issues, particularly on microsurfacing. Detailed analysis was provided to evaluate the friction performance of 4. 75 -mm HMA overlays.

The milling characteristic of plastic profiles is investigated by cutting experiments in the present paper. The cutting forces increase with the feed speed increase.

In modern industry, thread milling cutters gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the thread milling cutters with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength thread milling cutters and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on thread milling cutters showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end thread milling cutters with helical flutes. Since the standard presents thread milling cutters with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face <b>profile,</b> the end <b>mills</b> of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth thread milling cutter with helical flutes.

The goal was discovery and analysis of information on the river-basin Bedřichovský, Pasecký and Váckový stream, Humenická dam and in closure <b>profile</b> at Tomkův <b>mill</b> in the years 2007 { [...] } 2010, where there were monitoring heights of water level. After substitution into discharge-rating curve were scoring flow rate for individual parts of river-basins and examination of influence Humenická dam on flow rate wave in the closure profile. Between the upper specific profiles of individual streams above Humenická dam and specific profile by the Tomkův mill there was not found any influence of Humenická dam on flow wave in the river basin of Stropnice...|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of automated manufacturing equipment {{in developing nations}} can be expensive. Hence, this article presents {{the development of a}} computer numerical control milling machine’s control unit using low-end PIC microcontrollers. The design employs a hierarchy of five low-end PIC microcontrollers connected to a PC. A single master PIC acts as a link between a PC and four slave microcontrollers via a RS 232 serial port. One slave PIC is interfaced with the electronics of the spindle drive. The three remaining slave PICs are interfaced with the electronics of the x-, y- and z-axis drives. The low-cost milling machine’s control unit has been constructed and tested. A circle–diamond–square test confirms the functionality of the machine and demonstrates that it does not accumulate error along a <b>milled</b> <b>profile</b> path...|$|R
