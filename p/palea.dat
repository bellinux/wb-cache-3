25|$|Van Hung Village, in Cat Thinh Commune (Văn Chấn District) {{has been}} {{described}} in the media as a village where family-run turtle farms, which started operating since 1999, have significantly raised the villagers' income and standard of living. The turtle species being farmed is described as Trionyx steindachneri, which is a synonym for <b>Palea</b> steindachneri or the wattle-necked softshell turtle.|$|E
25|$|How is the {{enormous}} {{diversity in the}} shape, color and sizes of flowers established? There is enormous variation in the developmental program in different plants. For example, monocots possess structures like lodicules and <b>palea,</b> that {{were believed to be}} analogous to the dicot petals and carpels respectively.It turns out that this is true, and the variation is due to slight changes in the MADS-box genes and their expression pattern in the monocots. Another example is that of the toad-flax, Linaria vulgaris, which has two kinds of flower symmetries: radial and bilateral. These symmetries are due to epigenetic changes in just one gene called CYCLOIDEA.|$|E
25|$|Flowers of Poaceae are {{characteristically}} {{arranged in}} spikelets, each having {{one or more}} florets. The spikelets are further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the spikelet that bears the florets is called the rachilla. A spikelet consists of two (or sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed {{by one or more}} florets. A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two bracts, one external—the lemma—and one internal—the <b>palea.</b> The flowers are usually hermaphroditic—maize being an important exception—and anemophilous or wind-pollinated. The perianth is reduced to two scales, called lodicules, that expand and contract to spread the lemma and palea; these are generally interpreted to be modified sepals. This complex structure {{can be seen in the}} image on the right, portraying a wheat (Triticum aestivum) spikelet.|$|E

25|$|The flowerheads {{are seated}} {{at the end of}} the stem or in the limbs of the higher leaves, are {{arranged}} in a spike or a globose cluster and are subtended by two to more than five leaflike bracts. Each flowerhead is circled by an involucre that consists of many spine-tipped bracts in several rows, the outer papery and shorter than the inner ones, which are leaflike in consistency. These surround the common floral base (or receptacle), which is conical in shape and is set with ovate papery bracts called chaff or paleae. Inplanted are dorsally compressed cypselas, each enclosed by a <b>palea,</b> the outer rows higher than the inner ones. On top of the cypselas there may be two to five stiff scabrous bristles, which are equivalent to sepals (and are called pappus). Also, on top of the cypsela and within the pappus is a yellow, orange or white strap-like corolla which ends in five teeth, together comprising a ligulate floret.|$|E
