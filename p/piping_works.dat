50|$|The union became {{embroiled in}} a {{bruising}} battle with the plumbers' and carpenters' unions in 1919. The Sheet Metal Workers had organized thousands of railway locomotive fabricators nationwide, but now the plumbers' union was arguing that it had jurisdiction over the <b>piping</b> <b>work</b> that went into building these engines. Railroad shop workers from the machinists, blacksmiths and plumbers met in St. Louis, Missouri in 1920 {{after a number of}} local plumbers' railroad unions defected to the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers. Although the workers could not agree on which union should have jurisdiction over the work, the workers did agree to form the Federated Railroad Shopmen's Union to protect their work from being taken over by non-railroad workers. In 1921, the federated union disbanded, but the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers won substantial jurisdictional concessions from the plumbers. The conflict would continue into the 1950s, substantially weakening the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers. Finally, on April 26, 1955, the National Mediation Board reaffirmed Amalgamated Sheet Metal Worker jurisdiction over plumbing and pipefitting work in the railroad industry.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} to save trillions of BTU’s in energy usage {{and billions of}} dollars in cost on an annual basis based on use of higher strength steel in major oil and gas transmission pipeline construction is a compelling opportunity recognized by both the US Department of Energy (DOE). The use of high-strength steels (X 100) is expected to result in energy savings across the spectrum, from manufacturing the pipe to transportation and fabrication, including welding of line pipe. Elementary examples of energy savings include more the 25 trillion BTUs saved annually based on lower energy costs to produce the thinner-walled high-strength steel pipe, with the potential for the US part of the Alaskan pipeline alone saving more than 7 trillion BTU in production and much more in transportation and assembling. Annual production, maintenance and installation of just US domestic transmission pipeline is likely to save 5 to 10 times this amount based on current planned and anticipated expansions of oil and gas lines in North America. Among the most important conclusions from these studies were: • While computational weld models to predict residual stress and distortions are well-established and accurate, related microstructure models need improvement. • Fracture Initiation Transition Temperature (FITT) Master Curve properly predicts surface-cracked pipe brittle-to-ductile initiation temperature. It has value in developing Codes and Standards to better correlate full-scale behavior from either CTOD or Charpy test results with the proper temperature shifts from the FITT master curve method. • For stress-based flaw evaluation criteria, the new circumferentially cracked pipe limit-load solution in the 2007 API 1104 Appendix A approach is overly conservative by a factor of 4 /π, which has additional implications.. • For strain-based design of girth weld defects, the hoop stress effect is the most significant parameter impacting CTOD-driving force and can increase the crack-driving force by a factor of 2 depending on strain-hardening, pressure level as a % of SMYS, and flaw size. • From years of experience in circumferential fracture analyses and experimentation, there has not been sufficient integration of work performed for other industries into analogous problems facing the oil and gas pipeline markets. Some very basic concepts and problems solved previously in these fields could have circumvented inconsistencies seen in the stress-based and strain-based analysis efforts. For example, in nuclear utility <b>piping</b> <b>work,</b> more detailed elastic-plastic fracture analyses were always validated in their ability to predict loads and displacements (stresses and strains). The eventual implementation of these methodologies will result in acceleration of the industry adoption of higher-strength line-pipe steels...|$|R
40|$|In 2000 the Hanford Tank Farms {{had one of}} {{the worst}} safety records in the Department of Energy Complex. By the end of FY 08 the safety {{performance}} of the workforce had turned completely around, resulting in one of the best safety records in the DOE complex for operations of its kind. This paper describes the variety of programs and changes that were put in place to accomplish such a dramatic turn-around. The U. S. Department of Energy's 586 -square-mile Hanford Site in Washington State was established during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear materials to end the war. For the next several decades it continued to produce plutonium for the nation's defense, leaving behind vast quantities of radioactive and chemical waste. Much of this waste, 53, 000, 000 gallons, remains stored in 149 aging single-shell tanks and 28 newer double-shell tanks. One of the primary objectives at Hanford is to safely manage this waste until it can be prepared for disposal, but this has not always been easy. These giant underground tanks, many of which date {{back to the beginning of}} the Manhattan Project, range in size from 55, 000 gallons up to 1. 1 million gallons, and are buried beneath 10 feet of soil near the center of the site. Up to 67 of the older single-shell tanks have leaked as much as one million gallons into the surrounding soil. Liquids from the single-shell tanks were removed by 2003 but solids remain in the form of saltcake, sludges and a hardened heel at the bottom of some tanks. The Department of Energy's Office of River Protection was established to safely manage this waste until it could be prepared for disposal. For most of the last seven years the focus has been on safely retrieving waste from the 149 aging single-shell and moving it to the newer double-shell tanks. Removing waste from the tanks is a difficult and complex task. The tanks were made to put waste in, not take it out. Because of the toxic nature of the waste, both chemically as well as radiologically, all retrieval operations must be performed using remote-controlled equipment which has to be installed in each tank, then removed when retrieval is completed. This process involves a variety of potentially hazardous construction activities including crane and rigging, excavation, electrical and <b>piping</b> <b>work.</b> It also requires strong attention to safety to avoid injuries to personnel and contamination of the environment...|$|R

Structural integrity assessments, such as estimating the frequency of loss-of-coolant accidents, are performed by computer codes that require, as input, accurate estimates of flaw densities.

40|$|Air vent {{systems are}} {{designed}} to protect hydropower penstocks and reservoir outlets under various operating conditions. During an emergency closure of an upstream gate the hydraulic jump that forms downstream of the gate is not stationary and may advance downstream potentially increasing the total air demand. A lab-scale physical model of a general outlet <b>works</b> <b>piping</b> configuration was constructed at Reclamation’s Hydraulics Laboratory in Denver, CO to observe hydraulic jump behavior during emergency gate closures. Parameters including gate discharge, gate closure rate, air vent size, and downstream pipe pressure were tested at two different pipe slopes. Results indicate that the hydraulic jump travel speed is dependent on air vent size as well as gate closure rate, both of which affect the internal pressure in the pipe near the vent connection. For a shallow-sloped pipe, the jump speed remains steady throughout the entire pipe length if the air supply is sufficient. However, if air flow is significantly reduced due to an undersized air vent, unsteady travel speeds and pressure surges were observed. This {{was not the case}} for a steep-sloped pipe which produced steady jump speeds for all vent sizes. Once completed, these results are expected to be applicable for prediction of hydraulic jump travel speed and its effects on air demand for vent sizing considerations based on hydraulic operating conditions...|$|R

Far-side inspections of these welds are currently performed on a “best effort ” basis and do not conform to ASME Code Section XI Appendix VIII performance demonstration requirements. For this study, four circumferential welds in 610 mm diameter, 36 mm thick ASTM A- 358, Grade 304 vintage austenitic stainless steel pipe were examined. The welds were fabricated with varied welding parameters; both horizontal and vertical pipe orientations were used, with air and water backing, to simulate field welding conditions. A series of saw cuts, electro-discharge machined (EDM) notches, and implanted fatigue cracks were placed into the heat affected zones of the welds. The saw cuts and notches range in depth from 7. 5 % to 28. 4 % through-wall. The implanted cracks ranged in depth from 5 % through wall to 64 % through wall.

The knowledge of the viscosity of sorbet is essential for the improvement of product quality, the selection of process equipment, and for the optimal design of <b>piping</b> systems. This <b>work</b> aimed firstly, at studying the influence of the ice volume fraction (determined by the product temperature) on the apparent viscosity of a commercial sorbet, and secondly, to propose a rheological model that describes the evolution of the viscosity of the product {{as a function of the}} ice volume fraction. The rheology of sorbet was measured in situ by means of a pipe rheometer connected at the outlet of a continuous scraped surface heat exchanger (SSHE). The pipe rheometer was composed of a series of pipes in PVC of different diameters, making it possible to apply a range of apparent shear rate from 4 to 430 s(- 1). The flow behaviour index of sorbet decreased as the temperature of the product decreased, the effect of which indicates that the product becomes more shear thinning as the freezing of sorbet occurs. The consistency coefficient and therefore the magnitude of the apparent viscosity of sorbet increased with the decrease in product temperature and with the increase of the ice volume fraction. Results also showed that the rheological model described the experimental data within a 20 % error. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The <b>work</b> focuses on developing an accurate AE source location technique. The works {{is divided into three}} main areas of research: 1. Development of Wavelet Transform analysis and Modal Location (WTML) method A novel location method was successfully developed using modal location theory and wavelet transform analysis. Source location was performed on a steel plate of 790 x 300 mm with nominal thickness of 5 mm under a planar location setup using H-N sources. The accuracy of the new technique was compared with the major location methods (the time of arrival (TOA) technique, triple point filtering and DeltaT location methods). The result of the study shows that the WTML method produces more accurate location result compared with other AE location methods. 2. Validation of WTML method for accurate location of fatigue crack growth in steel plate Laboratory fatigue tests were conducted on steel plate in order to monitor and locate fatigue crack growth, and validate the workability of WTML method. WTML was successful in locating the AE signal released from fatigue crack growth. The accuracy of WTML is much better than TOA, DeltaT and triple point filtering location methods. 3.
