5|$|By {{featuring}} {{the life of}} John of Lancaster from early childhood to young adulthood, Heyer conveys a full glimpse of medieval life – court intrigues {{as well as the}} lives of ordinary people are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> Furthermore, while near to major historical players, John's apartness from power allows Heyer to create a fuller depiction of his life without having to change major historical events.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{characters}} became common {{enough that}} Diana Wynne Jones' The Tough Guide To Fantasyland contains an entry on gay mages as a fantasy cliché. Such characters {{are found in}} Mercedes Lackey's works, such as the Lambda award-winning The Last Herald Mage trilogy (1989), in which the protagonists are gay and have magical powers. Their relationships are an integral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> which takes places in the fictional country of Valdemar. Much of the extended series provides non-heterosexual role-models for younger readers.|$|E

5|$|In February 2013, Gary K. Wolf, {{writer of}} the {{original}} novel, said that he, as well as Erik Von Wodtke were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called The Stooge, based on the 1952 film of the same name. The proposed film is set to a prequel, taking place five years before Who Framed Roger Rabbit and <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is about how Roger met Jessica, his future wife. Wolf has stated the film is currently wending its way through Disney.|$|E
5|$|In November 1953, it was {{suggested}} that the existing two episodes could be combined and followed with a condensed live production of the latter <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> for a special Christmas omnibus repeat of the serial. This idea was abandoned. Although Cartier and star Reginald Tate were keen to make an all-film omnibus version for television, this also did not come to fruition. In 1963, one of the existing episodes was selected as a representative of early British programming for the Festival of World Television at the National Film Theatre in London.|$|E
5|$|Nicky Flippers {{was not a}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> as it was {{initially}} conceived and prior to his creation, the investigation {{was going to be}} led by Chief Grizzly. After producer Sue Bea Montgomery and her husband pointed out similarities between the film and the 1950s television series The Thin Man, the Edwards brothers and Leech decided to introduce the character and his dog into the film as an homage. They considered several different types of animals before settling on making him a frog.|$|E
50|$|<b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{occur in}} flashback, with Colin {{discovering}} Liz's infidelity and <b>the</b> after effects <b>of</b> it, which then affect the present, {{in which he}} tries {{to come to terms}} with the shame and torment that this brings to him. <b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> also appear to happen inside Colin's mind, with him trying to reconcile with himself, using his friends as representations of his own turmoil, and his resolving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation.|$|R

5|$|The first season, {{consisting}} of 12 episodes, became available for streaming on Netflix on June 5, 2015, and {{was met with}} generally favorable critical reception. It became notable for its presentation of LGBTQ characters and themes, winning the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Drama Series. It has also been recognized with a Location Managers Guild award for its use of locations as an integral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{also plays}} a part in Operation Garbo, a three-volume novel written by Harry Winter, a pseudonym for an undisclosed number of people. The techno-thriller novel is about a Soviet invasion of Sweden, and while Boden Fortress is not a main <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> one chapter in the first volume briefly mentions Södra Åberget Fort, and two chapters in the second volume are devoted to events at and around the forts, Södra Åberget and Mjösjöberget Forts are mentioned by name while Rödberget Fort is described more in detail.|$|E
5|$|The {{genetic code}} {{is a key}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of life. The main {{hypothesis}} for life's origin is the RNA world hypothesis. Any model {{for the emergence of}} genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.|$|E
50|$|The ending is a {{complete}} departure from the original, in which the wolf is presumably left caged in the zoo. Throughout <b>the</b> latter <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>the</b> duck can be heard quacking inside the wolf, implying it is still alive.|$|R

5|$|Chocobo Tales {{features}} {{a mix of}} three different types of gameplay; role-playing video game, exploration, and card battles. Players explore a 3D environment to find picture books. Upon finding them the player is transported into pop-up picture books to complete minigames and open {{the path to the}} next <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> The picture books take the form of Aesop's Fables and Grimm's Fairy Tales with the player character often taking the main role. Other Final Fantasy characters take up roles within the stories. More simplistic minigames, known as microgames, are also scattered throughout the world. Unlike minigames, these are not located within pop-up books, do not affect the game-world and are not required to progress in the game.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured {{to write a story}} Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted {{to have the opportunity to}} write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E
5|$|Judge John Deed {{regularly}} {{formed the}} backbone of the BBC One winter schedule. The pilot and first series were broadcast on Tuesday evenings at 8p.m., with the second, third and fourth series moving to Thursday evenings (8:30p.m. for the first two and 8p.m. for the latter, though one episode in series three was postponed for over a month). The fifth series moved to Friday nights, and the sixth was shown two nights a week, with the first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> on Tuesday nights and concluding the following Thursday. This series was also the first to be simulcast on BBC HD. Occasionally, due to a clash with regional programming, it has aired at different times on BBC One Scotland; series two was delayed for sometimes over a week while series three began a half-hour earlier. Series five had a six-day delay.|$|E

50|$|<b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{were not}} universally praised; some {{commentators}} felt <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was unrealistic, <b>the</b> player {{and his companions}} unlikeable, and <b>the</b> inconsistency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot's tone awkward.|$|R

5|$|Luka Urushibara is {{a friend}} of Okabe and Lab Member No. 006. His {{appearance}} is that of a female and he acts in a feminine way due to his upbringing, wearing girl's clothing within and outside his father's temple. He is also a close friend and classmate of Shiina, who often asks him to try on her cosplay costumes, but as he is quite shy, he generally refuses. He harbors homosexual feelings towards Okabe, who calls him by a nickname , and thinks of Luka as his pupil. He is 16 years old. While he does become a female for <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and in most of the time lines throughout the story, canonically he is male by the end, and in only one of multiple time lines Luka was female.|$|E
5|$|The comic series , {{picks up}} {{immediately}} after {{the events of the}} television series. Connor is shown sprinting home as ordered by Angel. He debates going back but gets drawn into the battle when the whole city is sent to hell by the Senior Partners. A veteran of hell, Connor takes it upon himself to provide sanctuary to humans and good demons. Along to help him are the benevolent werewolf Nina Ash, the mutant Gwen Raiden, and the vampire Spike. Connor also becomes much closer to Angel as he joins his newest battle to wrestle back control of the city from Demon Lords. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> centers on Connor and Gwen's romance, which ends when he discovers Gwen has betrayed the team.|$|E
5|$|The early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{provides}} an anthropological {{view of the}} culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of {{the early part of the}} novel describes the life that Tenar leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E

5|$|The film {{returns to}} the {{traditional}} gun barrel opening shot, which was altered into <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> for Casino Royale where it {{was moved to the}} beginning of the title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise, and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's Stranger than Fiction and The Kite Runner, MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gunbarrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with graphical user interface, including the electronic table MI6 use, and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> which starts {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the first part but extends into the next seven years, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together, and eventually get married. Tomoya has to endure several hardships that the family has been suffering from, especially Nagisa's illness. Just after Nagisa gives birth to their daughter Ushio, she dies, which causes Tomoya to become severely depressed. He is barely able to function, let alone look after an infant. As a result, Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae, take care of their granddaughter. Five years later, Tomoya meets with Shino Okazaki, his paternal grandmother. Shino tells Tomoya of his father's traumatic past, which is eerily similar to Tomoya's current situation. Afterwards, Tomoya resolves to raise Ushio and acknowledges Naoyuki as his father. Shortly after Tomoya overcomes his depression, Ushio is stricken with the same disease that Nagisa had. Tomoya, Sanae and Akio struggle to save her—Tomoya even quits his job—but all of their efforts turn out to be in vain. In the coming winter, wanting to do anything for his daughter, Tomoya takes her on a trip, but she dies shortly after.|$|E
5|$|The Irregular at Magic High School {{was adapted}} into a manga series with storyboards by Fumino Hayashi and {{illustrations}} by Tsutomu Satō; it was serialized between GFantasys January 2012 and October 2013 issues. Square Enix collected the individual chapters into four tankōbon volumes and released them between September 2012 and December 2013. After {{the conclusion of}} the first manga adaptation, it was immediately followed up with two more adaptations beginning in GFantasys November 2013 issue; the two adaptations were based on the light novel's Nine Schools Competition Arc and Yokohama Disturbance Arc story arcs. The Nine Schools Competition Arc is illustrated by Tsuna Kitaumi and is currently ongoing. It was collected into four tankōbon volumes released between April 2014 and October 2015.
