5|$|Practical {{implementations}} of road {{congestion pricing}} are found {{almost exclusively in}} urban areas, because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers. Autoroute A1 in Northern France {{is one of the}} few cases of congestion pricing implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 congestion <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings. As congestion pricing has been increasing worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide congestion pricing; city center toll ring; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing.|$|E
5|$|Unit <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> readjusted {{and some}} units renamed, {{as well as}} new ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle unit that can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E

25|$|World {{crude oil}} demand grew {{an average of}} 1.76% per year from 1994 to 2006, with a high of 3.4% in 2003–2004. World demand for oil is {{projected}} to increase 37% over 2006 levels by 2030, according to the 2007 U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) annual report. In 2007, the EIA expected demand to reach an ultimate high of , from 2006's , driven {{in large part by}} the transportation sector. A 2008 report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that although drops in petroleum demand due to high <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed in developed countries and are expected to continue, a 3.7 percent rise in demand by 2013 is predicted in developing countries. This is projected to cause a net rise in global petroleum demand during that period.|$|E

25|$|World {{food prices}} {{increased}} dramatically in 2007 {{and the first}} and second quarter of 2008, creating a global crisis and causing political and economic instability and social unrest in both poor and developed nations. Although the media spotlight focused on the riots that ensued in the face of high prices, the ongoing crisis of food insecurity had been years in the making. Systemic causes for the worldwide increases in food prices continue to be the subject of debate. After peaking {{in the second quarter of}} 2008, prices fell dramatically during the late-2000s recession but increased during late 2009 and 2010, reaching new heights in 2011 and 2012 (see 2010–12 world food price crisis) at a level slightly higher than the level reached in 2008. Over the next years, prices fell, reaching a low in March 2016 with the deflated FAO food price index close to pre-crisis level of 2006. Since then <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> increasing, but as of 2017-05 they have not reached crisis levels again.|$|E
500|$|In an {{electricity}} {{system without}} grid energy storage, generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be {{go up and}} down in reaction to {{the rise and fall of}} solar electricity (see load following power plant). [...] While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly follow solar being intermittent due to the weather, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. [...] Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected intermittent sources like solar tend to require investment in some combination of grid interconnections, energy storage or demand side management. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity <b>prices</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing baseload generation contracts.|$|E

In 2010 the GDP grew by a modest 1.6%, {{but over the}} next couple of years economic activity continued to improve, driven by the rebuild in Canterbury after the Christchurch earthquakes and recovery in domestic demand. Through 2011, global conditions deteriorated and the terms of trade eased off their 2011 peak, continuing to moderate until September 2012. Since then, commodity prices have rebounded strongly, with strong demand from China and the international situation improving.
