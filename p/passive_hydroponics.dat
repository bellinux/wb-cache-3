50|$|In basic {{hydroculture}} or <b>passive</b> <b>hydroponics,</b> {{water and}} nutrients are distributed through capillary action. In hydroponics-like hydroculture, water and nutrients are distributed by {{some form of}} pumping mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The various hydroponic media {{available}} {{contain more}} air space than more traditional potting mixes, delivering increased oxygen to the roots. Allowing air {{to reach the}} roots is particularly important in preventing root rot in epiphytic plants such as orchids and bromeliads, whose roots {{are exposed to the}} air in nature. <b>Passive</b> <b>hydroponics</b> also may add additional ambient humidity through evaporation. It is important in passive subirrigation to wash out the system {{from time to time to}} remove salt accumulation. Plants that require drying between waterings or a dry dormant period may fail to thrive under the constant moisture of <b>passive</b> <b>hydroponics.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Like perlite, {{vermiculite}} is {{a mineral}} {{that has been}} superheated until it has expanded into light pebbles. Vermiculite holds more water than perlite and has a natural [...] "wicking" [...] property that can draw water and nutrients in a <b>passive</b> <b>hydroponic</b> system. If too much water and not enough air surrounds the plants roots, {{it is possible to}} gradually lower the medium's water-retention capability by mixing in increasing quantities of perlite.|$|R
50|$|Many {{media are}} {{available}} for <b>passive</b> <b>hydroponics,</b> but the most common are expanded clay pellets, coconut husk chips, perlite, vermiculite, diatomite, charcoal, sand, shredded newspaper, and rock wool. These are frequently used in combination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>hydroponics,</b> semi-hydroponics or passive subirrigation is {{a method}} of growing plants without soil, peat moss, or bark. Instead an inert porous medium {{transports}} water and fertilizer to the roots by capillary action. Water and fertilizer are held in a reservoir and conducted to the roots as necessary, reducing labor and providing a constant supply of water to the roots. In the simplest method, the pot sits in a shallow solution of fertilizer and water or on a capillary mat saturated with nutrient solution. Since routine maintenance is much simplified, <b>passive</b> <b>hydroponics</b> can reduce the labor required to maintain a large collection of plants.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a history}} of notable {{hydroculture}} phenomena. Ancient hydroculture proposed sites, and modern revolutionary works are mentioned. Included in this history are all forms of aquatic and semi-aquatic based horticulture that focus on flora: aquatic gardening, semi-aquatic crop farming, hydroponics, aquaponics, <b>passive</b> <b>hydroponics,</b> and modern aeroponics.|$|E
50|$|Passive sub-irrigation, {{also known}} as <b>passive</b> <b>hydroponics</b> or semi-hydroponics, is a method wherein plants are grown in an inert porous medium that {{transports}} water and fertilizer to the roots by capillary action from a separate reservoir as necessary, reducing labor and providing a constant supply of water to the roots. In the simplest method, the pot sits in a shallow solution of fertilizer and water or on a capillary mat saturated with nutrient solution. The various hydroponic media available, such as expanded clay and coconut husk, contain more air space than more traditional potting mixes, delivering increased oxygen to the roots, which is important in epiphytic plants such as orchids and bromeliads, whose roots {{are exposed to the}} air in nature. Additional advantages of <b>passive</b> <b>hydroponics</b> are the reduction of root rot and the additional ambient humidity provided through evaporations.|$|E
