Cash <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> is used in these hospitals. But with the introduction of the new Financial Regulations for Institutions of Higher Learning, more requirements are imposed on cost accounting and performance appraisal, which makes the strengths <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> more visible. In this paper, the author conducts a comparative study and draws a conclusion that adding accounts receivable and payable and accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> to the existing cash <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> is conducive to the authenticity of financial information...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (International Accounting) This limited-scope {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on a case study performed on a trading entity in a national department in South African government. This limited-scope dissertation contributes to the body of knowledge by examining the effect of the adoption <b>of</b> the accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> on the quality of information available for decision making. There are arguments that the accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> will provide enhanced information for decision making and that it will increase the ability of the users of financial statements to evaluate the financial position and financial performance of entities in the public sector. This limited-scope dissertation assesses the effect of the adoption <b>of</b> the accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> on decision usefulness of information provided in the financial statements of departments in South Africa. This assessment is effected based on the financial statements of a trading entity in a department in South Africa, which has already adopted accrual accounting. To enable an objective assessment of the effect of the adoption <b>of</b> the accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting,</b> two sets <b>of</b> financial statements, in respect of the same entity and the same financial period are compared, one prepared on the modified cash <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> and the other prepared on the accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> {{by governments}} {{is an important}} element to transform the bureaucratic administrative cash-based system to a more informative financial management system to ensure the supply of comprehensive, reliable, and meaningful financial information for appropriate accountability and decision making. Yemen is engaged in such reform, with advent of the E-Government, Information and Telecommunication Technologies era. This study describes the Yemen Central Government’s accounting and reporting system, its institutional framework, its policy characteristics and the environmental conditions that are in favour and unfavourable of such reform change. It also investigates the relationships between attitudes, innovative and organisational factors, {{as well as the}} adoption <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> barriers and its implementation. Additionally, it investigates the moderating effects of E-Government between the abovementioned relationships during the face of change. This is to test if E-Government interaction will influence the strength and direction of the mentioned relationships in the model, and if the predictive power of that model would be increased. Finally, it examines the feasibility <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> in Yemen. This study applied multiple theories, multi-method approaches (mixed-methods), and utilised qualitative and quantitative methodologies for data (analysis), collected from questionnaires and interview surveys. Twenty hypotheses are tested. The findings show that innovative and organisational factors have a positive relationship with an attitude toward change, while barriers have a negative relationship with an attitude toward change, but E-Government has a positive relationship with an attitude toward change. The results show that institutional frameworks such as the current Yemen governmental accounting and reporting framework, have an acceptable level of moving towards accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting,</b> while accounting system objectives and reporting policy specifications reveal acceptable level of objectives and insufficient level of reporting policy. Even though the Yemen government officially announced the adoption <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> and performed several alterations on the accounting system toward accrual basis, central government accounting officials are still using (modified) cash basis accounting. Computer integration, across governmental departments, is not complete. Environmental factors that contributed to change from cash basis to accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> are reform stimuli, pressures related to other reforms, and forces of globalisation. The contextual variables are in favour of moving toward accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting.</b> Attitudes toward change were found to have a full mediation effect between innovation factors, organisational factors, barriers, and E-Government, emphasising the important role of accountants, financial managers, and others in the feasible adoption and implementation <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting.</b> E-Government shows a moderating effect on the relationships between all independent variables and the mediating variable of attitude toward change. This study found Government officials' attitude toward change from cash basis <b>accounting</b> to accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> to be very critical for the adoption and implementation of such change. Government financial officials have to be in line with the change process and their support is crucial for a successful adoption. E-Government (capabilities) is an important element in the success of the adoption and implementation <b>of</b> accrual <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting...</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are certain}} {{advantages}} in tax planning when the cash method <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> is used: for instance, payment of business expenses may be accelerated before year end, {{in order to}} maximize tax deductions, whereas billings for services may be postponed to after year end, so that payments won't be received until the new year, thus postponing tax payments on such income. Because of these advantages and the manipulations that can occur with it in order to minimize taxable income, the IRS has discouraged (although not prohibited entirely) the cash <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> for tax purposes. For instance the companies that use the cash <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> may not report any inventory in their financial statements, in fact reporting of any inventory at year end can lead to manipulation of taxable income to an enormous extent.|$|R
