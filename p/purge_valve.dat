50|$|The {{high oil}} {{consumption}} problem {{associated with the}} Knight double sleeve valve was fixed with the Burt-McCollum single sleeve valve, as perfected by Bristol. The models that had the complex 'junk head' installed a non-return <b>purging</b> <b>valve</b> on it; as liquids cannot be compressed, the presence {{of oil in the}} head space would result in problems. Mike Hewland, after adding an expander ring that worked in reserve, found the oil consumption of his single sleeve valve engines was half that of a similar poppet valve engine. 'In this engine all we really have to lubricate is the crankshaft, the rest seems to lubricate itself' (C&D, Jul 1974). At top dead centre (TDC), the single-sleeve valve rotates in relation to the piston. This prevents boundary lubrication problems, as piston ring ridge wear at TDC and bottom dead centre (BDC) does not occur. The Bristol Hercules time between overhauls (TBO) life was rated at 3,000 hours, very good for an aircraft engine, but not so for automotive engines. Sleeve wear was located primarily in the upper part, inside the 'junk head'.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{improving}} {{energy efficiency}} becomes a main challenge for all industrial energy systems. This challenge involves an improved recovery of wasted heat generated by several industrial processes. Large energy savings and potential environmental benefits {{are associated with}} the use of industrial heat pump mainly at high temperature levels. A laboratory flexible industrial scale heat recovery system is able to reproduce the operating conditions of real case simulating energetic losses and requirements in high temperature industrial applications. The integrated heat pump is an electrically-driven vapor compression using a twin screw compressor. Water vapor has been adopted as a working fluid using a modified screw compressor to carry out a dry compression process at high temperature levels. This heat pump generates vapor using flash evaporation. A <b>purging</b> <b>valve</b> is implemented in order to eliminate non-condensable gases present in system. Experimental simulation of the start-up phase has been presented showing the non-condensable purging process and the evolution of some parameters of the heat pump. Several scenarios of industrial processes for high-temperature heat recovery (heat sources between 80 °C and 90 °C) and heat upgrading are numerically simulated. The presented results show the global energy savings and the environmental benefits of using water as refrigerant at high temperature levels...|$|R

50|$|Many hookahs are {{equipped}} with a <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> connected to the airspace in the water jar to purge stale smoke that has been sitting unused in the jar for too long. This one-way valve is typically a simple ball bearing sitting over a port that seals the port by gravity alone and will open if positive pressure is created by blowing into the hose. The bearing is held captive with a screw-on cover. The cover should be opened and the bearing and seat cleaned of residue and corrosion regularly to ensure proper sealing.|$|E
5000|$|Deposits {{reduce the}} heat {{transfer}} in the boiler, reduce the flow rate and eventually block boiler tubes. Any non-volatile salts and minerals that will remain when the feedwater is evaporated must be removed, because they will become concentrated in the liquid phase and require excessive [...] "blow-down" [...] (draining) to prevent the formation of solid precipitates. Even worse are minerals that form scale. Therefore, the make-up water added to replace any losses of feedwater must be demineralized/deionized water, unless a <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> is used to remove dissolved minerals.|$|E

Stale smoke may be exhausted through the <b>purge</b> <b>valve,</b> if present. This one-way valve is opened by the positive pressure created from gently blowing into the hose. It will not function on a multiple-hose hookah unless all other hoses are plugged. Sometimes one-way valves are put in the hose sockets to avoid the need to manually plug hoses.|$|E
50|$|Other freeflows may {{be caused}} by the second stage valve jamming due to grit or {{corrosion}} products fouling the movement of the valve poppet, or the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> sticking in the depressed position. These can sometimes be stopped by pressing the purge button a few times to free up the works. If all else fails, the diver can breathe from a freeflowing demand valve by allowing excess air to escape from the sides of the mouth and the exhaust valve, which may allow a safe ascent, or at least the use of as much remaining gas as possible. When a full-face mask is used, excess gas will be vented through the exhaust valve and around the mask skirt, usually allowing the diver to continue to breathe without difficulty during the freeflow. This does not help after the cylinder has emptied.|$|E

40|$|The STS- 55 initial launch attempt of Columbia (OV 102) was {{terminated}} on KSC launch pad A March 22, 1993 at 9 : 51 AM E. S. T. due to violation of an ME- 3 (Engine 2011) Launch Commit Criteria (LCC) limit exceedance. The event description and timeline are summarized. Propellant loading was initiated on 22 March, 1993 at 1 : 15 AM EST. All SSME chill parameters and launch commit criteria (LCC) were nominal. At engine start plus 1. 44 seconds, a Failure Identification (FID) was posted against Engine 2011 for exceeding the 50 psia Oxidizer Preburner (OPB) purge pressure redline. The engine {{was shut down}} at 1. 50 seconds followed by Engines 2034 and 2030. All shut down sequences were nominal and the mission was safely aborted. The OPB purge pressure redline violation and the abort profile/overlay for all three engines are depicted. SSME Avionics hardware and software performed nominally during the incident. A review of vehicle data table (VDT) data and controller software logic revealed no failure indications other than the single FID 013 - 414, OPB purge pressure redline exceeded. Software logic was executed according to requirements {{and there was no}} anomalous controller software operation. Immediately following the abort, a Rocketdyne/NASA failure investigation team was assembled. The team successfully isolated the failure cause to the oxidizer preburner augmented spark igniter <b>purge</b> check <b>valve</b> not being fully closed due to contamination. The source of the contaminant was traced to a cut segment from a rubber O-ring which was used in a fine clean tool during valve production prior to 1992. The valve was apparently contaminated during its fabrication in 1985. The valve had performed acceptably on four previous flights of the engine, and SSME flight history shows 780 combined check valve flights without failure. The failure of an Engine 3 (SSME No. 2011) check valve to close was sensed by onboard engine instruments even though all other engine operations were normal. This resulted in an engine shutdown and safe sequential shutdown of all three engines prior to ignition of the solid boosters...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} century the petro {{chemical}} industry has provided an abundant and cheap source of hydrocarbons that have impacted and transformed many facets of our lives. Petrochemicals not only provide fuel that revolutionized transportation industry but also provided cheap petrochemical feedstock molecules that form a basis of many textiles, plastics, adhesives, detergents, and lubricants that are indispensable in modern life. Our dependence on the petrochemical industry and the sheer quantity of petrochemical based products that are consumed {{have led to a}} number of adverse and unintended effects on our environment. Recent attention to unintended effects of the petrochemical industry such as climate change, air pollution, and landfill overflow have sparked renewed interest in green chemistry and research in renewables that could potentially decrease our dependence on the petrochemical industry. Over the last two decades, with the advent of simple and cheap genetic engineering, a new field called metabolic engineering has emerged. A large focus of this field is centered around re-engineering the metabolism of simple organisms to produce bulk and specialty chemicals. We genetically engineered a lithoautotrophic organism, Ralstonia eutropha, to produce drop-in ready biofuels (isobutanol and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol) in an electro-bio reactor using CO 2 as the sole carbon source and electricity as the sole energy input. This method integrates electrochemical formate production and biological CO 2 fixation and higher alcohol synthesis. The liquid fuels generated are a relatively stable way to store energy and possess energy densities about 100 times higher than current-day batteries. A different approach to metabolic engineering coined synthetic biochemistry seeks to reconstitute complex metabolic pathways outside of cells. The Synthetic Biochemistry approach eliminates the myriad unwanted side reactions that occur in cells and product toxicity, enabling near 100 % theoretical yields. Unfortunately, eliminating the cellular environment also eliminates key regulatory networks involved in maintaining appropriate carbon flux and cofactor balance. Synthetic biochemistry seeks to replace these complex regulatory networks in vitro by creating self-balancing pathways that automatically regulate the production and consumption of cofactors while maintaining constant carbon flux through the pathway. To this end, we developed the concept of a molecular <b>purge</b> <b>valve.</b> Generally, the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> is made up of a NADPH dependent oxidase, a NADH dependent oxidase and a NADH specific oxidase (noxE). We first demonstrated this proof of concept by engineering the G. stearothermophilus pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to flip its cofactor specificity from NADH to NADPH and using it in the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> to transform pyruvate to either polyhydroxybutyrate bioplastic or isoprene at near quantitative yields. The concept of using a <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> to maintain carbon flux in an inherently imbalanced pathway was expanded through the production of polyhydroxybutyrate from glucose using a synthetic pathway called the PBG cycle. The PBG cycle is made up of enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway, the bifido shunt, and standard glycolysis (EMP). This pathway utilizes the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> concept at the two reductase enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway and produced the bioplastic polyhydroxybutyrate from glucose. The PBG pathway ran semi-continuously for 55 hours and produced 86 % yield from 110 mM glucose. The pathway had a maximum productivity of 0. 7 g/L PHB and maintained 50 % of its productivity {{over the course of the}} 55 hours at room temperature. The PBG cycle serves as a demonstration that synthetic biochemistry could be an alternative to in vivo metabolic engineering for the production of bulk and specialty chemicals and could potentially be one way to replace some of the petrochemicals we use today with renewable bio-based chemicals...|$|E
40|$|This new utility patent is {{an active}} design that relies on the lung's role as an organic heat {{exchanger}} for providing deep body core heating of air. It {{is based on the}} fact that the greatest heat loss mechanism for an insulated human body immersed in a cold water environment is due to heat loss through respiration. This innovation successfully merges two existing technologies (cold immersion suit and existing valve technologies) to produce a new product that helps prevent against the onset of hypothermia at sea. During normal operations, a human maintains an approximate body temperature of [98. 6 F (37 C) ]. A mechanism was developed to recover the warm temperature from the body and reticulate it in a survival suit. The primary intention is to develop an encompassing systems design that can both easily and cost effectively be integrated in all existing currently manufactured cold water survival suits, and as such, it should be noted that the cold water immersion suit is only used as a framework or tool for laying out the required design elements. At the heart of the suit is the Warm Air Recovery (WAR) system, which relies on a single, large Main <b>Purge</b> <b>Valve</b> (MPV) and secondary Purge Valves (PV) to operate. The main <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> has a thin membrane, which is normally closed, and acts as a one-way check valve. When warm air is expelled from the lungs, it causes the main <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> to open. Air forced from the MPV is dumped directly into the suit, thereby providing warmth to the torso, legs, and arms. A slight positive over-pressure in the suit causes warm waste air (or water if the suit is punctured) to be safely vented into the sea through large PVs located at the bottom of each arm and leg. The secondary purge valves act to prevent the buildup of large concentrations of CO 2 gas and help guard against asphyxia. It is noted that the MPV causes the inhalation and exhalation cycles to be completely isolated from one another in the current suit design...|$|E

A pressure-resistant rising pipe (1) e. g. steel pipe, opens out into the aquarium tank, and produces an increased hydrostatic pressure in the aquarium tank by a liquid column located in the rising pipe. The aquarium tank is arranged in an underground mine e. g. coal mine. The rising pipe is upwardly extended over an earth surface for increasing hydrostatic pressure in the aquarium tank.

40|$|Though lots of {{numerical}} {{methods have}} been proposed in the literature to optimize me-chanical structures at {{the final stage of}} the design process, few designers use these tools since the first stage. However, a minor modification at the first step can bring significant change to the global performances of the structure. Usually, during the initial stage, models are based on theoretical and empirical equations, which are often characterized by mixed variables: continuous (e. g. geometrical dimensions), discrete (e. g. the cross section of a beam available in a catalogue) and/or integer (e. g. the number of layers in a composite material). Furthermore, the functions involved may be non differentiable, or even discontinuous. Therefore, classical algorithms based on the computation of sensi-tivities are no more applicable. Consequently, to solve these problems, the most wide-spread meta-heuristic methods are evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which work as follows: the best individuals among an initial population of randomly generated potential solutions are favoured and com-bined (by specific operators like crossover and mutation) in order to create potentially better individuals at the next generation. The creation of new generations is repeated till the convergence is reached. The ability of EAs to explore widely the design space is useful to solve single-objective unconstrained optimization problems, because it gener-ally prevents from getting trapped into a local optimum, but it is also well known that they do not perform very efficiently in the presence of constraints. Furthermore, in many industrial applications, multiple objectives are pursued together. Therefore, {{to take into account the}} constrained and multicriteria aspects of optimization problems in EAs, a new method called PAMUC (Preferences Applied to MUltiobjectiv-ity and Constraints) has been proposed in this dissertation. First the user has to assign weights to the m objectives. Then, an additional objective function is built by linearly aggregating the normalized constraints. Finally, a multicriteria decision aid method, PROMETHEE II, is used in order to rank the individuals of the population following the m+ 1 objectives. PAMUC has been validated on standard multiobjective test cases, as well as on the pa-rametrical optimization of the <b>purge</b> <b>valve</b> and the feed valve of the Vinci engine, both designed by Techspace Aero for launcher Ariane 5. en sciences appliquéesinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
