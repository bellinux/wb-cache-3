40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} {{correlation study}} {{is concerned with}} accounting practitioners 2 ̆ 7 receptivity to a <b>propose</b> <b>change</b> in accounting education; specifically, that the existing three year degree course be extended to four years. This <b>change</b> is <b>proposed</b> by the Accounting Profession in Australia. A model of accounting practitioners 2 ̆ 7 receptivity towards the <b>proposed</b> <b>change,</b> at the adoption stage, was revised and adapted from a general model of teacher receptivity to any system-wide change. The revised model has one dependent variable, receptivity, which is measured in three aspects; overall feelings, attitudes, and general behaviour intentions towards the <b>proposed</b> <b>change</b> in accounting education. It has eight Independent variables, {{and a number of}} situation variables. These independent variables are; attitudes towards the structure and content of the <b>proposed</b> <b>change,</b> general beliefs about the change based on the expanding scope of accounting practice, overall feelings about {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} accounting graduates, overall feelings about alleviating fears and uncertainties of the <b>proposed</b> <b>change,</b> overall feelings about the practicality of the <b>proposed</b> <b>change</b> in the lecture room and tutorial room in two aspects, general behaviour intentions about expectations and achievements for the <b>proposed</b> <b>change,</b> and general behaviour intentions to support instructors and the accounting profession.

This <b>proposed</b> <b>change</b> revises certain TS requirements associated with demonstrating the operability of alternate trains when redundant equipment is made or {{found to be}} inoperable. These excessive testing requirements are unnecessary to maintain adequate assurance of system operability, and may result in unintended consequences, such as premature wear of components. Other surveillance requirements provide adequate assurance that redundant systems and components are operable and capable of performing their intended safety function.

The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to stand for a second term.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{the state of}} New York {{submitted}} a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered.

5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style. The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and the <b>proposed</b> <b>changes</b> passed with very slim margins. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E

McClory got wind of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film Thunderball, back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s. McClory threatened to sue Broccoli for alleged copyright infringement, claiming that he had the sole right to include SPECTRE and its agents in all films. Not wishing to extend the already ongoing legal dispute that could have delayed the production of The Spy Who Loved Me, Broccoli requested Wood remove all references to Blofeld and SPECTRE from the script.|$|E

Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic.
