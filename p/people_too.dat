5|$|The American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is also {{native to}} the region and has been {{designated}} as endangered since 1975. Unlike their relatives the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such as estuarine or marine coasts. Their most significant threat is disturbance by <b>people.</b> <b>Too</b> much contact with humans causes females to abandon their nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories and attempting to cross U.S. 1 and Card Sound Road in the Florida Keys. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000crocodiles in southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were <b>people</b> <b>too</b> poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have <b>people</b> <b>too</b> young to have played the games experience them; his son was only {{old enough to know}} the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was to have <b>people</b> <b>too</b> young to have played the games experience them, as his son was only {{old enough to know}} the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E

25|$|A person's {{strategies}} to respond or {{react to a}} stimulus, and to solve problems, often change over time and over tasks.

25|$|Kven and Sami people share {{a common}} history of Norwegianization. However, post-Norwegianization {{policies}} have treated them differently.

Some Kvens believe the distribution of rights and public funds has favored the Sami <b>people</b> <b>too</b> much, whereas on the Sami side there are people who think the Norwegian minority politics and public funding should focus mostly on the Sami people.|$|E
25|$|Tong Chi-On – On is a 30-year-old man who {{strives to}} do his best for the Tong family.

Although his manner is regarded as loving and caring, he is gullible in his relationships and trusts in <b>people</b> <b>too</b> easily often leading to disastrous results. His greatest desire is to find his real family as he is an adopted son of the Tong family and not of true blood, it turns out he is really Gai's son with a third woman. His love interest is Sheung Joi Sum and although she doesn't love him, he still cares for her. He is a comic character in the beginning but by the end he matures greatly. He stands in the place of Hau after her death and is also straightforward in his acts, rejecting Kam's return to the family (much to the dismay of his father).|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} {{sexuality}} was further explored through Sarah, seeing her have relations with Zoe Carpenter {{and a serious}} relationship with Lydia Hart, which Batley initially found strange to portray because of Sarah's many relationships with male characters. Other story lines include her embarkment on a modelling career, competing in swimming competitions and her many relationships. According to Batley, Sarah relies on <b>people</b> <b>too</b> much for support and was [...] "man-crazy" [...] in her early years. Sarah's final storyline is her death in a skydiving accident, which was a first for a British soap opera. The storyline aired in the second series of Hollyoaks Later and was devised by producer Bryan Kirkwood. Sarah's death won [...] "Spectacular Scene Of The Year" [...] at the British Soap Awards in 2010 and the scenes have been praised by certain critics.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} script for [...] "Subway", Yoshimura wanted the Pembleton {{character}} to be confronted with his own mortality, a theme that had continued from the previous season in which the character suffered a stroke. Although Pembleton does not typically discuss his own feelings, Yoshimura {{wanted him to be}} placed in a situation in which he not only discussed death, but is also led by the unique circumstance of Lange's subway incident to confide his stroke experience to an almost complete stranger. From the beginning of the writing process, Yoshimura specifically wanted the Lange character to be mean and unpleasant, rather than the nice and innocent victim more typically portrayed in such television episodes: [...] "Tragedy can happen to jerky <b>people</b> <b>too</b> and I think it'd be much more interesting to see how that kind of character's circumstances transcends the typical cliched TV kind of victim." ...|$|E
