40|$|One of the {{phenomena}} that make superconductors unique materials is the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect. This effect {{results in a}} state in which an applied magnetic field is expelled from {{the bulk of the}} material because of the circulation near its surface of resistance-free currents, also known as Meissner currents. Notwithstanding the intense research on the Meissner state, local fields due to the interaction of Meissner currents with <b>pinning</b> <b>centres</b> have not received much attention. Here we report that the Meissner currents, when flowing through an area containing a <b>pinning</b> <b>centre,</b> generate in its vicinity two opposite sense current half-loops producing a bound vortex–antivortex pair, which eventually may transform into a fully developed vortex–antivortex pair ultimately separated in space. The generation of such vortex dipoles by Meissner currents is not restricted to superconductors; similar topological excitations may be present in other systems with Meissner-like phases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Boosting {{large-scale}} superconductor applications require nanostructured conductors {{with artificial}} <b>pinning</b> <b>centres</b> immobilizing quantized vortices at high temperature and magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate a highly effective mechanism of artificial <b>pinning</b> <b>centres</b> in solution-derived high-temperature superconductor nanocomposites through generation of nanostrained regions where Cooper pair formation is suppressed. The nanostrained regions identified from {{transmission electron microscopy}} devise a very high concentration of partial dislocations associated with intergrowths generated between the randomly oriented nanodots and the epitaxial YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 matrix. Consequently, an outstanding vortex-pinning enhancement correlated to the nanostrain is demonstrated for four types of randomly oriented nanodot, and a unique evolution towards an isotropic vortex-pinning behaviour, even in the effective anisotropy, is achieved as the nanostrain turns isotropic. We suggest a new vortex-pinning mechanism based on the bond-contraction pairing model, where pair formation is quenched under tensile strain, forming new and effective core-pinning regions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{systematic}} study of dc electric fields produced by sinusoidal high frequency ac currents in Nb superconducting films {{subject to a}} constant magnetic field perpendicular to the film plane. At frequencies in the 100 kHz to MHz range appears a new rectification effect {{which has not been}} previously observed at lower frequencies. We have observed the dc electric field generated in this regime in films without intentionally created anisotropic <b>pinning</b> <b>centres,</b> i. e. plain films, both in strip geometry as in cross-shape geometry, and also in films with symmetric periodic <b>pinning</b> <b>centres.</b> The electric field appears in both directions along and transverse to the alternating current and is essentially different at opposite film sides. It depends strongly on the intensity of the magnetic field and may exceed by nearly an order of magnitude the rectified electric fields recently reported at lower frequencies (few kHz) in systems with artificially induced anisotropic vortex pinning. The effect has a non-monotonic dependence on the drive current frequency, being maximum around a few 100 kHz to MHz, and shows a complicated temperature dependence. It is found to be different in long strips and cross shape samples. In the case of films with symmetric periodic <b>pinning</b> <b>centres</b> the rectified voltage shows a lower magnitude than in plain films, and shows an interesting structure when the applied magnetic field crosses the matching fields. We are only able to put forward tentative ideas to explain this phenomenon, which irrespective of its explanation should be taken into account in experimental studies of rectification effects in superconductors. status: publishe...|$|R

This project investigated {{the increase in}} critical current density (J_c) and related physical properties of YBCO films by self-assembling nanotechnology of <b>pinning</b> <b>centres,</b> using substrate decoration, quasi-multilayers (using noble metals and Pr_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_ 7 (PBCO) in both cases), and targets containing BaZrO_ 3 (BZO) nano-inclusions. Samples were prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on single crystal SrTiO_ 3 (STO) substrates and on Ni-W Rolling-Assisted Biaxially Textured Substrates (RABiTS). Optical lithography and chemical etching were used to prepare samples for transport measurements. The superconducting properties were characterised by AC susceptibility, magnetisation loops and transport measurements using a Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) and a Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS). Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM) and (TEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction were also used to characterise the micro-structure of the films {{and the structure of}} artificially-induced <b>pinning</b> <b>centres.</b> The optimum conditions for the growth of YBCO films, Ag and PBCO nano-dots, and BZO nano-columns were investigated. Combinations of all three nana-structuring approaches resulted in a maximum J_c in applied fields and self-field. The related physical properties such as angular dependence of J_c, vortex melting line, pinning force, frequency dependence of J_c, were also investigated to understand pinning mechanisms in the films. The combination of Ag nano-dots and BZO nano-inclusions in the YBCO target provided the greatest improvement of critical currents of the film in applied fields.
