40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} methods for using linguistically {{motivated}} information {{to enhance the}} performance of statistical machine translation (SMT). One {{of the advantages of}} the statistical approach to machine translation is that it is largely language-agnostic. Machine learning models are used to automatically learn translation patterns from data. SMT can, however, be improved by using linguistic knowledge to address specific areas of the translation process, where translations would be hard to learn fully automatically. We present methods that use linguistic knowledge at various levels to improve statistical machine translation, focusing on Arabic-English translation as a case study. In the first part, morphological information is used to preprocess the Arabic text for Arabic-to-English and English-to-Arabic translation, which reduces the gap in the complexity of the morphology between Arabic and English. The second method addresses the issue of long-distance reordering in translation to account for the difference in the syntax of the two languages. In the third part, we show how additional local context information on the source side is incorporated, which helps reduce lexical ambiguity. Two methods are proposed for using binary decision trees to control the amount of context information introduced. These methods are successfully applied to the use of diacritized Arabic source in Arabic-to-English translation. The final method combines the outputs of an SMT system and a Rule-based MT (RBMT) system, taking advantage of the flexibility of the statistical approach and the rich linguistic knowledge embedded in the rule-based MT system. by Rabih M.

5000|$|Davis {{attended}} Friends Academy, in Locust Valley, New York, {{from kindergarten}} through sixth grade, while his mother was an English teacher and assistant principal. In 1966 Davis enrolled at Eaglebrook School, in Deerfield, Massachusetts, where he spent grades 7 through 9 and graduated in 1970. In 1966 Davis, then age 11, learned computer programming, by participating in the testing {{and development of the}} BASIC computer language via a time-sharing hookup to Dartmouth College, where BASIC was being developed. In 1970 Davis enrolled at Northfield Mt. Hermon School, in Northfield, Massachusetts, where he spent his sophomore and junior years. He spent his {{senior year of high school}} at Collins Brook School, in Freeport, Maine. The school was modeled after and run by former educators of the progressive Summerhill School in Suffolk, England. Davis graduated in 1973 from Collins Brook, where his senior class consisted of only six people. In 1978 Davis enrolled in Antioch College and completed his B.A. in Botany. The Wall St. Journal described Davis as [...] "a teen-age prodigy who earned a B.A. in only one year." [...] In 1979 Davis continued at Antioch College, and he earned his M.S. in Ecosystems Management in 1981. In 1980 Davis enrolled at Union Institute & University as a degree candidate for a <b>PhD</b> <b>in</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Technology.</b> His dissertation was titled [...] "Computer Assisted Publishing," [...] and although Davis did not complete his PhD, the dissertation formed the groundwork for a book he coauthored—Desktop Publishing—one of the first books to be published on that topic.|$|E

40|$|Women have {{historically}} been underrepresented {{in the field of}} <b>information</b> <b>technology.</b> The literature related to the underrepresentation of women <b>in</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> has focused on developing strategies for attracting more females into the industry. Despite these efforts, the number of women <b>in</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> has been declining. The factors that contribute to the career persistence of women <b>in</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> were investigated. An exploratory multiple case study methodology was used with nine women who have been employed <b>in</b> the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> field for a minimum of five years. The subjects underwent a series of two interviews that focused on the reasons why they thought they had been able to have sustained careers <b>in</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology.</b> A qualitative analysis of the interviews was conducted to determine the factors that the subjects identified as contributors to their career persistence. The interviews were also analyzed to discover whether women that have had sustained careers <b>in</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> conceptualize their experiences from particular feminist perspectives. The findings provided insights into the following factors that contribute to career persistence among women <b>in</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology.</b> These factors included how a woman 2 transitioned into her first <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> position, personal traits, effective career strategies, and effective coping strategies. While there will be individual differences, each subject presented that a combination of the stated factors directly contributed to her sustained career <b>in</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology.</b> Women <b>in</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> were found to conceptualize their experiences through a variety of feminist perspectives. The existential feminist perspective was used extensively as a rationale for how societal expectations shape peoples view of women <b>in</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology.</b> The Marxist/socialist feminist and radical feminist perspectives were utilized when describing the barriers against women <b>in</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology.</b> The liberal feminist and postmodern feminist perspectives served as a foundation for recommendations to increase the likelihood for women entering and staying in the field of <b>information</b> <b>technology.</b> Department of Educational LeadershipThesis (D.
