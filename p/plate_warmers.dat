60|$|After him marched the {{attendant}} of Dr. Sitgreaves, who had instinctively seized an enormous tureen, as most resembling matters he understood, and followed on in place, until the steams of the soup so completely bedimmed the spectacles he wore, as {{a badge of}} office, that, on arriving {{at the scene of}} action, he was compelled to deposit his freight on the floor, until, by removing the glasses, he could see his way through the piles of reserved china and <b>plate</b> <b>warmers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dining car Sky View (Pullman plan number 7556) could {{accommodate}} 52 {{people in}} three different dining rooms. It sat 24 in its main dining room, 18 in its dome, and 10 in its reserve private dining room beneath the dome. It was both the first dome diner to be built and the first diner of any kind with an all-electric kitchen. At its front end, the car featured the crew's toilet, an icemaker, and food storage accessible from the kitchen. The kitchen covered roughly the first third of the car, and it entirely constructed of stainless steel and featured a pan floor made of the anti-slip material Martex. The kitchen featured {{a wide array of}} electric appliances, including a frozen food locker, a General Electric (GE) broiler, a GE garbage disposal unit, three GE ranges, a Hobart dishwasher, a hot table, a water heater, a Hotpoint fry kettle, a KitchenAid mixer, three ovens, <b>plate</b> <b>warmers,</b> and Pullman-Standard refrigerators with mechanics made by Frigidaire. The kitchen also featured long counter spaces, a pastry board, a sink, and storage lockers.|$|E
40|$|We have amplified an 84 bp {{fragment}} {{from the}} insertion sequence IS 6110 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA {{on a paper}} substrate in 10 min. Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious disease with a high mortality rate in the developing countries. Cheap and rapid screening assays are needed {{at the point of}} care for timely intervention and treatment. While PCR-based detection of TB is faster than bacterial culture and more specific compared to microscopy, PCR is not viable as a routine screening test in many low-income countries where TB is endemic due to the requirement of an expensive thermocycler. Disease screening based on isothermal amplification techniques is, therefore, being explored as an alternative to PCR. Successful isothermal amplification of DNA from HIV, H 1 N 1, Chlamydia trachomatis, E. coli, etc. on cheap and disposable paper substrates has been reported in the literature. Isothermal amplification of MTB DNA on paper has been challenging due to the high GC content (65 %) of MTB genome. Here we report helicase dependent amplification of a fragment of MTB DNA on a paper substrate in 10 min starting from 100 copies of the template using inexpensive heat sources, such as hot <b>plates</b> and hand <b>warmers.</b> The enzyme mix used to amplify DNA can be spotted and stored dry on paper at ambient temperatures for more than a month. The DNA amplified on paper can be detected by incorporating a suitable fluorescence marker in the reaction mixture or by directly loading the paper in a standard gel electrophoresis set up. Finally, as a surrogate to real clinical sputum samples, MTB DNA was successfully amplified on paper in the viscous environment of artificial sputum...|$|R
