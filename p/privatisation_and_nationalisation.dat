40|$|Where does higher {{education}} in the United Kingdom sit today in terms of the public–private distinction, and what does that distinction mean in the {{higher education}} context? This article considers these questions and related issues, noting how the particular example of the United Kingdom compares with other systems internationally. Following a historical exploration of the meaning of 'public', 'private' and other related terms, an examination is undertaken of their currency during the post-war period in the UK higher education system. This is exemplified through an analysis of the two major British higher education reports of the last 50 years – the Robbins Report of 1963 and the Dearing Report of 1997. It is argued that the contemporary UK higher education system could be seen as suffering from the worst of both worlds, trapped between and suffering from the seemingly contrary pressures of <b>privatisation</b> <b>and</b> <b>nationalisation...</b>|$|E
50|$|Despite its democratic-socialist ideas, the Peoples Party never {{actually}} allied with communism, the Communist Party remaining {{one of its}} major rivals (The CPP is headquartered in Hyderabad, Sindh). The Peoples Party has been criticised by various socialists such as Fahad Rizwan who accused the Peoples Party of opportunism.

5|$|It {{shares a}} similar right-wing policy {{platform}} with UKIP, with Nattrass stating as such amid the party's launch. Key policies include withdrawing the UK from the European Union (EU), prioritising {{relations with the}} Commonwealth of Nations and introducing more stringent measures on immigration. It further supports widespread use of referenda, promoting English devolution and abolishing the National Assembly for Wales. Nattrass places his party {{to the left of}} UKIP, however, due to both the party's general opposition to <b>privatisation</b> <b>and</b> its proposed <b>nationalisation</b> of targeted infrastructure and amenities.|$|R

50|$|The Labor Party is {{commonly}} {{described as a}} social democratic party, and its constitution stipulates {{that it is a}} democratic socialist party. The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement. Thus at the first federal election 1901 Labor's platform called for a White Australia Policy, a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes. Labor has at various times supported high tariffs and low tariffs, conscription and pacifism, White Australia <b>and</b> multiculturalism, <b>nationalisation</b> <b>and</b> <b>privatisation,</b> isolationism <b>and</b> internationalism.|$|R
