500|$|In 2015 Emanuel Tschopp, Octávio Mateus, and Roger Benson {{released}} {{a paper on}} diplodocoid systematics, and proposed that genera could be diagnosed by thirteen differing characters, and species separated based on six. The minimum number for generic separation was chosen {{based on the fact}} that A.ajax and A.louisae differ in twelve characters, and Diplodocus carnegiei and D.hallorum differ in eleven characters. Thus, thirteen characters were chosen to validate the separation of genera. The six differing features for specific separation were chosen by counting the number of differing features in separate specimens generally agreed to represent one species, with only one differing character in D.carnegiei and A.louisae, but five differing features in B.excelsus. Therefore, Tschopp etal. argued that Apatosaurus excelsus, originally classified as Brontosaurus excelsus, had enough morphological differences from other species of Apatosaurus that it warranted being reclassified as a separate genus again. The conclusion was based on a comparison of 477 morphological characteristics across 81 different dinosaur individuals. Among the many notable differences are the widerand presumably strongerneck of Apatosaurus species compared to B.excelsus. Other species previously assigned to Apatosaurus, such as Elosaurus parvus and Eobrontosaurus yahnahpin were also reclassified as Brontosaurus. Some features proposed to separate Brontosaurus from Apatosaurus include: posterior dorsal vertebrae with the centrum longer than wide; the scapula rear to the acromial edge and the distal blade being excavated; the acromial edge of the distal scapular blade bearing a rounded expansion; and the ratio of the <b>proximodistal</b> length to transverse breadth of the astragalus 0.55 or greater.

50|$|The cephalocaudal trend, or cephalocaudal {{gradient}} of growth, {{refers to}} the pattern of changing spatial proportions over time during growth. One {{example of this is}} the gradual change in head size relative to body size during human growth. During prenatal growth, from conception to 5 months, the head grows more than the body. In humans, the head comprises almost 50% of total body length at approximately the third month of intrauterine development. By the time of birth the head has decreased to approximately 30% of total body length {{as a result of the}} limbs and trunk growing faster than the head. This trend continues postnatally along an axis of increased growth from the head to the feet. Finally, in adults, the head represents approximately 6% of the body length. The cephalocaudal trend is also the trend of infants learning to use their upper limbs before their lower limbs. The <b>proximodistal</b> trend, on the other hand, is the prenatal growth from 5 months to birth when the fetus grows from the inside of the body outwards. When referring to motor development, the <b>proximodistal</b> trend {{refers to the}} development of motor skills from the center of the body outwards.|$|E

5000|$|The {{speed of}} motor {{development}} is rapid in early life, {{as many of}} the reflexes of the newborn alter or disappear within the first year, and slows later. Like physical growth, motor development shows predictable patterns of cephalocaudal (head to foot) and <b>proximodistal</b> (torso to extremities) development, with movements at the head and in the more central areas coming under control before those of {{the lower part of the}} body or the hands and feet. Types of movement develop in stage-like sequences; for example, locomotion at 6-8 months involves creeping on all fours, then proceeds to pulling to stand, [...] "cruising" [...] while holding on to an object, walking while holding an adult's hand, and finally walking independently. Older children continue the sequence by walking sideways or backward, galloping, hopping, skipping with one foot and walking with the other, and finally skipping. By middle childhood and adolescence, new motor skills are acquired by instruction or observation rather than in a predictable sequence. There are executive functions of the brain (working memory, timing measure of inhibition and switching) which are important to motor skills.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{developing}} chick limb bud, retinoic acid (RA) has a striking effect on anteroposterior axis formation, {{resulting in a}} duplicated pattern of digits. There is no evidence, however, that RA affects <b>proximodistal</b> axis formation in {{the developing}} chick limb bud, although RA induces <b>proximodistal</b> duplication in regenerating amphibian limbs. We describe a series of investigations {{on the effect of}} RA on the <b>proximodistal</b> axis in the chick limb bud. A RA-containing bead applied to the anterior margin of the chick limb bud at stage 20 induces the anteroposterior duplication of autopodial structures at the wrist level. We found that the RA-treated tissue has the ability to form more proximal structures. When a tissue graft from the RA-treated anterior region was implanted into a stage 17 wing bud (in which the stylopod is developing in the progress zone), the graft produced a humerus, radius–ulna, and digits. When the graft was implanted into a stage 19 wing bud (in which the zeugopod is developing in the progress zone), a zeugopod and digits were formed. These results were associated with changes in the expression of Hox-A genes in the RA-treated grafts, whose domains were reorganized to be similar to those in host tissues 24 h after grafting. When a small graft of RA-treated tissue was implanted into the apex of a stage 19 wing bud, the cells were found in the zeugopod and autopod, whereas cells of control fragments were found only in the autopod region. In vitro,distal cells from different stage limb buds are known to segregate from each other. However, RA-treated stage 24 distal cells did not sort out from stage 20 distal cells and mixed homogeneously. These results suggest that RA induces distal cells to adopt “younger” properties which render them susceptible to forming more proximal patterns under the direction of host signals. The effects of RA on <b>proximodistal</b> patterns in developing chick limb buds appear to differ from its effects on <b>proximodistal</b> patterns in regenerating urodele limbs because RA can induce the <b>proximodistal</b> duplicationin situin the regenerating limbs...|$|E
40|$|The vitamin A {{metabolite}} {{retinoic acid}} (RA) provides patterning information during vertebrate embryogenesis, but the mechanism through which RA influences limb development is unclear.

Here, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that limb <b>proximodistal</b> patterning is not RA dependent, thus indicating that RA-FGF antagonism does not occur along the <b>proximodistal</b> axis of the limb. Instead, our studies show that RA-FGF antagonism acts prior to limb budding along the anteroposterior axis of the trunk lateral plate mesoderm to provide a patterning cue that guides formation of the forelimb field.

We show that two other Hedgehog proteins, Banded hedgehog and Cephalic hedgehog, related to the mouse Indian hedgehog and Desert hedgehog, respectively, are strongly expressed in the central retinal pigment epithelium but excluded from the peripheral pigment epithelium surrounding the ciliary marginal zone. By contrast, downstream components of the Hedgehog signalling pathway, Gli 2, Gli 3 and X-Smoothened, are expressed in this narrow peripheral epithelium. We show that this zone contains cells that are in the proliferative state. This equivalent region in the adult mammalian eye, the pigmented ciliary epithelium, has been identified as a zone in which retinal stem cells reside. These data, combined with double labelling and the use of other retinal pigment epithelium markers, show that the retinal pigment epithelium of tadpole embryos has a molecularly distinct peripheral to central axis. In addition, Gli 2, Gli 3 and X-Smoothened are also expressed in the neural retina, in the most peripheral region of the ciliary marginal zone, where retinal stem cells are found in Xenopus, suggesting that they are good markers for retinal stem cells. To test the role of the Hedgehog pathway at different stages of retinogenesis, we activated the pathway by injecting a dominant-negative form of PKA or blocking it by treating embryos with cyclopamine. Embryos injected or treated at early stages display clear <b>proximodistal</b> defects in the retina.

In this report we have analyzed the function of two genes, vestigial (vg) and optomotor-blind (omb), related to <b>proximodistal</b> wing development. vg is considered the master gene of wing development.

Nonetheless. very little iS known about its implication in the development of proximal wing structures. Here we present evidence of vg acting non-autonomously to direct proximal development by activating the key target genes wingless (wg), rofund (rn) and nubbin (nub). Our model predicts a two step mechanism in which, first, vg activates in a non-autonomous fashion these genes and, second, Wg acts as a mitogenic factor inducing proliferation in proximal wing tissue and expanding the expression domains of m and nub. omb has been previously described to be involved in dorsoventral signaling at the presumptive wing margin. Our results suggest that omb is involved in <b>proximodistal</b> wing fate specification through its effects on anteroposterior signalling rather than dorsoventral signalling. In fact, as we show in the results section, omb is autonomously required for sorne, but not all, decapentaplegic (dpp) dependent gene activities.
