5|$|A {{number of}} <b>preclinical</b> {{studies have been}} {{conducted}} using MFGM and combinations of MFGM-derived components. Liu et al. (2014) studied brain development and spatial learning and memory in neonatal piglets.|$|E
5|$|Current <b>preclinical</b> {{tests show}} that the SEGRAMs {{available}} so far would elicit fewer side effect or at least less grave side effects than classic glucocorticoids would. For example, skin atrophy in rats was significantly less pronounced than under prednisolone in a study using the SEGRAM Mapracorat, and metabolic effects like weight gain or increase of blood glucose were practically inexistent.|$|E
5|$|Gallium maltolate, an oral, highly {{absorbable}} form of gallium(III) ion, is an anti-proliferative to pathologically proliferating cells, particularly {{cancer cells}} and some bacteria that accept {{it in place}} of ferric iron (Fe3+). Researchers are conducting clinical and <b>preclinical</b> trials on this compound as a potential treatment {{for a number of}} cancers, infectious diseases, and inflammatory diseases.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{bioactive}} protein components, including the glycoproteins lactadherin, MUC-1, and butyrophilin, {{have been shown}} in <b>preclinical</b> studies to affect immune response. These components influence the immune system by several mechanisms, including interference with microbe adhesion to intestinal epithelia, bacteriocidal action, support of beneficial microbiota, and modulation of {{other parts of the}} immune system.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>preclinical</b> studies have {{demonstrated}} inhibitory effects of MFGM against several pathogens. Both whole bovine MFGM and its extracted lipid components were found to exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of rotavirus infectivity in vitro. Antibacterial effects of MFGM have included decreased gastric colonization and inflammation after H. pylori infection in mice; inhibition of shiga toxin gene expression by E. coli O157:H7; and decreased colonization and translocation of L. monocytogenes. Mice that were fed prophylactically with bovine whey glycoprotein fraction, including MFGM proteins, did not develop diarrhea after exposure to rotavirus.|$|E
5|$|Investigations on neuroprotection {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include anti-apoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). <b>Preclinical</b> research also targets alpha-synuclein. A vaccine that primes the human immune system to destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Preclinical</b> {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} effects of MFGM-derived bioactive components on brain structure and function, intestinal development, and immune defense. Similarly, pediatric clinical trials have reported beneficial effects on cognitive and immune outcomes. In populations ranging from premature infants to preschool-age children, dietary supplementation with MFGM or its components {{has been associated with}} improvements in cognition and behavior, gut and oral bacterial composition, fever incidence, and infectious outcomes including diarrhea and otitis media.|$|E
5|$|Selective {{glucocorticoid}} receptor modulators (SEGRMs) {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) {{formerly known as}} dissociated glucocorticoid receptor agonists (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the desirable anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anticancer properties of classical glucocorticoid drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although <b>preclinical</b> evidence on SEGRAMs’ anti-inflammatory effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|Victor Ewings Negus {{was born}} on 6 February 1887 in Tooting, London, the {{youngest}} of three sons of William and Emily Negus (née Ewings). His father was a solicitor, Justice of the Peace, and Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Surrey. Victor's pre-university education took place at King's College School. In 1906, he was awarded a Sambrooke scholarship to King's College London, on the Strand, where his studies {{for the next three}} years included premedical and <b>preclinical</b> subjects.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the polar}} lipids, the outer layer of MFGM {{contains}} {{a number of}} glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins. Proteomic analysis has revealed at least 191 different known proteins in human MFGM, and comparable numbers in bovine milk protein concentrates. While quantitatively these only represent 1% to 2% of total milk protein content, MFGM proteins are of significant interest because many {{are known to have}} bioactive and potentially beneficial properties; almost half of identified proteins have membrane/protein trafficking or cell signaling functions. The glycosylated proteins, including mucins (MUC-1, MUC-4, MUC-15), butyrophilin, lactadherin, and CD36, have been suggested to enhance triacylglyceride digestion efficiency. Furthermore, lactadherin and MUC-1, in addition to the non-glycosylated protein xanthine oxidase, have been shown or suggested in <b>preclinical</b> studies to possess antimicrobial properties.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacia & Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) {{started its}} own oxazolidinone {{research}} {{program in the}} 1990s. Studies of the compounds' structure–activity relationships {{led to the development}} of several subclasses of oxazolidinone derivatives, with varying safety profiles and antimicrobial activity. Two compounds were considered drug candidates: eperezolid (codenamed PNU-100592) and linezolid (PNU-100766). In the <b>preclinical</b> stages of development, they were similar in safety and antibacterial activity, so they were taken to Phase I clinical trials to identify any difference in pharmacokinetics. Linezolid was found to have a pharmacokinetic advantage—requiring only twice-daily dosage, while eperezolid needed to be given three times a day to achieve similar exposure—and therefore proceeded to further trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved linezolid on April 18, 2000. Approval followed in Brazil (June 2000), the United Kingdom (January 2001), Japan and Canada (April 2001), Europe (throughout 2001), and other countries in Latin America and Asia.|$|E
5|$|Based on <b>preclinical</b> {{research}} with animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E
25|$|This <b>preclinical</b> {{treatment}} involves using {{radio waves}} {{to heat up}} tiny metals that are implanted in cancerous tissue. Gold nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes {{are the most likely}} candidate. Promising <b>preclinical</b> trials have been conducted, although clinical trials may not be held for another few years.|$|E
25|$|In Finland, basic medical {{education}} {{is given in}} five universities: Helsinki, Kuopio, Oulu, Tampere and Turku. Admission is regulated by an entrance examination. Studies involve an initial two-year <b>preclinical</b> period of mainly theoretical courses in anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology etc. However, students have contact with patients {{from the beginning of}} their studies. The <b>preclinical</b> period is followed by a four-year clinical period, when students participate in the work of various hospitals and health care centres, learning necessary medical skills. Some Finnish universities have integrated clinical and <b>preclinical</b> subjects along the six-year course, diverging from the traditional program. A problem-based learning method is widely used, and inclusion of clinical cases in various courses and <b>preclinical</b> subjects is becoming common. All medical schools have research programs for students who wish to undertake scientific work. The duration of basic {{medical education}} is six years and the course leads to the degree of Licentiate of Medicine.|$|E
25|$|In <b>preclinical</b> studies, methcathinone {{hydrochloride}} {{produces an}} abuse potential {{similar to that}} of the amphetamines.|$|E
25|$|An updated {{summary of}} both <b>pre{{clinical}}</b> and clinical findings with PPI {{can be found}} in a recent comprehensive review.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also one}} of the few medical schools in the United States that is {{structured}} with an accelerated 1.5 year <b>preclinical</b> curriculum.|$|E
25|$|Reviews of <b>preclinical</b> studies {{indicate}} that long-term frequent and excessive consumption of high fat or sugar foods can produce an addiction (food addiction).|$|E
25|$|Displacement {{chromatography}} {{has been}} used to identify and characterize these often unseen variants in quantities that are suitable for subsequent <b>preclinical</b> evaluation regimens such as animal pharmacokinetic studies. Knowledge gained during the <b>preclinical</b> development phase is critical for enhanced product quality understanding and provides a basis for risk management and increased regulatory flexibility. The recent Food and Drug Administration’s Quality by Design initiative attempts to provide guidance on development and to facilitate design of products and processes that maximizes efficacy and safety profile while enhancing product manufacturability.|$|E
25|$|RNA interference, usually microRNA, {{is being}} studied in tissue culture, {{pathology}} specimens and in <b>preclinical</b> animal studies. MicroRNA-screening of plasma {{is used to}} determine the prognosis of glioblastoma.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic {{inheritance}} of depression-related phenotypes {{has also been}} reported in a <b>preclinical</b> study. Inheritance of paternal stress-induced traits across generations involved small non-coding RNA signals transmitted via the paternal germline.|$|E
25|$|Medical degrees {{are awarded}} to medical {{students}} {{after the completion}} of their degree program, which typically lasts five or more years for the undergraduate model and four years for the graduate model. Many modern medical schools integrate clinical education with basic sciences {{from the beginning of the}} curriculum (e.g.). More traditional curricula are usually divided into <b>preclinical</b> and clinical blocks. In <b>preclinical</b> sciences, students study subjects such as biochemistry, genetics, pharmacology, pathology, anatomy, physiology and medical microbiology, among others. Subsequent clinical rotations usually include internal medicine, general surgery, pediatrics, psychiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology, among others.|$|E
25|$|Transgenerational {{epigenetic}} {{inheritance of}} anxiety-related phenotypes {{has been reported}} in a <b>preclinical</b> study using mice. In this investigation, transmission of paternal stress-induced traits across generations involved small non-coding RNA signals transmitted via the male germline.|$|E
25|$|Escitalopram is a {{substrate}} of P-glycoprotein {{and hence}} P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as verapamil and quinidine may improve its blood-brain penetrability. In a <b>preclinical</b> study in rats combining escitalopram with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor enhanced its antidepressant-like effects.|$|E
25|$|These factors {{often come}} as a {{surprise}} to many students in the <b>preclinical</b> years, who often work very hard to get great grades, but do not realize that only 45% of directors cite basic science performance as an important measure.|$|E
25|$|At the University of Dublin the <b>preclinical</b> course {{leads to}} an {{additional}} Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree (upgradable after {{three or four years}} to Master of Arts); as originally after this most students used to go elsewhere to complete clinical training.|$|E
25|$|Goldacre {{was educated}} at Magdalen College School, Oxford. He studied {{medicine}} at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he obtained a first-class Bachelor of Arts honours degree during his <b>preclinical</b> studies in 1995 in Physiological Sciences. He edited the Oxford student magazine, Isis.|$|E
25|$|Janet Sawicki is {{a cancer}} {{researcher}} and Deputy Director of the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research (LIMR). Her research {{is focused on}} the <b>preclinical</b> development of treatments for cancers, including prostate, ovarian, cervical and pancreatic. She is most notable among cancer biologists for her extensive work on cancer nanotherapies.|$|E

25|$|Clemetson {{was born}} in Canterbury, England, {{attending}} Wootton Court preparatory school, Wootton, Kent (1930–1935) and The King's School, Canterbury (1935–1942). After <b>preclinical</b> studies at Magdalen College, University of Oxford, he completed his training at Radcliffe Infirmary, graduating from Oxford University in 1948 with Bachelor of Medicine & Bachelor of Surgery (B.M., B.Ch) degrees.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{students}} used to receive {{four years of}} <b>preclinical</b> training, followed by two years of clinical training (co-assistentschappen, or co-schappen for short) in hospitals. However, {{for a number of}} medical schools this has recently changed to three years of <b>preclinical</b> training, followed by three years of clinical training. At least one medical faculty, that of the Utrecht University, clinical training already begins in the third year of medical school. After 6 years, students graduate as basisartsen (comparable to Doctors of Medicine). As a result of the Bologna process, medical students in the Netherlands now receive a bachelor's degree after three years in medical school and a master's degree upon graduation. Prospective students can apply for medical education directly after finishing the highest level of secondary school, vwo; previous undergraduate education is not a precondition for admittance.|$|E
25|$|The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution {{licensed}} (+)-discodermolide to Novartis, {{which began}} a phase 1 clinical trial in 2004. The trial {{concluded that the}} drug resulted in minimal toxicities and represents a novel mechanism of action. Amos B. Smith's research group, in collaboration with Kosan Biosciences, has a <b>preclinical</b> drug development program ongoing.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of human gut microbiota changes over time, when the diet changes, and as overall health changes. A systematic review from 2016 examined the <b>preclinical</b> and small human trials {{that have been}} conducted with certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria and identified those that had the most potential to be useful for certain central nervous system disorders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Preclinical</b> {{study results}} in 2012 {{indicated}} that these selective inhibitors decreased colon inflammation in {{mice and rats}} cloned with the human KCa3.1 protein as effectively as the standard inflammatory bowel disease treatment of sulfasalazine. However, these novel selective IK channel blockers are significantly more potent and theoretically {{would be able to}} be taken at a much more manageable dosage.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{plasmids}} {{has been}} validated in <b>preclinical</b> studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases. However, in human studies, {{this approach has}} failed to provide clinically relevant benefit. The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid's immunogenicity while also correcting for factors involved in the specific activation of immune effector cells.|$|E
25|$|As p53 protein {{levels are}} usually kept low, one could block its {{degradation}} and allow {{large amounts of}} p53 to accumulate, thus stimulating p53 activity and its antitumour effects. Drugs that utilize this mechanism include nutlin and MI-219, which are both in phase I clinical trials. There are also other drugs that {{are still in the}} <b>preclinical</b> stage of testing, such as RITA and MITA.|$|E
