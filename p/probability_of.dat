5|$|Across {{languages}} and letters, the average <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a letter being chosen {{as one of}} the six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree. The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.|$|E

5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E

40|$|The Basel II/III and CRD-IV Accords reduce {{capital charges}} on bank loans to smaller firms by {{assuming}} that the default <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> smaller firms are less sensitive to macroeconomic cycles. We test this assumption in a default intensity framework using a large sample of bank loans to private Danish firms. We find that controlling only for size, the default <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> small firms are, in fact, less cyclical than the default <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> large firms. However, accounting for firm characteristics other than size, {{we find that the}} default <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> small firms are equally cyclical or even more cyclical than the default <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> large firms.

5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm {{can be much}} slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E

5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{statistical}} methods {{for evaluating the}} data of individual-subject designs invites {{a comparison of the}} usual research tactics of the group-design paradigm and the individual-subject-design paradigm. That comparison can hinge on the concept <b>of</b> assigning <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> Type 1 and Type 2 errors.
