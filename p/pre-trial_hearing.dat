40|$|Background: This {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the difference between}} the involvement of the parents of Dutch children and the parents of immigrant children, at the <b>pre-trial</b> detention <b>hearing</b> before the youth court judge. Method: An observation list is used to measure the involvement of the parents at the hearing. During this study 21 court observations have been conducted. Results: In line with the predictions, {{there is a difference between}} the behavior and the attendance of Dutch and immigrant parents. Conclusions: There is indeed a significant difference in the attendance of the parents. The Dutch parents are often present at the <b>pre-trial</b> detention <b>hearing.</b> Furthermore there is a difference in the behavior, but this doesn‟t mean that there is also a difference in the involvement of the parents.

25|$|On April 25, 2016, the Pennsylvania Superior Court {{announced}} that it refused to hear Cosby's appeal to have the case dismissed. The court also lifted a temporary stay of the <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> and sent the case {{back to the original}} court. At a preliminary hearing on May 24, a judge found that there was enough evidence to proceed with a trial, despite the fact that Constand did not testify, which is allowed under Pennsylvania law. He set a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> for September 6, 2016. Cosby is appealing this decision based upon the belief {{they have the right to}} cross examine the accuser. On October 12, 2016 Cosby lost this appeal.

2500|$|The State {{argued that}} if Sowell's Sixth Amendment right was {{violated}} via the closed <b>pre-trial</b> Suppression <b>Hearing</b> {{it would not}} have affected the outcome of the trial, as the evidence was overwhelming, and that [...] "Sowell's attorneys were the ones who asked multiple times in his presence for the jury selection to be done privately, without cameras in the courtroom." [...] The State also asserted that Sowell has never denied his guilt, and that the heinous nature of his crimes—coupled with little mitigating evidence to deny imposing the death penalty—warrants affirming the death sentence.|$|R

25|$|On February 13, 2007, Nowak {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charges of {{attempted}} murder and attempted kidnapping. On March 2, Florida prosecutors filed three formal charges against Nowak: (1) attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm or terrorize, (2) burglary of a conveyance with a weapon, and (3) battery. The prosecutors declined to file the attempted murder charge that had been recommended by Orlando police. Nowak formally entered a plea of not guilty to the kidnapping charges on March 22 at an arraignment hearing although she was not present in person. Nowak's attorney, who filed the plea with the Orange County court, requested a jury trial. The trial was originally due to commence on July 30, 2007, but was postponed until April 7, 2008, to allow the prosecution time to prepare for an anticipated insanity defense. On January 16, 2008, a judge postponed the trial, as well as the <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> to be held on March 12, 2008, indefinitely, pending the outcome of the state's appeal of an earlier decision to suppress evidence obtained on the day of her arrest.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court heard {{arguments}} from Sowell's appellant attorneys and the Cuyahoga County D.A. representing the State of Ohio regarding {{the merits of}} the closed <b>pre-trial</b> Suppression <b>Hearing</b> prior to Sowell's trial, and the defendant's right to a fair and public trial. The attorneys representing Sowell argued that Sowell's Sixth Amendment right was violated by closing the Suppression Hearing to the press, and that the Court should commute his Death Sentence to Life-In-Prison as a remedy to the structural error that resulted in the violation. They also argued that counsel had made errors, and [...] "urged the Ohio Supreme Court to send the case back to Cuyahoga County for a retrial. 'Frankly we blew it,' attorney Jeffrey Gamso told the Ohio Supreme Court." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nicholson {{received}} widespread notice for {{his ruling}} in State v. Jones, {{a case in}} which a woman was charged with the murder of her boyfriend. In November 2012, the couple had a dispute at their shared residence; when Jones attempted to leave, her boyfriend punched her and grabbed her by the hair, and she stabbed him. In a <b>pre-trial</b> immunity <b>hearing,</b> Nicholson ruled that the state's [...] "stand-your-ground" [...] statute, the Protection of Property and Persons Act, gave Jones immunity for the killing of her boyfriend. The law protects the actions of a person who uses deadly force and [...] "who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in another place where he has a right to be"; prosecutors had argued that the phrase [...] "another place" [...] should not include a home in which the attacker resided, but Nicholson disagreed, stating in his ruling that prosecutors' reading of the law would create a [...] "nonsensical result" [...] in which a person could defend him- or herself against an intimate partner's attack outside of the home but not within it.|$|R
500|$|The {{prosecution}} set out {{its case}} at the <b>pre-trial</b> committal <b>hearing,</b> which began in Minehead on 20 November 1978. At the request of Deakin's counsel, reporting restrictions were lifted, which meant that newspapers were free to print anything said in court without fear of the libel laws. This move infuriated Thorpe, who had hoped for an in camera hearing which would avoid unfortunate newspaper headlines and perhaps lead to the dismissal of the case. Whatever the outcome, Thorpe knew that the adverse publicity would destroy his career, and that Scott would thus have his revenge. As the hearings began, Bessell described the 1969 meetings where he alleged that Thorpe had suggested that Holmes should kill Scott, including the comment about the shooting of a sick dog. The court learned that Bessell had a contract with [...] The Sunday Telegraph, which was paying him £50,000 for his story. Dinshaw gave evidence of the £20,000 he had received from Hayward and passed to Holmes, and of subsequent attempts by Thorpe to obscure the details of these transactions. Newton testified that Holmes had wanted Scott killed: [...] "He would prefer it if [...] vanished {{from the face of}} the earth and was never seen again. It was left to me how to do it". Scott gave clinical details of his alleged seduction by Thorpe at Thorpe's mother's house in November 1961 and on other occasions, and also recounted his ordeal on the moors above Porlock Hill. At the end of the hearing the presiding magistrate committed the four defendants for trial at the Central Criminal Court, commonly known as the Old Bailey.|$|R
500|$|In 2000, Hudson and {{two other}} Sisters of her congregation, Carol Gilbert, O.P., and Ardeth Platte, O.P., entered Peterson Air Force Base without {{authorization}} and sprinkled blood on a fighter plane. The trio was caught and arrested. They were then held in a federal prison until the charges were dropped {{because there was no}} lasting damage was done to the airplane. Gilbert claimed that the base was part of the [...] "Star Wars" [...] defense system and the government did not want to draw unnecessary attention to the area. In 2002, the same group of nuns gained access to a Minuteman III missile silo in Colorado. Wearing white hazmat suits emblazoned with [...] "Citizen Weapon Inspection Team," [...] they pounded on the missile, drew a cross in their own blood and prayed for peace. At their <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing,</b> the Sisters, dressed in their religious habit, engaged in silent protest by only answering the judge with a nod. When their trial came about, the presiding judge, Robert E. Blackburn, granted an in limine motion to the prosecutor preventing the Sisters from arguing that their actions were legal under international law and the Nuremberg defense. The group was sentenced to between 31 and 40 months for obstructing national defense and damaging government property. The sister's appeal was rejected in 2005 by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
2500|$|... and a nurse, Kristin Schmidt (who {{was present}} during the {{incident}} but took no action) were arrested {{on charges of}} aggravated manslaughter of a child, a felony. [...] When the eight defendants were arraigned on January 18, 2007 they entered [...] "not guilty" [...] pleas. [...] Circuit Judge Michael Overstreet set a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> date for Feb. 22. [...] Subsequently, they were freed on $25,000 bail.|$|E
2500|$|While Khalid Sheikh Mohammad {{and other}} ghost prisoners {{had given the}} Red Cross [...] "elaborate {{descriptions}} of waterboardings and other tortures" [...] they had suffered, government psychiatrist Dr. Sally Johnson testified in a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> that Siddiqui had never given anyone, whether her brother, her lawyers, Pakistani senators or embassy personnel, other visitors, prison staff or psychiatrists, [...] "a clear account of any torture or imprisonment".|$|E
2500|$|Under the 1999 Constitution, {{military}} officers {{are entitled to}} a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> before the Plenary of the Supreme Court of Justice to rule on whether they should be charged with a crime. In such a hearing on 14 August 2002, the Tribunal ruled by an 11–9 margin (with two justices recused) that four high-ranking {{military officers}} charged with rebellion should not stand trial, arguing that what took place was not a [...] "coup" [...] but a [...] "vacuum of power" [...] that had been generated by the announcement of Chávez's resignation made by Gen. Lucas Rincón Romero.|$|E
2500|$|Preponderance of the {{evidence}} is the standard of proof used for immunity from prosecution under Florida's controversial stand-your-ground law. The defense must present its evidence in a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing,</b> show that the statutory prerequisites have been met, and then request that the court grant a motion for declaration of immunity. The judge must then decide from the preponderance of {{the evidence}} whether to grant immunity. This is a far lower burden than [...] "beyond a reasonable doubt," [...] the threshold a prosecutor must meet at any proceeding criminal trial, but higher than the [...] "probable cause" [...] threshold generally required for indictment.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, The Word apologised {{in court}} for a piece written by David Quantick, which commented on the 2007 NME article and {{suggested}} Morrissey was a racist. Morrissey accepted The Word's apology. The legal suit against NME began in October 2011 after Morrissey won a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing.</b> Morrissey's case against NME editor Conor McNicholas and publisher IPC was due to have been heard in July 2012. In June 2012, the parties settled the dispute with NME issuing a public apology. Morrissey's lawyer said that [...] "no money was sought {{as part of a}} settlement. ... The NME apology in itself is settlement enough and it closes the case." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> on July 2, 2009, {{the three}} legal groups moved to {{intervene}} in the lawsuit, as did the City of San Francisco in a separate filing. The plaintiffs opposed allowing the groups or the City to intervene. On August 19, Judge Walker denied the legal groups' motions to intervene but granted the City's, albeit in a limited capacity. Despite the other groups' failed attempt {{to intervene in}} the lawsuit, they offered support to the legal team litigating the case, with James Esseks of the ACLU saying: [...] "e are interested in doing whatever we can to make sure their case is as successful as possible".|$|E
2500|$|The Randolph County Superior Court Minutes of March 20, 1807 recorded: [...] "The Grand Jury {{returned}} {{a bill to}} the Court against Jonathan Lewis for Murder & indorsed thereon a trial bill upon which the said Jonathan Lewis was arraigned, plead not guilty and put himself upon his country." [...] Witnesses for both sides were summoned and a trial date of October 26, 1807 was set in the Guilford County Superior Court. Jonathan was arrested on April 8 and locked in the Randolph County jail. A <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> was held October 5 and he was indicted {{for the murder of}} Omi Wise, a single woman. On October 9, he escaped the jail and fled to parts unknown.|$|E
2500|$|The Pentagon chief {{prosecutor}} Colonel Morris Davis, who had {{resigned from the}} US defence force citing dissatisfaction with the Guantanamo military commission process, alleged that the process had become highly politicised {{and that he had}} felt [...] "pressured to do something less than full, fair and open". Davis later elaborated, saying that the Hicks trial was flawed and appeared rushed for the political benefit of the Howard government in Australia. Davis said of his former superiors that [...] "there is no question they wanted me to stage show trials {{that have nothing to do}} with the centuries-old tradition of military justice in America". On 28 April 2008, while testifying at a <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> at Guantanamo for Salim Hamdan, Colonel Davis said that he had [...] "inherited" [...] the Hicks case but did not consider it serious enough to warrant prosecution.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> {{was held}} on July 17, 2007, and further {{hearings}} were to be held on September 19, to argue defense motions to suppress {{some of the evidence}} obtained on the day of her arrest. On August 12, 2007, Nowak asked to have her GPS ankle bracelet removed, which the judge agreed to on August 30. On August 28, the trial judge unsealed a court document indicating that Nowak intended to pursue an insanity defense. According to documents submitted by her lawyer, Nowak was evaluated by two psychiatrists who diagnosed her with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, Asperger syndrome, a single episode of major depressive disorder and a [...] "brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors" [...] {{at the time of the}} incident. On November 2, 2007, the trial judge suppressed Nowak's initial (pre-Miranda) statements to police, as well as all evidence found in her vehicle, citing police misconduct in their initial search and questioning. The prosecution appealed that ruling on November 8. A hearing on that appeal occurred on October 21, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Eric Rothschild {{gave the}} opening {{statement}} for the plaintiffs. He {{said that the}} plaintiffs {{would be able to}} provide many examples of school board members wishing to balance the teaching of evolution with creationism. He attacked prior defense claims that it was a minor affair by saying {{that there is no such}} thing as a [...] "little" [...] constitutional violation. He also provided the definition of creationism given by an early draft of Pandas: [...] "Creation is the theory that various forms of life began abruptly, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers and wings, mammals with fur and mammary glands." [...] He compared this with what was eventually published: [...] "Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks and wings, et cetera." [...] (The definitions had come up earlier in a July 14 <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing.)</b> He also argued that intelligent design was not science in its infancy, but rather was not science at all.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>pre-trial</b> <b>hearing</b> {{began on}} 19 December 1990 in the Supreme Court of South Australia, with Justice Duggan as the {{presiding}} judge. The prosecution decided after Justice Duggan's findings {{two days earlier}} to have Einem tried separately for the murders of Alan Barnes and Mark Langley. Justice Duggan ruled that the evidence relating to the Richard Kelvin murder and from the various associates of Einem and hitchhikers was inadmissible, although he did rule that [...] "B"'s evidence could be heard, but with the defence allowed to question the evidence as it was being given. This was a shattering blow for the prosecution's case, and on 21 December 1990, on advice from the Attorney-General of South Australia, prosecutors withdrew the charge {{for the murder of}} Mark Langley. The prosecution tried to continue with the charge for the murder of Alan Barnes, however with the problems of getting enough evidence admitted into court from associates about von Einem picking up hitchhikers to convict Einem still too great, the final charge was withdrawn on 1 February 1991. The prosecution, on the advice of the Attorney-General, then entered a nolle prosequi for the Alan Barnes murder charge.|$|E
