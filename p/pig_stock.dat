Close-to-market-weight pigs from 2 barns (north barn or south barn) were placed in 32 single-sex pens in the north barn at densities of either 12 or 20 pigs per pen. Pens of pigs were allotted to 1 of 4 mixing treatments (8 pens per treatment). Mixing treatments were: (1) nonmixed pens with 12 north barn pigs (control), (2) mixing 6 north barn pigs with 6 south barn pigs (Mix 1), (3) mixing 10 north barn pigs with 10 south barn pigs (Mix 2), and (4) mixing 10 north barn pigs with 10 more north barn pigs (Mix 3). All pigs were fed a common diet during the trial. Pens of pigs were weighed and feed disappearance determined on d 0, 8, and 15 to determine ADG, ADFI, and F/G.

Evaluating {{the removal}} of pigs from a group and {{subsequent}} floor space allowance on the growth performance of heavy-weight finishing pigs. Journal of Animal Science, 94 (10), 4388 - 4400. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2016 - 0407 A total of 1, 092 finishing pigs (initially 36. 3 kg) were used in a 117 -d study to evaluate the impact of initial floor space allowance and removal strategy on the growth of pigs up to 140 kg BW. There were 4 experimental treatments with 14 pens per treatment. The first treatment provided 0. 91 m(2) per pig (15 pigs/pen). The other 3 treatments initially provided 0. 65 m(2) per pig (21 pigs/pen) with 3 different removal strategies. The second treatment (2 : 2 : 2) removed the 2 heaviest pigs from pens on d 64, 76, and 95 when floor space allowance was predicted to be limiting. Treatment 3 (2 : 4) removed the 2 heaviest pigs on d 76 and the 4 heaviest pigs on d 105. Treatment 4 (6) removed the heaviest 6 pigs on d 105. All pigs remaining in pens after removals were fed to d 117. Overall (d 0 to 117), pigs initially provided 0. 91 m(2) of floor space had increased (P < 0. 05) ADG compared to pigs in pens on the 2 : 4 or 6 removal strategy, but ADG was not different compared with pigs on the 2 : 2 : 2 removal strategy. Total BW gain per pen was greater (P < 0. 05) for pens initially stocked at 0. 65 m(2) compared to pens initially stocked at 0. 91 m(2). Feed usage per pen was less (P < 0. 05) for pens initially stocked at 0. 91 m(2) compared to pens initially providing 0. 65 m(2) of floor space and on removal strategies; however, feed usage per pig was greater (P < 0. 05) for <b>pigs</b> initially <b>stocked</b> at 0. 91 m(2) compared to <b>pigs</b> initially <b>stocked</b> at 0. 65 m(2) and on removal strategies. Feed usage, on a pig or pen basis, was less (P < 0. 05) for pigs on the 2 : 2 : 2 removal strategy compared to pigs on the 2 : 4 or the 6 removal strategy. Income over feed and facility cost (IOFFC) was less (P < 0. 05) for pigs initially provided 0. 91 m(2) compared to pigs initially provided 0. 65 m(2) and on removal strategies. Also, IOFFC was less (P < 0. 05) for pigs on the 2 : 2 : 2 compared to the 2 : 4 and 6 removal strategies. In conclusion, increasing the floor space allowance or the time points at which pigs are removed from the pen improved the growth of pigs remaining in the pen; however, IOFFC may be reduced because fewer pigs are marketed from each pen (<b>pigs</b> <b>stocked</b> at 0. 91 m(2) throughout the study) or from reducing total weight produced (2 : 2 : 2 removal strategy) ...|$|R

40|$|Trichinella, {{formerly}} called trichinae, are nematodes {{that are}} to be found in the meat of domestic and wild animals like domestic pigs, wild boar, foxes and martens. They can cause serious illnesses in humans. Humans become infected through the consumption of raw or inadequately prepared trichinous meat or products produced from it like raw sausage or raw ham. According to the German Meat Hygiene Act (FIHG) all slaughtered animals must, therefore, be tested for Trichinella before they are approved for consumption. In line with a new EU Regulation the Member States may, however, specify regions in which Trichinella tests are not necessary in domestic pigs when the Trichinella risk for the area concerned has been officially recognised as negligible. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has examined from the scientific angle whether Germany or individual federal Laender could qualify for this classification. Over the last forty years there were a few larger outbreaks of trichinosis in Germany. Aside from “imported diseases” these cases exclusively involved pigs that had become infected in free-range farms through eating wild animals carrying Trichinella. The fattening <b>pig</b> <b>stocks</b> are all free of Trichinella. However, there are reports of Trichinella being detected in martens, foxes and wild boar. Hence it cannot be ruled out that domestic pigs could become infected with the parasite on free-range farms. This means they could be a source of infection for consumers. According to BfR no “region with negligible Trichinella risks in domestic pigs” should be recognised in Germany. However, from the scientific angle exemptions for fattening pig farms with closed intensive farming could be justifiable...|$|R

40|$|PosterPig {{traditional}} {{production systems}} in Galicia (NW Spain) {{are based on}} seasonal resources us like chestnut and pastures. The Breeders' Association of the autochthonous Celtic breed of pigs (ASOPORCEL) has developed a novel system within the traditional Galicia grazed forest areas {{in order to preserve}} landscape quality and biologic diversity, minimizing therefore the environmental impact of pig production. One of the main concerns of silvopastoral system implementation is the need of fencing. Fencing costs could be reduced if animals are rearing with infrastructures based on Pavlov animal condition reflex management in an extensive system. Therefore, cost reduction is obtained thanks to the clear reduction of personnel needs to feed animals, fencing costs and understorey clearance to reduce forest fires. In 2013 an experiment was carried out in Nebra (NW of Spain) in a young Pinus pinaster plantation. <b>Pig</b> <b>stocking</b> rate was around 3. 85 pigs per ha (25 males and 25 females) in a total surface of 13 ha. Forest grazing program was initiated when animals were three months old in March 2013 and finished in December 2013. They were allowed access the whole plot. Concentrate was provided twice every day after sounding an alarm to attract pigs. All the animals adapted rapidly to the system. Two types o understory vegetation (Ulex and Pteridium) was sampled following a transect from close to far away feeding areas (three distances). Fern control was intense, being gorse less consumed. After nine months, average animal daily gain (ADG) obtained was 290 ± 4 gr.

40|$|During {{the last}} 2 years there has {{occurred}} {{a large number}} of deaths among the breeding females of our guinea <b>pig</b> <b>stock.</b> The course of the disease, time of occurrence in relation to gestation, and lesions noted at autopsy were similar in practically every instance. Females nearing term, or those recently parturient were usually affected, and after death showed an extremely pale, fatty liver. For want of a better term, we have until recently designated the condition the yellow liver disease of late pregnancy. Judging from the literature, the condition occurs infrequently. It appears to be identical with that described in guinea pigs by T. Smith (1) and which has been encountered by Nelson (2). Greene (3) has recently studied a condition in rabbits, toxemia of pregnancy, which is of particular interest in connection with the disease we have encountered. He has noted a striking similarity between the disease observed by Nelson in guinea pigs and that occurring in the rabbit. The outbreak in our stock was of considerable severity and differed from those seen by Smith and by Nelson in seasonal incidence. In view of the infrequent occurrence of the disease and its similarity to toxemia of pregnancy of the rabbit, a report of the findings is submitted. Description of the Colony The guinea pig colony consists of about 300 animals, of which about 150 are breeding females. The stock is, on the whole, free from the usual guinea pig epidemics, although occasional deaths from pneumonia due to Bact. bronckisepticum or pneumococcus occur. During the early months of the period considered in this report, a few animals with Group C streptococcus lymphadenitis were in the herd. This disease has since been eradicated. In order to prevent the introduction of disease, inbreeding has been practiced for 3 years. The diet consists of purina complete rabbit chow supplemented with cabbage twice a week. Water is before the animals at all times. The quarters are air-conditioned, the temperature being around 70 °F. and the humidity about 45 per cent. Each cage contains two or three females and a male. Pregnant animals are removed from the breeding cages about a month prior to parturition...|$|E
40|$|Not only in Germany, human {{salmonellosis}} due {{to consumption}} of contaminated food {{of animal origin}} {{is one of the most}} frequent gastrointestinal infections. Since the entry into force of the duty of notification in accordance with BSeuchG 1962, the incidence continuously in-creased with S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium as the most frequent serovars. To protect the consumer from Salmonella infections, the law relating to food production and distribution has laid down minimum hygienic requirements for the handling of food and criteria to assess its presence in food. As a prerequisite for the assessment of the efficiency of these legal requirements for user protection, the present paper first discusses the epidemiological context and legal regulations with respect to salmonellae. Based on the compiled facts it was discussed and established whether the legal regulations are sufficient to deal with the presence of salmonellae on a reasonable safety level, whether the legal environment has weak points with respect to certain types of food or circumstances, or whether law includes inadequately serious responses to the presence of salmonellae. Results It is possible to reliably destroy the Gramnegative rod-like bacteria of the genus Enterobacteriaceae by heating food to 70 °C for 1 minute. All other procedures (i. e. drying, salting, fermentation, nitrite addition and cooling) only inhibit growth without however killing the salmonellae. Main sources of human salmonellosis are types of {{food of animal origin}}, including eggs and crude egg products that most frequently are suspected and identified as vehicles for salmo-nellae. However, salmonellae can be detected in nearly all types of food, in particular poultry meat that may be contaminated up to the half of the investigated lots (39 %). Average contamination rates are reported as follows: beef: 1 %, pork: 4 %, minced meat: 8 %, milk and milk products: pastries: 1. 4 %. Under consideration of the origin of the raw materials, the technology used for the production process, the final preparation of food for consumption under kitchen conditions and the resulting classification for the risk that a specific food might be contaminated with salmonellae, it is possible to deduce a risk assessment for the consumer including a specific risk tendency. For the protection of consumers against substances that are dangerous to health and that are (contained in) commercially available types of food, the law relating to food production and distribution has laid down a number of regulations on various levels (general hygiene requirements, Salmonella treatment and assessment regulations) that apply to the presence of salmonellae. A comparison of legal directives and their relation to the risk to the user by individual types of food demonstrates that in some cases the legal requirements for the handling of pork and poultry are not adequate. The legal limits of carcass and meat examination mainly apply to clinical diseases of the carcass. The principal origin of salmonellae, i. e. latently infected carcass, can be eliminated by control of the herds of origin. In addition to the examination of individual animals, the examination of herds should be kept out with even higher priority. As far as the presence of salmonellae is concerned, legal requirements on (poultry and) meat products have insufficient microbiological standards. These types of food could be made safer via legally binding standards or other regulations (e. g. HACCP systems). As discussed above, food containing crude egg products is the most frequent cause of human salmonellosis, indicating that the regulations with respects to this type of food is insufficient. It would be possible to implement the use of pasteurized egg mass via an HACCP conception. Legal requirements that refer to eggs to be used as food have loopholes with respect to cooling. Early cooling after laying will considerably contribute to risk minimization. Although sufficient consumer education would be required, the legal fixation of shorter periods before cooling would be more helpful. With respect to the low contamination of raw materials and also finished products, the legal regulations on the handling of egg products are sufficient to guarantee healthy unrisky egg products. Legal requirements on milk and milk products are high. However, the rule to heat farm milk demonstrates to be a weak point in milk hygiene legislation, because its implementation appears to be impossible. Despite the considerable risk to consumers, no particular hygiene regulations beyond the too general LMHV exist for bread, cakes and pastries. So far, particular requirements for the handling of this type of food are missing. The comparison of individual types of food and production lines thereof demonstrates that the legal assessment of a salmonellae contamination risk is quite heterogeneous and does not refer to prevalence or risk originating from the individual food. The chicken salmonellae directive and the voluntary monitoring initiative in <b>pig</b> <b>stock</b> seem to be initial steps into a direction that will help to establish the required far-reaching monitoring programs for all types of food. <br...|$|E
