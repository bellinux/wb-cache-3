40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} of manufacturing systems {{is a topic}} of paramount interest, and reliable methods for modeling the energy consumption of machine tools are of fundamental importance for the design and management of production plants. For these reasons, this paper proposes a approach, named aCtuatorS Methodology (CSM), for modeling and predicting the energy behavior of discrete systems, i. e. systems where the energy consumption is mainly due to the on/off switching of the actuators governed by the control logic. CSM is then used to compute the energy consumption of the <b>pallet</b> <b>transport</b> line of a de-manufacturing pilot plant. A dynamic Discrete Event Simulator (DES) is first used to estimate the instantaneous overall energy consumption based on the absorbed power of each actuator and to complete a preliminary simulation study. The value of the energy consumption estimated with CSM is then compared to the real value measured on the transport line. The results achieved confirm the very good agreement between {{the behavior of the}} system predicted with CSM and the measured data...|$|E

McNair's duties in prison {{included}} {{work in a}} manufacturing area, where he repaired old, torn mailbags. He held this position for several months, during which he plotted his escape. McNair escaped by constructing an [...] "escape pod," [...] which included a breathing tube, and burying it {{under a pile of}} outgoing mailbags. At approximately 9:45 AM, prison staff placed the mailbags on a <b>pallet,</b> <b>transported</b> it to a nearby warehouse outside the prison's perimeter fence, and went for lunch. McNair then cut himself out of the pod and escaped at 11:00 AM. Having observed prison operations and the times when prisoner counts were conducted, McNair knew that his absence would not be discovered until 4:00 PM. After an over yearlong manhunt, McNair was captured in New Brunswick, Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Oct. 25, 2007 after being featured on the television program Americas Most Wanted. Since McNair had previously escaped from a county jail and a state prison in North Dakota in 1987 and 1992, he was classified as a high-escape risk and transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX, the federal supermax prison in Colorado which holds inmates requiring the tightest controls.|$|R

The intrinsic advantage of palletized transport is that it minimises manual handling operations. These repalletizations detract from that advantage.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development ofa low cost indicator mechanism that is triggered by overloading. The method is applied to Flexible Bulk Containers (FJBCs) and detects overloading during handling. BACKGROUND Increasingly, packaging materials are being designed to satisfy complex multifunctional demands. this is in parallel with demands for cost reductions. In the area of agricultural materials. the response to this has been to develop Flexible Intermediate Bulk Containers (FIBCs). The industry standard some years past involved stacking low weight (50 - 100 kg) bags on wooden <b>pallets</b> and <b>transporting</b> these <b>pallets</b> from manufacturer to end-user site. With the advent of FIBCs these labour intensive methods of handling 0. 5 tonne, 1 tonne and 2 tonne loads have been superseded. In their place, single point lift and multiple point lift bags have reduced the cost of handling and storing bulk materials. These bags are simple to manufacture and yet provide a convenient medium to contain bulk materials. They are easily stacked and finally, do not require sophisticated lifting equipment during transportation. Their low cost of manufacture stems from {{the simplicity of the}} weaving and sewing methods used i...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} been made {{with the purpose of}} trying to attain the {{competitiveness}} between container carriers and specialised reefers in offering door-door services for perishable cargo. In order to achieve a full scale picture of the investigated cost chains a number of different analyses and calculations have been performed regarding the door-door cost chain. Two key trades where the NLC group is currently operating have been chosen as basis for this comparison. Still, the intention in this {{study has been}} to find the general benefits/disadvantages regard the chosen mode of transportation, which can be applicable to any trade using a certain mode. A model has therefore been constructed based on earlier studies conducted within the NLC group, relevant shipping theory and new information gathered during interviews and questionnaires. This model computes a comparison between the shipper and carrier looking at the total door-door cost. An indication on the competition in the trade is hereby attained. However most importantly is that the comparison generates an overview of the economical conditions in the trade, i. e. are the trades theoretically making money. The results from this study show that there is a margin in most trades between the cost to produce the service, i. e. carrier cost and the shipper cost. This is only natural however the troubles come from comparing the margins between the container and specialised reefer vessel. These result shows that the container margin in certain trades is almost {{three times the size of}} the specialised reefers looking at competing trades. This does not only indicate bigger revenue but also makes for a buffer towards market fluctuations. Results from the study also show the importance in taking full control of the entire cost chain and not to be governed by strong importers controlling the end of the chain. This is especially true looking at <b>pallets</b> <b>transported</b> under deck where the haulage activity plays a critical scale of balance role, with the possibility of breaking the entire cost chain. A backhaul cost model has also been constructed in order to find the possible effects which backhaul can play on the total round voyage cost. These results show that all investigated backhaul cargo covers the additional cost for the backhaul operation, hence giving contribution to container and ship repositioning. However only live cargo shipped in operating 40 `RHC can pay the full cost for the round voyage. Looking at the general competitiveness between the different transport modes this study does not produce any final conclusions. A tendency can however be noticed towards container lines under the right circumstances tend to produce the door-door service at a lower cost compared to the specialised reefer...|$|R

40|$|The {{deployable}} crew quarters (DCQ) {{have been}} designed for the International Space Station (ISS). Each DCQ would be a relatively inexpensive, deployable boxlike structure {{that is designed to}} fit in a rack bay. It is to be occupied by one crewmember to provide privacy and sleeping functions for the crew. A DCQ comprises mostly hard panels, made of a lightweight honeycomb or matrix/fiber material, attached to each other by cloth hinges. Both faces of each panel are covered with a layer of Nomex cloth and noise-suppression material to provide noise isolation from ISS. On Earth, the unit is folded flat and attached to a rigid <b>pallet</b> for <b>transport</b> to the ISS. On the ISS, crewmembers unfold the unit and install it in place, attaching it to ISS structural members by use of soft cords (which also help to isolate noise and vibration). A few hard pieces of equipment (principally, a ventilator and a smoke detector) are shipped separately and installed in the DCQ unit by use of a system of holes, slots, and quarter-turn fasteners. Full-scale tests showed that the time required to install a DCQ unit amounts to tens of minutes. The basic DCQ design could be adapted to terrestrial applications to satisfy requirements for rapid deployable emergency shelters that would be lightweight, portable, and quickly erected.
