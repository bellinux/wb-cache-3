40|$|Monitoring pest insect populations is {{currently}} a key issue in agriculture and forestry protection. At the farm level, human operators typically must perform <b>periodical</b> <b>surveys</b> of the traps disseminated through the field.

Our autonomous monitoring system will be able to cover large areas with very low energy consumption. This issue would be the main key point in our study; since the operational live of the overall monitoring system should be extended to months of continuous operation without any kind of maintenance (i. e., battery replacement). The images delivered by image sensors would be time-stamped and processed in the control station to get the number of individuals found at each trap. All the information would be conveniently stored at the control station, and accessible via Internet by means of available network services at control station (WiFi, WiMax, 3 G/ 4 G, etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|While {{different}} sources of natural resistance to Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) {{have been described}} in grapevines and citrus, lack of consolidated information exists on the wide panel of cultivars characterizing the vast olive germplasm. Preliminary observations on few cultivars, support the evidence that differential cultivar responses to Xf infections may exist. To explore the response of a larger panel of cultivars, in April 2015, an experimental olive plot, located within the Xf-heavily affected olive groves, {{was established in the}} Apulia Region (Italy). Twenty-four trees for each of the ten different cultivars were planted in randomized blocks. Each tree was caged with 15 - 20 specimens of Philaenus spumarius collected from the neighboring infected olive groves. Upon removing the cages, the trees are then continuously exposed to the natural vector populations occurring in the area. Nine and 12 -months after planting, the trees were sampled, tested for Xf and inspected for symptoms. The first data confirmed the infectivity of the vector populations occurring in the Apulian contaminated area and the Xf susceptibility of the olive cultivars tested. Almost 50 % of the trees tested positive, with an infection incidence ranging from 25 % (Leccino) to 78 % (Koroneiki). Symptoms of shoot dieback started to appear 1 -year after planting, limitedly on few replicates of Cellina di Nardò.

In our study, we aimed {{to assess the}} effects of the exposure to indoor factors associated with increased microbial exposure (mould, dampness and pets) on behavioural problems in children aged 10 years, participating in two German birth cohorts. A total of 4860 children were followed until the age of 10 years, and the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) was administered to the parents. Indoor factors were assessed through parental reported questionnaires in <b>periodical</b> <b>surveys.</b> Logistic and multinomial regressions adjusting for potential confounders were performed. Prevalences of borderline/abnormal total scores in the SDQ at 10 years of age were higher in children exposed to mould (aOR= 1. 23, 95 %CI= 1. 00 - 1. 56), dampness (aOR= 1. 51, 95 %CI= 1. 10 - 2. 07), and pets (aOR= 1. 48, 95 %CI= 1. 20 - 1. 94). The dimension "emotional symptoms" showed statistically significant risk estimates for mould and pets, meanwhile "conduct problems" and "hyperactivity/inattention" dimensions only did for pets. No significant associations were found for the "peer relationship problems" dimension. We found a significant strong interaction between dampness and pet, the risk of borderline/abnormal scores in the "total difficulties" scale and the "emotional symptoms" dimension for pets' was at least twice the risk in children with reported dampness than in children without. Our findings point to a potential effect of microbial exposure on children's behavioural problems, especially on emotional disorders, probably mediated through neurotoxicity and immune system activation. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|The {{site safety}} {{monitoring}} involves {{continuously or periodically}} evaluation of deformations of a permanent (e.g., building) or temporary (e.g., scaffolding) structure that usually bears dynamic excitements. The consequences of site safety monitoring failure are usually severe, and can cause damage, injuries, or even casualties. A specific case is monitoring the settling displacements of an existing building adjacent to a jobsite. For construction sites, it is stringently demanded that the settlement of adjacent buildings is monitored {{in the course of}} foundation excavation to ensure the integrity of these buildings and minimize disturbances. Traditionally, the settling markers are installed on the wall of a monitored building, and the contractor employs a registered professional surveying team to carry out periodical (e.g., bi-weekly) measurements of the settling markers with a total station during the entire piling construction period (ASD 2007). In such respect, surveying settlement consists of two phases: transiting the geodetic coordinates from the government benchmark positions to locally defined points around the monitored building, and performing a <b>periodical</b> <b>surveying</b> of the vertical movements of these markers on the building relative to the local points and identifying changes, both of which remand a sheer volume of efforts and costs.|$|R

40|$|Background: Malaria was {{restricted}} to the I Region of Chile, being Anopheles pseudopunctipennis the only vector species. In 1936 the parasitosis affected more than 50 % {{of the population and}} 62. 4 % of military recruits, proceeding from Southern regions became infected. From 1937 to 1947, an antimalaria campaign was carried out, stressing actions on the battle against the vector and the treatment of malaria infected individuals. Since April 1945 no autochthonous cases of malaria have been detected. Aim: To update the situation of malaria in Chile. Methods: 1) Imported malaria: Analysis of occasional publications on the subject (1945 - 1988) and the annual reports of the Ministry of Health Department of Epidemiology (1990 - 2001). Annual reports on the Anopheles specimens collected -mostly larvae- in the provinces of Arica and Iquique and examined in the Parasitology Unit of the School of Medicine, University of Chile, during the period 1980 - 2001. Results: 1) Imported malaria. A total of 24 cases were published in the period 1945 - 1988. In the 1980 - 2001 period, the Ministry of Health recorded 66 cases with 5 (8. 8 %) deaths. 2) Anophelines: Only in 1984, 1985, 1998 and 2001 A. pseudopunctipennis foci were detected. Entomological surveillance was stressed and insecticides were applied on these focuses. Conclusions: Autochthonous malaria does not exist in Chile since 1945.

The purpose {{of this research was}} analyzing {{the internal}} environment, identifying the weaknesses and the strengths of the organization. Material and Methods: This was a cross sectional and descriptive study which was carried out as a survey. The sample size of this survey was formed by 260 employees holding a bachelor’s degree or higher. The data were collected by distributing questionnaires among the members of the sample group. The different components of Weisbord model included setting goals, structure, leadership, communications, reward, useful mechanism (co-ordination), and the attitude towards change. The data were analyzed by SPSS software and statistical tests. Results: The findings of this study showed that the components of goal setting and communications have a lot of strong points at both Shohada and Razi Hospitals. Regarding the components of leadership, structure, and the attitude towards change, more attention is needed by the managers of these hospitals. The reward component is actually one of the weak points in both centers. Useful mechanism component is the weak point of Razi hospital. Conclusion: Considering the findings of this survey, both Shohada and Razi hospitals are in a desirable and positive condition in all of the components except for the component of reward.

40|$|In {{developing}} countries {{there is a}} lack of space-oriented data. This complicates the implementation of different measures in existing social, economical and ecological systems and also restricts the estimation of future risks. Since systematic and <b>periodical</b> <b>surveys</b> in the sense of a census concept are mostly unrealistic, a method is needed to produce sufficiently adequate estimations of processes by random samples and indicators. This case study aims at developing a method on the basis of the combination of the representative samples and the indicator-based approaches for analyzing space relevant socioeconomic and ecological processes in Benin. In total we identified three main processes in the coastal area of Benin: the migration into coastal zone, the environment changes (land use, climate change and natural risks) and the vulnerability of local residents. Method consisted to two types of surveys: the interrogation of responsible persons in public office (32 semi-structured interviews) and of the population groups (667 structured interviews). These groups were distinguished according to ethnicity, gender, age as well as location of the dwelling place (rural or urban zone). In total, 262 women and 405 men belonging to the ethnic groups Fon, Yoruba, Houedah, Xla, Toffinou, Wéménou and Gun were interviewed. Members of each ethnic group were grouped according to sex (men and women), marital status and age (young adults, adults and elderly persons). For the data analysis, we used the log (x+ 1), the analysis variance using 4 factors, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Factor Analysis (AFC) and Log-linear analysis. Multivariate analysis was applied to define the spatial variability of the vulnerability in the area of investigation. Results showed that: (1) the coastal area of Benin have the highest population density in the country, which can be attributed to migration and an increase in population, (2) there is a relationship between ethnicity and incidence of occupation as well as between religious affiliation and incidence of occupation, (3) the coastal area experiences numerous environmental problems and the effects of climate change, (4) all this has an impact on the socioeconomic components of the coastal area and increase the vulnerability of the coastal inhabitants, (5) this leads to the marginalization of actor groups and social problems, (6) the local population has certain patterns to explain natural and coastal risks and of vulnerability, (7) therefore, their reasoning of possible actions in response to issues which arise differs markedly from that of public administration, (8) taking into account this rationality is crucial in the participative coastal zone management. The method used is applicable for the analysis of regional processes when dealing with insufficient data. In addition it is transferable to other tropical coastal regions with a similar set of data problems. Therewith, the conducted methodology has successfully proven to be a suitable alternative under the specified conditions. In the end the new approach to detect spatially relevant processes with heterogeneous data sets, combing remote sensing, GIS and socioeconomic surveys for further research is identified to overcome the limitations of the achieved results that still exist...|$|E
