40|$|Law of One Price (LOP) is {{important}} in the theory of international trade. It {{is important}} in LOP studies to have data that accurately represents homogeneous products (i. e., the product in one country has the same product characteristics as the product in another country). We present a theoretical model that determines fresh grapefruit prices Free on Board (FOB) at the packinghouse. The first order conditions show that the FOB packinghouse prices are equal for products with the same product characteristics. The theoretical conditions show a difference in FOB prices when the product characteristics are different. The product characteristics that are varied include <b>packing</b> <b>costs</b> and pack-out rates. The results from a nonlinear programming optimization routine demonstrates the importance of using data that accurately represents homogeneous products for LOP studies. Different <b>packing</b> <b>costs</b> and pack-out percentages are shown to cause different FOB packinghouse prices for fresh grapefruit destined for domestic and export markets.

40|$|The basic {{characteristic}} of packing {{is to protect}} the product from external factors while the product is delivering to consumers. However, recently packing has become an indispensable aspect of marketing. Because, packing is considered as a silent dealer which directly reaches consumers. Packing {{is one of the most}} important factor of product sales. Consumers assess a product with its packing and make up a purchasing decision accordingly. In addition to its protective function, packing also performs functions such as selling and communication. Recently, firms have begun attaching great importance on packing investments. A high-quality and attractive packing means expenditure. A firm can increase its sales as much as it creates difference with its packing. Therefore, it is required to take a risk of increasing the <b>packing</b> <b>costs</b> for increasing sales. Increasing packing cost is an important factor of prices. In this study, the relation between the packing cost and price has been researched by making regression analysis...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{road freight}} {{transport}} {{is to get the}} desired goods to their destination over public roads, at the lowest possible cost and without causing damage to the vehicle, to other road users or to the cargo itself. In order to ensure cargo safety, load units should be prevented from causing high impact forces on other structures in their proximity. Therefore, shifting or tilting of load units during sudden manoeuvres of the vehicle should be avoided or at least highly limited. As the use of additional restraining methods is often costly and time consuming, cargo safety is preferentially inherent to the loading scheme. By eliminating empty space inside the vehicle, undesirable movement of the load units can be avoided. As sequential loading constraints substantially confine the possibilities for optimizing the loading scheme, the unloading sequence and therefore also the route of the vehicle is considered part of the optimization. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which is determined as the sum of the route cost and the cost for using additional securing methods. The problem can be modeled as a decomposition of two subproblems: the vehicle routing problem {{on the one hand and}} the container loading problem with sequential loading and safe packing constraints on the other hand. The approach presented in this talk consists of a simulated annealing procedure for solving the vehicle routing problem and a GRASP-based heuristic for solving the container loading problem. In the simulated annealing procedure, routes are updated using a few basic moves and the corresponding <b>packing</b> <b>costs</b> for a route are evaluated by solving the container loading subproblem. New packing schemes for a given route are constructed in a greedy randomized way and locally improved using a few simple moves, the cost of the best packing scheme is returned to the simulated annealing procedure. status: publishe...|$|E
