40|$|The current {{research}} highlighted {{the roles of}} psychological climate for engagement and leader behavior patterns as drivers of employee engagement. Additionally, results emphasized the function of leader behavior patterns in fostering engagement and managing task and contextual (i. e., non-work related) <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Building on foundational research that substantiates a link between engagement and performance, the {{current research}} focused on motivational processes that precede individual-level engagement. ^ There were two primary objectives of this research project. The first was to model the process through which individual experiences of employee engagement transmit the influence of psychological climate perceptions of engagement and leader behavior patterns on task and contextual <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The second was to define the nature of leader behavior patterns in fostering employee engagement among organizational members. ^ A multilevel design, the research model included self-report measures of individual and aggregate level variables. Psychological climate for engagement, employee attitudes about work, and task and contextual <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors</b> represented individual level variables. Aggregate level variables included collective assessments of workgroup members 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of leader engagement and transformational and transactional leadership styles. ^ A social network analysis strategy and interviews with union representatives and the executive committee defined clusters of individuals who worked interdependently and shared common work goals (i. e., workgroups). A multilevel modeling procedure, hierarchical linear modeling, accounted for relationships between the aggregate and individual levels across organizational data. ^ Results indicate that employee engagement serves as a robust mediator {{of the effects of}} psychological climate for engagement on contextual <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors</b> directed at fellow employees. Psychological climate for engagement is also a chief, direct predictor of respondent reports of task <b>performance.</b> Leader <b>behavior</b> patterns, specifically, leader engagement and transformational leadership, serve as predictors of task performance. Results indicate transformational leadership influences reports of contextual <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors</b> directed at fellow employees, albeit, negatively. Employee engagement is a significant predictor of both forms of contextual performance (employee and organization-directed). Results suggest that the motivational process, through which engagement manifests itself, includes components of the social work environment. Discussions include implications of these results, suggestions for future research, and promising intervention strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{measurement}} and criterion theory are critical topics {{in the fields}} of I/O psychology, yet scholars continue to note several issues with the criterion, including empirically redundant behaviors, construct and measure proliferation, and definitions that conflict. These interconnected problems hinder the advancement of criterion {{measurement and}} theory. The goal {{of this study was to}} empirically examine the issues of theory/construct clarity and measurement as they exist regarding work <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors.</b> This study's first objective was to clarify definitions of core <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors,</b> particularly to resolve issues of construct proliferation and conceptual conflict. Universal definitions of four core criterion constructs (i. e., task performance, citizenship <b>performance,</b> counterproductive work <b>behavior,</b> and withdrawal) were developed that integrated existing definitions of similar behaviors. Each definition reflects a parsimonious conceptualization of existing <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors,</b> which serves to clarify existing, and at times divergent, criterion conceptualizations. Importantly, these integrated definitions represent commonly-held definitions of the constructs and replace the largely discrepant accumulation of definitions. The second objective was to determine whether existing items assumed to measure the four core work <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors</b> were judged by raters to represent their respective constructs. The results showed that of the 851 items examined, over half were judged to not represent their respective constructs which, importantly, replicated previous research. Additionally, the results highlight items that match their respective construct definition and contain minimal overlap with non-posited constructs. Finally, the third objective was to determine the implications of using the problematic items for both the empirical relationships among work <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors</b> and evidence of construct-related validity. The results provided preliminary evidence that while nomological networks are minimally affected, relationships among some work performance dimensions are significantly affected when problematic items are removed from measures of performance constructs. This dissertation demonstrated the need for more attention to the construct labels placed on the behaviors described in work performance items, as there are potentially adverse consequences for theory and measurement. Ultimately, the results of this study showed that work performance behaviors/items have often been assigned incorrect construct labels which, subsequently, may cast considerable doubt on the theoretical and empirical understanding of the criterion domain...|$|R

It is generally accepted that errors in performance give insight into perception of a music’s structure, but these studies are restricted to Western score-reading tradition thus far. Currently there are several theories to explain the evolution of music. One of theories, expanded on by Ian Cross, {{is the idea that}} music piggy-backed on the ability to produce language and evolved to enable and promote social interaction. Cross bases his account on the fact that music is a humanly ancient art seen throughout nearly every example of human culture. Since opinions vary on what precisely can be defined as [...] "music", Cross defines it as [...] "complexly structured, affectively significant, attentionally entraining, and immediately—yet indeterminately—meaningful," [...] noting that all known cultures have some art form that can be defined in this way. In the same article, Cross examines the communicative power of music, exploring its role in minimizing within-group conflict and bringing social groups together and claiming that music could have served the function of managing intra and inter-group interactions throughout the course of human evolution. Essentially, Cross proposes that music and language evolved together, serving contrasting functions that have been equally essential to the evolution of humankind. Additionally, Bruno Nettl has proposed that music evolved to increase efficiency of vocal communication over long distances, or enabled communication with the supernatural.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} extra-role <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> {{of teachers}} and their identification with the teaching staff under the conditions of modernization of the education system and optimization of the network of educational institutions in Russia. The author provides {{a review of the}} literature on the subject and specifies the concept of extra-role <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> of teachers, what factors cause or promote such behavior, and what it means to be a “good teacher”. Understanding the importance of extrarole <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> as an essential component of labor efficiency will help educational organizations’ heads to use it in the recruitment, selection and certification of teachers, and in the development of personnel reserve. The author selects three factors predicting extra-role performance behavior: work experience, the school as an organization, and identification with the school staff. Regression models based on data on school teachers of Vologda (N = 78. 6 schools), explained extra-role <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> associated with a change in the functioning of the organization (Model 2. Enhancement of performance, R 2 = 0. 21) and with behavior toward colleagues (Model 4. Helping the colleagues,R 2 = 0. 19). The predictive capacity (partial R 2) of predictors turned out different: for work experience – 0. 10, for affiliation with a particular school – 0. 06, for identification with the school staff – 0. 02. Extra-role <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> of teachers in Vologda is more pronounced in comparison with the standardization sample. Newcomers are much less likely to display such behavior since they do not have opportunities to influence the school organization and help colleagues. The low degree of satisfaction with group membership as a component of identification with the school team can be caused by significant work-load. We assume that when work-load increases, it is extra-role <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> that suffers in the first place, and this leads to decrease in work performance and provokes various unproductive compensatory strategies: burnout; slowdown of professional development. Because newcomers and experienced teachers manifest this behavior to a different extent, the effect for beginners will be delayed. It is necessary to consider the influence of the environment, because extra-role <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> depends on where and with whom an individual works...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} {{to extend the}} software performance engineering process. Common performance measurement and tuning principles mainly target to improve the software function itself. Hereby, the application source code is studied and improved independently of the overall system <b>performance</b> <b>behavior.</b> Moreover, the optimization of the software function {{has to be done}} without an estimation of the expected optimization gain. This often leads to an under- or overoptimization, and hence, does not utilize the system sufficiently. The proposed performance improvement methodology and framework, called dynamic performance stubs, improves the before mentioned insufficiencies by evaluating the overall system performance improvement. This is achieved by simulating the <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> of the original software functionality depending on an adjustable optimization level prior to the real optimization. So, it enables the software performance analyst to determine the systems’ overall <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> considering possible outcomes of different improvement approaches. Moreover, by using the dynamic performance stubs methodology, a cost-benefit analysis of different optimizations regarding the <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> can be done. The approach of the dynamic performance stubs is to replace the software bottleneck by a stub. This stub combines the simulation of the software functionality with the possibility to adjust the <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> depending on one or more different performance aspects of the replaced software function. A general methodology for using dynamic performance stubs as well as several methodologies for simulating different performance aspects is discussed. Finally, several case studies to show the application and usability of the dynamic performance stubs approach are presented...|$|E

This paper seeks to address how to accelerate full-system simulation through studying, characterizing, and predicting the <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> of OS services. Through studying the <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> of OS services, we found that each OS service exhibits multiple but limited behavior points that are repeated frequently. OS services also exhibit application-specific <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> and largely irregular patterns of occurrences. We exploit the observation to speed up full system simulation. A simulation run is divided into two nonoverlapping periods: a learning period in which <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> of instances of an OS service are characterized and recorded, and a prediction period in which detailed simulation is replaced with a much faster emulation mode to obtain the behavior signature of an instance of an OS service, and prediction of its performance based on the signature and records of the service’s past <b>performance</b> <b>behavior.</b> Statistically-rigorous algorithms are used to determine when to switch between learning and prediction periods. We test our simulation acceleration method with a set of OSintensive applications and a recent version of Linux OS running on top of a detailed processor and memory hierarchy model implemented on Simics, a popular full-system simulator. On average, the method needs the learning periods to cover only 11 % of OS service invocations in order to produce highly accurate performance estimates. This leads to an estimated simulation speedup of 4. 9 ×, with an average performance prediction error of only 3. 2 %, and a worst case error of 4. 2 %. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between psychological empowerment and job performance, and whether three intermediate performance determinants; motivation, ability, and opportunity to perform {{hold the key}} to unlocking the empowerment-performance relationship dilemma are addressed. Using hierarchical linear modeling to analyse responses from 380 project management-level staff, the results show that psychological empowerment not only has direct and positive performance consequences, but also indirect effects, mediated by intrinsic motivation, opportunity to perform and ability to perform. The findings provide preliminary evidence in support of a comprehensive model of work performance that takes into consideration not only motivation and ability but opportunity to perform. Indeed, opportunity to perform actually emerged as a stronger mediator in the psychological empowerment-contextual <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors</b> relationship than ability to perform.

40|$|Redesigning {{jobs from}} a {{traditional}} workgroup structure to a semiautonomous team structure has become increasingly popular, but the impact of such redesigns on employee effectiveness criteria has been mixed. The present longitudinal quasi-experimental study showed that although such a redesign had positive effects on 3 <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors</b> (effort, skill usage, and problem solving), its effectiveness also depended on aspects of the organizational context. In conditions where the organizational reward and feedback and information systems were effective, redesigning work into a semi-autonomous team structure had no discernible effect on <b>performance</b> <b>behaviors.</b> In conditions where these systems were poor, however, such a redesign produced large positive benefits.

Achieving this objective by introducing structural alterations in a neutral covalent compound offers only one approach for resultant properties modification. Heterocyclic salts significantly enhance the flexibility for achieving properties modification via three strategic approaches: (1) compositionally pairing various cation structural classes {{with a number of}} anion structural classes, (2) systematically altering the structure of the cation; and, (3) systematically altering the structure of the anion. To illustrate this premise, four general synthesis methods to synthesize heterocyclic salts, including several new binary heterocyclium icosahedral closo-borane and closo-carborane salts, first are outlined. Secondly, properties modification approaches of neutral covalent compounds are then compared with those approaches available for various heterocyclic salts. Lastly, a key example, using three unsaturated bridged heterocyclium di-cation salts, demonstrates how rational structure design, and its effect on resultant predictable properties modification, produces tailored <b>performance</b> <b>behavior</b> to reach the thermochemical initiation threshold needed for combustion. This is achieved with predictable properties modifications that increase salt energy content, or that accelerate the reaction kinetics of the thermochemical initiation process...|$|E
