30|$|Previous {{studies have}} used various ways of {{providing}} incentives to respondents and compensate {{them for their}} participation (Navratil et al. 1994). With an increasing reliance on ICT-based communication, it has become less feasible to send gifts or vouchers to respondents directly. Different from the conventional face-to-face interview, incentives {{may need to be}} transmitted electronically, such as electronic coupons, <b>prepaid</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>cards,</b> and credits for online games and services. This panel study provided <b>prepaid</b> mobile <b>phone</b> <b>cards</b> of around RMB 30 – 50 yuan (≈ 4.8 - 8.0 USD) to compensate respondents, and this amount could be deposited directly to their phone numbers. As with the strategy of sending gift vouchers together with a change-of-address card (Laurie and Scott 1999), this study also used this chance to update contact information by sending confirmation messages to their phone numbers. However, such economic incentives may not be big enough to persuade some to participate, and for others, the exchange relationship may cause discomfort since they do not like the instrumental feeling of “selling information.” In both situations, the research team worked on the emotional aspects of how respondents felt about the survey in various ways.|$|R
