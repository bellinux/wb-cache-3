40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{political}} representation in EU multi-level governance. The European Union {{and its political}} system is quite complex, due to its unusual and multi-level governance. It has gained the reputation of capturing professionalism, and conforming to elite governance {{to a point where}} it is seen as an elite political game. The thesis wish to examine the European political system, and ask the questions, how important is the degree of consent between the political elite and the public in the European Union? Does it necessarily {{have an effect on the}} system of political representation as such, and if is does, does it influence legitimacy? Or in other terms, is it necessary for a degree of consent between the political elite and the public for <b>political</b> representation and <b>legitimacy?</b> The European Union has a tendancy to gain critique for its focus on professionalism and elitism, and I wish therefore to state that it is important to generate an evident relationship between <b>political</b> representation and <b>legitimacy</b> in EU multi-level governance. It is necessesary to create a functioning relationship between the political elite and the public, but it does not necessarily mean that it influence <b>political</b> representation and <b>legitimacy.</b> It is important to view the opportunities for <b>political</b> representation and <b>legitimacy</b> in a situation such as this.

40|$|Our {{paper is}} divided into three sections. First, it was {{necessary}} to contextualize further our study in the various scholarly fields that have touched on issues of leadership and local politics. A second part is a presentation of, and elaboration upon, the concepts within Bourdieu’s work that we found useful to our theorization of community leadership. A third section is illustrating the relevance of this theoretical framework to unpack a complex South African story of local politics. The conclusion debates the relevance of this framework beyond the South African case. In our attempt to unravel the structures, constraints and opportunities under which community leaders operate, we have been inspired, as many before us in different ways, by Bourdieu’s work on political capital, political representation and his analyses of the specificities of the ‘political field’ (Bourdieu, 1991). However, we also feel that his theoretical frames are built on reflections developed at a supra-local scale, in contexts of highly institutionalized or institutionalizing politics (national party apparatuses), and where the politics of informality are not at the center of his observations. We believe our perspectives on the micro-politics of the local in urban societies dominated by informality, and in globalizing and neoliberalizing governance contexts which see the proliferation of governance institutions (private and public, formal and informal, local, national and international) might bring new insights into the understanding of the complex construction of <b>political</b> <b>legitimacies.</b> In particular, we argue that community leaders – being both grounded locally, in close proximity to their constituencies; and in search of institutional recognition (by a party, or a fraction of the state) that might give them less uncertain legitimacy as well as possible access to material resources, need to build their <b>political</b> <b>legitimacies</b> not either from the bottom or from the top, but from both simultaneously. Following Bourdieu’s notion of double dealings (the need for what he calls ’professional politicians’ to fight in the political field {{as well as in the}} social field; for their own political positions and as representatives of their mandators), we then elaborate on instances where the relationships between the two legitimation processes (what we call here legitimation from the ‘bottom’ and from the ‘top’) reinforce one another or contradict one anothe...|$|R

In order to maintain <b>political</b> <b>legitimacy</b> and receive Daoist support, Beiyue Temple was chosen by the Song Emperor as the location to make sacrifices to Hengshan.

40|$|This article explores and critiques the {{relationship}} between justice and legitimacy in contemporary liberal thought. The first half sets out {{the extent to which}} liberalism demands the same necessary and sufficient conditions of justice and legitimacy, and in doing so obscures their evaluative distinctiveness. It then offers an interpretation of the deeper theoretical assumptions that result in this unsatisfactory conflation, arguing that the primacy that liberal theory has given to justice, understood as a moral concept, has resulted in a failure to appreciate the deeply multifaceted <b>political</b> nature of <b>legitimacy.</b> The suggestion is then made that it is only through recognizing this nature, including the different (political) circumstances in which the demand for legitimation arises and the needs to which it responds, that this theoretical impasse can be overcome. The article ends on the more radical thought that this may require liberal theory to displace justice as the first (moral) virtue of political systems and replace it with the (<b>political)</b> virtue of <b>legitimacy...</b>|$|R

However, military critics of the war pointed out that the Vietnam War was political and that the military mission lacked any clear idea of how to achieve its objectives.

25|$|King Taksin {{was seen}} by some radical historians as a King who {{differed}} from the Kings of Ayutthaya, in his origins, his policies, and his leadership style, {{as a representative of}} a new class.

Instead, King Taksin became one of the national heroes. This was because the leaders of that time such as Plaek Pibulsonggram and even later military junta, on the other hand, wanted to glorify and publicise the stories of certain historical figures in the past in order to support their own policy of nationalism, expansionism and patriotism.|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} question {{of economic and}} technological history is why some civilizations adopted new and important technologies and others did not. In this paper, we construct a simple political economy model which suggests that rulers may not accept a productivity-enhancing technology when it negatively affects an agent’s ability to provide the ruler legitimacy. However, when other sources of legitimacy emerge, the ruler will accept the technology {{as long as the}} new legitimizing source is not negatively affected.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of systems of transnational regulation and governance {{in the last}} decade has been a considerable challenge to authors studying patterns of business and management from an institutionalist perspective. One view, expounded most clearly in Whitley, is that “as long as the nation state remains the primary unit of <b>political</b> competition, <b>legitimacy</b> and definer and upholder of private property rights, in addition to being the predominant influence on labor market institutions, many characteristics of business systems will continue to vary significantly across national boundaries” (Whitley 2005 a: 224). Inevitably such arguments are countered by contrary claims showing how, in specific areas, forms of transnational governance are emerging, what Djelic and Quack refer to as “the progressive transnationalization of a few actors, strategies and logics” (Djelic and Quack 2003 : 11) ...|$|R
