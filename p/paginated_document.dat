40|$|Introduction NROFF and TROFF are text {{processors}} {{under the}} PDP- 11 UNIX Time-Sharing System 1 that format text for typewriter-like terminals {{and for a}} Graphic Systems phototypesetter, respectively. They accept lines of text interspersed with lines of format control information and format the text into a printable, <b>paginated</b> <b>document</b> having a user-designed style. NROFF and TROFF offer unusual freedom in document styling, including: arbitrary style headers and footers; arbitrary style footnotes; multiple automatic sequence numbering for paragraphs, sections, etc; multiple column output; dynamic font and point-size control; arbitrary horizontal and vertical local motions at any point; and a family of automatic overstriking, bracket construction, and line drawing functions. NROFF and TROFF are highly compatible {{with each other and}} it is almost...|$|E

50|$|Database {{publishing}} {{is an area}} of automated media {{production in}} which specialized techniques are used to generate <b>paginated</b> <b>documents</b> from source data residing in traditional databases. Common examples are mail order catalogues, direct marketing, report generation, price lists and telephone directories. The database content can be in the form of text and pictures but can also contain metadata related to formatting and special rules that may apply to the document generation process. Database publishing can be incorporated into larger workflows as a component, where documents are created, approved, revised and released.|$|R
40|$|FOA [Formatting Object Authoring] is an {{open-source}} {{authoring tool}} that applies rich styling to XML content. It allows the styling to be re-used across multiple documents. It also allows the author to build or import {{a library of}} style components. It is based on XSL-FO, the W 3 C-defined markup language, whose aim is to add rich styling to XML content, especially for <b>paginated</b> <b>documents.</b> The architecture of FOA permits the author to create and modify style sets, and also allows these styles to be re-applied to different XML content. The tool generates an XSL stylesheet, based on the style information It takes the XML content and produces an XSL-FO document, which can then be rendered into different output formats. An extension to an XSL-FO renderer allows the author to preview the output within the authoring tool...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In 2004 the {{adoption}} of a modular curriculum at the medical faculty in Muenster led to the introduction of centralized examinations based on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). We report on how organizational challenges of realizing faculty-wide personalized tests were addressed by implementation of a specialized software module to automatically generate test sheets from individual test registrations and MCQ contents. Methods Key steps of the presented method for preparing personalized test sheets are (1) the compilation of relevant item contents and graphical media from a relational database with database queries, (2) the creation of Extensible Markup Language (XML) intermediates, and (3) the transformation into <b>paginated</b> <b>documents.</b> Results The software module by use of an open source print formatter consistently produced high-quality test sheets, while the blending of vectorized textual contents and pixel graphics resulted in efficient output file sizes. Concomitantly the module permitted an individual randomization of item sequences to prevent illicit collusion. Conclusions The automatic generation of personalized MCQ test sheets is feasible using freely available open source software libraries, and can be efficiently deployed on a faculty-wide scale. </p...|$|R
50|$|Computer usage has {{blurred the}} distinctions between illustrators, photographers, photo editors, 3-D modelers, and {{handicraft}} artists. Sophisticated rendering and editing software has led to multi-skilled image developers. Photographers may become digital artists. Illustrators may become animators. Handicraft may be computer-aided or use computer-generated imagery as a template. Computer clip art usage has also made the clear distinction between visual arts and page layout less obvious due to the easy access and editing of clip art {{in the process of}} <b>paginating</b> a <b>document,</b> especially to the unskilled observer.|$|R
40|$|The NC- 94 dataset, that {{contains}} climate, soil and crop data for 30 years during 1971 - 2000 for all {{counties in the}} north central United States, is an important resource in the agricultural community. Analyzing the dataset would yield invaluable understanding for farmers, scientists, public, planners, and policy makers to improve crop practices and yields, undertake scientific studies, and developing policy.;In the parametric model and its query language ParaSQL, {{the concept of a}} dimension is built at the level of primitive values. A canonical storage for XML (CanStoreX) is a technology to store large XML documents, deemed to be in terabyte range, in a paginated form on the disk that is accessed easily and efficiently requiring very small amount of main memory. CanStoreX is used as a back-end for storing NC- 94 data, hiding the heterogeneity in climate, crop, and soil data in order to allow the user a simple view of counties as objects where geographical and time dimensions are implicit and taken for granted.;This work has focused on loading the NC- 94 database on the CanStoreX storage platform. The combination of existing parametric query constructs and an efficient storage structure will provide an important tool to researchers who wish to analyze the NC- 94 dataset. The process of loading this database has also revealed important inconsistencies in the data, which we have tried to address and hence develop a more consistent view of the dataset. Previously only climate data was available and it was stored in an older version of CanStoreX where XML was stored in text form. The newer binary version of CanStoreX allows a readily available tree-like navigation in the <b>paginated</b> XML <b>document.</b> Addition of crop and soil data requires different internal representation in order to achieve a uniform view for users that is at par with the climate data. Further, the internals were conformed to use the version of CanStoreX where pages are stored in binary, rather than text form...|$|R
40|$|JDBC, Java Database Connectivity, is a {{well-known}} and mature technology for a Java based client to connect to a relational database on a server, execute SQL commands, and process results of queries that reside on the server. Likewise, {{there are a few}} technologies such as XQJ, IBM Cognos to support such connectivity to XML. But these technologies require the whole document to be stored in memory before it can be processed. As a result, such technologies cannot handle large XML documents. Canonical Storage for XML (abbreviated CanStoreX and also Csx), is a suite of technologies that are under varying stages of development at our lab. CsxPagination <b>paginates</b> an XML <b>document</b> of any size and stores it in ready to consume pages that are loaded into main memory as needed. CsxDOM, is a Javabased DOM API for processing XML documents and CsxXQuery, built on the top of CsxDOM is for query of XML documents. Under the research reported here, we have developed CsxJBCX, Csx Java Based Connectivity for XML, built on the top of CanStoreX, CsxDOM, and CsxXQuery. It provides API to allow a client to access the XML on a server, submit an XQuery query for execution on the server, and use CsxDOM from the client to process the result residing on the server. We have also done some testing of JBCX on CyDIW (Cyclone Database Implementation Workbench) - a command-based software development environment in our lab...|$|R
