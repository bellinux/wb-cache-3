5|$|In {{the days}} before Abraham Lincoln took office, parties in the seceding states {{disagreed}} over the <b>proper</b> <b>course</b> of action concerning the forts within their domains. In Florida, three forts remained {{in the possession of}} the United States Army: Fort Zachary Taylor at Key West, Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, and Fort Pickens near Pensacola. Some of the most strident secessionists proposed that they be taken over immediately, by force if needed, beginning with Fort Pickens. Cooler heads hoped to avoid bloodshed and gain possession by negotiation; they made much of the conciliatory words of William H. Seward, already selected to be Secretary of State in the incoming administration. Mallory and Florida's other Senator, David L. Yulee, and the two Senators from Alabama sent telegrams to their respective governors urging caution. Other Southern Senators lent their support, and President-elect Jefferson Davis seemed to agree. In the end, the moderates won out, and no attack was made on Fort Pickens. Although Mallory was hardly alone, his political opponents later used his perceived pro-Union stance as an excuse to attack him.|$|E

When she appreciated the fact that the interest on her invested property had increased her wealth, since the previous morning, by some hundreds of dollars, it frightened her.

Empirically-based treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, have been researched to show that through the <b>proper</b> <b>course</b> of treatment, symptoms can dissipate over time. Other forms of talk-therapy (e.g. psychodynamic psychotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy) have also been said to be effective in treating the disorder. It may be helpful for people diagnosed with dysthymia to develop better coping skills, search for the root cause of symptoms, and work on changing faulty beliefs (such as when patients believe themselves to be worthless).|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, Botvinnik was {{urged to}} return to Moscow by the People's Commissar for Power Stations, an admirer and {{subsequent}} good friend. On his return, Botvinnik suggested a match with Samuel Reshevsky in order to strengthen his claim for a title match with Alekhine, but this received no political support. In December 1943, he won the Moscow Championship, ahead of Smyslov. At the same time, opposition to his plan for a match with Alekhine re-surfaced, {{on the grounds that}} Alekhine was a political enemy and the only <b>proper</b> <b>course</b> was to demand that he be stripped of the title. The dispute ended in Botvinnik's favor, and in the dismissal of a senior chess official, one of those to have opposed Botvinnik's plan, who was also a KGB colonel.|$|E
25|$|To {{the south}} in the Saar-Palatinate region, Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. 3rd Army had dealt a devastating blow to the German 7th Army and, in {{conjunction}} with the U.S. 7th Army, had nearly destroyed the German 1st Army. In five days of battle, from 18–22 March, Patton's forces captured over 68,000 Germans. These bold actions eliminated the last German positions west of the Rhine. Although Montgomery's drive was still planned as the main effort, Eisenhower believed that the momentum of the American forces to the south should not be squandered by having them merely hold the line at the Rhine or make only limited diversionary attacks beyond it. By the end of March, the Supreme Commander thus leaned toward a decision to place more responsibility on his southern forces. The events of {{the first few days of}} the final campaign would be enough to convince him that this was the <b>proper</b> <b>course</b> of action.|$|E

25|$|The {{challenge}} to the Court in its analysis and decision was devising a <b>proper</b> <b>course</b> of action that was both coordinate and consonant between the sovereign authorities (the Congress over itself and its members, {{the people and the}} states over the Congress) each in their own sphere, over the choosing of members to the Congress. The Court looked at the historical precedent of the House, the history of its candidate members, {{and the role of the}} states and their voters in choosing their representatives. The Court concluded that the US Constitution (the word and will of the people), the weight of history (the record of how the people have used their constitution), and the federal structure of the government (the role of the states in organizing and managing elections within their borders) required the Court to decide that the sovereign will of the people, as expressed in the democratic process, and the coordinate role of their states must be made consonant and held supreme, in the responsibility to create candidate members for the Congress.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{held that}} a person {{awaiting}} trial has a valid reason, protected under the due process clause, to refuse antipsychotic drugs, referencing Washington v. Harper (1990) and Bell v. Wolfish (1979). Therefore, once Riggins' requested termination of the medication, the State was obligated to establish both {{the need for the}} antipsychotic drug and its medical appropriateness for Riggins' safety and that of others as the less restrictive alternative available. If the state had done this, due process would have been satisfied. The State {{might have been able to}} justify the treatment, if medically appropriate, if it set forth that the adjudication of guilt or innocence could not be established by using less intrusive means. Since the trial court did not do this and allowed the drug's administration to continue without making any of the determinations stated above, it is very likely that this error violated Riggins' trial rights established by the Constitution. However, this is only speculative as there is no way to know what the outcome would have been if the <b>proper</b> <b>course</b> had been followed.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, a ship {{brought with}} it rats {{infected}} with bubonic plague to initiate the San Francisco plague of 1900–1904; the first plague epidemic in the continental US. Mistakenly believing that interred corpses contributed to the transmission of plague, and possibly also motivated by the opportunity for profitable land speculation, city leaders banned all burials within the city. Cemeteries moved to the undeveloped area {{just south of the}} city limit, now the town of Colma, California. A fifteen-block section of Chinatown was quarantined while city leaders squabbled over the <b>proper</b> <b>course</b> to take, but the outbreak was finally eradicated by 1905. However, the problem of existing cemeteries and the shortage of land in the city remained. In 1912 (with fights extending until 1942), all remaining cemeteries in the city were evicted to Colma, where the dead now outnumber the living by more than a thousand to one. The above-ground Columbarium of San Francisco was allowed to remain, as well as the historic cemetery at Mission Dolores, the grave of Thomas Starr King at the Unitarian Church, and the San Francisco National Cemetery at the Presidio of San Francisco.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Providing {{accurate}} {{advices to}} postgraduate students during their postgraduate program and directing them toward a <b>proper</b> <b>courses</b> selection with their interests are an essential process in postgraduate stage. In this paper, we propose and develop an expert system for advising postgraduate students {{instead of the}} traditional way in advising by the department’s advisors. This system aims to assist postgraduate students of Computer Science (CS) major in King Abdulaziz University (KAU) to select the suitable courses during their postgraduate program. The proposed system enables the students to select and get a plan to each semester without needing to consult advisors. Moreover, it takes into account courses prerequisites and department’s requirements. Wxpython language and access database are used to implement the system. The result was as expected, {{where most of the}} postgraduate students who tested the system, were very amused and satisfied. into which you can type your own text...|$|R

25|$|Treatment in {{the acute}} setting is mostly focused on {{symptomatic}} management. After initial {{treatment in the}} hospital, some patients will need short-term placement {{in a nursing home}} or rehabilitation facility before going home. In hospital settings the doctors work with speech pathologists in issues like these. Typically, a commonly used tool to assess the degree of severity of dysphagia and speech issues is the Barnes Jewish Hospital Stroke Dysphagia Screen, which offers a validated guide to assessing plan of action (solid food diet, all liquid diet, IV hydration, etc.) for the patient while in the hospital and the <b>proper</b> <b>course</b> of action in the outpatient setting. Rehabilitation in Wallenberg’s Syndrome focuses on improving balance, coordination, working on activities of daily living, and improving speech and swallowing function. Severe nausea and vertigo can be present and limit progress in rehabilitation and recovery. Symptomatic treatment with anti-emetics and medications for the hiccups are important. Commonly used anti-emetics include ondansetron, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and promethazine. These medications are also used to treat hiccups, along with chlorpromazine. There are case reports of other medications useful in treating hiccups in Wallenberg’s Syndrome including baclofen and anti-epileptic medications. The prognosis for someone with lateral medullary syndrome depends upon the size and location of damaged area of the brain stem. Some individuals recover quickly while others may have significant neurological disabilities for months to years after the initial injury.|$|E
