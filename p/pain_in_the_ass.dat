I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was a <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass,</b> although sometimes she is a <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass.</b> But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers {{the sound of a}} detuned guitar: [...] "To me, they sound totally different if you have those nice loose, floppy strings," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in. Especially for [...] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're doing a lot of fast moving around or high up on the neck. It's a <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass,</b> but I really like that sound. I don't think I would ever go to a 7-string." ...|$|E

She placed second in IGN's [...] "Soulcalibur: The Top Ten Fighters" [...] article, which stated [...] "Few, if any, Soul fighters so aptly sum up what the series is about as Ivy Valentine." [...] IGN also included her in their list of guest characters they {{would have liked to have}} seen for Super Smash Bros.

GameSpy named her one of the [...] "25 Extremely Rough Brawlers" [...] in video gaming, praising the brutality of her fighting style and weapon. Tom's Games named her one of the fifty greatest female characters in video game history, stating that as [...] "an anti-hero who frequently clashes with other Souls, Ivy is a fascinating character for a fighting game". UGO.com placed her sixteenth on their list of the [...] "Top 50 Evil Women", noting her role as an antagonist in the first Soulcalibur while adding that it could be [...] "difficult to truly appreciate [...] villainy" [...] due to her attractiveness, and adding that her appearance and attitude made her [...] "a feared competitor".

2500|$|La Torre {{wrote the}} lyrics to [...] "Don't Look Back", {{predominantly}} basing them on a poem about moving on, which he wrote many years prior when he was [...] "in a really weird place personally". He explains that the song is about [...] "taking charge of [...] own life and not making up excuses for why life is such a <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass</b> sometime," [...] because La Torre believes that we control our own destiny, and are responsible for our own successes and failures. He has also said: [...] "It's about scenarios of despair, but people are finding the beauty in the very simple things in life." [...] Looking for [...] "some kind of resolver or conclusion" [...] to make the lyrics make sense, {{he came up with}} a chant: [...] "Magnetize what you conceptualize because your thoughts become things", a thought process based on the law of attraction from the book The Secret. The chant is repeated three times {{near the end of the}} song; La Torre says [...] "it used to build up even more" [...] in the original demo.|$|E

5000|$|Type I citrullinemia is {{the most}} common form of the disorder, {{affecting}} about one in 57,000 births worldwide. Mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ASS</b> gene cause type I citrullinemia. The enzyme made by this gene, argininosuccinate synthetase (...) , is responsible for one step of the urea cycle. Mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ASS</b> gene reduce <b>the</b> activity of the enzyme, which disrupts the urea cycle and prevents the body from processing nitrogen effectively. Excess nitrogen, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of ammonia, and other byproducts of the urea cycle, accumulate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bloodstream, leading to the characteristic features of type I citrullinemia.|$|R

At Startup Grind Jackson Hole on March 13, 2015, Barlow {{said that he was}} motivated to team up with Algae Systems after undergoing back surgery to address pain from an old ranching injury, while he had been an advisor to Herb Allison (president of Merrill Lynch at the time) and working to completely [...] "electronify" [...] financial transactions and speculative asset assembly (Barlow was named [...] "One of the 25 Most Influential People in Financial Services" [...] in the June 1999 issue of FutureBanker Magazine). The surgery successfully alleviated the pain and catalyzed Barlow to change his focus from building wealth to building infrastructure in order {{to do something about the}} “amount of alterations we are already enacting on Planet Earth... We are not necessarily making it warmer, but weirder.” At Startup Grind Jackson Hole, Barlow also explained how once over tea with “Grandmother of the Conservation Movement” Mardy Murie, he was inspired by her words, “Environmentalists can be a <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ass...</b> But they make great ancestors.” Adopting this philosophy, Barlow says, “I want to be a good ancestor." ...|$|E
