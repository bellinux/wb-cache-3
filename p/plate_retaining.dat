40|$|To warn of the {{stability}} of retaining wall structures with damage, a simplified mechanical model and a finite element model of this retaining wall-soil coupling system are established. Via finite element model updating, a baseline finite element model of the wall-soil system is acquired. A damage alarming index ERSD (Energy Ratio Standard Deviation) is proposed via the wavelet packet analysis of a virtual impulse response function of dynamic responses to this baseline finite element model. The internal relationships among the alarming index, earth pressure, and damage stability of the wall are analyzed. Then, a damage stability alarming method for the retaining walls is advanced. To verify the feasibility and validity of this alarming method, vibration tests on the baseline finite element model of a pile <b>plate</b> <b>retaining</b> wall are performed. The ERSD is used as an alarm for the damage stability of the wall. Analysis results show that, {{with an increase in}} the ERSD, {{the stability}} of the wall changes from a stable state to an unstable one. The wall reaches a critical stable state when the alarming index reaches its threshold value. Thus, the damage stability of this pile <b>plate</b> <b>retaining</b> wall can be alarmed via ERSD...|$|E
40|$|To {{eliminate}} {{the influence of}} excitation on the wavelet packet frequency band energy spectrum (ES), ES is acquired via wavelet packet decomposition of a virtual impulse response function. Based on ES, a character frequency band vector spectrum and damage eigenvector spectrum (DES) are created. Additionally, two damage identification indexes, the energy ratio standard deviation and energy ratio variation coefficient, are proposed. Based on the damage index, an updated damage identification method for retaining wall structures is advanced. The damage state of a retaining wall can be diagnosed through DES, the damage location can be detected through the damage index trend surface, and the damage intensity can be identified by establishing a quantitative relationship between the damage intensity and damage index. To verify the feasibility and validity of this damage identification method, a vibration test on a pile <b>plate</b> <b>retaining</b> wall is performed. Test results demonstrate that it can distinguish whether the retaining wall is damaged, {{and the location of}} partial damage within the retaining wall can be easily detected; in addition, the damage intensity of the wall can also be identified validly. Consequently, this damage identification theory and method may be used to identify damage within retaining wall structures...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The microstructure and hardness of simulated welds in HY- 130 cast plate, wrought plate and weld filler metal are investigated. The dependence of these quantities on the austenitizing temperature and the tempering provided by subsequent weld passes is also investigated. The {{use of a}} tempering parameter, as developed by Hollomon and Jaffe, allows comparison of different tempering times and temperatures. It was found that in the rapid heating cycle of simulated welding that the AC 1 and AC 3 temperatures are approximately as much as 150 to 170 °F higher than the corresponding temperatures of the equilibrium phase diagram for this 0. 1 % C- 5. 0 % Ni steel. Results indicate that cast plate tends to resist tempering more than either the rolled plate or weld metal. Additionally, structures formed at lower austenitizing temperatures temper more readily. Although all three conditions tempered, the cast <b>plate</b> <b>retained</b> a steep hardness and microstructural gradient through the HAZ and consequently is probably more susceptible to a metallurgical notch effect.

40|$|For {{composite}} structures with externally bonded reinforcement, debonding at the interface {{is one of}} the most difficult problems. This paper presents the application of a nanotechnology - surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT), which produces nanostructured steel plates, to overcome this critical debonding problem through strain localization. The nanostructured steel plates can have tensile strength comparable to that of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) while retaining high ductility. When used for structural strengthening, the <b>plates</b> <b>retain</b> the advantages of FRP and steel, and avoid their disadvantages. By locally treating a steel plate with SMAT to increase its tensile strength in certain parts, the plate&# 039;s yielding is diverted and localized to certain relatively weaker zones when the strengthened beam is loaded to yield, leaving the stronger zones under elastic and much smaller strain conditions. As debonding is closely related to the tensile strain of the externally bonded reinforcement, the small strain condition in the stronger regions inhibits the debonding from spreading. As a result, the global detachment of the externally bonded reinforcement can be delayed or even avoided. The effectiveness of this new technology has been substantiated by beam testing. The anti-debonding mechanism is also studied using numerical simulations...|$|R
5000|$|A {{diamond plate}} is a steel plate, {{sometimes}} {{mounted on a}} plastic or resin base, coated with diamond grit, an abrasive that will grind metal. When they are mounted they are sometimes known as diamond stones. [...] The plate may {{have a series of}} holes cut in it that capture the swarf cast off as grinding takes place, and cuts costs by reducing the amount of abrasive surface area on each plate. Diamond plates can serve many purposes including sharpening steel tools, and for maintaining the flatness of man-made waterstones, which can become grooved or hollowed in use. Truing (flattening a stone whose shape has been changed as it wears away) is widely considered essential to the sharpening process but some hand sharpening techniques utilise the high points of a non-true stone. As the only part of a diamond plate to wear away is a very thin coating of grit and adhesive, and in a good diamond plate this wear is minimal due to diamond's hardness, a diamond <b>plate</b> <b>retains</b> its flatness. Rubbing the diamond plate on a whetstone to true (flatten) the whetstone is a modern alternative to more traditional truing methods.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} image light {{elements}} in both crystalline and noncrystalline materials at near atomic resolution with an enhanced contrast is highly advantageous {{to understand the}} structure and properties {{of a wide range}} of beam sensitive materials including biological specimens and molecular hetero-structures. This requires the imaging system to have an efficient phase contrast transfer at both low and high spatial frequencies. In this work we introduce a new phase contrast imaging method in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) using a pre-specimen phase plate in the probe forming aperture, combined with a fast pixelated detector to record diffraction patterns at every probe position, and phase reconstruction using ptychography. The phase plate significantly enhances the contrast transfer of low spatial frequency information, and ptychography maximizes the extraction of the phase information at all spatial frequencies. In addition, the STEM probe with the presence of the phase <b>plate</b> <b>retains</b> its atomic resolution, allowing simultaneous incoherent Z-contrast imaging to be obtained along with the ptychographic phase image. An experimental image of Au nanoparticles on a carbon support shows high contrast for both materials.

This work investigates the structure of Eurasian Plio–Pleistocene Mammuthus enamel, with attention to diagenesis and individual variability. A focal point {{of this study was}} to determine whether morphological trends in Mammuthus molars were accompanied by correlated enamel microstructure changes. In the examined four taxa the enamel of the cheek teeth consists of three layers delimited by two major discontinuities in enamel prism direction. Noticeably, the enamel capping the occlusal end of the unworn molar <b>plates</b> <b>retains</b> a less derived two−layered structure, similar to that found in the basal proboscidean Moeritherium. In Mammuthus meridionalis the third deciduous premolar is differentiated from all other teeth in having more strongly decussating Hunter−Schreger bands in the middle layer, as a possible reinforcement of the very thin enamel. Evidence from this analysis shows that, in the transition from late Middle Pliocene M. rumanus to Late Pleistocene M. primigenius, the middle enamel layer, which is made up of prisms at an angle to the occlusal surface, pro− viding greater resistance against wear, increased its relative thickness. This is consistent with the hypothesis that Mammuthus adapted to a more abrasive diet. Comparison with other proboscidean taxa indicates that the schmelzmuster (enamel pattern) found in Mammuthus is a synapomorphy of the Elephantoidea...|$|R
