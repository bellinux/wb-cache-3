25|$|Because {{of these}} {{unbearable}} conditions, Chinese coolies often revolted against their Ko-Hung bosses and foreign company bosses at <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> on ships, and in foreign lands.

25|$|The {{majority}} {{of the game is}} spent sailing from destination to destination around the Caribbean islands. To control their ship the player must use the number pad (or the directional arrows) on the keyboard. Mouse navigation is also possible, where clicking anywhere on the screen will send the ship sailing in that direction. During the sailing segment, the player navigates between areas of interest in the Caribbean, including colonies, cities, missions, pirate havens, and others. Wind conditions have an important effect on sailing, as winds tend to blow westwards (especially on lower difficulty levels) and as such speed up travels to the west while slowing down travel to the east. Clouds passing overhead indicate barometric depressions, and at the centers of these depressions are storms which cause powerful winds, usually assisting sailing in any direction but also posing a threat to any ship passing underneath the storm. Unlike previous versions of the game, the Caribbean is teeming with ships represented visually by their three-dimensional models. The player can spot these ships from a distance and even collect information about their mission, <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> destination, and nationality. This allows the player to hand-pick his targets, as well as actively pursue most ships if an attack is to be attempted. Unlike previous Pirates! games, however, enemy ships cannot force the player to fight, although they can bombard the player's ships en route to a destination and even sink some (but not all) of the player's ships if they bombard them long enough. Fortified cities which hold a particular grudge against the player (or whose controlling nation holds a substantial bounty over the player's head) may also open fire upon the player's fleet as it passes by. The player must also navigate around reefs and shoals, which cause hull damage to any ship which passes over them (but rarely sink ships, unlike in previous versions). Finally, if the player wishes, he may sail the ship onto the shoreline, allowing the crew to disembark and begin to march. This can be used when the player wishes to approach a hostile city without being fired upon, to attack a friendly city, or to travel on land seeking buried treasure, lost cities, or Montalban's hideout.|$|E

2500|$|The {{race was}} not only a test of sailing, but also of {{efficient}} management at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b> Each ship needed to be ready to receive her cargo.

[...] Its growth as a major port was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution. Along with handling general cargo, freight, raw materials such as coal and cotton, the city merchants were involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In the 19th century, it was a major <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> for Irish and English emigrants to the United States.

Such questions and answers are common enough on board ships, and, as they are usually put and given with intelligence, one of our mate's general knowledge of his profession, was likely to carry away much useful information. By conversations of this nature, and by consulting the charts, which Spike did not affect to conceal after the name of his port became known, the young man, in fact, had so far made himself master of the subject, as to have tolerably accurate notions of the courses, distances, and general peculiarities of the reef. When the sun went down, he supposed himself to be about half-way across the space of open water, and some five-and-twenty miles dead to windward of his <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b> This was doing very well for the circumstances, and Mulford believed himself and his companions clear of spike, when, as night drew its veil over the tranquil sea, nothing was in sight.|$|E

60|$|Roswell Gardiner, however, did not {{neglect the}} lead. The {{schooner}} had merely to luff {{close to the}} wind, {{and they were in}} a proper state to sound. This they did twice, during that night, and with a very sensible diminution in the depth of the water. It was evident that the schooner was getting pretty close in on the coast, the wind coming out nearly at south, in squalls. Her commander held on, for he thought there were indications of a change, and he still did not like to ware so long as his rival of the Vineyard kept on the larboard tack. In this way, each encouraging the other in recklessness, did these two craft run nearly into the lion's jaw, as it might be; for, when the day re-appeared, the wind veered round to the eastward, a little northerly, bringing the craft directly on a lee-shore, blowing at the time so heavily as to render a foresail reefed down to a mere rag, more canvass than the little vessels could well bear. As the day returned, and the drizzle cleared off a little, land was seen to leeward, stretching slightly to seaward, both ahead and astern! On consulting his charts, and after getting a pretty good look at the coast from aloft, Roswell Gardiner became satisfied that he was off Currituck, which placed him near six degrees to the southward of his <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> and about four to the westward. Our young man now deeply felt that a foolish rivalry had led him into an error, and he regretted that he had not wore the previous evening, when he might have had an offing that would have enabled him to stand in either direction, clearing the land. As things were, he was not by any means certain of the course he ought to pursue.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between Qing Dynasty China and Japan continued {{over an extended}} period of time through Chinese ships sailing to Nagasaki. Representative <b>of</b> the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> for these Chinese sailing ships was, in the early stages, Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, with Zhapu, also in Zhejiang Province, also focused on from around the end of the 17 th century to the beginning of the 18 th century.

The function of Zhapu as a <b>port</b> <b>of</b> trade with Japan in this way is emphasized in conventional research, but its important function as a port for coastal trade within China has been overlooked. Therefore, this paper begins the discussion of the relation between Zhapu and Japan starting from the Middle Age era of the Japanese pirates. It describes the fact of Zhapu not only functioning as a trade port with Japan during the Qing Dynasty but also that it was an important port for coastal trade in China, and, as one example of this, illustrates the relation between Zhapu and Chinese coastal trade as a method of clarifying why typical China-made sugar exported to Japan was stockpiled in Zhapu...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: American Creole cattle presumably {{descend from}} animals {{imported}} from the Iberian Peninsula {{during the period of}} colonization and settlement, through different migration routes, and may have also suffered the influence of cattle directly imported from Africa. The introduction of European cattle, which began in the 18 th century, and later of Zebu from India, has threatened the survival of Creole populations, some of which have nearly disappeared or were admixed with exotic breeds. Assessment of the genetic status of Creole cattle is essential for the establishment of conservation programs of these historical resources. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We sampled 27 Creole populations, 39 Iberian, 9 European and 6 Zebu breeds. We used microsatellite markers to assess the origins of Creole cattle, and to investigate the influence of different breeds on their genetic make-up. The major ancestral contributions are from breeds of southern Spain and Portugal, in agreement with the historical <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>of</b> ships sailing towards the Western Hemisphere. This Iberian contribution to Creoles may also include some African influence, given the influential role that African cattle have had in the development of Iberian breeds, but the possibility of a direct influence on Creoles of African cattle imported to America can not be discarded. In addition to the Iberian influence, the admixture with other European breeds was minor. The Creoles from tropical areas, especially those from the Caribbean, show clear signs of admixture with Zebu. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Nearly five centuries since cattle were first brought to the Americas, Creoles still show a strong and predominant signature of their Iberian ancestors. Creole breeds differ widely from each other, both in genetic structure and influences from other breeds. Efforts are needed to avoid their extinction or further genetic erosion, which would compromise centuries of selective adaptation {{to a wide range of}} environmental conditions...|$|R
