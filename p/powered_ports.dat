40|$|Summary: Comparison of CT (power) and {{standard}} venous port systems in long-term central venous access in outpatients. The aim {{of our study}} was to evaluate benefit of use of portsystems during contrast enhanced CT examinations. We studied implantation of <b>power</b> <b>port</b> systems in short and middle time period and also compared the procedure to literature informations. We also studied benefit of <b>power</b> <b>port</b> implantation procedure done under sonographic and fluoroscopic navigation. Materials and methods: There were collected patients of two cooperating departments of interventional radiology. All our patients {{included in the study}} had implanted <b>power</b> <b>port</b> systems, the procedure was done by sonographic and fluoroscopic control. We studied periprocedural and late complications of the procedure. We also studied benefit of the <b>power</b> <b>port</b> for contrast enhanced CT follow up during oncologic therapy and frequency of port using by medical staff. We studied perception of implanted <b>power</b> <b>port</b> in our patients in their daily life. Results: The primary technical success of the procedure was 100 % and we had no postprocedural pneumothorax observed. The technique of implantation of <b>ports</b> and <b>power</b> <b>ports</b> is the same. The average follow up in our study is 291, 5 days (2 - 294 days). Five patients died in follow up period 2 - 594 days [...] . ...|$|R

30|$|These {{multi-port}} converters can {{be classified}} as electrically-coupled and magnetically-coupled structures. The electrically-coupled types are usually implemented with non-isolated topologies such as buck, boost, and buck-boost switching cells [9, 10, 12]. In these topologies, {{in order to avoid}} large buck/boost conversion ratios and to effectively handle the ports, the operating voltage of different <b>power</b> <b>ports</b> need to be close to each other. This constraint is the main drawback of electrically-coupled multiple-port converters [13]. In magnetically-coupled topologies, the energy sources are coupled through magnetic coupling (mainly high frequency ac-link), which provide electrical isolation between the <b>power</b> <b>ports</b> [9, 11]. In these topologies, because of the use of multi-winding transformers, DGs with different operating voltage levels can be connected to <b>power</b> <b>ports.</b> These converters can handle quite different operation levels of DGs and energy storage units, but with relatively complex structures and control systems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Transient Signal Analysis (TSA) is {{a testing}} method {{that is based}} on the {{analysis}} of a set of V DD transient waveforms measured simultaneously at each supply port. Defect detection is per-formed by applying linear regression analysis to the time or frequency domain representations of these signals. Chip-wide process variation effects introduce signal variations that are correlated across the individual <b>power</b> <b>port</b> measurements. In contrast, defects introduce uncorrelated local variations across these measurements that can be detected as anomalies in the cross-correlation pro-file derived (using regression analysis) from the <b>power</b> <b>port</b> measurements of defect-free chips. This work focuses on the application of TSA to the detection of delay faults. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This work {{addresses}} {{the construction of}} a four-wheel, nonlinear vehicle dynamic bond graph model and its implementation in the 20 sim modeling and simulation environment. Nonlinear effects arising from the coupling of vertical, longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics, as well as geometric nonlinearities coming from the suspension system are taken into account. Transmission and (a simplified) engine models are also included. The modeling task is supported by a multibody representation where the parts are handled as rigid bodies linked by joints. The first step is the 3 D-modeling of each, chassis, suspension units, tires and joints, as bond graph elements equipped with <b>power</b> <b>ports</b> for physical interconnection. This is done with the help of vector or multibond graphs in order to exploit their compactness and simplicity of representation. These 3 D-units are later programmed as 20 sim bond graph subsystems whose assembling through the <b>power</b> <b>ports</b> allows for an automated, modular approach to the construction of the overall vehicle model. Simulation experiments corresponding to standard vehicle dynamics tests are presented in order to show the performance of the model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A three-port triple-half-bridge {{bidirectional}} dc–dc converter topology {{is proposed}} in this paper. The topology comprises a high-frequency three-winding transformer and three half-bridges, {{one of which}} is a boost half-bridge interfacing a <b>power</b> <b>port</b> with a wide operating voltage. The three half-bridges are coupled by the transformer, thereby providing galvanic isolation for all the <b>power</b> <b>ports.</b> The converter is controlled by phase shift, which achieves the primary power flow control, in combination with pulsewidth modulation (PWM). Because of the particular structure of the boost half-bridge, voltage variations at the port can be compensated for by operating the boost half-bridge, together with the other two half-bridges, at an appropriate duty cycle to keep a constant voltage across the half-bridge. The resulting waveforms applied to the transformer windings are asymmetrical due to the automatic volt-seconds balancing of the half-bridges. With the PWM control it is possible to reduce the rms loss and to extend the zero-voltage switching operating range to the entire phase shift region. A fuel cell and supercapacitor generation system is presented as an embodiment of the proposed multiport topology. The theoretical considerations are verified by simulation and with experimental results from a 1 kW prototype...|$|R
