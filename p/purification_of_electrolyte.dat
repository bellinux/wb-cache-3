40|$|Zinc {{electrowinning}} from sulfate solutions is {{the traditional}} industrial method to produce SHG zinc. Over {{the past few years}} several efforts have been done to improve process efficiency in order to reach high productivity with low energy requirement. The latter aim can be pursued both by means <b>of</b> a hard <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electrolyte</b> and reducing the anodic voltage. This work is a comparative study of the results obtained in several previous researches on zinc electrowinning from both sulfate and chloride solutions. Zinc electrowinning tests on industrial sulfate solution have been carried out by using Pb alloy anodes and by adding organic depolarizers such as ethanol, acetic acid or ethylene glycol. Experiments on chloride solutions, obtained by <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> zinc exhausted <b>electrolyte,</b> have been performed by using DSA anodes and by testing the effect of additives such as TEACl and TBACl. Comparing the best results obtained with the two methods it can be highlighted that a high quality zinc is electrowon in both cases with comparable energy requirements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{removal of}} {{impurity}} elements from crude nickel by vacuum distillation {{was carried out}} at the temperature 1773 K∼ 1973 K and the pressure less than 10 Pa using crude nickel(≥ 99. 9 %) as raw materials. A series of results of the impurity elements were obtained under the experimental conditions aforementioned. The experimental values βi andγio of the product were also calculted in this paper. The seperation of certain impurities from main element nickel was disscussed {{from the viewpoint of}} thermodynamics and alloy composition. Nickel (≥ 99. 99 %) was obtained and the purification and impurity removal from crude nickel by vacuum distillation method was feasible and determined. A China Patent on this new technology was also authorized. We consider that the vacuum distillation process of nickel can serve as a pretreatment step for the prepartion of highpurity nickel, and can relieve the following <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electrolyte,</b> so that the whole process of preparation of the high-purity nickel is simplified, energy consumption and environmental pollution are reduced. Therefore, the vacuum distillation process is a green metallurgical method...|$|R

40|$|A {{realistic}} molecular {{description is}} developed for electrosorption in nanoporous carbon electrodes, {{based on the}} replica reference interaction site model (replica RISM) approach to electrolyte solution sorbed in disordered nanoporous material. The theory properly accounts for the disordered structure of nanoporous carbon material and chemical specificity of sorbed solution species. The description {{is applied to the}} <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> ambient aqueous <b>electrolyte</b> solution <b>of</b> sodium chloride by nanoporous electrodes of carbonized polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) and activated carbon. The solvation structure and thermodynamics of sorbed solution are discussed in detail. The specific sorption capacity and <b>purification</b> efficiency <b>of</b> the nanoporous electrodes are calculated. It is shown that the electrosorption mechanism and properties of a nanoporous electrode are very different from those of a planar electrochemical double layer. They are determined largely by the chemical potentials of ions sorbed in the nanoporous electrodes, rather than just by the potential drop in solution at the surface of nanopores.

In addition to reducing {{the volume of}} legacy wastes, a decontamination process could make 200, 000 tons of this strategic metal available for domestic use.

This report reviews several industrial-scale processes [...] electrorefining, electrowinning, vapormetallurgy, and leaching [...] used for the <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> nickel. Conventional nickel electrolysis processes are particularly attractive because they use side-stream <b>purification</b> <b>of</b> process solutions to improve the purity of nickel metal. Additionally, nickel purification by electrolysis is effective in a variety <b>of</b> <b>electrolyte</b> systems, including sulfate, chloride, and nitrate. Conventional electrorefining processes typically use a mixed electrolyte which includes sulfate, chloride, and borate. The use of an electrorefining or electrowinning system for scrap nickel recovery could be combined effectively {{with a variety of}} processes, including cementation, solvent extraction, ion exchange, complex-formation, and surface sorption, developed for uranium and transuranic purification.

More recently Grumwald put forward a theory in which the effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the initial as well as the transition state was considered to be important. Experimental support for the latter theory was rather weak as it consisted solely of results obtained using different organic compounds for the solubility and rate determinations (the solubility data showing the effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the initial state). It was therefore thought desirable to study the effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the solubility and on the rate of hydrolysis of the same organic compound (p-nitrobenzhydrylchloride). The results show that the effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the solubility of the initial state is certainly not negligibly small, and that the requirements of Grumwald’s quantitative treatment are obeyed for many <b>of</b> the <b>electrolytes</b> studied. However factors not taken into account by this treatment appear to be of importance for some <b>of</b> the <b>electrolytes</b> employed (e. g. NaC 10 (_ 4), HC 10 (_ 4)).
