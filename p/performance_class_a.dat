40|$|Abstract Background BLAST {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and useful tools for Genetic Research. This paper {{describes}} a software application we have termed Windows. NET Distributed Basic Local Alignment Search Toolkit (W. ND-BLAST), which enhances the BLAST utility by improving usability, fault recovery, and scalability in a Windows desktop environment. Our goal was to develop an easy to use, fault tolerant, high-throughput BLAST solution that incorporates a comprehensive BLAST result viewer with curation and annotation functionality. Results W. ND-BLAST is a comprehensive Windows-based software toolkit that targets researchers, including those with minimal computer skills, and provides the ability increase the performance of BLAST by distributing BLAST queries to any number of Windows based machines across local area networks (LAN). W. ND-BLAST provides intuitive Graphic User Interfaces (GUI) for BLAST database creation, BLAST execution, BLAST output evaluation and BLAST result exportation. This software also provides several layers of fault tolerance and fault recovery to prevent loss of data if nodes or master machines fail. This paper lays out the functionality of W. ND-BLAST. W. ND-BLAST displays close to 100 % performance efficiency when distributing tasks to 12 remote computers of the same <b>performance</b> <b>class.</b> <b>A</b> high throughput BLAST job which took 662. 68 minutes (11 hours) on one average machine was completed in 44. 97 minutes when distributed to 17 nodes, which included lower performance class machines. Finally, there is a comprehensive high-throughput BLAST Output Viewer (BOV) and Annotation Engine components, which provides comprehensive exportation of BLAST hits to text files, annotated fasta files, tables, or association files. Conclusion W. ND-BLAST provides an interactive tool that allows scientists to easily utilizing their available computing resources for high throughput and comprehensive sequence analyses. The install package for W. ND-BLAST is freely downloadable from [URL]. With registration the software is free, installation, networking, and usage instructions are provided as well as a support forum. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between instrumental music and student achievement has been debated for decades. Many studies (mostly correlational research) suggest that music performance can impact {{student achievement and}} social environment. Much of the research has evaluated instrumental music performance and student achievement from a quantitative/statistical standpoint using student test scores and college admission records. This study investigated the underrepresented perspective of students {{in regards to the}} impact of instrumental performance on student achievement and social environment. The aim was to find out why students continue to enroll in instrumental <b>performance</b> <b>classes.</b> <b>A</b> survey was conducted with participants from four high school advanced music classes (156 students). From two of the surveyed classes, two small student groups were selected for interviews. The small groups were randomly selected from a group of students who had a minimum of five years of instrumental performance experience. The initial findings of the survey and interviews revealed that instrumental music performance is positively correlated with student achievement and social environment. More research is needed to explore student perspectives to account for student instrumental experience and/or gender. Public and private schools are recommended to invest heavily in their music programs, as music performance is a conduit for student achievement. Moreover, with the advances in technology and recent findings from studies in neuroscience, instrumental performance has been shown to have beneficial effects on the brain and neuro-functioning.

After the {{collapse}} of socialism, post-Soviet republics reorganized economics curricula, published new textbooks, and trained students and academics {{in their home countries}} or in the West.

The results of this study show that the number of international publications increased gradually. These publications usually concern regional issues and are published in low impact journals. The preference of Russian language journals implies that language is a barrier to publish in international journals.

40|$|The Service-Profit Chain (SPC) model (Heskett et al., 1994) {{has been}} the subject of much {{scrutiny}} over the past decade, having been explored in a range of different applications, contexts and variants. The SPC model is based on a series of cause-effect relationships, combining to drive service performance. Closely related constructs including internal service quality, employee satisfaction and productivity, customer value, customer satisfaction, and loyalty are viewed as inputs, and ultimately as determinants of service profitability. Research relating to the model has included a number of empirical examinations (e. g. Silvestro & Cross, 2000; Maritz & Neiman, 2008), and conceptual extensions (e. g. Kamakura et al., 2002; Pasupathy & Triantis, 2007). Theoretical and managerial gaps however still exist, specifically the consideration of service performance over time, the application of the SPC model as a basis for segmentation, the examination of alternate constructs, and the testing of the model in a retail automotive context. These gaps are addressed through this research. The aim of the study is to extend the SPC as a framework for segmenting organisations based on their service performance. The extended framework builds on an SPC conceptualisation by Kamakura et al. (2002) and considers objective and subjective inputs, including service quality, transactional value, customer satisfaction and customer retention. A Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach is used to analyse longitudinal data taken from automotive dealerships and a PLS – Finite Mixture model is used to identify latent (<b>performance)</b> <b>classes.</b> <b>A</b> series of hypotheses derived from the extended SPC are tested for each <b>class,</b> and <b>an</b> Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) is used to further examine the differences that exist. The findings of this research deepen the understanding of the relationships between service performance metrics and provide guidance for managers on how and where to allocate resources in order to improve service profitability...|$|R
