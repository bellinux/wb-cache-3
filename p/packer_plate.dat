50|$|The Pakamatic was {{introduced}} in 1959 and utilised an aluminium alloy body which was left un-painted. A single reciprocating <b>packer</b> <b>plate</b> compacted the refuse which was discharged by rearward tipping of the body. The design was by Fernand Rey and was produced under licence to Semat-Rey of France. The Pakamatic proved to be highly popular with customers. The 'N designation denotes a narrow bodied vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Might and Power {{made his}} debut {{late in his}} two-year-old season, and won his first race on 24 July 1996, at his third start. Spelled after one more start, he {{returned}} in the new year, and, once stepped up to 1,900 metres, won back-to-back restricted races at Canterbury. Up in grade, he finished second to the multiple Group One winner Intergaze in the Canterbury Guineas, seventh in the Rosehill Guineas, and was defeated by just over a length when fourth in the AJC Derby after suffering severe interference. Seven days later, as a short-priced favourite, he won the Frank <b>Packer</b> <b>Plate</b> by six lengths.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{forwards}} Jim a joke chain-email entitled [...] "Fifty Signs Your Priest Might Be Michael Jackson". Michael later {{compares the}} members of the office to the cast of Friends, saying that he is both Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani and Pam is Rachel Green. He claims that Dwight is Cosmo Kramer, failing to realize that he is a character in the sitcom Seinfeld and not Friends. Todd <b>Packer's</b> license <b>plate</b> reads [...] "WLHUNG", a reference to a large penis, but Ryan interprets it to mean he is a fan of singer William Hung. Darryl asks whether Michael got his pants at [...] "Queers R Us", a reference to Toys R Us. The episode is the first to feature what would become Michael's catchphrase: [...] "That's what she said." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lift-equipped {{trucks are}} {{referred}} to as automated side loaders, or ASL's. Similar to a front-end loader, the waste is compacted by an oscillating <b>packer</b> <b>plate</b> {{at the front of the}} loading hopper which forces the waste through an aperture into the main body and is therefore compacted towards the rear of the truck. [...] An Automated Side Loader only needs one operator, where a traditional rear load garbage truck may require two or three people, and has the additional advantage of reducing on the job injuries due to repetitive heavy lifting. Due to these advantages, ASL's have become more popular than traditional manual collection. Typically an Automated Side Loader uses standardized wheeled carts compatible with the truck's automated lift.|$|E
