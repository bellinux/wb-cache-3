5|$|In 2009, all twelve T2000 {{units were}} taken out of service, before {{the last of the}} much older T1300.

The initial orders for MX3000 trains did not call for sufficient numbers to replace the T2000. Kollektivtransportproduksjon has estimated the cost of renovating the units so they can run for 15 more years at NOK50 million. Alternatively, the city council has been recommended by Kollektivtransportproduksjon to purchase 15 new MX3000 three-car trains for NOK250 million.|$|E

Residents and guests could also offset travel-accumulated carbon emissions by computing their footprint and then <b>procuring</b> carbon credits at the specifically created Green Games Carbon Neutrality Kiosk. The World Anti-Doping Agency set up an anti-doping education hub {{in collaboration with the}} organisers.
