Its advantages include increased productivity, accuracy, long tool life, and a simple machine structure. For the <b>plunge</b> <b>shaving</b> method, the gear tooth modification only depends on the surface geometry of the <b>plunge</b> <b>shaving</b> cutter. The analytical description of the gear with tooth modifications is firstly constructed by B-spline surface fitting. Then, the grinding wheel profile is parameterized and optimized for minimizing the surface deviations of theoretical and ground (from re-sharpening machine) tooth surfaces of the <b>plunge</b> <b>shaving</b> cutter, in which the topographic error has been reduced. The cutting trace of <b>plunge</b> <b>shaving</b> cutter has also been analyzed so that the shaving efficiency can be improved. Index Terms—Gear <b>plunge</b> <b>shaving,</b> Cone grinding wheel, Topographic error, Shaving cutter serration. et al. [9] proposed a method for shaving gears with double crowning by CNC shaving machine. For shaving methods other than <b>plunge</b> <b>shaving,</b> the gear tooth modification is accomplished by tooth modifications of the shaving cutter and the coordinated motions between cutter and gear. For the <b>plunge</b> <b>shaving</b> method, however, it only depends on the surface geometry of the <b>plunge</b> <b>shaving</b> cutter. Focusing on the surface geometry of shaving cutter, what’s really significant is precision of the region between SAP. (start of active profile) and EAP. (end of active profile) as shown in Fig. 1. In gear shaving, SAP. of cutter tooth shaves the gear tooth tip while EAP. shaves the gear tooth root. Traditionally, the cutter surface geometry results from a cutter re-sharpening machine by trial and error, which is very time-consuming. I...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of 2000, Lucent's [...] "private bubble" [...] burst, while {{competitors}} like Nortel Networks and Alcatel were still going strong; it would be many months {{before the rest of}} the telecom industry bubble collapsed. Previously Lucent had 14 straight quarters where it exceeded analysts' expectations, leading to high expectations for the 15th quarter, ending Dec. 31, 1999. On January 6, 2000, Lucent made the first of a string of announcements that it had missed its quarterly estimates, as CEO Rich McGinn grimly announced that Lucent had run into special problems during that quarter—including disruptions in its optical networking business—and reported flat revenues and a big drop in profits. That caused the stock to <b>plunge</b> by 28%, <b>shaving</b> $64 billion off of the company's market capitalization. When it was later revealed that it had used dubious accounting and sales practices to generate some of its earlier quarterly numbers, Lucent fell from grace. It was said that [...] "Rich McGinn couldn't accept Lucent's fall from its early triumphs." [...] He described himself once as imposing [...] "audacious" [...] goals on his managers, believing the stretch for performance would produce dream results. Henry Schacht defended the corporate culture that McGinn created and also noted that McGinn did not sell any Lucent shares while serving as CEO. [...] In November 2000, the company disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had a $125 million accounting error for the third quarter of 2000, and by December 2000 it reported it had overstated its revenues for its latest quarter by nearly $700 million. Although no wrongdoing was found on his part, McGinn was forced to resign as CEO and he was replaced by Schacht on an interim basis. Subsequently, its CFO, Deborah Hopkins, left the company in May 2001 with Lucent's stock at $9.06 whereas at the time she was hired it was at $46.82.|$|R
