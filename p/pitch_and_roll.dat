5|$|In 1735 Harrison {{built his}} first chronometer, which he {{steadily}} improved {{on over the}} next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, {{including the use of}} bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{control was}} entirely through a single side-mounted control stick. <b>Pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw {{could be controlled}} by twisting the stick. No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|E
5|$|The 767 was {{the first}} Boeing {{wide-body}} to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced {{the role of the}} flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in control design, flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>roll,</b> and the control yoke has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.|$|E

50|$|The sight {{was easy}} to align because the horizon and the star seem to move {{together}} as the ship <b>pitched</b> <b>and</b> <b>rolled.</b> This also created {{a situation where the}} error in observation was less dependent on the observer, as he could directly see both objects at once.|$|R

60|$|All {{afternoon}} the Dazzler <b>pitched</b> <b>and</b> <b>rolled</b> at her anchorage, and as evening {{drew on the}} wind deceitfully eased down.

25|$|These {{are three}} angles, {{also known as}} yaw, <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>roll,</b> Navigation angles and Cardan angles.

50|$|The charts, unlike {{traditional}} maps, {{were studied}} and memorized {{prior to a}} voyage and were not consulted during a trip, as compared to traditional navigation techniques where consultation of a map is frequent and points and courses are plotted out both before and during navigation.

25|$|Number of axes – two axes are {{required}} to reach any point in a plane; three axes {{are required}} to reach any point in space. To fully control {{the orientation of the}} end of the arm(i.e. the wrist) three more axes (yaw, <b>pitch,</b> <b>and</b> <b>roll)</b> are required.

25|$|In moths, their {{antennae}} {{are known}} to be responsible for the sensing of Coriolis forces in the similar manner as with the halteres in flies. In both flies and moths, a collection of mechanosensors {{at the base of the}} appendage are sensitive to deviations at the beat frequency, correlating to rotation in the <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> planes, and at twice the beat frequency, correlating to rotation in the yaw plane.|$|E
25|$|Several {{people on}} the ground {{witnessed}} the final moments of flight 240. The consensus of their evidence was that the stricken plane was lower than usual compared with other aircraft approaching East Midlands, and that it was losing altitude as well as oscillating in both <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>roll.</b> As it regained level attitude, both wings folded up almost simultaneously and became detached from the fuselage, along with other parts of the structure.|$|E

Tests were made at free stream Mach numbers of 0. 3, 0. 4, and 0. 7 and for angles of attack from about - 4 deg to 20 deg. The effects of various components such as the canard, nose strakes, wings, vertical tail, and horizontal tail were determined. The basic canard wing, vertical tail configurations generally had positive damping in <b>pitch,</b> yaw, <b>and</b> <b>roll.</b> The effect of the canard was generally beneficial except for its tendency to decrease the oscillatory directional stability...|$|R

25|$|There {{are three}} primary flight controls: control stick, rudder pedals, and throttle. Typically, the control stick is termed the cyclic and tilts the rotor in the desired {{direction}} to provide <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> control (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor {{relative to the}} airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The rudder pedals provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.|$|E
25|$|For an aircraft, {{they can}} be {{obtained}} with three rotations around its principal axes if done in the proper order. A yaw will obtain the bearing, a pitch will yield the elevation and a roll gives the bank angle. Therefore, in aerospace they are sometimes called yaw, <b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>roll.</b> Notice that this will not work if the rotations are applied in any other order or if the airplane axes start in any position non-equivalent to the reference frame.|$|E
25|$|Gun {{fire control}} systems require {{corrections}} to gun-order angles (bearing and elevation) {{to compensate for}} deck tilt (<b>pitch</b> <b>and</b> <b>roll).</b> In traditional systems, a stabilizing gyroscope with a vertical spin axis corrects for deck tilt, and stabilizes the optical sights and radar antenna. However, gun barrels point in a direction different from the line of sight to the target, to anticipate target movement {{and fall of the}} projectile due to gravity, among other factors. Gun mounts roll and pitch with the deck plane, but also require stabilization. Gun orders include angles computed from the vertical gyro data, and those computations involve Euler angles.|$|E
40|$|A FORTRAN IV coded {{computer}} program is presented for post-flight {{analysis of a}} missile's control surface response. It includes preprocessing of digitized telemetry data for time lags, biases, non-linear calibration changes and filtering. Measurements include autopilot attitude rate and displacement gyro output and four control surface deflections. Simple first order lags are assumed for the <b>pitch,</b> yaw <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> axes of control. Each actuator is also assumed to be represented by a first order lag. Mixing of <b>pitch,</b> yaw <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> commands to four control surfaces is assumed. A pseudo-inverse technique is used to obtain the <b>pitch,</b> yaw <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> components from the four measured deflections. This program {{has been used for}} over 10 years on the NASA/SCOUT launch vehicle for post-flight analysis and was helpful in detecting incipient actuator stall due to excessive hinge moments. The program is currently set up for a CDC CYBER 175 computer system. It requires 34 K words of memory and contains 675 cards.

30|$|One motor-primitive {{generation}} {{approach is}} based on a graph [5 – 8]. Graph-based motor primitives have flexibility in dynamic environments because they consider the state of the environment while executing the motor primitives. A method that generates UAV motor primitives using demonstration-based learning [9] is suggested. The process of generating motor primitives is divided into three stages: Operation collection stage, time adjustment stage, and motor-primitive generation stage. The motor primitives, based on measured yaw, <b>pitches</b> <b>and</b> <b>rolls,</b> are divided into sub-motor primitives considering pinpoints, where pinpoints are predefined spots where the UAV should arrive.|$|R
