40|$|ABSTRACT The {{scarcity}} of field data to develop soil maps through a <b>pedological</b> <b>survey</b> {{is one of}} the main limitations to using distributed hydrological models, especially in small and medium-sized watersheds. The aim of this study was to compare a distributed hydrological model prediction to a soil map based on a <b>pedological</b> <b>survey</b> and a moisture zone map obtained using the Height Above the Nearest Drainage - HAND model. The Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model - DHSVM, which is a physically-based and distributed hydrological model, was applied to a mountainous watershed, located in the region of the Mantiqueira Range in the south of Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil, and was compared to both maps mentioned above, taking the soil map developed by the <b>pedological</b> <b>survey</b> as a reference. Daily weather and streamflow data-sets were used for DHSVM calibration and validation using the two different maps (soil and moisture zone maps) as inputs. In both simulations, the DHSVM performed well, with outputs indicating a good relationship between topographical and hydrological characteristics from the two types of maps. Thus, the moisture zone map obtained by the HAND model can also be successfully used in distributed hydrological modeling, especially for mountainous regions in southeastern Brazil...|$|E

The study area is located in a semi-natural deciduous forest on marl in Luxembourg, with a strong texture contrast in the soil at 15 - 25 cm depth (luvic planosols). The methodology applied is both based on hydrological and geomorphological field measurements on runoff, sediment yield, perched water table dynamics, geomorphological survey, <b>pedological</b> <b>survey</b> and measurements related to in situ ectorganic horizon dynamics and litter decay, soil animal activity, as well as measurements of dynamic soil properties such as soil moisture and swelling and shrinkage. The results show that there is a positive feedback between tree type, soil fauna activity and the development of pipes, partial areas, soils and geomorphology. The landscape can be divided into two main types: Areas where Stellario-Carpinetum vegetation and partial areas are common and areas with Milio-Fagetum vegetation on dry slopes, which are differentiating more and more over time as a result of ongoing geo-ecosystem processes, and which also reflected in their sediment yield. The hydrological response is highly different for both landscape compartments as they are dominated by matrix (Beech) and pipe flow (Hornbeam) respectively. Soil fauna and tree type drive both soil and geomorphological evolution and they both can be considered as important ecosystem engineers...|$|E

The digital soil mapping arises in the context of improved the <b>pedological</b> <b>surveys</b> products through the use of GIS tools, knowledge of the genesis, morphology, and classification of soils, for selection appropriate attributes to represent reality, and produce a soil survey with accuracy and efficiency (cost x time). The approach used in digital soil mapping is based on the classical concepts of soil genesis and relations with terrain attributes. The objective was evaluating the effects of using remote sensing data in digital soil mapping of the river basin Guapi-Macacu (RJ). Were analyzed five different sets of attributes, in order to assess the contribution of three indices derived from remote sensing, in the performance of the classification by neural networks. They are: (i) all variables, (ii) all except clay minerals, (iii) all except iron oxide, (iv) all except NDVI, (v) all except the three indices. Image processing was performed with ERDAS and other attributes in ArcGIS v. 10. The analyzes showed statistical differences between classifiers, highlighting the contribution of data derived from remote sensing. The criteria used in the evaluation (statistical indexes and concordance with the control points) indicate the set (iv) as the most suitable to represent the soil map of the area, although better performance of statistical indices has been obtained by the set (i).

40|$|ABSTRACT Digital {{soil mapping}} is an {{alternative}} for the recognition of soil classes in areas where <b>pedological</b> <b>surveys</b> are not available. The main {{aim of this study}} was to obtain a digital soil map using artificial neural networks (ANN) and environmental variables that express soil-landscape relationships. This study was carried out in an area of 11, 072 ha located in the Barra Bonita municipality, state of São Paulo, Brazil. A soil survey was obtained from a reference area of approximately 500 ha located in the center of the area studied. With the mapping units identified together with the environmental variables elevation, slope, slope plan, slope profile, convergence index, geology and geomorphic surfaces, a supervised classification by ANN was implemented. The neural network simulator used was the Java NNS with the learning algorithm "back propagation. " Reference points were collected for evaluating the performance of the digital map produced. The occurrence of soils in the landscape obtained in the reference area was observed in the following digital classification: medium-textured soils at the highest positions of the landscape, originating from sandstone, and clayey loam soils in the end thirds of the hillsides due to the greater presence of basalt. The variables elevation and slope were the most important factors for discriminating soil class through the ANN. An accuracy level of 82 % between the reference points and the digital classification was observed. The methodology proposed allowed for a preliminary soil classification of an area not previously mapped using mapping units obtained in a reference area...|$|R
40|$|The Valpolicella area (Veneto Region, Italy) {{is famous}} for its high quality wines: Amarone and Recioto, both {{obtained}} from partial post-harvest dehydrated red grapes. The main cultivars used for these wines are Corvina and Corvinone. In this region hundreds of years ago a particular wine making process was developed to dehydrate the grape after the harvest. The aim of this innovative work was to study how the environmental factors affected the post-harvest dehydration process. Different vocation units were defined from a <b>pedological</b> <b>survey</b> using landscape genesis. Afterwards Corvina and Corvinone vineyards, trained with simple Guyot, were selected and observed for a three year period (2009 - 2011). New parameters correlated to grape dehydration rate were evaluated: quantity of epicutiuolar wax (Ew), skin thickness (ThS), bunch density (BD) and berry surface to volume ratio (S/V). The results showed a variation of these parameters depending on the environmental variability, mainly due to pedological soil characteristics (texture, depth, soil water availability), site-altitude and exposure. The Ew, BD and S/V showed a good correlation with the kinetic of post-harvest weight loss, so the evaluation of these parameters {{can be used as a}} prediction model. This new information is useful for winemakers so they can separate the grapes depending on the growing area to reach an optimum post-harvest weight loss (from 35...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} primary flow paths involved in the chlordecone (CLD) river contamination and quantify the CLD fluxes to assess CLD pollution levels and duration according to a typical catchment of the banana cropping area in the French Indies (Guadeloupe) : the Pérou Catchment (12 km 2) characterized by heavy rainfall (5686 mm year− 1). Three sub-catchments (SC 1, SC 2 and SC 3) were studied during the hydrological year 2009 – 2010 : a <b>pedological</b> <b>survey</b> combined with a spatialized hydrochemical approach was conducted. The average soil concentration is higher in the Pérou Catchment (3400 μg kg− 1) than in the entire banana cropping area in Guadeloupe (2100 μg kg− 1). The results showed that CLD stocks in soils vary largely among soil types and farming systems: the weakest stocks are located upstream in SC 1 (5 kg ha− 1), where a majority of the area is non-cultivated; medium stocks are located in Nitisols downstream in SC 3 (9 kg ha− 1); and the greatest stocks are observed in SC 2 on Andosols (12 kg ha− 1) characterized by large farms. The annual water balance and the hydro-chemical analysis revealed that the three sub-catchments exhibited different behaviors. Pérou River contamination was high during low flows, which highlighted that contamination primarily originated from groundwater contributions. The results showed that only a small part of the catchment (SC 2), contributing little to the water flow, comprises a major CLD contribution, which is in agreement with the highly contaminated andosol soils observed there. Another significant result considers that at least 50 years would be required to export the totality of the actual CLD soil stocks retained in the topsoil layer. The actual time for soil remediation will however be much longer considering (i) the necessary time for the chlordecone to percolate and be stored in the shallow aquifers and (ii) its travel time to reach the river.

40|$|International audiencePurpose Conventional <b>pedological</b> <b>survey</b> {{generally}} assesses soil metal pollution {{by comparing}} total metal concentrations in soil to geochemical baselines in parent rock. This global approach overlooks the sorption capacities of the clay minerals which form at micrometric scale in weathering microsystems and {{are essential for}} the behaviour of metals in soil. Therefore, {{our aim was to}} investigate the impact of these weathering microsystems and their clay mineralogy upon Zn sorption and distribution throughout a sludge-contaminated soil. Materials and methods Two soil profiles with the same diorite parent-rock were sampled: (i) an amended soil profile (AS) that received for ten years wet sewage sludges heavily loaded with Zn and (ii) a control soil profile (CS) free of sludge spreading. Soil samples were 2 carefully collected as undisturbed blocks using plastic core samplers to prevent sample metal contamination. Each sample was further divided into two subsamples: the first was devoted to bulk chemical analyses, mineral grains separation and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, whereas the second part was used for thin sections preparation and electron probe microanalyses (EPMA). Results and discussion Zn in the control soil is inherited from the weathering parent-rock and its concentration is always lower than in the amended soil where Zn is supplied at the surface by sludge. Each rock-forming mineral weathers into specific clay minerals: amphibole into saponite and montmorillonite and plagioclase into montmorillonite and kaolinite. Each clay mineral, with its specific sorption capacity, controls the Zn distribution within the soil: the smectites produced by the amphiboles have high sorption capacity and favor Zn retention in the upper horizons of the soil; the kaolinites produced by the plagioclases have lower sorption capacity, do not retain Zn in the surface horizons, and allow it to migrate to deeper horizons where it is sorbed onto the montmorillonites. Conclusions The clay minerals appear to be important soil components controlling the mobility of Zn in the contaminated soils. The micrometric mineralogical approach proves to be relevant to describe the importance of the clay mineral species in the Zn fixation at the solid/solution interface. When applied to a wider range of heavy metals and clay minerals, it could be a useful improvement in the surface complexation modeling used to explain metal cation sorption in soils...|$|E

Sovice hill represents a very important location from the point of view of prehistoric or early medieval settlement dynamics in the given landscape unit. This fact became the main incentive for the implementation of research activities on the hilltop platform. The archaeological research was drawn up in a way that it was possible to use the combination of different methods of field survey and investigation, whereas great emphasis was placed especially on non-destructive methods (geodetic/topographic survey connected with levelling, surface collection of analytical nature, geophysical measurement – magnetometry, <b>pedological</b> probing, total <b>survey</b> with the help of metal detectors without any discrimination). Within the framework of small-scale test excavation, four test pits were dug in different places of the hilltop platform or at its foot, with a total area of 12 m 2. The archaeological investigation of the hilltop platform produced important findings confirming the presence of several chronological components, which had been identified here by earlier surface surveys. This pertains especially to the Aeneolithic, Hallstatt, Late Bronze Age or the Hillfort Period. For the first time, the investigation on the hilltop platform also confirmed the activities of the people of the Únětice culture. Typical settlements of this culture in the northern half of Bohemia were the upper parts of hills close to water courses, whereas a number of these settlements are situated in places, which had been used in earlier periods. The hilltop Únětice settlement on Sovice fulfils both criteria. Its linkage to a longdistance route was particularly important, which is here represented by the Elbe River (approx. 1 km distant). Thanks to its advantageous location, the inhabitants of this hilltop settlement could participate in all activities the river was used for at that time. This assumption does naturally not apply to the Únětice settlement on the site only, but can be related to the use of this location in all recorded periods. In the Middle Hillfort Period, there was a hilltop settlement on Sovice, which could have included also the adjacent southwest or northwest slopes of the hill. Whether the upper platform was fenced off or divided in a different way, is not proved yet. However, the investigation produced certain findings, on the basis of which we can hypothetically speculate about the relation of a wall-like body with a parallel ditch, located on the hilltop platform, to the Middle Hillfort Period settlement on this site. The final interpretation and dating of this terrain feature will however be done within the framework of a detailed evaluation of the whole situation, which will be part of a summary study, currently under preparation.

40|$|The final {{conclusions}} of a multidisciplinary study of Earth and Soil Sciences, {{carried out in}} the frame of Prin 2007 are presented. The study has dealt with a variety of natural materials, encompassing soils, waters, atmospheric depositions, the vegetation and the bottom sediments of a coastal lagoon, in the territory north of Ravenna, characterized by important agricultural and industrial activities. In particular, by chemical and isotopic methodologies and <b>pedological</b> <b>survey,</b> it has been studied the ecosystem of the San Vitale Pinewood and the Lagoon of Pialassa Baiona, both constituting the southernmost part of the Po river delta Park. The results obtained have shown that the Pinewood is affected by major salinization processes induced by local subsidence and concerning underground water and soils. This jeopardizes the vegetation's health, in particular, the pine trees that are the main characteristic species. Moreover, the proximity of the industrial zone of Ravenna to the Pinewood represents another threat to the environment, as it is a major pollution source by release of particulate matter with stacks. Therefore, potentially toxic elements may fallout onto the soils, waters and vegetation of the Pinewood, arising general concern on the preservation of the forest. The important traffic rolling on the road net contouring the Pinewood-Lagoon ecosystem is a further source of pollution, as indicated by the incoming diffusion of PGE on the topsoils bordering the roads. Lastly, the study of the bottom deposits of the Lagoon at the water-sediment interface has unveiled the diffuse presence of Hg with significant concentrations, derived from industrial wastewaters unloaded in the basin some decades ago. Luckily, Hg occurs in the element form and, thus, its mobility is very reduced, keeping so far the risk factor in the Lagoon low. As a whole, the Pinewood-Lagoon ecosystem is ailing due to incoming salinization processes and, subordinately, moderate pollution proceeding from the industrial zone and the traffic. Therefore, it is recommended to implement a monitoring survey of the study area on the ground of the parameters used in this research. In fact, {{they have been able to}} provide the local Administrations with punctual responses to the problem of degradation of the Pinewood-Lagoon ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} study, involving geologists, chemists and pedologists, started {{aiming at}} identifying a “Geo- Pedo-Fingerprint” (GPF) univocally linking the wine to its origin, namely, the Piedirosso vineyards {{growing in the}} Campi Flegrei volcanic area. The focal point {{of this research was}} the characterization of the whole parent material–soil–vineyard–wine system, achieved by correlating the elemental pattern – with special reference to micro-nutrients and Rare Earth Elements (REEs) – and Sr isotopic ratios, to identify a reliable and convenient ‘GPF‘, as a guaranteed indicator of wine provenance. A representative soil/Piedirosso vineyard system was identified and characterized. Samples from each soil horizon as well as from vine branches, leaves, grapes and wine were collected and analyzed. All samples were analyzed by multi-collector inductively coupled mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) to determine their 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic composition, by ICP-Quadrupole MS to measure multielemental composition including REE, and by X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) for the quantitative evaluation of the mineral phases occurring in soil samples. Statistical analysis (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, Factor Analysis) revealed the existence of separate correlations of element distribution between: i) soil, as nutrient pool source, and vegetative compartments, i. e. branches and leaves, as biochemical yards for nutrient elaboration and marshaling, ii) vegetative compartments and the productive compartment, i. e. grapes as the metabolic outcome of the vine, and, iii) the productive compartment and its artifact produced by man, i. e. wine. However, no sequential correlation of elements from soil to wine did appear, likely because clusters of elements were discriminated due to the varying take up and fractionation processes in plants, as well as during vinification processes. Therefore, none of the investigated elements was a liable ‘GPF’ as a candidate tracer from soil to wine. In contrast, the use of a petrogenetic tracer such as 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic composition provided satisfactory responses. In fact, the values of such a ratio within the entire studied chain vary in a very small range from 0. 7076 to 0. 7084, thus falling within the typical range for volcanites of Campi Flegrei (0. 7065 – 0. 7086). These results currently represent the only study focusing on a geotracer, such as the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratio, linked with a <b>pedological</b> <b>survey</b> to identify the volcanic Campanian wine-producing chains from soil parent material-to-wine...|$|E
