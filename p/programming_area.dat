50|$|The new decade {{began with}} a new {{franchise}} round for the islands in which Channel was unopposed. However, {{there was to be}} a change of franchise in the South West of England with Westward being replaced by Television South West (TSW), requiring a new agreement with TSW. However, in 1986 Channel changed who they sourced their network feed from, instead changing to Television South (TVS) who served the South and South East of England from Southampton. An unexpected side-effect of this change was a disruption to serials airing on the station in the afternoon due to the serial having begun on TVS at a different time to TSW so that they were at a different point through the serial's run. For instance, Channel had to miss 172 episodes of The Young Doctors, the first nine episodes of Prisoner Cell Block H which had been screened on TVS in 1985, and it had to re-show 83 episodes of Sons and Daughters as TVS was behind TSW. The new TVS feed also meant that Channel simulcast their night time schedule following the launch of this <b>programming</b> <b>area</b> in 1988. As a result, Channel's night time schedule from that point onwards always simulcast the service seen on TVS and on their successor Meridian.|$|E

Five summer {{programs}} are offered each session: one-week youth camp (ages 7-11), youth camp (ages 7-12), senior camp (ages 13-15), leaders-in-training or LIT (ages 15-16), and counsellors-in-training or CIT (ages 16-17). Campers are placed into cabins {{of the same}} age group, each cabin maintaining a 5:1 camper-staff ratio, usually with 10 campers and two staff. Every cabin participates in an out trip, the length of which is based on their age group. One-week youth campers go on an overnight trip conducted on site, youth campers go on an overnight trip on one of the islands on Eagle Lake, while senior campers, LITs, and CITs go on out trip for multiple nights, conducted in Frontenac Provincial Park or Algonquin Provincial Park.Campers may choose their activities, participate in core <b>programming</b> <b>area</b> activities, and participate in camp wide games. There are seven core programming areas: Swimming, Boating, Adventure, Nature, Arts and Crafts, Campcraft, and Music. Each camper may choose two program areas, which they attend every day.
