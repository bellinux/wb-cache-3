The early actions have been credited with <b>preparing</b> <b>the</b> gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E

Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter <b>preparing</b> <b>the</b> dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.|$|E

In early October 1945, Sinnock submitted models to Assistant Director of the Mint F. Leland Howard (then acting as director), who transmitted them to the Commission of Fine Arts. This commission reviews coin designs because it was tasked by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks.|$|E
