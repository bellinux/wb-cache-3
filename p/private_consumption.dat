Major findings of this paper are as follows. First, estimates of the costs, GDP and welfare costs as well as abatement cost, of the GHG abatement target differ substantially by two things: (1) assumption on carbon reductions in other countries (the reduction only in Korea or commitments with Annex I countries), (2) assumption on international emission trading. Second, governmental policy to set sectoral abatement target would increase the costs than otherwise in spite of the same level of the carbon reduction.

40|$|We study a {{model of}} {{efficient}} risk sharing between two agents, A and B, who enjoy a non-durable common good. Only agent B can provide the common good whereas agent A can merely contribute indirectly by making transfers to the provider, agent B. We consider self-enforcing equilibria {{in the absence of}} commitment. We characterize the Pareto frontier of the subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs. The main results are: First, the consumption of the public good is significantly more stable than are the <b>private</b> <b>consumptions.</b> Second, in the absence of aggregate uncertainty, agents' consumptions are invariant to distribution of income in most cases. In the remaining cases, <b>private</b> <b>consumptions</b> and continuation values covary positively with respective incomes. Third, if some first best allocation is sustainable, the long-term equilibrium converges to the first best allocation. Otherwise, agents' utilities oscillate over a finite set of values. We find that an increase in the provider's deviation lifetime utility shifts the frontier of the set of subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs to exclude the lowest values of the provider (hence the highest values of the other). A decrease in the provider's deviation lifetime utility shifts the frontier of the set to include lower values for the provider (hence higher values for the other) mutual insurance, lack of commitment, optimal dynamic contract, public good...|$|R

Its economy faced a downturn in 2009 due to a heavy reliance on exports which in turn made it vulnerable to world markets. Unemployment reached levels not seen since 2003, and the economy fell 8.36% {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2008. In response, the government launched a US$5.6 billion economic stimulus package (3% of its GDP), provided financial incentives for businesses, and introduced tax breaks. The stimulus package focused on infrastructure development, small and medium-sized businesses, tax breaks for new investments, and low-income households. Boosting shipments to new overseas markets, such as Russia, Brazil, and the Middle East was also a main goal of the stimulus. The economy has since slowly recovered; by November 2010, Taiwan's unemployment rate had fallen to a two-year low of 4.73%, and continued dropping to a 40-month low of 4.18% by the end of 2011. The average salary has also been rising steadily for each month in 2010, up 1.92% from the same period in 2009. Industrial output for November 2010 reached another high, up 19.37% from a year earlier, indicating strong exports and a growing local economy. <b>Private</b> <b>consumption</b> is also increasing, with retail sales up 6.4% compared to 2009.

While national urbanization levels are not a good indicator of urban transport demand, there is an established negative relationship between urban density and such demand. This paper uses a consistent, well-known population-based framework (the STIRPAT model) and three separate, but highly related, datasets of cities from developed and developing countries (with observations from 1990, 1995, and 2001) {{to examine the relationship}} among <b>private</b> transport energy <b>consumption,</b> population, income, urban density, and several variables (e. g., network size and prices) that describe the nature of the public and private transport systems of those cities. The paper confirms the now well-established result that urban density is negatively correlated with urban <b>private</b> transport energy <b>consumption.</b> In terms of policies, improving private vehicle fuel efficiency, in particular, and increasing fuel price as well as other ownership/operating costs for private transport could have a substantial impact on lowering transport energy consumption. On the other hand, {{there is no evidence that}} further lowering the cost to riders of public transport would lower <b>private</b> transport energy <b>consumption.</b> For cities in developing countries, demographic variables (population size and urban density) are particularly important in determining <b>private</b> transport energy <b>consumption.</b> Also, <b>private</b> transport energy <b>consumption</b> is considerably less price sensitive in those developing country cities compared to cities in the most developed countries. ...|$|R
