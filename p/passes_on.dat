5|$|Despite winning 2 Super Bowl {{championships in}} 5 years, the 2012 (9-7), 2013 (7-9), and 2014 (6-10) seasons saw the Giants missing the playoffs 3 {{years in a}} row. A bright spot of the 2014 season was rookie Odell Beckham Jr., who burst onto the scene {{catching}} 91 <b>passes</b>	<b>on</b> 132 targets, for 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns, {{and in doing so}} winning Offensive Rookie of the Year.|$|E

5|$|The Blonde Bear {{was one of}} the world's {{greatest}} football players, {{who never}} missed an open field block.

5|$|Edward {{wakes up}} but, {{unable to speak}} much, asks Will to narrate how his life ends. Though struggling, Will tells his father of their {{imagined}} daring escape from the hospital to the nearby lake, where everyone from Edward’s past is there to see him off. Will takes Edward into the river, where he transforms into the giant catfish and swims away. A satisfied Edward dies, knowing Will finally understands his love for storytelling. At the funeral, Will and Joséphine are surprised when all the people from Edward’s stories come to the service, though each one is a slightly less fantastical version than described. Will, finally understanding his father’s love for life, <b>passes</b> <b>on</b> Edward’s stories to his own son.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, Governor Dannel Malloy {{announced}} that 5 weekend round trips would {{be extended to}} New London beginning in April 2013. However, the extension was dependent on ongoing negotiations with the marine industry over mandated closings of the Old Saybrook – Old Lyme bridge. Two weekday midday trips were added in May 2013, while weekend service began on June 1, 2013, after the application for additional bridge closings {{was approved by the}} state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Because Shore Line East service to New London is limited, Amtrak honors monthly Shore Line East <b>passes</b> <b>on</b> select intercity trains between New London and New Haven.|$|E
5|$|In Super Bowl XXXI, Favre {{completed}} 14-of-27 {{passes for}} 246yards and two touchdown <b>passes.</b> <b>On</b> the second {{play of the}} game, Favre called an audible and threw a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Andre Rison. In addition, Favre completed an 81-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Antonio Freeman {{in the second quarter}} (then a Super Bowl record for longest touchdown catch). Favre rushed for 12yards and another touchdown, as the Packers won Super Bowl XXXI over the New England Patriots, 35–21. In their 19 games of the season, the Packers had a turnover ratio of plus 24, and outscored their opponents 100–48 in the playoffs. Favre became the first and only quarterback to score three touchdowns in the Super Bowl and fail to win MVP honors.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} year in the league, Kolb was {{promoted}} to second-string quarterback ahead of A. J. Feeley. He played the entire {{second half of the}} Eagles game against the Baltimore Ravens on November 23 after an infamous benching of McNabb. Kolb threw an interception in the endzone to Ed Reed, who took it back 108yards for a touchdown, an NFL record. Kolb completed only 17 <b>passes</b> <b>on</b> 34 attempts for 144yards, throwing no touchdowns and four interceptions during the season.|$|E
5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material <b>passes</b> <b>on</b> through the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee had {{one final}} {{opportunity}} to score after receiving Virginia Tech's kickoff with 2:38 remaining. Jonathan Crompton threw several passes downfield, completing throws of 9, 9, 8, and 26 yards, advancing the Volunteers {{toward the end}} zone. Inside the Virginia Tech red zone, however, the Volunteers found less success. They committed a false start penalty, advanced the ball with a five-yard run, then Crompton threw two incomplete <b>passes.</b> <b>On</b> fourth down, Crompton was sacked for a 14-yard loss, the Volunteers' final play of the game. Virginia Tech knelt on the ball to run the final seconds off the clock and clinch the 37-14 victory.|$|E

50|$|In genetics, genomic {{imprinting}} or other patterns of inheritance {{that are not}} determined by DNA sequence alone can form an epigenetic memory that is <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> to subsequent generations through meiosis.

Both processes include similar epigenetic mechanisms, e.g. involving histones and methylation patterns.|$|R

5|$|The 1999 season {{featured}} many strong individual {{performances by}} the Giants, especially on offense. Receiver Amani Toomer had a breakout season, accumulating over 1100yards receiving and six touchdowns. Fellow receiver Ike Hilliard {{also had a}} solid season, finishing just shy of 1000yards receiving on the year. Tight end Pete Mitchell contributed 58 receptions, and Tiki Barber emerged as a premiere pass-catching running back, catching 66 <b>passes</b> <b>on</b> the year. The defense was also solid, ranking 11th {{in the league and}} sending Armstead and Strahan to the Pro Bowl again. Though the Giants stood at 7–6 after 13 games, they lost their final three games of the season to miss the playoffs for the second consecutive season.|$|E
5|$|The {{capitulation}} of Italy {{also brought}} with it the real threat of an invasion by the Allies of the Dalmatian coast. As a result, on 9 September, orders were received by 1./(Kroat.)KG to execute two coastal reconnaissance sorties over the central and south Adriatic each morning and afternoon. On 10 October one of its Dornier Do 17Zs was intercepted by eight Spitfire Mk.VIII fighters of No. 92 Squadron RAF near the coast of Italy. All of the fighters made firing <b>passes</b> <b>on</b> the Dornier, which was shot down, the crew bailing out. One Spitfire was hit by return fire and crashed into the sea, killing its pilot. After this, reconnaissance sorties were confined to {{the vicinity of the}} Dalmatian coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{less common}} tigon is {{a cross between}} a lioness and a male tiger. Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness <b>passes</b> <b>on</b> a growth {{inhibiting}} gene, tigons are often relatively small, only weighing up to 150kg (350lb), which is about 10–20% smaller than lions. Like ligers, they have physical and behavioural traits from both parental species, and males are sterile. Females are sometimes fertile and have occasionally given birth to litigons when mated to a lion.|$|E

5|$|The liger is a {{cross between}} a male lion and a tigress. Because the lion sire <b>passes</b> <b>on</b> a growth-promoting gene, but the {{corresponding}} growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers are often fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but, even if they do, their manes will be only around half the size of that of a pure lion. Ligers are typically between 10 and 12feet in length, and can weigh between 800 and 1,000pounds or more.|$|E

Peter <b>passes</b> <b>on</b> joining him as he feels it will reveal his abilities. When he hears Flash Thompson planning on specifically going after Harry during tryouts, he decides to keep him safe and try out anyway. They each do good at tryout - Harry impresses the coach and the other player, while Peter does the same using his extra abilities.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play after the turnover, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 16-yard pass to Cornelius White, who picked up a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. Texas then committed a five-yard offsides penalty before Oxendine ran forward for four yards. On the next play, Oxendine fumbled the ball after {{being hit by a}} Texas defender. The loose ball was picked up by a Texas defender, who returned it to the 50-yard line. Brown threw two incomplete passes, then Tech committed a five-yard penalty. On third down, Brown completed a 21-yard pass to Davis, who gained a first down at the Tech 24-yard line. After the long gain, Brown threw two more incomplete <b>passes.</b> <b>On</b> third down, Brown threw another interception to Gray, who returned the ball to the Tech 31-yard line and allowed the Hokies' offense to return to the field with 7:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
