25|$|Like pulsars, {{some other}} types of <b>pulsating</b> <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> are regular enough that radial {{velocity}} could be determined purely photometrically from the Doppler shift of the pulsation frequency, without needing spectroscopy. This method is not as sensitive as the pulsar timing variation method, due to the periodic activity being longer and less regular. The ease of detecting planets around a <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> depends on the pulsation period of the star, the regularity of pulsations, {{the mass of the}} planet, and its distance from the host star.|$|R

5|$|Many main {{sequence}} stars of spectral type A {{fall into a}} region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram called the instability strip, which is occupied by <b>pulsating</b> <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> In 2003, photometric monitoring of the star revealed variations in brightness of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 minutes. As a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.|$|R
50|$|IRAS 08544-4431 is {{classified}} as an RV Tauri star, a type of <b>pulsating</b> <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> which shows cycles with alternating shallow and deep minima. In addition, IRAS 08544-4431 shows slow variations in amplitude from cycle to cycle over approximately 1,600 days, a defining characteristic of a type b RV Tauri variable. The maximum amplitude is only 0.18 magnitudes. It was given the variable star designation of V390 Velorum in 2006.|$|E
50|$|S Cassiopeiae is a {{variable}} Mira, a <b>pulsating</b> <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> whose visual brightness varies over several magnitudes with a somewhat regular period and amplitude. Its visual magnitude varies between +7.9 and +16.1 over an average period of 612.43 days.

Its variability was first noted in 1961 by Russian astronomer Nikolaĭ Efimovich Kurochkin, who gave it the variable star designation BL Boötis. However, he thought it was an eclipsing binary.

50|$|Depending on {{the type}} of {{pulsation}} and its location within the star, there is a natural or fundamental frequency which determines the period of the star. Stars may also pulsate in a harmonic or overtone which is a higher frequency, corresponding to a shorter period. <b>Pulsating</b> <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> sometimes have a single well-defined period, but often they pulsate simultaneously with multiple frequencies and complex analysis is required to determine the separate interfering periods. In some cases, the pulsations do not have a defined frequency, causing a random variation, referred to as stochastic. The study of stellar interiors using their pulsations is asteroseismology.|$|R
