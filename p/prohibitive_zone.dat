5000|$|An arch {{commemorating the}} diamond jubilee of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly is under {{construction}} near the Fort on Rajaji Salai close to Napier Bridge. The structure is a replica of Fort St George's fa√ßade. The arch will be rectangular in structure with a height of 41 ft and 80 m width being built {{at a cost of}} [...] 1.33 crore. The structure will be a mix of old and modern architecture, inspired by the frontage of Fort St George. The legend 'Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly diamond jubilee commemorative arch' would be inscribed in English and Tamil, in addition to the words '60 years'. The chief minister J Jayalalithaa laid the foundation stone for the arch on 30 October 2012. Earlier, the arch was planned to be constructed close to the entrance of Fort St George, but was later relocated beyond the <b>prohibitive</b> <b>zone</b> following the objections of archaeologists. A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Madras High Court opposing the move stating that the arch would choke Rajaji Salai that leads to the High Court. However, the petition was dismissed by a division bench on 9 January 2013.|$|E

Threat from winter floods and transgressive behavior by the river's transient dwellers further enforce this invisible divide. One community to embrace the transformed river is that of local artists. Multicolored murals and elaborate graffiti against the bleak channel expanses draw attention from bridges overhead. Poets and performance artists wade in the shallow depths to enact a one time work, seen by few {{but part of the}} river history. As politicians and citizens call for river restoration, this thesis proposes an art center and crossing as both a legitimate outpost for local artists and focal point in the Elysian community on this newly awakened landscape. With barriers removed, the art center leads the community to the open waters below, and a bridge physically unites the divided neighbors across the banks...|$|E

Astrophys. 595, A 121, 2016) {{introduced}} {{a method to}} infer the axial magnetic field in flux-rope coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the solar corona and farther away in the interplanetary medium. The method, based on the conservation principle of magnetic helicity, uses the relative magnetic helicity of the solar source region as input estimates, along with the radius and length of the corresponding CME flux rope. The method was initially applied to cylindrical force-free flux ropes, with encouraging results. We hereby extend our framework along two distinct lines. First, we generalize our formalism to several possible flux-rope configurations (linear and nonlinear force-free, non-force-free, spheromak, and torus) to investigate the dependence of the resulting CME axial magnetic field on input parameters and the employed flux-rope configuration. Second, we generalize our framework to both Sun-like and active M-dwarf stars hosting superflares. In a qualitative sense, we find that Earth may not experience severe atmosphere-eroding magnetospheric compression even for eruptive solar superflares with energies ~ 10 ^ 4 times {{higher than those of}} the largest Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) X-class flares currently observed. In addition, the two recently discovered exoplanets with the highest Earth-similarity index, Kepler 438 b and Proxima b, seem to lie in the <b>prohibitive</b> <b>zone</b> of atmospheric erosion due to interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs), except when they possess planetary magnetic fields that are much higher than that of Earth.

40|$|Liquefiable {{soils are}} common at ports {{due to the}} use of {{hydraulic}} fills for construction of waterfront facilities. Liquefaction-induced ground failure can result in permanent ground deformations that can cause loss of foundation support and structural damage. This can lead to substantial repair and/or replacement costs and business interruption losses that can have an adverse effect on the port and the surrounding community. Although numerous soil improvement methods exist for remediating a liquefaction-prone site, many of these methods are poorly suited for developed sites because they could damage existing infrastructure and disrupt port operations. An alternative is to use a passive remediation technique. Treating liquefiable soils with colloidal silica gel via permeation grouting has been shown to resist cyclic deformations and is a candidate {{to be used as a}} soil stabilizer in passive mitigation. The small-strain dynamic properties are essential to determine the response to seismic loading. The small-to-intermediate strain shear modulus and damping ratio of loose sand treated with colloidal silica gel was investigated and the influence of colloidal silica concentration was determined. The effect of introducing colloidal silica gel into the pore space in the initial phase of treatment results in a 10 % to 12 % increase in the small-strain shear modulus, depending on colloidal silica concentration. The modulus reduction curve indicates that treatment does not affect the linear threshold shear strain, however the treated samples reduce at a greater rate than the untreated samples in the intermediate-strain range above 0. 01 % cyclic shear strain. It was observed that the treated sand has slightly higher damping ratio in the small-strain range; however, at cyclic shear strains around 0. 003 % the trend reverses and the untreated sand begins to have higher damping ratio. Due to the nature of the colloidal silica gelation process, chemical bonds continue to form with time, thus the effect of aging on the dynamic properties is important. A parametric study was performed to investigate the influence of gel time on the increase in small-strain shear modulus. The effect of aging increases the small-strain shear modulus after gelling by 200 to 300 % for the 40 -minute-gel time samples with a distance from gelation (time after gelation normalized by gel time) of 1000 to 2000; 700 % for the 2 -hour-gel time sample with a distance from gelation of 1000; and 200 to 400 % for the 20 -hour-gel time samples with a distance from gelation of 40 to 100. The treatment of all potentially liquefiable soil at port facilities with colloidal silica would be cost <b>prohibitive.</b> Identifying treatment <b>zones</b> that would reduce the lateral pressure and resulting pile bending moments and displacements caused by liquefaction-induced lateral spreading to prevent foundation damage is an economic alternative. Colloidal silica gel treatment zones of varying size and location were evaluated by subjecting a 3 -by- 3 pile group in gently sloping liquefiable ground to 1 -g shaking table tests. The results are compared to an untreated sample. The use of a colloidal silica treatment zone upslope of the pile group results in reduced maximum bending moments and pile displacements in the downslope row of piles when compared to an untreated sample; the presence of the treatment zone had minimal effect on the other rows of piles within the group.
