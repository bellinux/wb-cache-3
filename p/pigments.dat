5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide <b>pigments</b> {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. <b>Pigments,</b> in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green <b>pigments</b> makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite <b>pigments,</b> chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pigments</b> are {{coloured}} chemicals (such as melanin) {{in animal}} tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), {{an example of}} seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the <b>pigments</b> that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid <b>pigments</b> synthesized by plants. In {{the case of the}} flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own <b>pigments,</b> including both carotenoids and (green) chlorophyll. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.|$|E

Macular retinal <b>pigment</b> epithelium wound repair and regression of choroidal neovascularization are more pronounced in younger than older patients.
