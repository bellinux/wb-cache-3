2500|$|The {{symptoms}} that occur after a concussion {{have been described}} in various reports and writings for hundreds of years. The idea that this set of symptoms forms a distinct entity began to attain greater recognition {{in the latter part}} of the 19th century. John Erichsen, a surgeon from London, played an important role in developing the study of PCS. The controversy surrounding the cause of PCS began in 1866 when Erichsen published a paper about persisting symptoms after sustaining mild head trauma. He suggested that the condition was due to [...] "molecular disarrangement" [...] to the spine. The condition was originally called [...] "railroad spine" [...] because most of the injuries studied had happened to railroad workers. While some of his contemporaries agreed that the syndrome had an organic basis, others attributed the symptoms to psychological factors or to outright feigning. [...] In 1879, the idea that a physical problem was responsible for the symptoms was challenged by Rigler, who suggested that the cause of the persisting symptoms was actually [...] "compensation neurosis": the railroad's practice of compensating workers who had been injured was bringing about the complaints. [...] Later, the idea that hysteria was responsible for the symptoms after a mild head injury was suggested by Charcot. [...] Controversy about the syndrome continued through the 20thcentury. During World War I many soldiers suffered from puzzling symptoms after being close to a detonation but without any evidence of a head wound. The illness was called shell shock, and a psychological explanation was eventually favoured. By 1934 the current concept of PCS had replaced ideas of hysteria as the cause of post-concussion symptoms. British authorities banned the term shell shock during World War II to avoid an epidemic of cases, and the term posttrauma concussion state was coined in 1939 to describe [...] "disturbance of consciousness with no immediate or obvious pathologic change in the brain". The term <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> was in use by 1941.|$|E

5000|$|Post-concussion {{syndrome}} (PCS), {{is a set}} {{of symptoms}} that a person may experience for weeks, months, or occasionally years after a concussion with a prevalence rate of 38-80% in mild traumatic brain injuries, it may also occur in moderate and severe cases of traumatic brain injury. A diagnosis may be made when symptoms resulting from concussion, depending on criteria, last for more than three to six months after the injury, in which case it is termed persistent postconcussive syndrome (PPCS). In a study of the prevalence of post concussion syndrome symptoms in patients with depression utilizing the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory: [...] "Approximately 9 out of 10 patients with depression met liberal self-report criteria for a <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> and more than 5 out of 10 met conservative criteria for the diagnosis." [...] These self reported rates were significantly higher than those obtained in a scheduled clinical interview. Normal controls have exhibited symptoms of PCS as well as those seeking psychological services. There is considerable debate over the diagnosis of PCS {{in part because of the}} medico-legal and thus monetary ramifications of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|Blast-related mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) has been unfortunately common in veterans {{who served in the}} recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with these mTBIs has frequently appeared in combination with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The presence of PTSD has complicated diagnosis since clinically PTSD and the <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> of mTBI have many overlapping symptoms. In particular establishing how much of the symptom complex {{can be attributed to the}} psychological trauma associated with PTSD in contrast to the physical injury of TBI has proven difficult. Indeed some have suggested that much of what is now being called blast-related <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> is better explained by PTSD. The relationship between the <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> of mTBI and PTSD is complex. Association of the two disorders might be viewed as additive effects of independent psychological and physical traumas suffered in a war zone. However we previously found that rats exposed to repetitive low-level blast exposure in the absence of a psychological stressor developed a variety of anxiety and PTSD-related behavioral traits that were present months following the last blast exposure. Here we show that a single predator scent challenge delivered 8 months after the last blast exposure induces chronic anxiety related changes in blast-exposed rats that are still present 45 days later. These observations suggest that in addition to independently inducing PTSD-related traits, blast exposure sensitizes the brain to react abnormally to a subsequent psychological stressor. These studies have implications for conceptualizing the relationship between blast-related mTBI and PTSD and suggest that blast-related mTBI in humans may predispose to the later development of PTSD in reaction to subsequent psychological stressors...|$|E

40|$|Background: Mild {{traumatic}} brain injury with postconcussion syndromes may be correlated with long term cognitive deficits. While 1. 7 million {{traumatic brain}} injuries are reported each year, this number {{does not account for}} the many mild traumatic brain injuries that are not reported each year. Methods: Exhaustive search of available medical literature using the search engines: OVID, CINAHL, Entrez, and UpToDate. Keywords used were Mild Traumatic Brain Injury, Cognitive Disorders, Psychological Disorders, Neurological Disorders, and <b>Postconcussion</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Results: The four articles that remained, presented vastly different conclusions as to the long term cognitive effects of traumatic brain injuries. One widely publicized article by Hoge et al 9 determined that mild {{traumatic brain injury}} posed no significant adverse health effects except headache. Another study conducted by De Beaumont et al found that there were cognitive dysfunction 30 years after the last mild traumatic brain injury event had occurred. Conclusion: Mild traumatic brain injuries do have a direct correlation with cognitive deficits. Post traumatic stress disorder and depression may mask the symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury with <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> and thereby making the diagnoses of this condition difficult.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sports-related {{injuries}} {{are among the}} more common causes of injury in adolescents that can result in concussion and its sequelae, <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> and second-impact syn-drome (SIS). Students who experience multiple brain injuries within {{a short period of}} time (hours, days, or weeks) may suffer catastrophic or fatal reactions related to SIS. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to the dangers of SIS, and current return-to-play guidelines may be too lenient to protect a student from SIS. Any student with signs of a concussion should receive medical eval-uation and not be allowed to return to play in the current game or practice. The role of the school nurse includes being knowledgeable about management of head injuries and return-to-play guide-lines, providing follow-up for athletes who have concussions, and providing education on pre-vention and management of head injuries...|$|E

Data were collected from mTBI participants with PCS, mTBI participants without PCS and non-head-injured participants (all groups: n= 8). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite profiles within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed a reduced creatine/choline ratio in mTBI patients compared with control participants. This data provides initial evidence for residual metabolic changes in chronic mTBI patients, {{but there was no}} conclusive relationship between these metabolic changes and PCS symptom report.

40|$|Past {{studies suggest}} {{a variety of}} factors that {{influence}} the report of <b>Postconcussion</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (PCS) symptoms, including head injury, depression, pain, and subjective expectation. Participants included 190 undergraduates across 8 groups chosen to examine the relative contribution of these factors, as well as treatment-seeking behavior, in the report of both current and past PCS symptoms. Depressed persons, depressed persons receiving treatment, and headache sufferers receiving treatment reported elevated rates of PCS symptoms when compared to controls. Five of the eight groups reported experiencing more current than past symptoms. Head-injured persons and headache sufferers underestimated premorbid symptom rates relative to the baseline of controls.

40|$|One of the {{consequences}} of traumatic brain injury is the <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The symptoms in this syndrome include headache, dizziness, poor memory, poor concentration, easy fatigue, drowsiness, irritability, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to noise, low alcohol tolerance, visual problems, auditory problems, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and depression. Several factor analytic studies have shown that these symptoms load onto cognitive and noncognitive factors (Bohnen, Twijnstra, & Jolles, 1992). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether patients who report different symptoms also evidence differences in cognitive deficits, as indexed by reaction time. For this purpose 106 subjects (mean age 25. 92 years; SD= 6. 05) of both sexes were tested on 8 reaction time tasks adapted from Shum, McFarland, Bain, and Humphreys (1990). There were 54 traumatic brain injury patients (mean age 26. 40 years; SD= 6. 23) drawn from three Pretoria hospitals. They were heterogeneous with respect to diagnosis and severity of injury. For the controls (N= 52), the mean age was 25. 43 years (SD= 5. 88). The eight reaction time tasks constituted 4 task variables, each with 21 evels. From these tasks, 36 reaction time indexes were derived. The indexes were classified into 4 groups, viz., reaction time (RT), movement time (MT), total reaction time (TT), and subtraction scores (SB, the difference between the 2 levels for each task variable). RT reflects the decision component and MT reflects the response execution component of reaction time. Partial correlation coefficients for all symptoms (p 0, 01) showed that some symptoms were most frequently associated with RT whilst others were most frequently associated with MT. On factor analysis with varimax rotation, symptoms loaded predominantly with SB scores. Symptoms also loaded with different task variablseuiggesting that they correlated with deficits on different stages of information processing. Taking into account possible methodological constraints that were discussed, these results confirm that different symptoms within the <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> correlate with different cognitive deficits. The correlations between symptoms and indices of reaction time are moderated by the characteristics of the symptoms (frequency & intensity), and the duration since injury. These findings have significance for understanding the aetiology of the postconcussion symptoms and for planning treatment. PsychologyPh. D. (Psychology...|$|E
40|$|Mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) is the commonest form of TBI. Though the name implies, {{it may not be}} mild in certain cases. There is a lot of heterogeneity in nomenclature, classification, evaluation and outcome of mTBI.

The aspects of mTBI like pediatric age group, sports concussion, and <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> were not reviewed. There is general agreement that Glasgow coma score (GCS) of 13 should not be considered as mTBI as the risk of intracranial lesion is higher than in patients with GCS 14 - 15. All patients with GCS of < 15 should be evaluated with a computed tomography (CT) scan. Patients with GCS 15 and risk factors or neurological symptoms should also be evaluated with CT scan.

With the increase in combat-related traumatic brain injuries in the military setting, lessons learned from sports concussion research are being applied by the Department of Defense to the assessment of blast concussions and return to duty decision making.

40|$|Background. There {{is a lack}} of {{scientific}} evidence in the literature on the involvement of the cervical spine in mTBI; however, its involvement is clinically accepted. Objective. This paper reviews evidence for the involvement of the cervical spine in mTBI symptoms, the mechanisms of injury, and the efficacy of therapy for cervical spine with concussion-related symptoms. Methods. A keyword search was conducted on PubMed, ICL, SportDiscus, PEDro, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases for articles published since 1990. The reference lists of articles meeting the criteria (original data articles, literature reviews, and clinical guidelines) were also searched in the same databases.

Sixty-two volunteers with no history of brain injury or neurological disease were randomly allocated to one of two conditions in which they read a mTBI vignette followed by information that varied only by use of the embedded terms concussion (n = 28) or mTBI (n = 34). Both groups reported illness perceptions (timeline and consequences subscale of the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised) and expected <b>Postconcussion</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (PCS) symptoms 6 months post injury (Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, NSI). Statistically significant group differences due to terminology were found on selected NSI scores (i. e., total, cognitive and sensory symptom cluster scores (concussion > mTBI)), but there was no effect of terminology on illness perception. When embedded in discharge advice, diagnostic terminology affects some but not all expected outcomes.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of psychological and cognitive {{factors in the}} development of the <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PCS) following mild uncomplicated traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has received little study. This may be because of the widely held belief that neurological factors are the cause of early PCS symptoms, whereas psychological factors are responsible for enduring symptoms. To further understand these relationships, the association between PCS and neuropsychological and psychological outcome was investigated in 122 general trauma patients, many of whom had orthopedic injuries, around 5 days following mTBI. Apart from verbal fluency, participants with a PCS did not differ in their performances on neuropsychological measures compared to those without a PCS. Individuals with a PCS reported significantly more psychological symptoms. Large effect sizes present on the psychological measures showed that the difference between participants with a PCS and without was greater on psychological than on neuropsychological measures.

We hypothesized that worse outcomes would be expected of mTBI, compared to other diagnoses, and that MHI would be perceived as worse than concussion. Method: 108 volunteers were randomly allocated to conditions in which they read a vignette describing a motor vehicle accident-related mTBI followed by: a diagnosis of mTBI (n= 27), MHI (n= 24), concussion (n= 31); or, no diagnosis (n= 26). All groups rated: a) event ‘undesirability’; b) illness perception, and; c) expected <b>Postconcussion</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (PCS) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms six months post injury. Results: On average, more PCS symptomatology was expected following mTBI compared to other diagnoses, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was a statistically significant group effect on undesirability (mTBI>concussion & MHI), PTSD symptomatology (mTBI & no diagnosis>concussion), and negative illness perception (mTBI & no diagnosis>concussion). Conclusion: In general, diagnostic terminology did not affect anticipated PCS symptoms six months post injury, but other outcomes were affected. Given that these diagnostic terms are used interchangeably, {{this study suggests that}} changing terminology can influence known contributors to poor mTBI outcome...|$|E
40|$|Minor {{traumatic}} brain injury accounts {{for the majority of}} the one million head trauma attendances at A&E departments in the United Kingdom. Guidelines have been established listing criteria for skull films, admission to hospital, computed tomography, and neurosurgical consultation. These are currently undergoing revision and were the subject of a satellite symposium to the J Douglas Miller memorial meeting held in October 1996 in Edinburgh. In the East Anglia Region the current guidelines have been issued as memo-cards for A&E officers. The aim of admission is to observe for deterioration, predominantly caused by intracranial haematomas. The indicators for the development of such lesions are an impaired level of consciousness and presence of a skull fracture. Such patients should therefore undergo regular and frequent neurological observations, and be admitted for at least 12 hours. Following discharge, routine follow up should be considered to identify and treat patients with postconcussion symptoms and signs. The possible way forward for the management of these patients is adopting a greater emphasis on preventative aspects, and establishing, implementing, and auditing evidence based guidelines. Improved teaching in the form of formal induction seminars and computerised teaching aids is required, and a better understanding of the aetiology and treatment of the <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background. Identifying which {{patients}} {{are most likely}} to be at risk of chronic pain and other postconcussion symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a difficult clinical challenge. Objectives. To examine the relationship between pain catastrophizing, defined as the exaggerated negative appraisal of a pain experience, and early MTBI outcome. Methods. This cross-sectional design included 58 patients diagnosed with a MTBI. In addition to medical chart review, postconcussion symptoms were assessed by self-report at 1 month (Time 1) and 8 weeks (Time 2) after MTBI. Pain severity, psychological distress, level of functionality, and pain catastrophizing were measured by self-report at Time 2. Results. The pain catastrophizing subscales of rumination, magnification, and helplessness were significantly correlated with pain severity (r=. 31 to. 44), number of postconcussion symptoms reported (r=. 35 to. 45), psychological distress (r=. 57 to. 67), and level of functionality (r=-. 43 to -. 29). Pain catastrophizing scores were significantly higher for patients deemed to be at high risk of <b>postconcussion</b> <b>syndrome</b> (6 or more symptoms reported at both Time 1 and Time 2). Conclusions. Higher levels of pain catastrophizing were related to adverse early MTBI outcomes. The early detection of pain catastrophizing may facilitate goal-oriented interventions to prevent or minimize the development of chronic pain and other postconcussion symptoms...|$|E
