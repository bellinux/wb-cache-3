40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of large-scale Photovoltaic energy-production systems {{is one of}} the promising solutions to replace fuel-based and nuclear-based electricity plants. Compared to most sources of electricity, photovoltaic <b>panels</b> produce few <b>CO</b> 2 in operation (although their manufacturing, transport, installation, cleaning and decommissioning/recycling creates CO 2 emissions), they need little maintenance, last 20 years or more and can be recycled. One of the key questions raised in developing large-scale PV systems is to find appropriate locations: flat, secured against vandalism and thieves, and near to existing power lines. Airports areas fit quite well those constraints so an increasing number of airport authorities is installing or planning to install large surfaces of PV panels producing 20 MW or more. In this paper, we address the safety concerns related to the implementation of large-scale PV systems in airport locations. We identify different kinds of risky situations in which PV panels are implied and we analyze their causes and potential consequences, along with proposals for risk reduction...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The {{study of}} {{carbonation}} perception is limited, even though carbonated beverages are very popular. A {{series of experiments}} were conducted to determine the sensory properties of carbonation itself and its interaction with other sensory modalities. First, the power functions of carbonation in carbonated spring water were developed by a trained panel using two assessing conditions, swallowing and expectoration. Five carbonation levels, 1. 2 2. 0. 2. 5, 3. 0, and 3. 9 volumes CO 2, were employed. The size of the exponents, 2. 79 (swallowing) and 2. 65 (expectoration), suggested a sharp increase of perceived carbonation magnitude with increasing concentration. There {{was no significant difference}} between exponents resulting from the two assessing conditions. Second, the effects of temperature on carbonation perception in carbonated spring water were determined by use of both a trained panel and a naive panel. Two carbonation levels, 2. 4 and 3. 0 volumes, and four temperature levels, 3 °, 10 °, 16 ° and 22 °C, were employed. Carbonation intensity was perceived to be higher at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. This effect held true for both trained and naive panels. The temperature effect on carbonation perception, however, was carbonation level dependent. Differences were more evident at the higher carbonation level.

40|$|Electricity {{generation}} from intermittent {{renewable energy}} sources {{is expected to rise}} drastically, which may have profound implications for building design and operation. The authors propose a combined design and control optimization that takes intermittent {{renewable energy sources}} into account and adds two steps to the literature. First is the use of multiple temperature levels, which allows a more realistic representation of energy storage and conversion efficiencies. Second is the explicit inclusion of a simplified representation of the electricity generation side, which allows quantifying the value of flexible electricity demand. The proposed modeling framework is applied to nine scenarios for the electricity generation mix in Belgium. The results indicate that a hot water storage tank is not an attractive technology in the presented scenarios, altering the CO 2 emissions less than 0. 05 ton per building per year. This lowers the added value of modeling the temperature levels. The combination with the electricity generation system allows for a thorough assessment of the CO 2 emissions.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the characteristics of}} China's regional CO 2 emissions and effects of economic growth and energy intensity using panel data from 1997 to 2009. The results show that there are remarkable regional disparities among eastern, central and western areas, regional elasticities of per capita GDP and energy intensity on CO 2 emissions, which reflect the regional differences in economic development, economy structure and restraining function of energy intensity decrease on the emission. Energy intensity reducing is more effective to emission abatement for provinces with higher elasticity of energy intensity, but may not be significant for provinces with lower elasticity. The inverse distribution of energy production and consumption, regional unfairness caused by institutional factors like energy price and tax system result in inter-regional CO 2 emission transfer embodied in the power transmission. The calculation indicates that the embodied emission transfer was gradually significant after 2003, from eastern area to the central and western areas, especially energy production provinces in central area, which leads to distortion on the emission and emission intensity. The regional emission reduction targets and supporting policies should be customized and consistent with the actual situations rather than setting the same target for all the provinces.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the {{position}} of Slovakia and the Czech Republic in the European Union from the viewpoint of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Econometric models for <b>panel</b> data with <b>CO</b> 2 emissions as the dependent variable and four different types of macroeconomic aggregates are employed in the study. The EU- 27 data used in the study supports the hypothesis of the EKC. As the EU countries are heterogeneous, the countries are further classified into “rich” and “poor” (according to the level of their GDP), and further analyses are performed. Considering the “rich” EU countries the EKC hypothesis holds, but if the “poor” EU countries are taken into account, the coefficient of the quadratic regressor is positive which relates to the traditional U-shaped curve, not the inverted one. Such a finding is still not in contradiction to the EKC hypothesis, as it assumes that at the low level of economic output, as the development progresses, the emissions increase. The estimated value of the EKC turning point is 19 660 USD (constant 2000 USD) which has not been reached by the “poor” EU countries yet. As for the position of Slovakia and the Czech Republic in the EU, the results are not unambiguous. The CO 2 emissions have been decreasing very slightly in both countries since 1992 (with 1. 33 percent mean annual rate of decrease in Slovakia and 1. 16 percent mean annual rate of decrease in the Czech Republic). The GDP per unit of energy use (constant 2005 PPP USD per kg of oil equivalent) increased from 3. 15 USD to 6. 33 USD in Slovakia between 1990 and 2010 (i. e. 3. 54 percent mean annual growth rate).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although most {{closed cell}} foams {{incorporate}} barriers at the surface, {{most of these}} barriers {{have been found to}} do little, if anything, to improve the long term performance of foams The cause of the barrier failures will be explained in terms of the author’s previous research. The advantage of properly applied barriers can be shown by use of the MIT aging model along with measured values of diffusion coefficients. The model shows that the time averaged insulation performance can be substantially enhanced by use of proper use of barriers. For example, a foam <b>panel</b> filled with <b>CO</b> 2 having proper bar-riers on the top and bottom surface has an equivalent average R-value over the time span of decades when compared to a CFC filled panel without facers. Means to measure the performance of a barrier when applied to a foam panel m-clude a qualitative dye technique. The dye technique allows the existence of open pathways at the interface of a foam and barrier to be easily visualized. Early test work with the dye technique indicates that many barrier/foam combinations give poor per-formance even when the barrier is impermeable. Experimental means to quantitatively measure barrier-foam behavior are needed to determine the potential of new barrier foam combinations and allow the long term performance to be predicted without the need for long term aging tests. A new mea-surement technique involves the use of transient tests of a foam sample with a barrier applied from the production process. The comparison of the experimental transient performance with the barrier in place and the transient performance of a similar un-faced foam will allow the barrier performance to be calculated using the transient analysis applied to the test data. The quantitative results of the barrier performance will allow the long term aging of a foam sample protected by barriers to be accurately predicted. The barrier characteristics of dense foam polymer material at the surface of th...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} (RES) {{will play a}} vital role in {{reducing}} the impact of climate change. Solar and wind energy, captured by PV-panels and wind turbines respectively, are two major RES that pose enormous potential but have two important disadvantages: a limited predictability and intermittency. Demand response (DR) is often put forward as part of the solution for intermittency, by shifting electricity demand away or towards times of shortages or abundances of RES respectively. One of the major technologies that pose significant potential for DR are electrical heating and cooling systems. Within these systems, this work focuses on the heating of residential buildings by means of a heat pump. Residential buildings with heat pumps show potential for DR as the building structure and domestic hot water tank can be used as thermal energy storage. This allows a decoupling in time of the delivery of thermal comfort and the heat pump electricity demand. One of the factors hampering a widespread implementation of DR for heat pumps is a thorough understanding of the potential benefits. To this aim, this work presents an integrated modeling approach that captures both the incentives for DR by explicitly modeling the electricity generation system as well as the flexibility potential of residential buildings with heat pumps. In contrast to the literature, a bottom-up representation of this flexibility potential is developed, resulting in a linear optimal control problem (OCP). This linear OCP of buildings with heat pumps is combined with a state of the art unit commitment and economic dispatch model of the electricity generation system. The added value of this integrated modeling approach is shown with respect to typical other approaches in the literature. It correctly captures the maximal potential for DR, weighs the thermal losses against the supply side incentives and includes the feedback with the electricity generation system. This integrated model is employed in a number of case studies to explore the potential benefits of DR for residential heat pumps. In a first case study for a Belgian context, it is shown that DR with residential heat pumps can shift electricity demand towards moments of curtailment in order to avoid electricity demand later on when fuel fired power plants are running. In this case study, half of the shifted electricity demand was directly lost due to thermal losses in the residential buildings. In this manner, applying DR to residential heat pumps allows reducing the CO 2 emission further by an extra 15 % on top of the CO 2 emission reduction of installing a heat pump. Furthermore, the contribution of the electricity demand of residential heat pumps to the peak electricity demand is almost one on one in case no DR is applied. With DR, well insulated buildings can significantly shift their electricity demand away from the peak. Buildings which are not well insulated are shown to be unattractive for installing heat pumps, even with a DR implementation. In a second case study, the monetary benefits of applying DR for residential heat pumps are identified to go up to 150 EUR per participant per year from operational savings and up to 300 EUR per participant per year by avoiding peak electricity demand. These cost savings are shown to diminish as the participation in DR rises. This discourages extreme configurations in the residential buildings: high spreads on temperature set points or high domestic hot water tank sizes pose little added value in case of higher DR participation. The integrated model has potential for a practical implementation of DR with residential heat pumps. It can be employed to anticipate, in a day ahead setting, the reaction of residential heat pumps to incentives from the electricity generation system. Residential heat pumps controlled by MPC are shown to be very greedy to these incentives. In this manner, sending an electricity price profile leads to poor performance when a high number of buildings, 100, 000 in this work, join in on DR. Sending an electricity demand profile for the residential heat pumps to follow attains superior performance in this context. Finally, this work combines the integrated model with a heating system design optimization in order to investigate whether heating systems should be designed differently in the light of high RES shares in the electricity generation system. Two modeling additions towards this aim, temperature level and electricity generation side modeling, show limited added value to the heating system optimization but does allow a correct quantification of the CO 2 emissions. From the results it follows that a residential building is best equipped with a single main heat production system. The combination of heat pump and PV <b>panel</b> reduce the <b>CO</b> 2 emission of the building with up to 2 ton per building per year compared to typical fuel fired options for a limited extra cost. A storage tank for space heating and solar thermal panels appear to be unattractive technologies. A large scale combined heat and power unit is attractive but the CO 2 emission strongly depends on the CO 2 emission calculation method. 1 Introduction 2 Concepts and boundary conditions 3 Integrated model development 4 Comparison integrated model to other modeling approaches in the literature 5 Case study I: Greenhouse gas abatement cost of heat pumps in a Belgian residential context 6 Case study II: Impact of market penetration 7 Comparison of DR incentives in attaining integrated model performance 8 Demand response: implications for residential heating system design 9 Conclusionnrpages: 248 status: publishe...|$|R
