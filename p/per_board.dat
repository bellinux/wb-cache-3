5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock <b>per</b> <b>board.</b> On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E
25|$|In the old days, {{relaying}} moves required {{another person}} copying the moves {{of the players}} into a large board behind the players, which was then transmitted via radio or telegram. Advancements of camera allow for zooming clearly at the players' board, although relaying moves still {{had to be done}} manually. Recently, DGT chess board captures the piece movements and allows for moves to be relayed instantaneously, eliminating the need for manual relay, but due to price (around $3000 <b>per</b> <b>board),</b> it has been limited to only a few tournaments.|$|E
25|$|By 23 April, {{new lines}} {{had been laid}} down Wheeler Gate, {{connecting}} {{for the first time}} the northern and southern sections, while work had commenced on relaying the Trent Bridge and Station Street sections. At this time a new electric line was laid from Bulwell as far as Gregory Boulevard at Hyson Green, which was some distance nearer the city than the Old Basford horse tram terminus. Horse buses provided a service connecting with the horse trams while the old rails were pulled up, thus continuing the service to Basford, and on 17 April horse trams commenced operating from Gregory Boulevard to Bulwell Market over the new rails. As further new rails were laid, so the Bulwell end of the service expanded, while the Nottingham end grew shorter. On completion of this work and the depot at Bulwell in June, a through horse tram service was inaugurated on 29 June. This did not last long, for electric cars superseded the horse trams on 23 July, a week after the Board of Trade inspection, the through fare being 3d., with intermediate 1d. and 2d. fares. Electricity at this time was 1½d. <b>per</b> <b>Board</b> of Trade unit.|$|E

6000|$|... 'So we substituted. He {{arranged}} the pièce de resistarnce {{in the shape}} of large drums--not saucers, mark you--drums of coloured fire, with printed instructions, at proper distances round Persimmon. There was a brief interregnum while we dug ourselves in among the wurzels by hand. Then he touched off the fires, not omitting the Roman candle, and, you may take it from me, all was visible. Persimmon shone out in his naked splendour, red to port, green to starboard, and one white light at his bows, as <b>per</b> <b>Board</b> o' Trade regulations. Only he didn't so much rock, you might say, as shrug himself, in a manner of speaking, every time the candle went off. One can't have everything. But the rest surpassed our highest expectations. I think Persimmon was noblest on the starboard or green side--more like when a man thinks he's seeing mackerel in hell, don't you know? And yet I'd be the last to deprecate the effect of the port light on his teeth, or that blood-shot look in his left eye. He knew there was something going on he didn't approve of. He looked worried.' ...|$|E
6000|$|For my part I could {{much sooner}} believe in an {{unsinkable}} ship of 3,000 tons than {{in one of}} 40,000 tons. It {{is one of those}} things that stand to reason. You can't increase the thickness of scantling and plates indefinitely. And the mere weight of this bigness is an added disadvantage. In reading the reports, the first reflection which occurs to one is that, if that luckless ship had been a couple of hundred feet shorter, she would have probably gone clear of the danger. But then, perhaps, she could not have had a swimming bath and a French cafe. That, of course, is a serious consideration. I am well aware that those responsible for her short and fatal existence ask us in desolate accents to believe that if she had hit end on she would have survived. Which, by a sort of coy implication, seems to mean that it was all the fault of the officer of the watch (he is dead now) for trying to avoid the obstacle. We shall have presently, in deference to commercial and industrial interests, a new kind of seamanship. A very new and [...] "progressive" [...] kind. If you see anything in the way, by no means try to avoid it; smash at it full tilt. And then--and then only you shall see the triumph of material, of clever contrivances, of the whole box of engineering tricks in fact, and cover with glory a commercial concern of the most unmitigated sort, a great Trust, and a great ship-building yard, justly famed for the super-excellence of its material and workmanship. Unsinkable! See? I told you she was unsinkable, if only handled in accordance with the new seamanship. Everything's in that. And, doubtless, the Board of Trade, if properly approached, would consent to give the needed instructions to its examiners of Masters and Mates. Behold the examination-room of the future. Enter to the grizzled examiner a young man of modest aspect: [...] "Are you well up in modern seamanship?" [...] "I hope so, sir." [...] "H'm, let's see. You are at night on the bridge in charge of a 150,000 tons ship, with a motor track, organ- loft, etc., etc., with a full cargo of passengers, a full crew of 1,500 cafe waiters, two sailors and a boy, three collapsible boats as <b>per</b> <b>Board</b> of Trade regulations, and going at your three-quarter speed of, say, about forty knots. You perceive suddenly right ahead, and close to, something that looks like a large ice-floe. What would you do?" [...] "Put the helm amidships." [...] "Very well. Why?" [...] "In order to hit end on." [...] "On what grounds should you endeavour to hit end on?" [...] "Because we are taught by our builders and masters that the heavier the smash, the smaller the damage, and because the requirements of material should be attended to." ...|$|E
