50|$|The main {{components}} of the piston-cylinder apparatus (Fig. 1) are the pressure generating system, the pressure vessel, and the assembly parts within the vessel. There {{are two types of}} piston-cylinder apparatus: non end-loaded and end-loaded, which involve, respectively, one or two hydraulic rams. In the end-loaded type the second hydraulic ram is used to vertically load and strengthen the pressure vessel. The non end-loaded type is smaller, more compact and cheaper, and is operable only to approximately 4 GPa.Pressure is applied to the sample by pressing a piston into the sample volume of the pressure vessel. The sample assembly consists of a solid pressure medium, a resistance heater and a small central volume for the sample. Three common configurations are used: ”, ” and 1”, which are the diameters of the piston and thus the sample assembly. According to the <b>pressure</b> <b>amplification</b> concept, the choice of the piston depends on the pressure you need to achieve.During the experiment, water circulates around the pressure vessel, the bridge and the upper plates to cool the system.|$|E
40|$|Background Brachial blood {{pressure}} predicts cardiovascular outcome at rest and during exercise. However, because of pulse <b>pressure</b> <b>amplification,</b> {{there is a}} marked difference between brachial pressure and central (aortic) pressure. Although central pressure {{is likely to have}} greater clinical importance, very little data exist regarding the central haemodynamic response to exercise. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the central and peripheral haemodynamic response to incremental aerobic exercise. Materials and methods Twelve healthy men aged 31 +/- 1 years (mean +/- SEM) exercised at 50 %, 60 %, 70 % and 80 % of their maximal heart rate (HRmax) on a bicycle ergometer. Central {{blood pressure}} and estimated aortic pulse wave velocity, assessed by timing of the reflected wave (T-R), were obtained noninvasively using pulse wave analysis. Pulse <b>pressure</b> <b>amplification</b> was defined as the ratio of peripheral to central pulse pressure and, to assess the influence of wave reflection on amplification, the ratio of peripheral pulse pressure to nonaugmented central pulse pressure (PPP : CDBP-P- 1) was also calculated. Results During exercise, there was a significant, intensity-related, increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate (P < 0. 001). There was also a significant increase in pulse <b>pressure</b> <b>amplification</b> and in PPP : CDBP-P- 1 (P < 0. 001), but both were independent of exercise intensity. Estimated aortic pulse wave velocity increased during exercise (P < 0. 001), indicating increased aortic stiffness. There was also a positive association between aortic pulse wave velocity and mean arterial pressure (r = 0. 54; P < 0. 001).

It is also becoming increasingly evident that changes in wall mechanics may progress both spatially and temporally (e. g., in age-related arterial stiffening and hypertension).

Previously, several modeling studies have investigated blood and pressure in full-body scale arterial trees using one-dimensional formulations. In this paper, we work towards the goal of deepening our understanding of arterial pulse propagation phenomena while incorporating detailed information on localized hemodynamics. To this end, we present the first multi-scale simulation of unsteady blood flow and pressure within a three-dimensional deformable full-body arterial network. This simulation framework builds upon previous advances in fluid-structure interaction, multi-scale outflow boundary conditions, and perivascular tissue support modeling.

40|$|Abstract Background. As arteries become stiffer with ageing, {{reflected}} waves {{move faster}} and augment late systolic pressure. We investigated the age dependency of peripheral and central systolic pressure, <b>pressure</b> <b>amplification</b> (peripheral {{systolic blood pressure}} - central systolic blood pressure), and peripheral and central systolic augmentation (maximal systolic pressure minus the first peak of the pressure wave). Methods. We randomly recruited 1420 White Europeans (mean age, 41. 7 years). peripheral systolic blood pressure and central systolic blood pressure were measured {{by means of an}} oscillometric sphygmomanometer and pulse wave analysis, respectively. Results. In cross-sectional analyses (731 women, 689 men), central systolic blood pressure and central systolic augmentation increased more with age than peripheral systolic blood pressure and peripheral systolic augmentation. These age-related increases were greater in women than men. The age-related decrease in <b>pressure</b> <b>amplification</b> was similar in both sexes. In longitudinal analyses (208 women, 190 men), the annual increases in central systolic blood pressure and central systolic augmentation were steeper (p < 0. 001) than those in peripheral systolic blood pressure and peripheral systolic augmentation with no sex differences (p ≥ 0. 068), except for peripheral systolic augmentation, which was larger in women (p = 0. 002). Longitudinally, <b>pressure</b> <b>amplification</b> decreased more with age in women than men (p = 0. 012). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, age was the overriding determinant of peripheral systolic blood pressure and central systolic blood pressure. Conclusion. With ageing, peripheral systolic blood pressure approximates to central systolic blood pressure.

Analysis {{of the central}} pressure waveform allows assessment of central pulse pressure and arterial stiffness. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the effect of vasoconstrictor drugs on pulse <b>pressure</b> <b>amplification</b> and arterial stiffness in vivo. Eight healthy male subjects (mean age 30 years) received an infusion of angiotensin II (1, 3, 6 and 10 ng kg− 1 min− 1), noradrenaline (10, 30, 60 and 100 ng kg− 1 min− 1) and matching placebo, in random order, on separate occasions. Peripheral blood pressure and cardiac index were recorded non-invasively. Pulse wave analysis was used to determine augmentation index (AIx), which provides a measure of systemic arterial stiffness, aortic stiffness and central arterial pressure. Infusion of both active drugs resulted in a significant increase in peripheral mean arterial pressure (PMAP), peripheral vascular resistance, AIx, aortic stiffness and central pulse pressure, but only angiotensin II reduced cardiac index. Peripheral pulse pressure was unaffected by infusion of angiotensin II but increased with noradrenaline, which also produced a greater reduction in pulse <b>pressure</b> <b>amplification</b> than angiotensin II. However, the linear relationship of PMAP with both AIx and aortic stiffness did not differ significantly between drugs. These results demonstrate that intravenous infusion of angiotensin II and noradrenaline increase aortic and systemic arterial stiffness.

Peripheral and central blood pressure, aortic pulse wave velocity, cardiac output, stroke volume, and peripheral vascular resistance were determined in 1008 subjects, aged 17 to 27 years.

We hypothesised that specimens from the pool would show smaller caudal fin area, since they are subject to lower predation <b>pressure.</b> Random <b>amplification</b> of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed a relatively high degree of both within- and between-sample genetic heterogeneity. The pond and pool samples exhibited heterozygosities, which did not differ significantly by t -test. Between-sample genetic divergence was highlighted by the coancestry coefficient (&#x 3 b 8; = 0. 301 1; 0. 059, P &#x 3 c; 0. 001) and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (variance between SITES = 41 %, P |$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} model for acoustic propagation in inhomogeneous flu- ids, and explores the focusing by arrays onto targets under various conditions. The work explores the use of arrays, in particular the time reversal array, for underwater and biomedical applications. Aspects of propagation and phasing {{which can lead to}} reduced focusing effectiveness are described. An acoustic wave equation was derived for the propagation of finite-amplitude waves in lossy time-varying inhomogeneous fluid media. The equation was solved numerically in both Cartesian and cylindrical geometries using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. It was found that time reversal arrays are sensitive to several debilitating factors. Focusing ability was determined to be adequate in the presence of temporal jitter in the time reversed signal only up to about one-sixth of a period. Thermoviscous absorption also had a debilitating effect on focal pressure for both linear and nonlinear propagation. It was also found that nonlinearity leads to degradation of focal <b>pressure</b> through <b>amplification</b> of the received signal at the array, and enhanced absorption in the shocked waveforms. This dissertation also examined the heating effects of focused ultrasound in a tissue-like medium. The application considered is therapeutic heating for hyperther- mia. The acoustic model and a thermal model for tissue were coupled to solve for transient and steady temperature profiles in tissue-like media. The Pennes bioheat equation was solved using the FDTD method to calculate the temperature fields in tissue-like media from focused acoustic sources. It was found that the temperature-dependence of the medium's background prop- erties can {{play an important role in}} the temperature predictions. Finite-amplitude effects contributed excess heat when source conditions were provided for nonlinear ef- fects to manifest themselves. The effect of medium heterogeneity was also found to be important in redistributing the acoustic and temperature fields, creating regions with hotter and colder temperatures than the mean by local scattering and lensing action. These temperature excursions from the mean were found to increase monotonically with increasing contrast in the medium's properties. Office of Naval Research (Code 321 -TS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that essential hypertension is determined by 2 separate mechanisms: a growth-promoting process in childhood and a self-perpetuating mechanism in adult life. We report a clinical study of 500 people taken from a cohort of 7086 men and women who were born in Helsinki from 1924 to 1933, and whose body size at birth was recorded. As expected, blood pressure levels were inversely related to birthweight and birth length. These associations, however, were confined to the 213 people who had previously been diagnosed as having hypertension. In them, a 1 -kg increase in birthweight was associated with a 6. 4 -mm Hg (95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 to 11. 9) decrease in systolic blood pressure recorded at the clinic, and with a 9. 3 -mm Hg (95 % confidence interval, 2. 1 to 16. 5) decrease recorded by ambulatory measurement. We conclude that pathological processes initiated in utero become self-perpetuating in adult life and lead to hypertension. Among elderly people with established hypertension, these processes have a strong effect on blood pressure levels, because they are processes that do not respond well to treatment.
