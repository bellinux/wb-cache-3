25|$|The era {{since the}} 1980s flourished, in large part, because of {{contributions}} {{made in the}} 1970s, a decade during which child psychiatry witnessed a major evolution {{as a result of}} the work carried out by Michael Rutter. The first comprehensive population survey of 9- to 11-year-olds, carried out in London and the Isle of Wight, which appeared in 1970, addressed questions that have continued to be of importance for child psychiatry; for example, rates of psychiatric disorders, the role of intellectual development and <b>physical</b> <b>impairment,</b> and specific concern for potential social influences on children's adjustment. This work was influential, especially since the investigators demonstrated specific continuities of psychopathology over time, and the influence of social and contextual factors in children's mental health, in their subsequent re-evaluation of the original cohort of children. These studies described the prevalence of ADHD (relatively low as compared to the US), identified the onset and prevalence of depression in mid-adolescence and the frequent co-morbidity with conduct disorder, and explored the relationship between various mental disorders and scholastic achievemment.|$|E
25|$|Swayze, {{who was an}} FAA {{licensed}} pilot with {{an instrument}} rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. He locked the cockpit, left the aircraft in the subdivision, and obtained a ride—with his dogs—from a passing vehicle driven by Gary Bruso, in order to telephone the authorities. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence—an open {{bottle of wine and}} a 30-pack of beer—from the crash site. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin, but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight and that the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's <b>physical</b> <b>impairment</b> due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the impact of the {{economic}} crisis and governmental expenditures on adults with <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> in Co. Kerry, Ireland. Closer examination of the governmental spending on services for adults with <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> and cutbacks in the distribution of benefits, allowances and grants and its effects on living conditions will be investigated. Personal views and opinions of adults with <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> on the impact of the crisis in terms of their autonomy/independence and the rights based approach will be also examined to answer the research question. Semi structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with ten participants to collect the research data. To analyze the data, the thematic analysis method was employed with the help of the theoretical framework of social model of disability and the rights based approach. These theoretical perspectives give a critical overview of understanding of disability and emphasize the importance of focusing on rights rather than needs in approach to disability. The findings of this study demonstrate that the economic crisis and governmental expenditures impact on adults with <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> standard of living, health and wellbeing and access to services. The findings also show that as a result their autonomy has been under threat due to growing dependency and rising decline in choice and control adults with <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> have over their lives...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} {{the impact that}} <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> have on the resource consumption in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks where bandwidth utilization is optimized performing an Optical Time Division Multiplexing (OTDM). In particular we propose two modified heuristics {{to solve the problem}} of Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in OTDM/WDM networks where <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> are taken into account. In literature this RWA problem is referred to as S-RWA (Super- Lightpath RWA) because Super-Lightpath must be routed. If D is the OTDM multiplexing degree, a Super-Lightpath is able to carry all connections from a single source node to D different destinations using the D time-slot carried out on each wavelength. The effectiveness of the technique is evaluated on the COST 266 physical topology and when random logical topologies with several connectivity degrees are considered. The RWA problem under <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> has been solved versus D and. The resource consumption is characterized by the average number n of wavelengths used and the number nSL of Super-Lightpath routed. When a heuristic optimizing the number of links occupied for each Super-Lightpath is used, we have obtained for D== 16 (n, nSL) =(24. 3, 26) and (n, nSL) =(18. 9, 145) when an S-RWA problem with and without <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> is solved respectively. The increase in number of Super-Lightpath was expected because the routing with <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> leads to shorter Super-Lightpath so much more of them are needed to solve S-RWA problem. On the contrary the lower number of wavelengths is explained with a better distribution of the Super-Lightpaths on physical topology when <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> are taken into account. In fact when they are not considered, Super- Lightpaths are longer, it is more probable that two Super-Lightpaths have at least one link in common and so a greater number of wavelengths are needed...|$|R

40|$|Background: The current {{model of}} care for breast cancer is focused on disease {{treatment}} followed by ongoing recurrence surveillance. This approach lacks attention to the patients’ physical and functional well-being. Breast cancer treatment sequelae can lead to <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> and functional limitations. Common impairments include pain, fatigue, upper extremity dysfunction, lymphedema, weakness, joint arthralgia, neuropathy, weight gain, cardiovascular effects, and osteoporosis. Evidence supports prospective surveillance for early identification and treatment {{as a means to}} prevent or mitigate many of these concerns. Purpose: This paper proposes a prospective surveillance model for physical rehabilitation and exercise that can be integrated with disease treatment to create a more comprehensive approach to survivorship health care. The goals of the model are to promote surveillance for common <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> and functional limitations associated with breast cancer treatment, to provide education to facilitate early identification of impairments, to introduce rehabilitation and exercise intervention when <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> are identified and to promote and support physical activity and exercise behaviors through the trajectory of disease treatment and survivorship. Methods: The model {{is the result of a}} multi-disciplinary meeting of research and clinical experts in breast cancer survivorship and representatives of relevant professional and advocacy organizations. Outcomes: The proposed model identifies time points during breast cancer care for assessment of and education about <b>physical</b> <b>impairments.</b> Ultimately, implementation of the model may influence incidence and severity of breast cancer treatment related <b>physical</b> <b>impairments.</b> As such, the model seeks to optimize function during and following treatment and positively influence a growing survivorship community...|$|R

Design: A longitudinal cohort study with 6 -month follow-up. Setting: Institutional practice. Participants: Subjects (N= 218) with chronic neck pain. Interventions: Subjects were treated with different physiotherapy modalities. Main Outcome Measures: Data were obtained for self-reported disability, verbal numeric pain scale, patient satisfaction, and 2 measures of <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> during the initial visit, at 6 weeks, and finally at 6 months. Results: The correlation among 4 sets of measurements varied. Moderate correlation was noted between disability and patient satisfaction (r range,. 50 -. 65), and between disability and pain (r range,. 55 -. 63). A fair relationship was found between pain and patient satisfaction (r range,. 43 -. 48), but only weak relationships were found between <b>physical</b> <b>impairments</b> and pain (r range, -. 08 to -. 25).
