25|$|Transgender youth {{experience}} {{a wide range}} of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and are better off with a high resilience to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.|$|E

Participants were interviewed about everyday life in the workplace as well as their experiences with resilience and thriving. The study found six main predictors of resilience: positive and proactive personality, experience and learning, sense of control, flexibility and adaptability, balance and perspective, and <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> <b>support.</b> High achievers were also found to engage in many activities unrelated to their work such as engaging in hobbies, exercising, and organizing meetups with friends and loved ones.|$|E

50|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in psychological vulnerability is Shahar’s fascination {{with the notion of}} resilience, i.e., individuals' ability to develop and thrive in the face of stressful conditions. However, Shahar is critical towards the notion that resilience is distinct from risk. Instead, he posits that any factor may confer both risk and resilience. Underlying this dialectic position on risk and resilience is Shahar’s argument, whereby psychosocial factors are inherently multifaceted and multilayered, with some “variance facets” positively associated with health and illness, and others negatively associated with these outcomes. His work on adolescent <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> carried out primarily with his chief collaborator, Prof. Christopher Henrich from Georgia State University, demonstrates this theoretical position. Shahar and Henrich, and their respective colleagues and students, have been examining the effects of social support from friends, parents, and school personnel on adolescents’ psychopathology and risk behaviors. They studied both community-dwelling American adolescents and Israeli adolescents who are routinely exposed to political and terror violence. Their research shows that, in most instances, <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> <b>support</b> is a double-edged sword, conferring both risk and resilience. An exception to this pattern appears to be <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> <b>support</b> from family members, which - according to Shahar and Henrich - should be the principal target of preventive interventions.|$|E

He has also argued that the temperament dimensions are associated with subjective well-being and to some extent with physical health. A study examining relationships between character dimensions and aspects of health and happiness found that self-directedness was strongly associated with happiness, satisfaction with life, general health, and <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> <b>support.</b> Cooperativeness was associated most strongly with <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> <b>support</b> and only weakly with the other well-being measures.

50|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{dedicated}} specifically to understanding the effects of social support in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a study by Haden et al., when victims of severe trauma perceived high levels of social support and engaged in interpersonal coping styles, they {{were less likely to}} develop severe PTSD when compared to those who perceived lower levels of social support. These results suggest that high levels of social support alleviate the strong positive association between level of injury and severity of PTSD, and thus serves as a powerful protective factor. In general, data shows that the support of family and friends has a positive influence on an individual's ability to cope with trauma. In fact, a meta-analysis by Brewin et al. found that social support was the strongest predictor, accounting for 40%, of variance in PTSD severity.

50|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain social support’s link to health. Stress and coping social support theory dominates social support research and is designed to explain the buffering hypothesis described above. According to this theory, social support protects people from the bad health effects of stressful events (i.e., stress buffering) by influencing how people think about and cope with the events. According to stress and coping theory, events are stressful insofar as people have negative thoughts about the event (appraisal) and cope ineffectively. Coping consists of deliberate, conscious actions such as problem solving or relaxation. As applied to social support, stress and coping theory suggests that social support promotes adaptive appraisal and coping. Evidence for stress and coping social support theory is found in studies that observe stress buffering effects for <b>perceived</b> <b>social</b> <b>support.</b> One problem with this theory is that, as described previously, stress buffering is not seen for social integration, and that received support is typically not linked to better health outcomes.|$|E
