5|$|While {{work on the}} Synopsis of Quadrupeds {{was still}} in progress, Pennant decided on a journey to Scotland, a {{relatively}} unexplored country and not previously visited by a naturalist. He set out in June 1769 and kept a journal and made sketches as he travelled. He visited the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast on the way and was much impressed by the breeding seabird colonies. He entered Scotland via Berwick-on-Tweed and proceeded via Edinburgh and up the east coast, continuing through Perth, Aberdeen and Inverness. His return journey south took him through Fort William, Glen Awe, Inverary and Glasgow. He was unimpressed by the climate but was interested in all he saw and made enquiries about the local economy. He described in detail the scenery around Loch Ness. He enthused over the Arctic char, a fish new to him but did not mention a monster in the lake. He observed red deer, black grouse, white hares and ptarmigan. He saw the capercaillie in the forests of Glenmoriston and Strathglass and mentioned the <b>pine</b> <b>grosbeak,</b> the only occasion on which it has been recorded from Scotland. He enquired into the fisheries and commerce of the different places he passed through and visited the great houses, reporting on the antiquities he found there. He finished his journey by visiting Edinburgh again and travelling through Moffat, Gretna and Carlisle {{on his way back}} to Wales, having taken about three months on his travels. On his return home, Pennant wrote an account of his tour in Scotland which met with some acclaim and which may have been responsible for an increase in the number of English people visiting the country.|$|E

500|$|A {{subcommittee}} {{was set up}} in 1997 {{to undertake}} a review of rare bird records from the years immediately prior to BBRC's establishment. The purpose of the review was to ensure that all records from 1950 onwards (the cut-off date for Category A of the BOU British List of birds) have been subjected to a similar level of scrutiny. Not all of the 1,100 records of species considered to be rarities at that time were assessed, but only those related to species not recorded more than 100 times by 1997, as well as a few records of less rare species under particularly unusual circumstances, which were termed [...] "sore thumbs". Much of the original documentation was unavailable for the review, as it had been lost, and so for many records, the review was based solely on published accounts of the birds. The most notable outcome of this review was the reidentification of a frigatebird record from Tiree in 1953. Previously identified as a magnificent frigatebird, the BBRC review concluded that the bird was in fact an Ascension frigatebird, the only individual of this species ever identified in Europe (Walbridge, Small & McGowan 2003). The full results of the review were published in 2006. Of the 126 records reviewed, 37 were rejected as unacceptable. These included a claimed white-tailed eagle, which broke into a chicken-run in a garden and stole a chicken, three little crakes, three European scops owls, the only late December record of tawny pipit, three black-eared wheatears, a record of two White's thrushes together in April, a spring lanceolated warbler, two moustached warblers and a <b>pine</b> <b>grosbeak.</b> Furthermore, issues were found with the identification of Britain's first western sandpiper, on Fair Isle in 1956, and these led the BOURC to reject this record. The western sandpiper has been recorded several times subsequently in Britain however, and remains on the national list. The subcommittee's final report also hints at the prospect that some records from immediately prior to 1950 may be incorrect; because these fell outside the timeframes of the review they were not reassessed.|$|E

The evolution of the bullfinch species started soon after the pine grosbeak's ancestors diverged from them (at {{the end of the}} Middle Miocene, about a dozen mya), and {{it is quite possible that}} the latter species evolved in North America; what is fairly certain is that the bullfinch radiation started in the general area of the Himalayas.

50|$|In Tartaria, the American mink's most {{important}} food items are voles, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and aquatic insects. In winter, aquatic foods predominate, while land-based prey increases in importance during the spring. Within the Altai Mountains, the American mink feeds predominantly on mammals such as rodents, shrews, and moles, {{as well as}} birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Among the 11 different bird species preyed upon by minks in Altai are dippers and <b>pine</b> <b>grosbeaks.</b> Among fish, small species predominate in the diet of minks in Altai, and include; minnows, gudgeons, and wide-headed sculpins. In the Sverdlovsk and Irkutsk Oblasts, mouse-like rodents are their {{most important}} foods, followed by birds, fish and insects. In the Russian Far East, where crustaceans are scarce, the American mink feeds extensively on amphipods. In the British Isles, dietary composition varies seasonally and regionally. European rabbits are the most commonly taken prey in areas where they are common, especially in summer. A range of small rodents and insectivores are preyed upon, but to a lesser degree. European hares are occasionally attacked. Minks in Britain prey on several bird species, with ducks, moorhens, and coots being most frequently targeted on lakes and rivers, while gulls are taken in coastal habitats. Aquatic species preyed upon in Britain include European eels, rock-pool fish such as blenny, shore crabs and crayfish. American minks have been implicated in {{the decline of the}} water vole in the United Kingdom and linked to the decline of waterfowl across their range in Europe. They are now considered vermin in much of Europe and are hunted for the purpose of wildlife management.

Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME) caused by E. chaffeensis occurs across a broad area of the eastern and south-central United States. HME is transmitted by lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum). Human granulocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HGE) caused by a currently unnamed organism closely related to or perhaps identical with E. equi or E. phagocytophila has been diagnosed mainly in the northeastern, upper midwestern, and western United States. HGE is transmitted by black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis and I. pacificus). A combined total of over 1, 200 cases of HME and HGE were diagnosed in people between 1986 and 1997. The third zoonotic ehrlichiosis, caused by E. ewingii, was diagnosed in four people from Missouri in 1999. Ehrlichia ewingii is known to occur in dogs in several other states in the eastern United States and is transmitted by lone star ticks. • Bovine tuberculosis (TB) recently was found in an eighth domestic cattle herd in Michigan. All TB-positive cattle herds and the single hunting enclosure containing captive deer with TB were located in the northeastern portion of Michigan’s lower peninsula where TB is endemic in free-ranging deer. • Lead Poisoning at a Shooting Range: In May 1999, a yellow-rumped warbler and a gray squirrel found at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynn County, Georgia, were submitted to SCWDS for diagnosis of central nervous system disease.
