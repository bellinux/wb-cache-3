HarbstreitJohn Deere Corporation {{sponsors}} 16 schools {{within the}} United States {{that are designed}} to educate students to become future agricultural equipment technicians. At the time of this study, the schools’ enrollments were at a less-than desirable level, 80 % capacity. However, the company was receiving feedback that dealerships needed technicians. The need to determine the disparity between the need for technicians and the level of enrollment led to the pursuit of this study. The researcher sampled 306 John Deere agricultural service managers across the continental United States to determine: (a) if the dealerships truly needed technicians, (b) the methods dealerships were using for locating technicians, and (c) the service managers’ perceptions of the John Deere (JD) Ag Tech program. The study also analyzed the relationships between the service managers’ perceptions of the JD Ag Tech program and five independent variables: (a) number of technicians employed at John Deere dealerships, (b) number of stores dealer-organizations own, (c) distance between John Deere dealerships and the closest JD Ag Tech school, (d) number of JD Ag Tech students John Deere dealerships have sponsored, and (e) service managers’ age. The results of the study indicated that John Deere service managers did <b>plan</b> to hire <b>technicians</b> over the next 12 months as well as over the next three years. However, it was also determined that 60 % of the service managers were only somewhat knowledgeable or unfamiliar with the JD Ag Tech Program.

The researcher’s recommendations focused upon two areas. The first was to improve the marketing of the JD Ag Tech program to insure that all John Deere service managers become familiar with the program.

40|$|In 2001, the Catholic University of Chile {{undertook}} a maintenance benchmarking study of six open pit copper mines having mill capacities varying between 18, 000 t/d and 156, 000 t/d, and collectively responsible for 58 % of Chilean copper production. Key performance indices {{were selected to}} measure the effectiveness, efficiency, {{and development of the}} maintenance process. Key effectiveness indices used in the mining industry are equipment availability, reliability, and maintainability and safety indices. Reliability is often measured by mean time between failures (MTBF) and maintainability as the mean time to repair or restore service (MTTR). At the time of undertaking the benchmarking study (2001), only two of the six participating mines routinely measured these parameters. For this reason, the study focused on comparing fleet availabilities. Accident rate and accident severity (expressed as the number of lost time incidents and lost time hours per million man hours, respectively) were solicited for all permanent and contracted maintenance personnel. Financial data provided by the participating companies included total annual maintenance and mining costs, as well as a breakdown of labour, materials, and contractor costs. This data, when combined with ore and waste production data, enabled the unit costs of maintenance to be calculated. Internal efficiency indicators were solicited for: * the percentage of planned maintenance (preventive, predictive, and programmed major component replacement) carried out on each equipment fleet (blasthole drills, hydraulic and cable shovels, wheel loaders, haul trucks, and auxiliary equipment); * scheduled maintenance compliance (actual planned hours versus scheduled planned hours); * organizational efficiency in terms of the ratio of supervisors to maintenance technicians; * investment in maintenance planning as evident from the ratio of planners to maintenance <b>technicians</b> (<b>planning</b> clerks and statisticians were also considered to be maintenance planners); and * efficiency in inventory practices as evident from the stores turnover ratio and service level. Development indices were solicited for the educational level of maintenance employees and the level of commitment to maintenance training by both the companies and their collaborators, in terms of annual training hours and investment per employee. The principal conclusions of the study were as follows: * For the six open pit mines that participated in the study, maintenance costs were found to average 44 % of mining costs. This highlights the importance of the direct cost of maintenance to the financial performance of mines. * Percentage planned maintenance of equipment fleets were low by world standards, averaging 35 %, 56 %, and 44 %, respectively, for blasthole drill, shovel, and haul truck fleets. * Fleet availabilities were significantly influenced by the percentage of planned maintenance achieved. For example, haul truck fleet availabilities were found to increase on average by 1 % for every 4 % increase in planned maintenance over the range examined. * Maintenance cost per equipment was found to decrease non-linearly with increases in percentage planned maintenance. An empirical relationship was determined {{that can be used to}} estimate potential cost savings as a result of improved planned maintenance practices (see figure). * The ratio of maintenance planning staff to maintenance technicians varied between 1 : 10 and 1 : 24, indicating improvement opportunities for some of the participating companies. Investment in technical training (including planned maintenance practice) was found to be low by global industry standards. It was concluded that fleet availability and maintenance costs in Chilean open pit operations could be considerably improved by improving and/or developing maintenance planning standards, and training personnel in planned maintenance technique...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Airline {{scheduling}} is {{the process}} of scheduling available aircraft and crews such that all flights that an airline operates are serviced. The goal is to develop a minimum-cost plan in which all aircraft and crews have tasks assigned to them. Aircraft operate sequences of flights, so-called routes, that must not violate maintenance requirements. Crews have pairings assigned to them, which are sequences of flights that respect several rules regarding work-load and rest periods. Due to its complexity, the airline scheduling is typically done sequentially, decomposing the entire problem into six more tractable sub-problems: the schedule design, fleet assignment, aircraft routing, crew pairing, crew rostering, and the tail assignment problem. The schedule design problem determines which flights should be offered, while the fleet assignment problem assigns the flights to aircraft types, matching aircraft capacity and expected demand as much as possible. The aircraft routing problem generates generic aircraft routes, whereas the crew pairing problem creates generic pairings. These pairings are then put together to form monthly rosters in the crew rostering problem. Finally, in the tail assignment problem, the generic routes are assigned to individual aircraft. An issue of the sequential approach is that later stages depend on decisions made in earlier stages. For example, the initial location, time since last maintenance checks of each required type, and usage history of the individual aircraft is not known with certainty in the aircraft routing problem. Thus, in the tail assignment problem, an assignment of the generic routes to available aircraft may not be possible without making costly adjustments to the routes. Another major disadvantage is caused by the long lead times and long planning horizons of the individual stages. Usually the aircraft routing and crew pairing problems are solved several weeks or even months before putting a plan into action, the so-called day of operations. As a result, routes and pairings will be formed based on forecasts and historical flight data. Often the circumstances do not eventuate according to the predictions, requiring modifications to routes and pairings close to or on the day of operations. While disruptive events on the day of operations will still occur, and {{have to be dealt with}} accordingly, many events leading up to that date may be considered if scheduling closer to the day of operations. For example, a change in workforce between solving the crew pairing problem and the day of operations may invalidate the crew pairing solution. Another example is that often minor equipment failures, such as a defective toilet, are tolerated if an aircraft's scheduled maintenance is not too far in the future. However, these issues may accumulate, possibly resulting in additional unscheduled maintenance. When scheduling close to the day of operations, these minor failures are largely known and can be accounted for by scheduling maintenance earlier than originally anticipated. Scheduling close to the day of operations also enables re-visiting fleeting decisions. The fleet assignment problem is solved months in advance, at which point demand is largely unknown. The literature indicates that the majority of the demand for each flight is realised during the last weeks prior to flight departure and that profit can be increased significantly if the fleeting decisions are revisited. However, since the aircraft routing problem is solved separately for each aircraft fleet, reassigning a flight to a different fleet due to updated demand information will invalidate the aircraft routes. Scheduling close to the day of operations overcomes this obstacle as routes are generated when most of the demand has been realised. Naturally, information becomes significantly more accurate as the day of operations approaches. The paradigm this thesis is based on allows an integrated aircraft routing, crew pairing, and tail assignment problem to be solved only a few days before the day of operations. At that point in time, it should be possible to predict location and status of crews and aircraft more accurately. In this paradigm, crews are not told the exact pairings they will be operating after the crew rostering phase; they will only be notified of days on and off. We then form "crew blocks", in which we aggregate all crews that have the same work period, i. e. consecutive working days, and are based at the same location. Then, for the purpose of our mathematical model, the crews represented by a crew block are considered identical. The solver will generate an appropriate number of pairings for each crew block. Since the work periods differ between crew blocks, we have to generate pairings for each individual crew block. Solving an integrated model this close to the day of operations means we can generate routes specifically for each aircraft, thereby eliminating the need to later assign routes to aircraft. The routes consider the location and maintenance requirements of the individual aircraft. Unlike standard aircraft routing, we consider all maintenance requirements that the aircraft has during the planning horizon. A downside of scheduling this close to the day of operations is that other processes and company divisions may be affected negatively. For example maintenance <b>planning</b> and <b>technician</b> rostering have to be carried out more timely, and, as already mentioned, crew members have to be more flexible as their final pairings are only revealed four days in advance. This may require higher financial compensation, however, we believe this to be offset by the benefits of using more accurate information when scheduling routes and pairings. To solve the integrated aircraft routing, crew pairing, and tail assignment problem, we use mathematical programming, more precisely we develop a column generation formulation in which the master problem ensures that all flights are covered by one aircraft and one crew. Additionally, it contains constraints that model the interaction of aircraft and crew along short and restricted connections: on short connections a crew must stay with an aircraft because insufficient time is available to physically move to another gate. Restricted connections are likely to propagate flight delays; staying with an aircraft avoids spreading the delay, thus increasing schedule robustness. All maintenance and crewing rules are relegated to the pricing problems, which are modeled as resource constrained shortest path problems with replenishments, where the replenishments represent maintenance checks for aircraft or rest periods for crews. The specific rules considered in our problem require several extensions to the standard resource constrained shortest path problems with replenishments. We present a labelling algorithm that is capable of handling these extensions. Furthermore, we develop a preprocessing procedure that significantly reduces the computational effort in the labelling algorithm. To obtain integer solutions to the integrated problem, we develop a branch-and-price algorithm based on follow-on branching. We evaluate the fitness of several column generation acceleration strategies to solve our problem by conducting numerical experiments on real world instances. Since we generate routes specifically for each aircraft and pairings specifically for each crew block, we must solve a large number of pricing problems. We develop several strategies to address this challenge. In the most straight-forward strategy, we solve all pricing problems in each column generation iteration. Another option is to solve only a subset of the pricing problems per iteration where the pricing problems are in a fixed order. In a third strategy, we chose a subset based on how well each pricing problem performed recently, and on the current state of the overall problem. The impact of these strategies on solution time, convergence of the column generation procedure, and the quality of the dual bound is investigated. We present detailed numerical results for real world and artificial instances of varying sizes. As perhaps the strongest methodological innovation in the thesis, we develop aggregated forms of pricing problems, which we call "superimposed pricing problems". These pricing problems can be solved instead of the many individual pricing problems as they fulfill the requirements of column generation, that is to generate the most negative reduced cost column among the represented pricing problems or prove that no such column exists. These superimposed pricing problems are slightly larger than the original problems but a much smaller number needs to be solved. We present numerical results, in which we compare their performance and impact on the overall branch-and-price algorithm to that of the regular pricing problem selection strategies. Lastly, we combine the ideas by solving only a subset of the superimposed pricing problems...|$|R
40|$| merely {{mine the}} soil with the extra water available. These {{techniques}} are based on local traditions - often {{a good starting point}} for technical design. Ideally farmers should be offered a 'menu' of possible solutions based on participatory <b>planning</b> discussions with <b>technicians.</b> It may be that farmers prefer a technically 'sub-optimal' solution, for reasons that remain difficult for the specialists to understand. Certainly farmer-choice should be guided by specialists: but 'solutions' should not be imposed from outside. 7 Equip farmers Farmers must be enabled to participate by providing appropriate incentives. Many soil and water conservation projects have previously had the tendency to equip themselves with lorries, graders and other machinery and thereby to do things for the farmers. But as we move away from the project approach towards a participatory and sustainable process, the trend should be to improve farmers' access to tools (hoes, shovels etc) inputs (seedlings of trees, splits of grasses etc) and appropriate means of transport (wheelbarrows and donkey carts), in order to facilitate their work. Food-forwork is rarely a good means of motivating farmers to work on their own land: it is better reserved for public works. Where contour stone bunds are being constructed in the Sahel, arguments have been forwarded that 'erosion goes faster than a donkey cart' and therefore it is more cost effective to use lorries for the transport of stones. These arguments overlook important aspects: (1) donkey carts are multipurpose; they will not be used only for the transport of stones, but also for the transport of manure from compost pits to the fields; (2) donkey carts, wheelbarrows, hoes etc. can be produced in the region and repaired locally. In this way they can contribute to the generation of non-farm employment. Investment in restoration is justified The possibilities for higher and more reliable levels of production of food, fodder and fuel throughout sub-Saharan Africa are probably brighter than has often been assumed. It is evidently possible to restore barren land to productivity in some semiarid regions by using simple techniques, implemented by farmers themselves. In the higher potential regions a move towards 'land husbandry' can link the restoration of fertility in soils with improved plant productivity. Despite some recent international pessimism, the evidence suggests a justification for investment in the restoration and conservation of these lands. A further cause for optimism is found in exploding a much repeated myth: that population pressure inevitably leads to increased land degradation. It does not. There may be a case to be made that an increase in population does initially cause disruption to a given agricultural system - and some increased degradation often ensues - but a further population growth can also have the stimulating effect of motivating land users to protect and improve their basic resources. The people in these regions have their backs against the wall and they have a simple choice: invest in the land or migrate. Indeed these are the situations where soil and water conservation programmes can be at their most effective. A study recently undertaken in Kenya's Machakos District shows that despite a five-fold increase in population between the 1930 s- 1940 s and the 1990 s, soil erosion and degradation had actually declined during the period. Donor agencies have an obligation and a desire to disburse money for soil and water conservation in Africa, and they wish to see tangible results. Now is the time for donors and governments to move away from a 'project' mentality, and to help to develop a sustainable 'process' approach. Projects can be a starting point, but the next immediate goal must be the development of a trained cadre of multipurpose extensionists under a national programme. The ultimate objective is to enable land users to combat land degradation themselves, by providing them with the tools and the requisite know-how. It is they who suffer when land loses its productivity, and they will be the ones to benefit when fertility is restored.
