40|$|We {{summarize}} {{progress to}} date on “universally <b>programmable</b> intelligence <b>matter</b> ” (the use of general-purpose autonomous molecular computation [AMC] for nanostructure synthesis and control), and on this basis discuss directions for future research. Accomplishments include an analysis of extensions to combinatory logic required for nanotechnology and an investigation (through simulation) of the assembly {{of a variety of}} membranes, nanotubes, pores, channels, actuators, and other important structures. We also outline the requirements and possible solutions for molecular implementation of this computational model. In addition to discussing the successes and limitations of molecular combinatory computing, the approach that has been investigated to date, we also suggest an alternative approach to AMC that may be more suitable for nanotechnology due to its greater insensitivity to error and stochastic effects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{explain how}} a small set of {{molecular}} building blocks {{will allow the}} implementation of “universally <b>programmable</b> intelligent <b>matter,</b> ” that is, matter whose structure, properties, and behavior can be programmed, quite literally, at the molecular level. I. DEFINITIONS Intelligent matter is any material in which individual molecules or supra-molecular clusters function as agents to accomplish some purpose. Intelligent matter may be solid, liquid, or gaseous, although liquids and membranes are perhaps most typical. Universally <b>programmable</b> intelligent <b>matter</b> (UPIM) is made from a small set of molecular building blocks that are universal {{in the sense that}} they can be rearranged to accomplish any purpose that can be described by a computer program. In effect, a computer program controls the behavior of the material at the molecular level. In some applications the molecules self-assemble a desired nanostructure by “computing ” the structure and then becoming inactive. In other applications the material remains active so that it can respond, at the molecular level, to its environment or to other external conditions. An extreme case is when programmable supra-molecular clusters act as autonomous agents to achieve some end. Although materials may be engineered for specific purposes, we will get much greater technological leverage by designing a “universal material ” which, like a generalpurpose computer, can be “programmed ” for a wide range of applications. To accomplish this, we must identify a set of molecular primitives that can be combined for widely varying purposes. The existence of such universal molecular operations might seem highly unlikely, but there is suggestive evidence that it may be possible to discover or synthesize them. II. APPROACH Accomplishing the goals of UPIM will require the identification of a small set of molecular building blocks that i...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} <b>programmable</b> liquid <b>matter</b> which can {{dynamically}} transform its 2 D shape into {{a variety of}} forms and present unique organic animations based on spatio-temporally controlled electric fields. We deployed a EGaIn (Gallium indium eutectic alloy) liquid metal as our smart liquid material since it features a superior electric conductivity in spite of a liquid state and presents a high dynamic range of surface tension and 2 D area controlled by applied voltage strength and polarity. Our proposed liquid metal shape and motion control algorithms with dynamically patterned electric fields realize path tracing organic animation. We demonstrate an interactive 7 x 7 electrode array control system with a computer vision based GUI system to enable novice users to physically draw alphabet letters and 2 D shapes by unique animatronics of liquid metals...|$|R

The ability of nucleic acid arrays to arrange other molecules indicates its potential applications in molecular scale electronics. [...] The assembly of a nucleic acid structure {{could be used to}} template the assembly of a molecular electronic elements such as molecular wires, providing a method for nanometer-scale control of the placement and overall architecture of the device analogous to a molecular breadboard. [...] DNA nanotechnology has been compared to the concept of <b>programmable</b> <b>matter</b> because of the coupling of computation to its material properties.|$|E
2500|$|The {{driving force}} behind <b>programmable</b> <b>matter</b> is the actual {{hardware}} that is manipulating itself into whatever form is desired. [...] Claytronics consists {{of a collection of}} individual components called claytronic atoms, or catoms. [...] In order to be viable, catoms need to fit a set of criteria. First, catoms {{need to be able to}} move in three dimensions relative to each other and be able to adhere to each other to form a three-dimensional shape. Second, the catoms need to be able to communicate with each other in an ensemble and be able to compute state information, possibly with assistance from each other. [...] Fundamentally, catoms consist of a CPU, a network device for communication, a single pixel display, several sensors, an onboard battery, and a means to adhere to one another.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{interrogate}} Marx’s analysis of the circulation of capital through the ‘new materialist’ communications and media theory of Friedrich Kittler. It explores the connections between Marx’s commodity fetish and how Kittler posits human beings as components of an information system alongside technologies and institutions. The article ask whether a ‘non-human’ Marxist theory is possible, i. e. if it is possible to remove the human being from its privileged position in Marx’s political economy. Specifically the paper argues that human beings are <b>programmable</b> human <b>matter</b> that serves to aid the communication of value through capital’s circuit. This stance necessitates adopting the point of view of capital and the fetish, bracketing the social and moving away from categories such as labour, production and class consciousness in favour of the value form, circulation and programmability...|$|R

40|$|Markov chain Monte Carlo {{methods have}} become {{ubiquitous}} across {{science and engineering}} to model dynamics and explore large sets of configurations. The idea is to perform a random walk among the configurations so that even though {{only a very small}} part of the space is visited, samples will be drawn from a desirable distribution. Over the last 20 years there have been tremendous advances in the design and analysis of efficient sampling algorithms for this purpose, building on insights from statistical physics. One of the striking discoveries has been the realization that many natural Markov chains undergo phase transitions, whereby they change from being efficient to inefficient as some parameter of the system is modified, also revealing interesting properties of the underlying random structures. We will explore how phase transitions can provide valuable insights in three settings. First, they allow us to understand the limitations of certain classes of sampling algorithms, potentially leading to faster alternative approaches. Second, they reveal statistical properties of stationary distributions, giving insight into various interacting models. Example include colloids, or binary mixtures of molecules, segregation models, where individuals are more likely move when they are unhappy with their local demographics, and interacting particle systems from statistical physics. Last, they predict emergent phenomena that can be harnessed for the design of distributed algorithms for certain asynchronous models of <b>programmable</b> active <b>matter.</b> We will see how these three research threads are closely interrelated and inform one another. The talk will take a random walk through some of the results included in the references...|$|R
5000|$|In {{one school}} of thought the {{programming}} could be external to the material and might be achieved by the [...] "application of light, voltage, electric or magnetic fields, etc." [...] For example, a liquid crystal display {{is a form of}} <b>programmable</b> <b>matter.</b> A second {{school of thought}} is that the individual units of the ensemble can compute and the result of their computation is a change in the ensemble's physical properties. An example of this more ambitious form of <b>programmable</b> <b>matter</b> is claytronics. There are many proposed implementations of <b>programmable</b> <b>matter.</b> Scale is one key differentiator between different forms of <b>programmable</b> <b>matter.</b> At one end of the spectrum reconfigurable modular robotics pursues a form of <b>programmable</b> <b>matter</b> where the individual units are in the centimeter size range.At the nanoscale end of the spectrum there are a tremendous number of different bases for <b>programmable</b> <b>matter,</b> ranging from shape changing molecules to quantum dots. Quantum dots are in fact often referred to as artificial atoms. In the micrometer to sub-millimeter range examples include MEMS-based units, cells created using synthetic biology, and the utility fog concept.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, the DARPA Information Science and Technology group (ISAT) {{examined}} {{the potential of}} <b>programmable</b> <b>matter.</b> This resulted in the 2005-2006 study [...] "Realizing Programmable Matter", which laid out a multi-year program for {{the research and development}} of <b>programmable</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a solution of}} automata similar to Population Protocols and Network Constructors. The automata (or nodes) move passively in a well-mixed solution and can cooperate by interacting in pairs. Every such interaction may result in an update of the local states of the nodes. Additionally, the nodes may also choose to connect {{to each other in}} order to start forming some required structure. We may think of such nodes as the smallest possible <b>programmable</b> pieces of <b>matter.</b> The model that we introduce here is a more applied version of Network Constructors, imposing physical (or geometrical) constraints on the connections. Each node can connect to other nodes only via a very limited number of local ports, therefore at any given time it has only a bounded number of neighbors. Connections are always made at unit distance and are perpendicular to connections of neighboring ports. We show that this restricted model is still capable of forming very practical 2 D or 3 D shapes. We provide direct constructors for some basic shape construction problems. We then develop new techniques for determining the constructive capabilities of our model. One of the main novelties of our approach, concerns our attempt to overcome the inability of such systems to detect termination. In particular, we exploit the assumptions that the system is well-mixed and has a unique leader, in order to give terminating protocols that are correct with high probability (w. h. p.). This allows us to develop terminating subroutines that can be sequentially composed to form larger modular protocols. One of our main results is a terminating protocol counting the size $n$ of the system w. h. p [...] We then use this protocol as a subroutine in order to develop our universal constructors, establishing that the nodes can self-organize w. h. p. into arbitrarily complex shapes while still detecting termination of the construction.

50|$|Electrons {{which are}} trapped in an {{electromagnetic}} cavity are in a bound state and thus organise themselves {{as they do in}} a regular atom, thus expressing chemical-like behaviour.

5000|$|Another {{example of}} an {{application}} has been coined [...] "telepario" [...] by CMU professors Todd Mowry and Seth Goldstein. What the researchers propose to make are moving, physical,three-dimensional replicas of people or objects, so lifelike that human senses would accept them as real. This would {{eliminate the need for}} cumbersome virtual reality gear and overcome the viewing angle limitations of modern 3D approaches. The replicas would mimic the shape and appearance of a person or object being imaged in real time, and as the originals moved, so would their replicas. One aspect of this application is that the main development thrust is geometric representation rather than applying forces to the environment as in a typical robotic manipulation task.
