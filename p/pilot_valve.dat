5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E
25|$|Some demand valves use a small, {{sensitive}} <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> {{to control}} {{the opening of the}} main valve. The Poseidon Jetstream and Xstream and Oceanic Omega second stages are examples of this technology. They can produce very high flow rates for a small pressure differential, and particularly for a relatively small cracking pressure. They are generally more complicated and expensive to service.|$|E

50|$|If the <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> is opened, water drains {{from the}} upper chamber and its {{pressure}} is reduced. The <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> is always larger in flowrate than the filling through the throttle valve. Pressure in the annular chamber now forces the piston upstream, lifting the valve body from the conical seat and opening the valve.|$|E

5000|$|When high {{pressures}} and large orifices are encountered, then high forces are required. To generate those forces, an internally <b>piloted</b> solenoid <b>valve</b> design may be possible. In such a design, the line pressure {{is used to}} generate the high valve forces; a small solenoid controls how the line pressure is used. Internally <b>piloted</b> <b>valves</b> are used in dishwashers and irrigation systems where the fluid is water, the pressure might be [...] and the orifice diameter might be 3/4 in.|$|R
50|$|Many valves are {{controlled}} manually with a handle {{attached to the}} stem. If the handle is turned ninety degrees between operating positions, the valve is called a quarter-turn valve. Butterfly, ball valves, and plug valves are often quarter-turn valves. If the handle is circular with the stem as the axis of rotation {{in the center of}} the circle, then the handle is called a handwheel. Valves can also be controlled by actuators attached to the stem. They can be electromechanical actuators such as an electric motor or solenoid, pneumatic actuators which {{are controlled}} by air pressure, or hydraulic actuators which are controlled by the pressure of a liquid such as oil or water. Actuators can be used for the purposes of automatic control such as in washing machine cycles, remote control such as the use of a centralised control room, or because manual control is too difficult such as when the valve is very large. Pneumatic actuators and hydraulic actuators need pressurised air or liquid lines to supply the actuator: an inlet line and an outlet line. <b>Pilot</b> <b>valves</b> are valves which are used to control other <b>valves.</b> <b>Pilot</b> <b>valves</b> in the actuator lines control the supply of air or liquid going to the actuators.|$|R

50|$|A bi-stable {{pneumatic}} valve is typically a <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> {{that is a}} 3 ported 2 position detented valve. The valve retains its position during loss of power, hence the bi-stable name.|$|E

40|$|Valve {{consists}} of small geared reversible motor, operated by momentary contact closure, which drives shaft with O-rings placed to seal selected ports. Shaft rotates and also moves axially, causing ports to be alternately connected and disconnected. Electrical control of valve {{is provided by}} limit switches and relays. Design has advantage over other available valves: less precision machining of parts is required; machining operations are less expensive.

50|$|In some {{solenoid valves}} the solenoid acts {{directly}} on the main valve. Others use a small, complete solenoid valve, known as a pilot, to actuate a larger valve. While the second type is actually a solenoid valve combined with a pneumatically actuated valve, they are sold and packaged as a single unit {{referred to as a}} solenoid <b>valve.</b> <b>Piloted</b> <b>valves</b> require much less power to control, but they are noticeably slower. Piloted solenoids usually need full power at all times to open and stay open, where a direct acting solenoid may only need full power {{for a short period of}} time to open it, and only low power to hold it.|$|R
50|$|The {{gyroscope}} senses {{the rolling}} tilt degree in real-time. It inputs push-pull control operation force to a <b>pilot</b> <b>valve,</b> sliding {{it inside the}} main controller to switch two output valves exclusively to the rudders.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} from the pilot tube to the dome is routed through the actual control <b>pilot</b> <b>valve.</b> There are many designs but the control pilot is essentially a conventional PRV with the special job of controlling pressure to the main valve dome. The pressure at which the control pilot relieves at is the functional set pressure of the PORV. When the <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> reaches set pressure it opens and releases the {{pressure from}} the dome. The piston is then free to open and the main valve exhausts the system fluid. The control pilot opens either to the main valve exhaust pipe or to atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|At {{intermediate}} positions, {{pressure in}} the two chambers is balanced and the valve remains part-open. This depends on the piston size, the pressure reduction downstream and the flows through the two control valves. The <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> gives a proportional control over main valve flowrate, with the opening being controlled, slow and gradual.|$|E

50|$|Internally {{the fixed}} valve body is {{constructed}} as a cylinder, with the moving {{part of the}} valve within this as a piston. The conical valve {{is part of this}} piston. The piston is double-acting and splits the internal valve body in two, with water pressure on both sides. The upper side of the piston is larger, the full diameter of the piston, and is supplied with water through a throttling valve; normally adjusted and then left in position. The lower side of the piston is an annular space surrounding the moving valve body and maintained at the lower (Bernoulli) water pressure. The tip of the conical valve contains a small <b>pilot</b> <b>valve,</b> linking the upper chamber of the valve to the downstream drain below the valve. This <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> is controlled mechanically from outside the valve chamber and is the main control over the valve position.|$|E

50|$|In newer {{models of}} constant-speed {{propeller}}s, oil is pumped through the propeller shaft to push on a piston {{that drives the}} mechanism to change pitch. The flow of oil and the pitch are controlled by a governor, consisting of a speeder spring, flyweights, and a <b>pilot</b> <b>valve.</b> The tension of the speeder spring is set by the propeller control lever, which sets the RPMs. The governor will maintain that RPM setting until an engine overspeed or underspeed condition exists. When an overspeed condition occurs, the propeller begins to rotate faster than the desired RPM setting. This would occur as the plane descends and airspeed increases. The flyweights begin to pull outward due to centrifugal force which further compresses the speeder spring. As that happens, the piston moves forward, allowing the <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> to open and oil to flow from the oil sump into the hub. This increase in oil pressure will increase the {{pitch of the propeller}} angle causing it to slow back down to the desired RPM setting. When an underspeed condition occurs, as in a climb with loss of airspeed, just the opposite takes place. The airspeed decreases, causing the propeller to slow down. This will cause the flyweights to move inward due to a lack in centrifugal force and tension will be released from the speeder spring. As this happens, the piston will move in the opposite direction causing the <b>pilot</b> <b>valve</b> to allow oil to flow from the hub back to the oil sump. The propeller blade angle will now decrease to a lower pitch allowing the propeller to speed back up to the desired RPM setting. This process usually takes place frequently throughout flight.|$|E

The mathematical model of a hydraulic system including a spool <b>valve</b> <b>piloted</b> by the PZT valve was developed and incorporated into Simulink, and its simulation results were given.

50|$|From this {{explanation}} {{it can be}} seen that this type of valve relies on a differential of pressure between input and output as the pressure at the input must always be greater than the pressure at the output for it to work.

40|$|Counterbalance valves {{are widely}} used in {{hydraulic}} deck machinery to balance the overrunning loads. However, as is well known, counterbalance circuit designed with poor choice of counterbalance valve tends to introduce instability to the system. This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a <b>pilot</b> operated counterbalance <b>valve</b> which can operate at a flow rate about 2000 L/min. A linearized stability analysis of such a hydraulic circuit which consists of a slip in cartridge, a <b>pilot</b> counterbalance <b>valve</b> and a hydraulic winch is presented. Pole-zero plots are employed to reveal {{the effect of the}} volume of control cavity, the hydraulic resistance on pilot line and counterbalance <b>valve</b> <b>pilot</b> area ratio on the stability of the system. The analysis results indicate that such a system will be unstable within the normal range of each parameter. An alternative approach that guarantees system stability by adding an accumulator on the pilot line is put forward. The approach stabilizes the pilot pressure by reducing the hydro-stiffness of pilot control cavity, thus the system can reach its stability condition. Finally, a numerical optimization method is putted forward, with the optimized parameters, the dynamic performance of considered system become better...|$|R
