5|$|Belushi {{had become}} a star in 1978 {{as a result of}} both the Blues Brothers' musical success and his role in National Lampoon's Animal House.

When Aykroyd and Belushi decided they could make a Blues Brothers film, the bidding war was intense. Universal Studios narrowly beat Paramount <b>Pictures</b> <b>for</b> the project.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1940s, Coggins {{obtained}} more work producing war <b>pictures</b> <b>for</b> other magazines, including {{a series of}} double-page spreads for the controversial newspaper PM, and illustrations for The Saturday Evening Post. Throughout the war years, most of the output of many large corporations was reserved for materiel production; however, management were keen to promote their connection {{to the war effort}} and keep their name before the buying public until they could resume peacetime sales. Coggins received advertising commissions from such corporations including Elco, Koppers, US Steel, and Westinghouse. He also received commissions from the U.S. War Department for aircraft recognition charts, and he was intrigued to later find these charts used during his army basic training.|$|E
5|$|Essential Media Entertainment and BBC Films {{initially}} developed Saving Mr. Banks as {{an independent}} production until 2011, when producer Alison Owen approached Walt Disney <b>Pictures</b> <b>for</b> permission to use copyrighted elements. The film's subject matter piqued Disney's interest, leading the studio to acquire the screenplay and produce the film. Principal photography commenced the following year in September before wrapping in November 2012; the film was shot almost entirely in the Southern California area, primarily at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, where {{a majority of the}} film's narrative takes place.|$|E

5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took <b>pictures</b> <b>for</b> attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Famous Players-Lasky {{president}} Jesse Lasky {{was looking}} for a new Production Editor in the story department of his studio and Thalberg suggested Hawks. Hawks accepted and was immediately put in charge of over 40 productions, including several literary acquisitions of stories by Joseph Conrad, Jack London and Zane Grey. Hawks worked on the scripts for all of the films produced, but he had his first official screenplay credit in 1924 on Tiger Love. Hawks was the Story Editor at Famous Players (later Paramount <b>Pictures)</b> <b>for</b> almost two years, occasionally editing such films as Heritage of the Desert.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, van Meegeren moved his family to Scheveningen. That year, he {{completed}} the diploma examination at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. The diploma allowed him to teach, {{and he took a}} position as the assistant to Professor Gips, the Professor of Drawing and Art History, for the small monthly salary of 75 guldens. In March 1915, his daughter Pauline was born, later called Inez. To supplement his income, Han sketched posters and painted <b>pictures</b> <b>for</b> the commercial art trade, generally Christmas cards, still-life, landscapes, and portraits. Many of these paintings are quite valuable today.|$|E

5|$|Previous offers by Paramount <b>Pictures</b> <b>for</b> a film {{adaptation}} of SpongeBob SquarePants had {{been rejected by}} Stephen Hillenburg, but he eventually accepted one offer in 2002.

The film was originally intended as the series finale, but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner with Tibbitt taking his place.|$|E
5|$|There {{is as yet}} no universally {{accepted}} diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder. Often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis.

Caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the Working Model of the Child Interview.|$|E
