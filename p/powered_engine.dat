5|$|The Model 8-A, {{the export}} {{model of the}} Northrop Attack Bomber series was never {{intended}} {{to serve as the}} basis of a floatplane and had to be redesigned to meet the requirements of the Norwegian order. The new N-3PB was the first product of Northrop Aircraft, which had reformed in 1939, and was a low-winged cantilever monoplane fitted with twin floats. First intended for a lower <b>powered</b> <b>engine,</b> the N-3PB was ultimately powered by a Wright Cyclone radial engine, of the same type specified for the Douglas 8A-5N bombers and Curtiss Hawk 75A-8s ordered by Norway at the same time, simplifying the eventual maintenance and operation requirements for the entire Norwegian military aircraft fleets.|$|E

25|$|Motorcycle {{construction}} is the engineering, manufacturing, and assembly of components and systems for a motorcycle {{which results in}} the performance, cost, and aesthetics desired by the designer. With some exceptions, construction of modern mass-produced motorcycles has standardised on a steel or aluminium frame, telescopic forks holding the front wheel, and disc brakes. Some other body parts, designed for either aesthetic or performance reasons may be added. A petrol <b>powered</b> <b>engine</b> typically consisting of between one and four cylinders (and less commonly, up to eight cylinders) coupled to a manual five- or six-speed sequential transmission drives the swingarm-mounted rear wheel by a chain, driveshaft or belt.|$|E
500|$|The {{completion}} of Redguard in 1998 {{led to a}} return to the Morrowind project, as the developers felt a yearning in their audience to return to the classically epic forms of the earlier titles. Finding that the gaps between their own technical capacities and those of rival companies had grown in the interim, Bethesda sought to revitalize itself and return to the forefront of the industry, an effort spearheaded by project leader Todd Howard. The XnGine was scrapped and replaced with a licensed copy of NetImmerse, a Direct3D <b>powered</b> <b>engine,</b> with transform and lighting capacity, 32-bit textures and skeletal animation. During their promotional campaign, Bethesda deliberately paralleled their screenshot releases with the announcement of NVIDIA's GeForce 4, as [...] "being indicative of the outstanding water effects the technology is capable of".|$|E
2500|$|The {{prototype}} {{was complete}} by late 1916 but concerns over structural strength and some engine tuning delayed {{the first flight}} until 31 March 1917, flown by Floris Albert Van Heyst. [...] Test flights led to aerobatics and Van Heyst became the first Dutchman to execute a loop in a military aircraft. [...] Nonetheless, its low <b>powered</b> <b>engine</b> did not provide high enough performance for a fighter and no more powerful engines were immediately available in the Netherlands. [...] No more V.1s were built; the prototype was bought by the Netherlands Naval Aviation Service in 1917 and retired in 1920.|$|E

2500|$|The {{date of the}} Dongó's first flight, made {{sometime}} during 1924, is not known exactly but by mid-December 1924 it had completed its tests {{in front of the}} official commission. It is not known if the Dongó ever received the intended lower <b>powered</b> <b>engine,</b> if the narrow wings met their design rigidity targets or if the [...] "exceptionally good" [...] maximum lift/drag ratio of about 16, remarkable for a fixed undercarriage biplane, was achieved. Despite its aerodynamic refinement it did not go into production and only one was built. [...] Rotter's interest in high lift/drag designs later led him to gliders; his first design, the 1933 Karakan, had an aspect ratio of 19, only a little greater than that of the Dongó though a much greater structural challenge for a monoplane wing without the biplane's intrinsic braced girder strength. Flying it, Rotter became Hungary's first [...] "Silver C" [...] glider pilot.|$|E
2500|$|With a {{compressed}} {{natural gas}} (CNG) engine, the mixing of the fuel and the air is more effective since gases typically mix well {{in a short period}} of time, but at typical CNG compression pressures the fuel itself is less energy dense than gas or diesel thus the end result is a lower energy dense air-fuel mixture. Thus for the same cylinder displacement engine, a non turbocharged CNG <b>powered</b> <b>engine</b> is typically less powerful than a similarly sized gas or diesel engine. [...] For that reason turbochargers are popular on European CNG cars. Despite that limitation, the 12 liter Cummins Westport ISX12G engine is an example of a CNG capable engine designed to pull tractor/trailer loads up to 80,000 lbs showing CNG can be used in most if not all on-road truck applications. [...] The original ISX G engines incorporated a turbocharger to enhance the air-fuel energy density.|$|E

40|$|Road {{transportation}} using air as a fuel {{has attracted}} much attention over the past decade. The fuel (air) can be in two forms, compressed gas form and cryogenic liquid form and engines based on both forms of air have been investigated. Prototypes of air powered road vehicles are expected to emerge {{over the next few}} years. However, there have been debates over {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the two technologies. This paper aims to compare the two technologies from the technological point of view. Engines for a typical small scale passenger car are used for the analyses and the comparison is based on the shaft work, coolth, efficiency and energy density. It is shown that the shaft work outputs and the coolth available to <b>engines</b> <b>powered</b> by both fuels increase with increasing working pressure and temperature. Given the working pressure and temperature, liquid air <b>powered</b> <b>engines</b> have a slightly lower specific work outputs than compressed air <b>powered</b> <b>engines.</b> The volumetric energy density of liquid air, however, is much higher than that of compressed air, and liquid air has much higher coolth than compressed air. On the other hand, the efficiency of the compressed air <b>powered</b> <b>engines</b> is higher than that of liquid air <b>powered</b> <b>engines</b> mainly because of the higher energy consumption of liquefaction plants. The analyses also suggest that an effective use of coolth be a key to improve the overall efficiency of liquid air <b>powered</b> <b>engines.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

2500|$|LNG {{offers a}} unique {{advantage}} over CNG for more demanding high-horsepower applications {{by eliminating the}} need for a turbocharger. [...] Because LNG boils at approximately -160C, by using a simple heat exchanger a small amount of LNG can be converted to its gaseous form at extremely high pressure with the use of little or no mechanical energy. [...] A properly designed high-horsepower engine can leverage this extremely high pressure energy dense gaseous fuel source to create a higher energy density air-fuel mixture than can be efficiently created with a CNG <b>powered</b> <b>engine.</b> [...] The end result when compared to CNG engines is more overall efficiency in high-horsepower engine applications when high-pressure direct injection technology is used. [...] The Westport HDMI2 fuel system {{is an example of a}} high-pressure direct injection technology that does not require a turbocharger if teamed with appropriate LNG heat exchanger technology. [...] The Volvo Trucks 13-liter LNG engine is another example of a LNG engine leveraging advanced high pressure technology.|$|E
