5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing <b>particle</b> <b>deposition</b> in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise.

40|$|Background: The topical {{administration}} of steroids or antibiotics to {{the nose and}} the sinuses {{is one of the}} important postsurgical therapies of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Methods: To investigate the effective deposition of aerosols in the paranasal sinuses after ESS, we restored the human nasosinus model that underwent ESS and studied the <b>particle</b> <b>depositions</b> on the ostiomeatal complex (OMC), maxillary, and ethmoid sinuses quantitatively. Results: A 45 ° nozzle insertion angle significantly increased the <b>particle</b> <b>depositions</b> more than the 30 ° angle (p < 0. 05). A computer simulation-assisted analysis shows that the inertial deposition at OMC increased with a nozzle angle of 45 ° versus 30 °. The particles with 5. 63 μm in diameter significantly deposit on OMC and maxillary sinus compared with the particles with 16. 37 μm (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: The topical {{administration of}} drugs to the paranasal sinuses postoperatively must be performed in consideration with aerodynamics of aerosols...|$|R
2500|$|Titanium dioxide dust, when inhaled, {{has been}} {{classified}} by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen, meaning it is possibly carcinogenic to humans. The {{findings of the}} IARC {{are based on the}} discovery that high concentrations of pigment-grade (powdered) and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal instillation. The series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers (e.g. <b>particle</b> <b>deposition,</b> impaired lung clearance, cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer) have also been seen in people working in dusty environments. Therefore, the observations of cancer in animals were considered, by IARC, as relevant to people doing jobs with exposures to titanium dioxide dust. For example, titanium dioxide production workers may be exposed to high dust concentrations during packing, milling, site cleaning and maintenance, if there are insufficient dust control measures in place. However, the human studies conducted so far do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer. The safety of the use of nano-particle sized titanium dioxide, which can penetrate the body and reach internal organs, has been criticized. Studies have also found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles cause inflammatory response and genetic damage in mice. The mechanism by which [...] may cause cancer is unclear. Molecular research suggests that cell cytotoxicity due to [...] results from the interaction between [...] nanoparticles and the lysosomal compartment, independently of the known apoptotic signalling pathways.|$|E

40|$|The {{transport}} and <b>deposition</b> of colloidal <b>particles</b> in porous media are important phenomena involved in many environmental and engineering problems as, for instance, {{the use of}} micro- and nanoscale zerovalent iron, a promising reagent {{in the field of}} groundwater remediation [1]. <b>Particle</b> {{transport and}} <b>deposition</b> in the proximity of injection or pumping wells and in porous media in general may also be relevant in other fields of chemical and petroleum engineering. Mathematical models able to predict <b>particles</b> transport and <b>deposition</b> in porous media are often needed in order to design field applications. The basic concept of these models is the single collector efficiency η, which predicts <b>particles</b> <b>deposition</b> onto a single grain of a complex porous medium in terms of probability that an approaching particle would be retained on a solid grain. Many different approaches and equations exist in the literature, however most of them are valid only under specific conditions (eg. specific range of flow rate, particle size, etc.), and predict, for certain parametric conditions, efficiency values exceeding unity, which is, for an efficiency concept, a contradiction [2][3]. The objectives of this study are to analyze the causes of the failure of the existing models in predicting the deposition rate in certain conditions and to modify the definition of collector efficiency {{in order to have a}} more general equation. The definition of collector efficiency, first proposed by Yao at al. [4], is based on the <b>particles</b> <b>deposition</b> onto a spherical grain (the collector) in an infinite domain. It is defined as the ration between the flux of particles that deposit on the grain and the total amount of particles that could reach the collector by advective flux from an area equal to the projection of the spherical grain itself. In the present work Yao's model has been implemented by COMSOL Multiphysics and solved with an Eulerian approach; <b>particles</b> <b>deposition</b> simulations were run. From these results a new definition of η is proposed, considering all the flux that potentially reach the collector. A new equation, valid in a broader range of parameters (eg. low Pe number, big particle size, etc.), has been formulated starting from the numerical result...|$|R

50|$|<b>Particle</b> <b>deposition</b> is the {{spontaneous}} attachment of particles to surfaces. The particles in question are normally colloidal particles, while the surfaces involved may be planar, curved, or may represent particles much larger in size than the depositing ones (e.g., sand grains). Deposition processes may {{be triggered by}} appropriate hydrodynamic flow conditions and favorable particle-surface interactions. Depositing particles may just form a monolayer which further inhibits additional <b>particle</b> <b>deposition,</b> and thereby one refers to surface blocking. Initially attached particles may also serve as seeds for further <b>particle</b> <b>deposition,</b> {{which leads to the}} formation of thicker particle deposits, and this process is termed as surface ripening or fouling.

40|$|The inhaled {{nanoparticles}} {{have attracted}} {{more and more}} attention, since they are more easily to enter the deep part of respiratory system. Some nanoparticles were reported to cause pulmonary inflammation. The toxicity of nanoparticles depends not only on its chemical component {{but also on the}} quantity and position of the deposition. The deposition of nanoparticles is not uniform and is influenced by airflow transport. The high deposition mainly occurs at the carinal ridges and the inside walls around the carinal ridges.
