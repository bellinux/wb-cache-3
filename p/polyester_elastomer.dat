30|$|Poly(polyol sebacate) (PPS) is {{a family}} of {{cross-linked}} <b>polyester</b> <b>elastomers,</b> developed for soft tissue engineering (Wang et al. [2002 a]). Polyol and sebacic acid are both endogenous monomers found in human metabolites (Ellwood [1995]; Natah et al.

Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is the most extensively evaluated member of the PPS family, with most in vitro data demonstrating that PGS {{has a very good}} biocompatibility (Fidkowski et al. [2005 a]; Gao et al. [2007]; Motlagh et al. [2006]; Sundback et al. [2005]; Sundback et al. [2004]; Wang [2004]). Poly(xylitol sebacate) (PXS) has also been developed using xylitol, a well-studied monomer in terms of biocompatibility and pharmacokinetics in humans (Ellwood [1995]; Natah et al. [1997]; Sestoft [1985]; Talke and Maier [1973]). As a metabolic intermediate in the mammalian carbohydrate metabolism, xylitol enters the metabolic pathway slowly without causing rapid fluctuations of blood glucose levels (Natah et al.

40|$|Introduction Peripheral nerve {{injury is}} common in {{clinical}} practice. The usual etiologies are penetrating injury, stretch, compression, crush and ischemia. Outcome of nerve injury depends on the etiology and also the management. Nerve defect is a challenging scenario. The current gold standard of managing a nerve defect is autologous nerve graft. However, due to the selection of nerve graft and donor site morbidity, artificial nerve conduits are gaining popularity. However, there are drawbacks of single hollow conduit such as lack of internal support to prevent conduit collapse and inability so as to recreate the proper native spatial arrangement of cells and extracellular matrix within the conduit. In this study, the biocompatibility and efficacy of five-channel and eight-channel Crosslinked Urethane-doped <b>Polyester</b> <b>Elastomers</b> (CUPEs) as nerve guidance conduit will be evaluated through a rat model with reconstruction of segmental peripheral nerve defect. Material and method Eighteen adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Tthey were randomly allocated to three groups: autograft group, five-channel conduit group and eight-channel conduit group with each consisted of six rats. A 10 mm nerve defects were created at the right sciatic nerve. They were bridged with reverse autograft, 5 -channel conduit and 8 -channel conduit. After eight weeks the rats were euthanized and the reconstructed nerves were harvested for histomorphometric analysis. Results All conduits showed regenerated nerve tissue inside. There was no collapse of the conduits. There were no severe tissue reaction or scarring near the reconstructed nerve. No neuroma was formed. Histomorphometric analysis showed nerve regeneration was enhanced with increasing number of channels inside conduit. There was overall drop in fiber density between proximal and distal segment among all groups. Conclusions CUPE nerve guidance conduit is biocompatible and shows good nerve regeneration in reconstructing nerve defect. published_or_final_versionObstetrics and GynaecologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R

Subjects exhibited significantly lower impact force (p =. 02) and loading rate (p =. 005) with shoe 2 (1. 84 ±. 24 BW; 45. 6 ± 11. 6 BW/s) compared to shoe 1 (1. 94 ±. 18 BW; 57. 9 ± 12. 1 BW/s).

KEY WORDS: impact force, loading rate, impact attenuation, spring-loaded shoes. INTRODUCTION: It has generally been assumed that running related injuries are, to some degree, caused by excessive peaks in the impact phase of the ground reaction force (James, Bates, & Osternig, 1978; Cavanagh, 1980; Novachek, 1998).

Several kinds of systems were investigated, which included diacetylene-containing polyurethane elastomers, polyurethane elastomers with monodisperse hard segments, and a bio-degradable <b>polyester</b> <b>elastomer.</b> ^ For the semi-rigid segmented polyurethane elastomers, {{we found that the}} chain rigidity of hard segment is the dominating factor responsible for their phase separation behavior. Chemical immiscibility, crystallization, and presence of hydrogen bonding are not necessary to drive phase separation even though they can promote it. ^ The phase diagrams for semi-rigid polyurethane elastomers associated with different lengths in hard/soft segments were explicitly calculated using molecular simulation technique based on rod-coil model. It was found that longer hard segment or shorter soft segments have higher degree of phase separation than their counterparts. This result was verified by vibrational spectroscopy. It was also shown that DSC is not appropriate to evaluate the phase composition of polyurethane elastomers. ^ The phase separation kinetics and the ultimate degree of phase separation for ultra-thin films of polyurethane elastomers are different from their bulk forms. Hard segments will also show preferential orientation onto the substrate surface. These are the direct consequence of hard segment chain rigidity effect. All the experimental results were successfully reproduced by Monte Carlo simulation based on rod-coil model. ^ Finally, the phase transformation process and mechanical deformation process of a bio-degradable thermoplastic elastomer, PHO, was investigated by FT-Raman spectroscopy and normal coordinate analysis. The long side-chains of PHO will form more extended conformations when PHO undergoes crystallization. It was also found that the strain-induced crystallization and crystalline break-up are not significant for deformed sample. We proposed that the high permanent tensile set associated with PHO comes from the amorphous part rather than from the crystalline part of the system. ...|$|E
40|$|The golden {{method of}} {{peripheral}} nerve system injury is the nerve autograft, {{but it is}} associated with drawbacks such as donor site morbidity, needs of second incisions and the shortage of nerve grafts. Comparatively, connecting the nerve defect directly is an alternative. Unfortunately, if the defects are long, the induced tension will deteriorate the nerve regeneration. These limitations {{led to the development}} of artificial nerve guidance conduit (NGC). The market available NGC have problems of unsatisfactory functional recovery and may collapse after the implantation. These are attributed to material and structural deficiencies. Therefore, there is essential to study a biomaterial, which has excellent biological and physical properties to fit the NGC application. In addition, some studies suggested that the poor functional recovery resulted from the NGC implantation were due to the lack of micro-guidance inside the conduit. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the structural influence on the functional recovery of peripheral nerve injury. Crosslinked urethane-doped <b>polyester</b> <b>elastomer</b> (CUPE) is newly invented for a blood vessel graft because it possesses similar mechanical properties of blood vessel which is similar to nerve as well. Therefore, CUPE was also considered to be the NGC. Its biocompatibility has been proved to be excellent in the previous study done by Dr. Andrew SL, Ip. Targeting on the long peripheral nerve regeneration, the aims of this study are (1) to investigate the biocompatibility of CUPE in in-vitro condition and (2) to study the influence of nerve-like structure on the peripheral nerve system injury in an animal model. The ultimate goal is to enhance the functional recovery of peripheral nerve system injury by implanting a flexible biomaterial, CUPE, which has a nerve-like microarchitecture. It is hypothesized that the nerve-like structure can promote the axonal regeneration. The surface energy and roughness of CUPE were investigated. It showed a relatively low surface energy compared to other conventional biopolymers such that the cell adhesion and also the proliferation were inhibited. Therefore, the CUPE was modified by the immersion into a high glucose DMEM. The change in the hydrophilicity, roughness and cell viability of medium treated CUPE were studied. The hydrophilicity of treated CUPE was increased but the roughness was remaining unchanged whereas the pH of the immersion solution did not cause any effect on the cell activity on the CUPE. In the pilot animal study, five channels along the CUPE-NGC had a similar myelinated fiber density and population compared to the nerve autograft. Also, the channels in the CUPE-NGC were fragmented. In summary, the medium treatment could enhance the hydrophilicity of CUPE and the cell activity on CUPE. Such modifications did not governed by the pH of the medium. The NGC-CUPE with five channels, which imitated a basic nerve structure was shown to have a similar tissue regeneration and the functional recovery as the nerve autograft did. The results proved the hypothesis that the nerve-like structure can promote the functional recovery of peripheral nerve system injury with the use of a new biomaterial, CUPE as the NGC substrate. published_or_final_versionOrthopaedics and TraumatologyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

Both DSC and DMTA results manifested that the addition of TPU elastomer not only accelerated the crystallization rate, but also increased the final degree of crystallinity, which proved that TPU has limited miscibility with PLA and has functioned as a plasticizer. All the blend samples showed distinct phase separation phenomenon with sea-island structure under SEM observation and the rubber particle size in the PLA matrix increased with the increased contents of TPU. The mechanical property variation of PLA/TPU blends could be quantitatively explained by Wu's model. With the variation of TPU, a brittle-ductile transition has been observed for the TPU/PLA blends. When these blends were under tensile stress conditions, the TPU particles could be debonded from the PLA matrix and the blends showed a high ability to induce large area plastic deformation before break, which was important for the dissipation of the breaking energy. Such mechanism was demonstrated by tensile tests and scanning electron microcopy (SEM) observations...|$|R
40|$|Current {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) derived scaffolds offer promising regenerative responses in many settings, however in some applications {{there may be}} a desire for more robust and long lasting mechanical properties. A biohybrid composite material that offers both strength and bioactivity for optimal healing towards native tissue behavior may offer a solution to this problem. A regionally distinct biocomposite scaffold composed of a biodegradable <b>elastomer</b> (<b>poly(ester</b> urethane) urea) and porcine dermal ECM gel was generated to meet this need by a concurrent polymer electrospinning/ECM gel electrospraying technique where the electrosprayed component was varied temporally during the processing. A sandwich structure was achieved with polymer fiber rich upper and lower layers for structural support and an ECM-rich inner layer to encourage cell ingrowth. Increasing the upper and lower layer fiber content predictably increased tensile strength. In a rat full thickness abdominal wall defect model, the sandwich scaffold design maintained its thickness whereas control biohybrid scaffolds lacking the upper and lower fiber-rich regions failed at 8 weeks. Sandwich scaffold implants also showed higher collagen content 4 and 8 weeks after implantation, exhibited an increased M 2 macrophage phenotype response at later times and developed biaxial mechanical properties better approximating native tissue. By employing a processing approach that creates a sheet-form scaffold with regionally distinct zones, it was possible to improve biological outcomes in body wall repair and provide the means for further tuning scaffold mechanical parameters when targeting other applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{quantitative}} analysis of two-dimensional small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns with fiber symmetry is proposed {{and applied to}} a series of images recorded during straining and relaxation cycles of a two-phase polymer sample at a synchrotron beamline. The studied longitudinal scattering originates from microfibrils or lamellar stacks built from alternating soft and hard domains. The scattering intensity of the patterns is projected onto the direction of strain, yielding one-dimensional scattering curves. From these curves, interface distribution functions are computed and analyzed using an advanced stacking model with a small set of parameters. Not only the average domain heights but also four parameters characterizing each of two height distributions (hard and soft domains) are determined as a function of elongation. These parameters are norm, mean, variance, and skewness. They describe the response of the filled elastic network to strain. For the studied <b>poly(ester</b> ether) thermoplastic <b>elastomer,</b> the quantitative analysis shows that two microfibrillar components (an intact and a damaged one) can be identified in the patterns from samples at medium elongation as well as in patterns recorded during relaxation from medium elongation. Although the scattering patterns differ considerably, the hard domain distributions extracted from the fits are identical. The difference between elongated and relaxed state is in the distribution of the soft domain heights. There are indications for a nonuniform elasticity of the soft domains. The average internal strain of the soft domains can be computed and compared to the external strain; and pull out of tie molecules taut among different microfibrils can be studied...|$|R
50|$|In {{the family}} of dialkyl phosphinic acid salts, {{aluminium}} diethyl phosphinate {{has been found to}} be an excellent flame retardant for use in engineering plastics such as polyamides, <b>polyesters,</b> thermosets and <b>elastomers.</b> It was developed by Hoechst, later by Clariant chemicals and Ticona.In 2004 and 2012, Clariant chemicals opened its first and second commercial production lines respectively in Huerth-Knapsack near Cologne.Aluminium diethyl phosphinate acts as a flame retardant in the condensed phase in contributing to charring of the polymer matrix and thus protecting the substrate against heat and oxygen attack. In parallel it acts in the gas phase by radical reactions removing from the combustion zone the high energy radicals H. and OH., which determine flame propagation and heat release.The phosphinate partly vaporises and partly decomposes to volatile diethyl phosphinic acid and an aluminium phosphate residue, which acts as a barrier for fuel and heat transport.Aluminium diethyl phosphinate is used as a halogen-free flame retardant for polyamides, polyesters, thermoset resins (e.g. epoxies) in electrical engineering and electronics (E&E) applications for switches, plugs, PC fans, and structural and housing components. Smartphones, washing machines, and airplane parts, among others, contain the product. Other applications include thermosetting resins and adhesives as well as cable sheaths and insulation made from thermoplastic elastomers. Aluminium diethyl phosphinate can give these plastics flame retardant properties that are otherwise only achievable with expensive high-performance plastics, which are less easy to work with. Aluminium diethyl phosphinate is often used in combination with other halogen-free flame retardant additives like melamine polyphosphate or melamine cyanurate.|$|R
