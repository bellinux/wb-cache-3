40|$|The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute at Kochi has {{developed}} culture {{methods such as}} <b>pole</b> <b>culture</b> and rack and ren method in back waters or estuaries. The rack and ren method is the most commonly used. The mussel seeds are collected from rocks during July-September. The seeds are spread on cotton mosquito netting which are wrapped on the poles or wrapped on the ropes which are suspended from racks. The pole method and rack method is done in estuaries at 2. 5 m depth. After 2 - 3 days, the cotton mosquito netting gets torn off and the mussel seeds stick to the poles or ropes. The seeding rate is 0. 75 to 1. 0 kg/m of rope. At the end of 6 months, the mussels grow to 90 - 100 mm in length and are ready for harvest. Harvest is done manually. The yield is 150 t/ha...|$|R

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to flatfish parasitism as a potential factor of variation in year-class strength. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between parasitic infection and nutritional condition of young-of-year (YOY) common sole. Sole were collected monthly from May (early settlement) to November 2004 in a mussel <b>pole</b> <b>culture</b> area, using a push-net or a trawl, and dissected for parasite identification and counts. Total lipids were extracted from the whole body and lipid classes quantified. Triacylglycerols to sterols (free form) ratio (TAG/ST) was used as an index of nutritional status. Digenean metacercariae infection, characterized by two dominant genera, displayed clear seasonal dynamics and the highest records yet reported for sole. Prevalence (P%) and mean abundance (Ab±SE) increased for Timoniella spp. (Acanthostomidae) from May (P%= 22 %; Ab= 1. 9 ± 1. 1) to August (P%= 100 %; Ab= 51. 2 ± 10. 4), and for Prosorhynchus spp. (Bucephalidae) from June (P%= 8 %; Ab= 0. 1 ± 0. 0) to August (P%= 100 %; Ab= 19. 5 ± 1. 7). Epidemiological values reached a plateau after August. In this shellfish-dominated nursery area, YOY sole accumulated metacercariae in the presence of the first intermediate hosts which live in the same habitat. Total lipids decreased significantly from May to June and then remained constant until autumn, indicating a change in the proximate composition of YOY during this high growth period. Mean (±SD) TAG/ST ratio increased from very low values in May–July (0. 10 on average) to a peak in September (0. 57 ± 0. 31) and then fell back to values as low as before. YOY sole only stored energy as TAG prior to autumn. No relationship was found between YOY parasitic infection levels and lipid condition indices. However, the poor nutritional status and heavy infection level observed in November could dramatically lower over-winter survival of the YOY remaining in this shallow part of the nursery...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of <b>poles</b> for yam <b>culture</b> is labour intensive, costly {{and difficult to}} mechanize. Furthermore, suitable bush sticks cannot always be obtained locally. These difficulties can be overcome by growing suitable trees in the field. In the Philippines farmers are using Leucaena, but other leguminous trees like Gliricidia could also be used. Yams are planted {{at the base of}} the tree, which will give some shade to the young yams and will encourage growth in the early stages. Later the tree is ring-barked about 40 cm above the ground, thereby killing all tree growth above that point. The tree stem then provides a sturdy pole to support the yam. After the yams are harvested the dead section of the pole can be cut down for firewood. Meanwhile, the tree may have sprouted below the ring bark in which case the new growth can become the pole for the next yam crop.

40|$|Recent {{national}} {{elections in the}} United States and Canada reveal an urban/rural cleavage in vote choice. This cleavage has been overshadowed by the red state/blue state analysis in the United States and dismissed as an artifact of demographic and regional differences in Canada; however, this voting gap appears to have emerged with the increasing salience of "culture war " issues in North American politics. Sociological theory suggests {{that there may be}} an affinity between urban and rural place of residence and the progressivist and traditionalist <b>poles</b> of the <b>culture</b> war which may explain urban/rural differences in vote choice. In the present study, urban/rural voting differences are assessed using election surveys from the Canadian Federal and United States Presidential Elections of 2004 and using aggregate data from Canadian Federal and United States Presidential Elections since 1920.

5000|$|The {{totem pole}} {{is arguably the}} most complex and grandiose art form in Kwakwaka'wakw <b>culture.</b> <b>Poles</b> are placed outside family houses where they display the family's crests, history, wealth, social rank, inheritance, and privilege. The {{sequence}} of characters and symbols sculpted into a totem pole is indicative of past family events, ancestors, myths, and heraldic crests, with the bottom figure usually being the most prominent. The interpretation of the symbols is retold in a semi-legendary form when the pole is first dedicated to a certain house after completion. Kwakwaka'wakw totems are built from red cedar and can range between fifteen and fifty feet tall. The reputation of a pole's maker depended on the quality of his work. The Kwakwaka'wakw style of totem uses more protruding elements than other Northwest coast totems, such as stretching limbs, beaks jutting out, and wings thrust away from the body of the pole. [...] Painting followed a scheme of alternating dark and light colors for contrast. Finally, like other forms of Kwakwaka'wakw art, Kwakwaka'wakw totems display a high emphasis on realism.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the expression and cellular functions of the epithelial NADPH oxidase DUOX 1 during alveolar type II cell development. When human fetal lung cells (gestational age 11 - 22 weeks) were cultured to confluency on permeable filters, exposure of cells to a hormone mixture (dexamethasone, 8 -bromo-cAMP, isobutyl-methyl xanthine; referred to as DCI) resulted in differentiation of cells into a mature type II phenotype as assessed by expression of lamellar bodies, surfactant proteins, and transepithelial electrical parameters. After 6 days in culture in presence of DCI, transepithelial resistance (2616 ± 529 Ω⋅cm 2) and potential (- 8. 5 ± 0. 6 mV) indicated epithelial polarization. At the same time treatment with DCI significantly increased the mRNA expression of DUOX 1 (~ 21 -fold), its maturation factor DUOXA 1 (~ 12 -fold), as well as DUOX protein (~ 12 -fold), which was localized near the apical cell <b>pole</b> in confluent <b>cultures.</b> For comparison, in fetal lung specimens, DUOX protein was not detectable up to 27 weeks of gestational age but was strongly upregulated after 32 weeks. Function of DUOX 1 was assessed by measuring H 2 O 2 and acid production. Rates of H 2 O 2 production were increased by DCI treatment and blocked by small interfering RNA directed against DUOX 1 or by diphenylene iodonium. DCI-treated cultures also showed increased intracellular acid production and acid release into the mucosa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSonic {{hedgehog}} signaling in {{the secondary}} heart field has a clear role in cardiac arterial pole development. In the absence of hedgehog signaling, proliferation is reduced in secondary heart field progenitors, and embryos predominantly develop pulmonary atresia. While {{it is expected that}} proliferation {{in the secondary}} heart field would be increased with elevated hedgehog signaling, this idea has never been tested. We hypothesized that up-regulating hedgehog signaling would increase secondary heart field proliferation, which would lead to arterial <b>pole</b> defects. In <b>culture,</b> secondary heart field explants proliferated up to 6 -fold more in response to the hedgehog signaling agonist SAG, while myocardial differentiation and migration were unaffected. Treatment of chick embryos with SAG at HH 14, just before the peak in secondary heart field proliferation, resulted unexpectedly in stenosis of both the aortic and pulmonary outlets. We examined proliferation in the secondary heart field and found that SAG-treated embryos exhibited a much milder increase in proliferation than was indicated by the in vitro experiments. To determine the source of other signaling factors that could modulate increased hedgehog signaling, we co-cultured secondary heart field explants with isolated pharyngeal endoderm or outflow tract and found that outflow tract co-cultures prevented SAG-induced proliferation. BMP 2 is made and secreted by the outflow tract myocardium. To determine whether BMP signaling could prevent SAG-induced proliferation, we treated explants with SAG and BMP 2 and found that BMP 2 inhibited SAG-induced proliferation. In vivo, SAG-treated embryos showed up-regulated BMP 2 expression and signaling. Together, these results indicate that BMP signaling from the outflow tract modulates hedgehog-induced proliferation in the secondary heart field...|$|R

This became necessary in today’s business world as corporations now play more within a global stage. In so doing, the challenge that faces employees and business leaders alike is the ease of applying policies and processes developed from countries of origin to areas of operation across the world. Some have argued for standardization of such practices across the world, particularly to address business challenges of cost efficiency {{and take advantage of}} economy of scale. Some others that may have harkened to the voice of cultural studies and international business scholars that culture affects every business process (House et al, 2001; Hofstede, 2005) have called for adaptation of such organizational processes as businesses transcend international boundaries. Using the experience of performance management exercise of a multinational corporation with country of origin being Netherlands and country of active operation being Nigeria – two countries viewed as operating from two different national <b>culture</b> <b>poles</b> of individualism vs communalism (Hofstede, 2005), this research outcome helped to reaffirm and establish the link between national culture and performance management as viewed from the lenses of performance appraisal. The qualitative research methodology followed extensive interviews with twenty nine Managers and employees of different nationalities with experience working in both Nigeria and Netherlands among other countries they have worked, the findings of the study indicate that National culture within the context of individualism and communalism influence the activities of performance management. In other words, this study helped to confirm the fact that national culture as seen from the dimension of individualism and communalism influences appraisal outcomes of organisations operating in different countries. This finding is also confirmed to include the national culture of West African countries, including Nigeria for which research has been hitherto limited...|$|R
