40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} n-dimensional discrete motions {{such that}} any two neighbouring positions correspond in a pure rotation (“rotating motions”). In the Study quadric model of Euclidean displacements these motions correspond to quadrilateral nets with edges {{contained in the}} Study quadric (“rotation nets”). The main focus of our investigation lies on the relation between rotation nets and discrete principal contact element nets. We show that every principal contact element net occurs in infinitely many ways as trajectory of a discrete <b>rotating</b> <b>motion</b> (a discrete gliding motion on the underlying surface). Moreover, we construct discrete <b>rotating</b> <b>motions</b> with two non-parallel principal contact element net trajectories. Rotation nets with this property can be consistently extended to higher dimensions...|$|R

Several phenomena were said to violate the principle of relativity as applied to <b>rotating</b> <b>motion.</b> These claims have recently been contested.

40|$|A direct {{numerical}} simulation study {{of the characteristics of}} macroscopic and microscopic <b>rotating</b> <b>motions</b> in swirling jets confined in a rectangular flow domain is carried out. The different structures of vortex cores for different swirl levels are illustrated. It is found that the vortex cores of low swirl flows are of regular cylindrical-helix patterns, whereas those of the high swirl flows are characterized by the formation of the bubble-type vortex breakdown followed by the radiant processing vortex cores. The results of mean velocity fields show the general procedures of vortex origination. Moreover, the effects of macroscopic and microscopic <b>rotating</b> <b>motions</b> with respect to the mean and fluctuation fields of the swirling flows are evaluated. The microscopic rotating effects, especially the effects with respect to the turbulent fluctuation motion, are increasingly intermittent with the increase in the swirl levels. In contrast, the maximum value of the probability density functions with respect to the macroscopic rotating effects of the fluctuation motion occurs at moderate swirl levels since the macroscopic rotating effects are attenuated by the formation of the bubble vortex breakdown with a region of stagnant fluids at supercritical swirl levels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{numerical}} simulation of oblique towing tests (OTT) and rotating arm tests (RAT) for a submarine model was undertaken {{with the same}} grid topology. As for the OTT simulation, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the computation, the drift sweep procedure was adopted. In contrast with the steady drift case, <b>rotating</b> <b>motion</b> for a submarine is more complex. The rotating reference frame was adopted {{to deal with the}} rotation problem. The Coriolis force and centrifugal force due to the computation in a body-fixed rotating coordinate system were treated explicitly and added to the momentum equations as source terms. The user-defined boundary conditions were coded to give the correct magnitude and direction of entrance velocity. Lastly, the computed forces and moments as a function of drift angle during the two kinds of simulations were compared with experimental results, as well as literature values. They always show the correct trend. The flow field and streamline patterns in <b>rotating</b> <b>motion</b> were depicted. It indicates that the method used in the paper is reliable and the same grid topology can be used for the simulation of two simplified maneuvers...|$|R

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the cyclic {{fracture}} resistance of rotating endodontic Ni-Ti instruments (Protaper F 2, Flex Master and Reciproc) used in rotation and in reciprocating motion. Methods. The cyclic fracture resistance of rotary Ni-Ti endodontic instruments was tested with a special device aiming at recreating the same conditions for all instruments. The instruments were rotated at constant speed and torque up to fracture, recording the time to fracture in seconds. 10 Flex Master 25 / 06, 10 Protaper F 2, 10 Reciproc used in <b>rotating</b> <b>motion</b> and 10 Reciproc using in reciprocating mode were tested. A statistical analysis was applied to check differences between the groups. Results. When comparing the resistance to cyclic fatigue, Reciproc had a mean of 263 seconds in continuous rotation and 318 seconds in reciprocating motion, Protaper F 2 used in continuous rotation had a resistance of 53 seconds while the duration for Flexmaster 25. 06 in continuous rotation was 61 seconds. Statistical differences were found among the groups. Conclusions. The resistance to cyclic fatigue is significantly influenced by the type of movement (reciprocating better than rotating). Also the kind of alloy is important (Reciproc-m wire was always more resistant than standard ni-ti even in <b>rotating</b> <b>motion)</b> ...|$|R
