500|$|Roosevelt {{maintained}} a heavy travel schedule in her twelve {{years in the}} White House, frequently making personal appearances at labor meetings to assure Depression-era workers that the White House was mindful of their plight. In one famous cartoon of the time from The New Yorker magazine (June 3, 1933), satirizing a visit she had made to a mine, an astonished coal miner, <b>peering</b> <b>down</b> a dark tunnel, says to a co-worker, [...] "For gosh sakes, here comes Mrs. Roosevelt!" ...|$|E
500|$|Like other elanid kites, black-shouldered kites hunt by {{quartering}} grasslands {{for small}} creatures. This can {{be from a}} perch, but more often by hovering in mid-air. When hunting the kite hovers with its body hanging almost vertically, and its head into the wind. Unlike the Australian kestrel, the black-winged kite shows no obvious sideways movement, even in a strong breeze. One study of a nesting pair noted that the male searched aerially for 82% of the search time. Typically, a kite will hover [...] above a particular spot, <b>peering</b> <b>down</b> intently, sometimes {{for only a few}} seconds, often for a minute or more, then glide swiftly to a new vantage point and hover again. When hunting from a perch, a dead tree is the preferred platform. Like other Elanus kites, The black-shouldered kite grips a vertical branch with a foot on either side, each one above the other and turned inwards, which enables them to maintain a secure footing on relatively small branches. Though hovering is the most common hunting method, the kites have been observed searching the ground beneath a vantage point for periods of up to an hour.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} {{southern}} Albertans called the Crowsnest Highway3 Association met {{annually in the}} 1970s {{with the intent of}} promoting the highway and advocating to the provincial government for improvements. [...] The group included local officials and residents who advertised Highway3 as a rival to the Trans-Canada Highway and a more scenic route between the prairies and the west coast. [...] Their efforts proved worthwhile; to attract travellers who might better identify with a route that has only one name, Alberta officially renamed Highway3 as [...] "Crowsnest Highway3" [...] in 1977 with British Columbia following suit for their portion through to Hope. [...] Members of the Association collaborated with the government on new highway shields, a sign that denotes the designated number of the highway. [...] They began to appear in both provinces {{by the end of the}} decade. [...] British Columbia had its own shield and in Alberta two versions of the shield were initially erected; a white number 3 on a crow background within the shield, and a more standard Alberta highway shield with the usual black number on a white background, but with a crow perched on top <b>peering</b> <b>down</b> at the number. [...] The first variant prevailed and remains unchanged through the 2010s. Long-term planning for a Highway3 expressway was on-going near the end of the decade, with minor changes to the two-lane route near the BC border in the late 1970s.|$|E

500|$|At 02.30 on 26 March, the {{regiment}} {{set out in}} thick fog for {{the assault on the}} town of Gaza. By 08:00 they had crossed the Wadi Ghuzze and reached Sheikh Abbas, confronted only by enemy aircraft and some Turkish camel patrols. Two hours later they were about [...] to the east of Gaza, providing a guard force against any reinforcements that might approach from Hareira. The British assault did not go according to plan, and at 14:00 the ANZAC Mounted Division was ordered to attack the town from the north. The regiment galloped forward together {{with the rest of the}} New Zealand brigade, and occupied Meshahera Ridge north-east of Gaza at 16:00. Dismounting, {{the regiment}} moved into Gaza, with the 6th Squadron leading, followed by the 2nd Squadron, and the 9th Squadron bringing up the rear. At 16:25 they captured a Turkish field ambulance; four officers, 125 other ranks and twenty vehicles. Continuing the assault through artillery and small arms fire, the 2nd and 9th Squadrons reached a cactus hedge. Cutting through it with their bayonets, they engaged the Turkish defenders behind it in hand-to-hand fighting. Two troops then charged across a lagoon, about [...] deep, to capture a Turkish trench. To their right they sighted a Turkish artillery emplacement, and Meldrum ordered the position taken without delay. Two troops from the 2nd and one from the 9th Squadron carried out a bayonet charge and captured the guns intact. Back in the regiment's centre they were held up by a strong Turkish defensive position at a cemetery. Instead of trying to attack the position, they held their line while the captured guns were recovered. The regiment was now some distance in front of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to their left, and in danger of a flanking counter-attack. To assist the defence of their position, they turned one of the captured guns onto the Turkish strong points, the inexperienced gun crew sighting by <b>peering</b> <b>down</b> the barrel until they could see their target.|$|E
2500|$|One night, Frank {{told his}} family {{a story about}} how a cyclone {{propelled}} a young boy to an enchanted world. <b>Peering</b> <b>down</b> at a file cabinet marked Oâ€“Z, he answered his son's query about the enchanted land's name: [...] "Oz". Maud supported him in this venture, and he began penning the stories which he would submit for publishing. Author Marlene Wagman-Geller stated that Maud [...] "was, in this manner, the mother of Oz".|$|E
