30|$|The {{first class}} {{includes}} systems that pose <b>prompts</b> {{to students and}} {{have proven to be}} effective in supporting cognitive and meta-cognitive learning strategies (Glogger et al. 2009; Wong et al. 2002). <b>Prompts</b> are hints or questions that induce productive learning processes. <b>Prompting</b> assumes that learners already know certain learning strategies, but that they are not able to apply them appropriately. <b>Prompts</b> are supposed to overcome the deficiency of applying learning strategies, that is, a student’s lack of application of a helpful strategy that is already in a student’s repertoire (Glogger et al. 2009; Flavell 1978). <b>Prompts</b> {{can also be used to}} support journal writing. Writing learning journals, students are instructed to write down a text in which they reflect on the previous classes’ learning contents and their learning process. Berthold et al. (2007) found that cognitive <b>prompts</b> or a combination of cognitive and meta-cognitive <b>prompts</b> elicited significantly more corresponding learning strategies compared to no <b>prompts</b> or just meta-cognitive <b>prompts.</b> Schwonke et al. (2006) also reported benefits of deploying adaptive cognitive and meta-cognitive <b>prompts</b> to help students revise learning journals. Nückles et al. (2009) compared the usefulness of different sets of <b>prompts</b> for writing journals and reported that participants, who received cognitive and meta-cognitive <b>prompts</b> including hints on planning or remedial strategies, outperformed the participants in the other conditions (no <b>prompts,</b> only using cognitive <b>prompts,</b> only meta-cognitive <b>prompts,</b> cognitive and just monitoring <b>prompts</b> as meta-cognitive <b>prompts).</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective Physicians {{typically}} {{respond to}} {{roughly half of}} the clinical decision support <b>prompts</b> they receive. This {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that selectively highlighting <b>prompts</b> in yellow would improve physicians' responsiveness. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial using the Child Health Improvement Through Computer Automation clinical decision support system in 4 urban primary care pediatric clinics. Half of a set of electronic <b>prompts</b> of interest was highlighted in yellow when presented to physicians in 2 clinics. The other half of the <b>prompts</b> was highlighted when presented to physicians in the other 2 clinics. Analyses compared physician responsiveness to the 2 randomized sets of prompts: highlighted versus not highlighted. Additionally, several <b>prompts</b> deemed high priority were highlighted during the entire study period in all clinics. Physician response rates to the high-priority highlighted <b>prompts</b> were compared to response rates for those <b>prompts</b> from the year before the study period, when they were not highlighted. Results Physicians did not respond to <b>prompts</b> that were highlighted at higher rates than <b>prompts</b> that were not highlighted (62 % and 61 %, respectively; odds ratio 1. 056, P =. 259, NS). Similarly, physicians were no more likely to respond to high-priority <b>prompts</b> that were highlighted compared to the year before, when the <b>prompts</b> were not highlighted (59 % and 59 %, respectively, χ 2 = 0. 067, P =. 796, NS).

30|$|With {{regard to}} score {{differences}} due to <b>prompts,</b> Weigle (2011) examined {{effects of the}} Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) Internet-based test (iBT®) independent task <b>prompts</b> and rater types (human scoring vs. machine scoring done by the same e-rater® engine as Criterion®) on holistic scores. She found nonsignificant and negligible effects of <b>prompts</b> and an interaction between <b>prompts</b> and rater types and a significant but small effect of rater types (partial η 2 [*]=[*] 0.003, 0.001, and 0.030, respectively).

Additionally, two <b>prompts</b> may not be sufficient in number, and more <b>prompts</b> are needed for rigorous investigation. Furthermore, other L 2 writing studies such as Nagahashi (2014) and Cho et al.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{investigated}} the effects of self-regulated learning (SRL) <b>prompts</b> on {{the academic performance of}} 30 year 9 students (12 - 13 year olds) learning science in a computer-based simulation environment by randomly assigning participants to either a SRL <b>prompted</b> or non-SRL <b>prompted</b> group.

Students in the SRL <b>prompted</b> group were given activity sheets which contained SRL <b>prompts,</b> whereas students in the non-SRL <b>prompted</b> group received no SRL-prompts in their activity sheets but some general <b>prompts</b> regarding how to follow the activity sheet. The incorporation of SRL <b>prompted</b> instructions into a computer-based simulation environment that teaches the rates of chemical reactions facilitated the shift in learners’ academic performance more than the non-SRL-prompted condition did.

5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the <b>prompt</b> neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the <b>prompt</b> neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the relative effectiveness of different <b>prompts</b> {{for people with}} dementia during multistep tasks in the home, to inform <b>prompting</b> technology design. Methods: Nine pairs of participants (one with dementia and a partner or relative) participated at home. The participants with mild to moderate dementia (5 M/ 4 F, aged 73 – 86 years) functioned at the Planned or Exploratory levels of the Pool Activity Level instrument. A touchscreen computer displayed different <b>prompts</b> during two set tasks: “card-and-envelope” and “CD player. ” The trials were scored to establish the relative effectiveness of the <b>prompts.</b> Individual tasks were also explored. Results: Text and audio <b>prompts</b> were each more effective than video or picture <b>prompts</b> for a card-and-envelope task, {{but this was not}} seen in a CD player task.
