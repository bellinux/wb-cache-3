On April 20, 2016, the EU filed a formal antitrust complaint against Google based upon the FairSearch allegations, arguing that its leverage over Android vendors, including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary Google software, hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into Android, and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of Android, constituted anti-competitive practices. In August 2016, Google was fined US$6.75 million by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) under similar allegations by Yandex.|$|E
25|$|If {{significant}} use of bicycles {{for shopping}} trips {{is to be}} achieved, sufficient retail services must be maintained within reasonable cycling distances of residential areas. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany {{the high levels of}} utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle. It is arguable that this is related to policies that favour access to retail services by non-motorised modes. The Danish 1997 Planning Act requires that planning shall encourage a diverse mix of retail shops in small and medium-sized towns and in individual districts of large cities and ensure that retail trade uses will be placed in locations to which people have good access by walking, bicycling and public transport. From the mid-1970s the Netherlands has had policies in place to severely restrict the growth of large out-of-town retail developments. Germany has had federal planning regulations in place to restrict retail uses to designated areas since the 1960s. In addition, since the 1970s federal regulations have been in place specifying that developments above a certain size (1,200mÂ²) be assessed regarding potential adverse effects. These federal regulations are further strengthened by regionally adopted regulations. This includes regulations specifying that new retail centres be limited to selling products not readily provided by shops at inner city/town centre locations. In Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, this approach not restricted to planning guidelines and is also supported by a ban on below cost selling. This supports smaller shops by preventing large multiples from engaging in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> practices by aggressively discounting key goods to use as so called loss leaders.|$|E

50|$|Critics of {{laws against}} <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> may support their case empirically {{by arguing that}} there has been no {{instance}} where such a practice has actually led to a monopoly. Conversely, they argue that there is much evidence that <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> has failed miserably. For example, Herbert Dow not only found a cheaper way to produce bromine but also defeated a <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> attempt by the government-supported German cartel Bromkonvention, who objected to his selling in Germany at a lower price. Bromkonvention retaliated by flooding the US market with below-cost bromine, at an even lower price than Dow's. However, Dow simply instructed his agents to buy up at the very low price and then sell it back in Germany at a profit but still lower than Bromkonvention's price. In the end, the cartel could not keep up selling below cost and had to give in. That is used as evidence that the free market is a better way to stop <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> than regulations such as anti-trust laws.|$|E
40|$|Price squeeze abuses {{lie at the}} {{crossroad}} {{between different}} forms of potentially anticompetitive conduct, {{as well as between}} antitrust law and regulation. The main question that has arisen in the academic debate and actual practice is whether a combination of a lawful wholesale price and a non-predatory retail price can be characterized as exclusionary conduct based on the analysis of the margin between the two prices. In the paper, we argue that {{there is no need for}} a separate price squeeze theory under antitrust law. Assuming that the costs of supplying an input to rivals and to internal downstream divisions do not differ, a price squeeze capable of excluding equally efficient competitors may arise only from upstream discrimination (discriminatory price squeeze) or downstream predation (<b>predatory</b> <b>price</b> squeeze). However, when the downstream division of the dominant firm is not a separate legal entity, distinguishing discriminatory and <b>predatory</b> <b>price</b> squeezes may turn out to be impossible, as internal transfer charges are absent in many concrete settings of vertical integration. In these cases, an analytical framework for the assessment of price squeeze cases can be useful, provided that it is intended as an operational tool aimed at detecting anticompetitive conduct of a discriminatory or predatory nature, which is not directly observable. Instead of mimicking regulatory tools and criteria, the analytical framework for the assessment of price squeeze cases should be construed in accordance with basic principles of competition law and traditional doctrines of antitrust liability. This approach strongly supports the application of principles on refusal to deal to price squeeze cases and the use of the equally efficient competitor test to ascertain whether a given pricing policy is anticompetitive...|$|R

50|$|In {{the short}} term, <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> through sharp {{discounting}} reduces profit margins, as would a price war, and will cause profits to fall.

Yet businesses may engage in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> as a longer term strategy. Competitors who are not as financially stable or strong may suffer even greater loss of revenue or reduced profits.

The second important difference between the two jurisdictions concerns the interpretation of the requirement of anticompetitive foreclosure.

40|$|Auctions play an {{important}} role in economics. In their most basic form, they are one of the ways in which various commodities, financial assets and concession rights are allocated to individuals and firms, particularly in a market-oriented setting. An auction is a market institution with an explicit set of rules determining resource allocation and prices on the basis of bids from the market participants. Since some products such as spectrum concessions have no standard value, auctions provide one way approaching the question of price formation of these products. This paper explores the details of Turkish GSM 1800 MHz auction held in April, 2000 within auction theory and competition policies framework. According to the findings of this study, since the auction design inappropriately dealt with market conditions, Is-Tim, winning bidders of one of two spectrums on offer, was able to make a high bid by deriving the price of first license, the reserve price of second one, up to excessive level, so other bidders were not able to afford to bid over this price at second round. First finding of this study is that Is-Tim is either <b>predatory</b> <b>pricer</b> or winner s curse both of which undermines general economic efficiency. As a result by not selling second license, Turkish GSM market has been unnecessarily concentrated; Turkish Treasury has obtained less revenue than it would; and the liability of TT owner of third license at the extremely high winning price of the first license, has soared more than what it otherwise would be by possibly undermining the market value of TT.
