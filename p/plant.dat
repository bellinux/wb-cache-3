40|$|Three {{studies in}} the Coastal Plain of Georgia were remeasured 7 or 8 years after <b>planting</b> to {{determine}} the effects of <b>planting</b> depth on field performance of open-rooted seedlings [root-collar diameter (RCD) ≥ 5 mm].

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine fruit yield of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) stock <b>plants</b> in a cropping system after producing runner tips and plug <b>plants.</b> Micropropagated stock <b>plants</b> were <b>planted</b> in a soilless growing system. Runner tips bearing at least one visible root nodule were harvested at 43, 66 and 87 days after <b>planting,</b> rooted and <b>planted</b> as multiplied stock <b>plants</b> for producing plug <b>plants.</b> Treatments consisted of micropropagated stock <b>plants</b> of cultivars INIA Arazá, INIA Guenoa and INIA Yvapitá, <b>planted</b> on October 1 st, 2008 (T 1); multiplied stock <b>plants</b> <b>planted</b> on November 28 th (T 2) and on December 21 st, 2008 (T 3), and on January, 10 th, 2009 (T 4).

5|$|GM halted {{production}} for about one {{month at the}} Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly <b>plant</b> by mid June 2011 to complete some upgrades, including the installation of new tooling, equipment and overhead conveyor systems throughout the facility.

After the <b>plant</b> retooling, the production rate reached 150 units per day {{four days a week}} by August 2011. The Volt <b>plant</b> was also down during January 2012 in preparation for building the California lower-emission version. A four-week shutdown due to slow sales took place between March and April 2012. GM said it had around 3,600 Volts in inventory and needed to reduce dealer inventories as production is expected to meet market demand. GM also extended the traditional two-week summer vacation by an extra week at the Hamtramck <b>plant.</b> GM closed its Detroit-Hamtramck <b>plant</b> from September 17 until October 15, 2012, affecting roughly 1,500 workers on downtime while the <b>plant</b> was retooled to assemble the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala alongside the 2013 Volt.
