25|$|Hypertension is a {{risk factor}} for atherosclerosis, heart failure, {{coronary}} artery disease, stroke, renal disease, and <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> and is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, in industrialized countries.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} an association between abdominal aortic dilatation and <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease.</b> Narrowing of aortic diameter, also called abdominal aortic hypoplasia, and <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> have received insufficient attention. Precise estimates {{of the relationship between}} aortic hypoplasia and <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> are lacking. In this study, we assessed the relationship between abdominal aortic diameter and <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease.</b> Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 1572 patients 18 to 79 years of age, newly referred to the vascular center of our hospital with clinically manifest atherosclerotic <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> or for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. Diameter measurements were used to subdivide patients according to tertiles of abdominal aortic diameter. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> was assessed by adjusted Rose questionnaire, ankle-brachial pressure index, and the presence of gangrene or leg ulcers. Results: Compared with patients with normal aortic diameter, <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> was twice as prevalent in patients {{at both ends of the}} aortic diameter spectrum. When the lowest tertile was compared with the middle tertile in male patients, the adjusted odds ratio was 1. 7 (95 % CI, 1. 0 - 3. 1). When the highest tertile was compared with the middle tertile, the adjusted odds ratio was 2. 1 (95 % CI, 1. 2 - 3. 4). Similar results were found in female patients. The adjusted odds ratio of lowest versus middle tertile was 2. 4 (95 % CI, 1. 1 - 5. 0) and 1. 8 (95 % CI, 0. 8 - 4. 0) when the highest tertile was compared with the middle tertile. Conclusion: The risk of <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> was increased in the lower and upper distribution of aortic diameter. Apparently, both patients with an aortic diameter too large and patients with an aortic diameter too small are prone to <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease.</b> This is the first large study that shows that small aortic diameter is associated with <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease.</b>  (J Vasc Surg 2001; 34 : 1085 - 9. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> increases the {{morbidity and mortality}} of patients with coronary artery disease. The objective {{of the present study}} was to calculate the prevalence of <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> in patients referred for coronary angiography. This prevalence study was carried out at the Hemodynamics Unit of Hospital Santa Isabel, Salvador, Brazil, from December 2004 to April 2005. After approval by the Ethics Committee of the hospital, 397 patients with angiographic signs of coronary artery disease were enrolled. Diagnosis of <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> was made using the ankle-brachial blood pressure index (£ 0. 90). Statistical analyses were performed using the z test and a level of significance of a = 5 %, 95 %CI, the chi-square test and t-test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> was 34. 3 % (95 %CI: 29. 4 - 38. 9). Mean age was 65. 7 ± 9. 4 years for patients with <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease,</b> and 60. 3 ± 9. 8 years for patients without <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> (P = 0. 0000003). The prevalence of <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> was 1. 57 times greater in patients with hypertension (P = 0. 007) and 2. 91 times greater in patients with coronary stenosis ³ 50 % (P = 0. 002). Illiterate patients and those with little education had a 44 % higher chance of presenting <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> probably as a result of public health prevention policies of limited effectiveness. The prevalence of <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> occlusive <b>disease</b> in patients referred to a tertiary care hospital in Salvador, Bahia, for coronary angiography, was 34. 3 %.

Whereas anti-angiogenic therapies are being employed to fight cancer and malignancies, which require an abundance of oxygen and nutrients to proliferate, pro-angiogenic therapies are being explored as options to treat cardiovascular diseases, the number one cause of death in the Western world. One of the first applications of pro-angiogenic methods in humans was a German trial using fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) for the treatment of coronary artery disease. Clinical research in therapeutic angiogenesis is ongoing for a variety of atherosclerotic diseases, like coronary heart disease, <b>peripheral</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> wound healing disorders, etc.|$|E

40|$|Contexto: A doença {{arterial}} obstrutiva periférica tem sido reconhecida como um sensível marcador de aterosclerose sistêmica e preditora de eventos cardiovasculares. Apesar da alta prevalência da doença cardiovascular, há poucos estudos sobre a doença arterial obstrutiva periférica em pacientes com insuficiência renal crônica em tratamento hemodialítico. Objetivo: Determinar a prevalência de doença arterial obstrutiva periférica em pacientes com insuficiência renal crônica em uma clínica de referência para tratamento hemodialítico no estado de Sergipe. Métodos: Trata-se de um estudo transversal, realizado no período de junho a novembro de 2008, em uma clínica de referência para tratamento de pacientes com insuficiência renal crônica. Foram caracterizados como portadores de doença arterial obstrutiva periférica os pacientes que apresentavam índice tornozelo-braquial (ITB) &# 8804; 0, 9. Resultados: De uma população de 239 pacientes com insuficiência renal crônica, foram avaliados 201. Destes, 28 (14 %) apresentavam insuficiência arterial periférica com ITB &# 8804; 0, 9. A idade variou de 24 a 82 anos, com média de 52 anos. A hipertensão e a dislipidemia foram os fatores de risco mais frequentes. Dos pacientes com doença arterial obstrutiva periférica, 89 % eram dislipidêmicos, 71 % hipertensos e 29 % tinham coronariopatias.

These patients were randomly allocated to intervention group (n= 15), which underwent a 6 - weeks training program & control group (n= 15) that received standard care and unsupervised exercise protocol.
