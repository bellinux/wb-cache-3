50|$|When the Mk 20 bomb {{cluster is}} {{released}} from the aircraft, the arming wires (primary and/or optional arming) are pulled sufficiently to arm the Mk 339 fuze (and recently the FMU-140 fuze) and release the fins. The positive armed fin release arming wire frees the fin release band, and the movable fins snap open by spring-force. Functioning of the fuze initiates the linear shaped charges in the dispenser which cut the dispenser case in half and disperse the bombs/bomblets. When the Mk 339 Mod 1 <b>primary</b> <b>fuse</b> arming wire is pulled, the fuze will function 1.2 seconds after the arming wire has been extracted. If the pilot selects the option time (4.0 seconds), both the primary and option arming wires must be pulled. If the pilot selects the option time and the primary arming wire is not pulled, the fuze will fail to function and be a dud.|$|E
40|$|The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has the {{responsibility}} of distributing electricity to the consumers in Sri Lanka except few areas which belong to the Lanka Electric Company (LECO). When considering about the distribution network, distribution transformers play the major role. Protection of transformers is therefore very much important. Transformer failure rate and the distribution network reliability are major concerns of the CEB. Distribution transformer failure rate is high in theCEB network and also the fuse usage is unacceptably high. Present CEB fuse selection practice and practical situation at the field have been analyzed to find out better solution for above problems. Theory behind distribution transformer fuse selection has been discussed in detail. K type expulsion fuses are the recommended primary side fuses by the CEB. The study has proposed several changes to the existing fuse selection practice recommended by the CEB. The present distribution transformer protection scheme do not provide over load protection. It has been identified that nearly 13 % transformers had failed annually due to over load within the Southern Province. The study revealed that lower capacity of transformers such as 100 kVA and 160 kVA have the higher probability of getting overloaded. Furthermore, 15 % of distribution transformers installed in the Southern Province {{have at least one}} phase overloaded. A Primary side K type fuse does not provide overload protection to the distribution transformer. Hence, secondary side fuse should provide the over load protection but above findings tell that the expected task cannot be achieved by the present system. The study has proposed three options to solve this problem. Introduction of a <b>primary</b> <b>fuse</b> which is having special Time Current Characteristic (TCC) curve is the first option. The fuse type is called “SloFast” and it has a duel TCC curve. The SloFast fuse TCC curve behaves very much parallel to the transformer damage curve at some low level of current unlike K type fuse TCC curve, which intersects transformer damage curve at some low level of current. The second option is adding a main secondary fuse in between the transformer secondary terminal and the feeder fusses. So that the feeder fuse does the overload protection of the feeder conductor and the main secondary fuse does the overload protection of distribution transformer. The third option is limitation of the number of outgoing feeders from a transformer. This is very important for the distribution transformers having low capacities such as 100 kVA and 160 kVA, because the probability of getting overloaded is high with the present feeder arrangement. It is recommended the maximum number of feeders for each distribution transformer capacit...|$|E

40|$|During {{exocytosis}} in the pancreatic acinar cell, zymogen granules fuse {{directly with}} the apical plasma membrane and also with granules that have themselves fused with the plasma membrane. Together, these primary and secondary fusion events constitute the process of compound exocytosis. It {{has been suggested that}} the sequential nature of primary and secondary fusion is a consequence of the requirement for plasma membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors, such as syntaxin 2, to enter the membrane of the <b>primary</b> <b>fused</b> granule. We have tested this possibility by determining the location of syntaxin 2 in unstimulated and stimulated pancreatic acini. Syntaxin 2 was imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Fused granules were detected both through their filling with the aqueous dye lysine-fixable Texas Red-dextran and through the decoration of their cytoplasmic surfaces with filamentous actin. In unstimulated cells, syntaxin 2 was exclusively present on the apical plasma membrane. In contrast, after stimulation, syntaxin 2 had moved into the membranes of fused granules, as judged by its location around dye-filled structures of 1 -mum diameter that were coated with filamentous actin. At long times of stimulation (5 min), the majority (85 %) of dye-filled granules were also positive for syntaxin 2. In contrast, at shorter times (1 min), more dye-filled granules (29 %) were syntaxin 2 -negative. We conclude that syntaxin 2 enters the membrane of a fused zymogen granule after the opening of the fusion pore, and we suggest that this movement might permit the onset of secondary fusion...|$|R

40|$|Like other positive-strand RNA viruses, alphaviruses {{replicate}} their genomes {{in association}} with modified intracellular membranes. Alphavirus replication sites consist of numerous bulb-shaped membrane invagina-tions (spherules), which contain the double-stranded replication intermediates. Time course studies with Semliki Forest virus (SFV) -infected cells were combined with live-cell imaging and electron microscopy to reveal that the replication complex spherules of SFV undergo an unprecedented large-scale movement between cellular compartments. The spherules first accumulated at the plasma membrane and were then internalized using an endocytic process that required a functional actin-myosin network, as shown by blebbistatin treat-ment. Wortmannin and other inhibitors indicated that the internalization of spherules also required the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. The spherules therefore represent an unusual type of endocytic cargo. After endocytosis, spherule-containing vesicles were highly dynamic and had a neutral pH. These <b>primary</b> carriers <b>fused</b> with acidic endosomes and moved long distances on microtubules, in a manner prevented by nocodazole.

Soot size information was obtained via computer-aided image analysis. Particle morphology was observed {{to be similar to}} that found in other combustion devices (i. e., nearly spherical <b>primary</b> particles <b>fused</b> into aggregate chains and clusters). Axial regions where soot nucleation, growth, agglomeration, and oxidation occur were identified. Primary particle size was observed to increase with combustor height, but the largest primary size reached is small compared to that observed in laminar diffusion flames. From calculated estimates of the specific soot surface growth and oxidation rates, the growth rate was found to be lower and the oxidation rate comparable to those for laminar diffusion flames. Aggregate sizes were also observed to increase with cambustor axial location, and were found to be distributed in a lognormal manner during the particle inception and growth stages. Fractal dimensions for characteristic aggregate populations were determined to be around 1. 8, and were independent of combustor axial location. The results suggest that cluster-to-cluster aggregation-and not surface growth-is the dominant soot aggregate growth mechanism in the complex-flow reactor. Comparisons with more traditional methods for soot size determination were made with moderate success...|$|R
30|$|Herpesviruses are {{classified}} into three subfamilies: alphaherpesviruses, betaherpesviruses and gammaherpesviruses (Davison et al., 2009). All herpesviruses {{share a common}} virion structure and similar proliferation strategies. An infectious virion consists of a 120 – 130 nm icosahedral capsid with a linear double-stranded DNA genome, a protein-containing tegument layer, and a host-membrane derived envelope spiked with virus-encoded glycoproteins. The life cycle of herpesviruses consists of several complex steps (Fig.  1). Upon initial binding to host cells, herpesviruses enter cells by fusion of the virion envelope with the plasma membrane (Spear and Longnecker, 2003). The capsids then interact with microtubules and are translocated to the nuclear envelope, where the linear viral genomic DNAs are injected into the nucleus through nuclear pores. After viral gene expression and viral DNA replication, the viral genomes are packaged into preformed capsids in the nucleus (Lee and Chen, 2010). The nascent nucleocapsids bud at the inner nuclear membrane to form primary virions in the perinuclear space, and then the envelopes of <b>primary</b> virions <b>fuse</b> with the outer nuclear membrane, releasing the nucleocapsids into the cytoplasm for further maturation. In the cytoplasm, nucleocapsids obtain 17 – 38 (or more) tegument proteins and bud into vesicles derived from host organelles. Finally, enveloped virions are released from the cells through fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane (Mettenleiter et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2010; Johnson and Baines, 2011).|$|R
50|$|Junctional {{epithelium}} {{is derived}} from the reduced enamel epithelium (REE) during tooth development.

The ameloblasts also develop hemidesmosomes for the primary EA and become firmly attached to the enamel surface. However, the cervical part of the fused tissue remains attached to the neck of the tooth by the <b>primary</b> EA. This <b>fused</b> tissue, which remains near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) after the tooth erupts, serves as the initial JE of the tooth, creating the first tissue attached to the tooth surface.

500|$|In 1906 Charles E. Lewis {{studied and}} {{illustrated}} {{the development of}} the basidia in order to compare the nuclear behavior of the two-spored with that of the four-spored forms. Initially (1), the young basidium, appearing as a club-shaped branch from the subhymenium, is filled with cytoplasm and contains two primary nuclei, which have distinct nucleoli. As the basidium grows larger, the membranes of the two nuclei contact (2), and then the membrane disappears at the point of contact (3). The two primary nuclei remain distinct for a short time, but eventually the two nuclei fuse completely to form a larger secondary nucleus with a single secondary nucleolus (4, 5). The basidium increases in size after the <b>primary</b> nuclei <b>fuse,</b> and the nucleus migrates {{towards the end of the}} basidia (6, 7). During this time, the nucleus develops vacuoles [...] "filled by the nuclear sap in the living cell". Chromosomes are produced from the nucleolar threads, and align transversely near the apex of the basidium, connected by spindles (8–10). The chromosomes then move to the poles, forming the daughter nuclei that occupy different positions in the basidium; the daughters now have a structure similar to that of the parent nuclei (11). The two nuclei then divide to form four nuclei, similar to fungi with four-spored basidia (12, 13). The four nuclei crowd together at some distance from the end of the basidium to form an irregular mass (14). Shortly thereafter, the sterigmata (slender projections of the basidia that attach the spores) begin to form (15), and cytoplasm begins to pass through the sterigmata to form the spores (16). Although Lewis was not able to clearly determine from observation alone whether the contents of two or four nuclei passed through the sterigmata, he deduced, by examining older basidia with mature spores, that only two nuclei enter the spores (16, 17).|$|R
40|$|The {{maturation}} and envelopment of {{varicella-zoster virus}} (VZV) was studied in infected human embryonic lung fibroblasts. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that nucleocapsids acquire an envelope {{from the inner}} nuclear membrane {{as they enter the}} perinuclear-cisterna-rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Tegument is not detectable in these virions; moreover, in contrast to the mature VZV envelope, the envelope of VZV in the RER is not radioautographically labeled in pulse-chase experiments with [3 H]mannose, and it lacks gpI immunoreactivity and complex oligosaccharides. This <b>primary</b> envelope <b>fuses</b> with the RER membrane (detected in cells incubated at 20 degrees C), thereby releasing nucleocapsids to the cytosol. Viral glycoproteins, traced by transmission electron microscopy radioautography in pulse-chase experiments with [3 H]mannose, are transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by a pathway that runs from the RER through an intermediate compartment and the Golgi stack. At later chase intervals, [3 H]mannose labeling becomes associated with enveloped virions in post-Golgi locations (prelysosomes and plasma membrane). Nucleocapsids appear to be enveloped by wrapping in specialized cisternae, identified as the TGN with specific markers. Tegument-like material adheres to the cytosolic face of the concave surface of TGN sacs; nucleocapsids adhere to this protein, which is thus trapped between the nucleocapsid and the TGN-derived membrane that wraps around it. Experiments with brefeldin A suggest that tegument may bind to the cytosolic tails of viral glycoproteins. Fusion and fission convert the TGN-derived wrapping sacs into an inner enveloped virion and an outer transport vesicle that carries newly enveloped virions to cytoplasmic vacuoles. These vacuoles are acidic and were identified as prelysosomes. It is postulated that secreted virions are partially degraded by their exposure to the prelysosomal internal milieu and rendered noninfectious. This process explains the cell-associated nature of VZV in vitro; however, the mechanism by which the virus escapes diversion from the secretory pathway to the lysosomal pathway in vivo remains to be determined...|$|R

30|$|Neutrophil {{granules}} {{are designated}} {{based on their}} content and order of production during BM development. Primary or azurophilic granules are formed at {{the early stages of}} neutrophil lineage formation in the BM (myeloblast to promyelocyte) and contain the potent proteases neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G, the chlorinating enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), and defensins. Secondary or specific granules arise at the later metamyelocyte stage and are characterized by the presence of lactoferrin, collagenase, carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule family members CD 66 a and CD 66 b, and the antiprotease cystatin C. Tertiary or gelatinase granules appear at the band cell stage, right before the final segmented stage of neutrophil BM development, and enclose lysozyme and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9). Secretory vesicles are present only in mature neutrophils and are thought to be produced by endocytosis of surface expressed proteins, enabling their rapid redeployment at the surface upon activation, as exemplified by the upregulation of PRR surface expression upon priming in blood [48, 49]. Mobilization of secretory vesicles followed by tertiary and secondary granules appears to be a default activation path for neutrophils. By contrast, <b>primary</b> granules generally <b>fuse</b> either with the phagosome or the nucleus [50], the latter being part of the recently discovered NETotic fate of neutrophils. During NETosis, DNA is decondensed, released along with histones, and complexed with cationic primary granule proteins (chiefly NE and MPO), thus forming extracellular traps endowed with antimicrobial activities [51].|$|R

40|$|AbstractPalatal fusion is a complex, {{multi-step}} developmental process; {{the consequence}} of failure in this process is cleft palate, {{one of the most}} common birth defects in humans. Previous studies have shown that regression of the medial edge epithelium (MEE) upon palatal fusion is required for this process, and TGF-β signaling plays an important role in regulating palatal fusion. However, the fate of the MEE and the mechanisms underlying its disappearance are still unclear. By using the Cre/lox system, we are able to label the MEE genetically and to ablate Tgfbr 2 specifically in the palatal epithelial cells. Our results indicate that epithelial–mesenchymal transformation does not occur in the regression of MEE cells. Ablation of Tgfbr 2 in the palatal epithelial cells causes soft palate cleft, submucosal cleft and failure of the <b>primary</b> palate to <b>fuse</b> with the secondary palate. Whereas wild-type MEE cells disappear, the mutant MEE cells continue to proliferate and form cysts and epithelial bridges in the midline of the palate. Our study provides for the first time an animal model for soft palate cleft and submucous cleft. At the molecular level, Tgfb 3 and Irf 6 have similar expression patterns in the MEE. Mutations in IRF 6 disrupt orofacial development and cause cleft palate in humans. We show here that Irf 6 expression is downregulated in the MEE of the Tgfbr 2 mutant. As a recent study shows that heterozygous mutations in TGFBR 1 or TGFBR 2 cause multiple human congenital malformations, including soft palate cleft, we propose that TGF-β mediated Irf 6 expression plays an important, cell-autonomous role in regulating the fate of MEE cells during palatogenesis in both mice and humans...|$|R

HBsAg (surface antigen) and HBeAg (extracellular form of core antigen) were observed by electrochemiluminescence (ECL). HBcAg (core antigen) was detected by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and quantified using real-time PCR. ResultsA new cell line was established and named HepCHLine- 7. The extracellular HBV DNA was observed from Day 2 and the levels ranged from 9. 80 (±  0. 32)  ×  102  copies/mL to 3. 12 (±  0. 03)  ×  104  copies/mL. Intracellular HBV DNA was detected at Day 2 after infection and the levels ranged from 7. 92 (±  1. 08)  ×  103  copies/mL to 5. 63 (±  0. 11)  ×  105 copies/mL. HBsAg in the culture medium was detected from Day 4 to Day 20. HBeAg secretion was positive from Day 5 to Day 20. HBcAg constantly showed positive signals in approximately 20 % (±  0. 82 %) of hybrid cells. Intracellular HBV cccDNA could be detected as early as 2 days postinfection and the highest level was 15. 76 (±  0. 26) copies/cell. ConclusionHepCHLine- 7 cells were susceptible to HBV and supported the replication of HBV. They are therefore suitable for studying the complete life cycle of HBV...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedTGF-beta/BMP {{signaling}} plays crucial {{roles in}} {{an array of}} biological processes, including embryonic patterning organogenesis, would healing and carcinogenesis. Binding of the TGF-beta/BMP ligands initiates the assembly of heteromeric complex of type II and type I receptors. Within the receptor complex, the type II receptor phosphorylates type I receptor. The activated type I receptor then phosphorylates the receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) and subsequently initiates the downstream Smad signaling pathway. Mutations in certain molecules of these signaling cascades can cause multiple craniofacial malformations in mice.; Previous studies indicate that TGF-beta signaling {{plays an important role in}} regulating regression of the medial edge epithelium(MEE) and palatogenesis. However, the fate of the MEE and the mechanisms underlying its disappearance are still unclear. By using the Cre/lox system, we are able to label the MEE genetically and to ablate Tgfbr 2 specifically in the palatal epithelial cells. Our results indicate that epithelial-mesenchymal transformation does not occur in the regression of MEE cells. Ablation of Tgfbr 2 in the palatal epithelial cells causes soft palate cleft, submucosal cleft and failure of the <b>primary</b> palate to <b>fuse</b> with the secondary palate. And TGF-beta IIR plays an important, cell-autonomous role in regulating the fate of MEE cells during palatogenesis.; On the other hand, studies show that Smad 4 serves as the central intracellular effector of TGF-beta signaling. We show here that p 38 MAPK functions as complementary effector in mediating Smad 4 -independent TGF-beta signaling during craniofacial organogenesis. Unlike Bmpr 1 a, ablation of Smad 4 in the dental epithelium does not block early tooth development and only causes defects in dental cusp patterning and root development. Inactivation of p 38 MAPK signaling in the Smad 4 mutant results in the arrest of tooth development at the bud stage, a phenotype identical to that of Bmpr 1 a mutant mice. Similarly, ablation of Smad 4 in the palatal epithelium does not cause cleft palate, but blocking p 38 MAPK and Smad 4 together does, reproducing the phenotype of Tgfbr 2 mutant mice. Thus, our study demonstrates that p 38 MAPK mediated Smad 4 -indepenedent TGF-beta signaling is a widely used mechanism in regulating embryonic organogenesis...|$|R
5000|$|The {{spore print}} of A. bisporigera, like most Amanita, is white. The spores are roughly spherical, thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), amyloid, and measure 7.8-9.6 by 7.0-9.0 μm. The cap cuticle {{is made of}} {{partially}} gelatinized, filamentous interwoven hyphae, 2-6 μm in diameter. The tissue of the gill is bilateral, meaning it diverges {{from the center of}} the gill to its outer edge. The subhymenium is ramose—composed of relatively thin branching, unclamped hyphae. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, thin-walled, without clamps, with dimensions of 34-45 by 4-11 μm. They are typically two-spored, although rarely three- or four-spored forms have been found. Although the two-spored basidia are a defining characteristic of the species, there is evidence of a tendency to shift towards producing four-spored basidia as the fruiting season progresses. The volva is composed almost exclusively of densely interwoven filamentous hyphae, 2-10 μm in diameter, that are sparsely to moderately branched. There are few small inflated cells, which are mostly spherical to broadly elliptic. The tissue of the stipe is made of abundant, sparsely branched, filamentous hyphae, without clamps, measuring 2-5 μm in diameter. The inflated cells are club-shaped, longitudinally oriented, and up to 2-3 by 15.7 μm. The annulus is made of abundant moderately branched filamentous hyphae, measuring 2-6 μm in diameter. The inflated cells are sparse, broadly elliptic to pear-shaped, and are rarely larger than 31 by 22 μm. [...] and [...] (cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent, but there may be cylindrical to sac-like cells of the partial veil on the gill edges; these cells are hyaline and measure 24-34 by 7-16 μm.In 1906 Charles E. Lewis studied and illustrated the development of the basidia in order to compare the nuclear behavior of the two-spored with that of the four-spored forms. Initially (1), the young basidium, appearing as a club-shaped branch from the subhymenium, is filled with cytoplasm and contains two primary nuclei, which have distinct nucleoli. As the basidium grows larger, the membranes of the two nuclei contact (2), and then the membrane disappears at the point of contact (3). The two primary nuclei remain distinct for a short time, but eventually the two nuclei fuse completely to form a larger secondary nucleus with a single secondary nucleolus (4, 5). The basidium increases in size after the <b>primary</b> nuclei <b>fuse,</b> and the nucleus migrates towards the end of the basidia (6, 7). During this time, the nucleus develops vacuoles [...] "filled by the nuclear sap in the living cell". Chromosomes are produced from the nucleolar threads, and align transversely near the apex of the basidium, connected by spindles (8-10). The chromosomes then move to the poles, forming the daughter nuclei that occupy different positions in the basidium; the daughters now have a structure similar to that of the parent nuclei (11). The two nuclei then divide to form four nuclei, similar to fungi with four-spored basidia (12, 13). The four nuclei crowd together at some distance from the end of the basidium to form an irregular mass (14). Shortly thereafter, the sterigmata (slender projections of the basidia that attach the spores) begin to form (15), and cytoplasm begins to pass through the sterigmata to form the spores (16). Although Lewis was not able to clearly determine from observation alone whether the contents of two or four nuclei passed through the sterigmata, he deduced, by examining older basidia with mature spores, that only two nuclei enter the spores (16, 17).|$|R
40|$|The {{transplantation}} of cultured myoblasts into mature {{skeletal muscle}} {{is the basis}} for a new therapeutic approach to muscle and non-muscle diseases: myoblast-mediated gene therapy. The success of myoblast transplantation for correction of intrinsic muscle defects depends on the fusion of implanted cells with host myofibers. Previous studies in mice have been problematic because they have involved transplantation of established myogenic cell lines or primary muscle cultures. Both of these cell populations have disadvantages: myogenic cell lines are tumorigenic, and primary cultures contain a substantial percentage of non-myogenic cells which will not fuse to host fibers. Furthermore, for both cell populations, immune suppression of the host has been necessary for long-term retention of transplanted cells. To overcome these difficulties, we developed novel culture conditions that permit the purification of mouse myoblasts from primary cultures. Both enriched and clonal populations of primary myoblasts were characterized in assays of cell proliferation and differentiation. Primary myoblasts were dependent on added bFGF for growth and retained the ability to differentiate even after 30 population doublings. The fate of the pure myoblast populations after transplantation was monitored by labeling the cells with the marker enzyme beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) using retroviral mediated gene transfer. Within five days of transplantation into muscle of mature mice, <b>primary</b> myoblasts had <b>fused</b> with host muscle cells to form hybrid myofibers. To examine the immunobiology of primary myoblasts, we compared transplanted cells in syngeneic and allogeneic hosts. Even without immune suppression, the hybrid fibers persisted with continued beta-gal expression up to six months after myoblast transplantation in syngeneic hosts. In allogeneic hosts, the implanted cells were completely eliminated within three weeks. To assess tumorigenicity, primary myoblasts and myoblasts from the C 2 myogenic cell line were transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Only C 2 myoblasts formed tumors. The ease of isolation, growth, and transfection of primary mouse myoblasts under the conditions described here expand the opportunities to study muscle cell growth and differentiation using myoblasts from normal as well as mutant strains of mice. The properties of these cells after transplantation [...] the stability of resulting hybrid myofibers without immune suppression, the persistence of transgene expression, and the lack of tumorigenicity [...] suggest that studies of cell-mediated gene therapy using primary myoblasts can now be broadly applied to mouse models of human muscle and non-muscle diseases...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 The Center for Immigration Studies {{reported}} in October 2016 that {{immigration to the}} U. S. had reached historic numbers. According to the U. S. Census estimates, 59. 1 million immigrants live in the U. S.; this numbers includes 16. 7 million American-born children who are {{under the age of}} 18. Thus, approximately one in five U. S. residents is an immigrant or minor child of an immigrant parent. This is a significant challenge facing many industrialized countries since the tools and frameworks to better integrate immigrants by a host country are evolving and are not currently designed to deal with the substantial number of people fleeing conflict and wars. Though libraries offer information and internet access and public educational institutions provide instructional support for immigrants, they are not adequate to scale to the ever-increasing tide of documented and undocumented immigrant and refugee flow coming into the United States. Since the flow of new immigrants is not decreasing, there is urgency to develop frameworks that can fluidly facilitate immigrant transition into the societies of the U. S. or other industrialized countries. Helping immigrant communities to transition into an unfamiliar environment and society continues to be an intractable, sometimes called a wicked or tricky problem in the literature because {{there is no way of}} knowing if the proposed solutions can offer a viable solution until the solution is actually implemented. Most international programs run by industrialized countries focus resources on preparing adults, and therefore indirectly their families, to adapt and become employable in cultures that differ considerably from their home countries. This adult training focus does not address the significant social, psychological and cultural barriers facing people who need to understand the structural, cultural and functional attributes of a different country. It is insufficient to make immigrants employable at a skilled job if they cannot also deal with the significant cultural differences that they face. Most programs do not include, or focus on, youth as communicators to transition immigrant knowledge needed to become functional members of a newly adopted country. This research explored whether immigrants would adapt faster to their new environments if they functioned as Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Wayfarers between their families and their new host country. This research should also identify whether some immigrant youth are already functioning as Positive Deviants within their community. The approach used in this study was to focus on male/female immigrant and refugee youth, ages 14 - 19, who are on their journey to become brokers and experts of language, technology, media, and culture. The goal of this study was to determine how, why, and when, or whether these youth act in the role of immigrant youth ICT wayfarers. The <b>primary</b> method <b>fused</b> in this study was the creation of an evolving participatory framework and youth engagement model called Teen Design Days (TDD). Teen Design Days emerged from observations and workshops conducted between 2011 and 2014 at libraries, churches, and neighborhood centers located in immigrant communities in South Seattle in Washington State. This study showed that using a unique participatory framework (TDD) does capture the voices of the youth as well as was able to identify Positive Deviants in the youth population. It also showed how combining a strategic use of design thinking and design artifacts was effective in offering insights into the Information Worlds (technology, social, information) of ICT Wayfaring youth and their ethnic communities. This research focused on creating and then evolving the TDD participatory engagement model using a pre-pilot, pilot (TDD I) and two youth participatory/co-design workshops (TDD II, II). The results of this study show the importance of youth in facilitating their parents’ and communities’ adjustment to their new environments by becoming seekers and sharers of their newly acquired skills and knowledge needed to function in a new country. Without these Wayfaring youth, immigrants arriving in the U. S. would face more challenges to adapt to their new environments. This research demonstrated how each Wayfaring youth had a different model for how they contributed to information sharing and how they facilitated their parents to become comfortable with their new surroundings. Immigrant youth need to balance adapting to a new culture but also retaining their home country traditions if they are going to be effective ICT wayfarers. This study found that immigrant and refugee youth within their ethnic communities had a near unlimited capacity and willingness to help family, peers, community overcome many types of technical, cultural, and social barriers.

40|$|An {{opportunity}} {{presented itself}} {{to develop a}} new food ingredient from the wood biopolymer lignin. Lignin is set to become a high-yielding and inexpensive by-product of lignocellulosic biorefining processes. The aromatic heteropolymer is water insoluble, relatively hydrophobic, non-digestible in its native form, and also considered to be non-toxic. Retention of these properties in isolated lignin may enable a microparticulate food ingredient, with particular use as a fat mimetic, to be developed. Lignin was extracted from shrub willow using an organosolv pulping procedure. A reactor vessel suitable for pulping under organosolv conditions was obtained, modified and commissioned. Using central composite design, an ethanol concentration of 60 % (v/v), extraction time of 132 minutes and extraction temperature of 195 °C were found to extract lignin of the highest yield and purity. The total lignin content of lignin extracted from chipped, untreated willow under these conditions was 96. 53 ± 0. 10 % (w/w). An anti-solvent precipitation technique was explored for the ability to produce lignin microparticles. An aqueous-organic solution of lignin was dispersed into a much larger volume of water, whereby leaching of organic solvent from the dispersed phase into the water resulted in progressive precipitation of the lignin solute, ultimately producing a suspension of solid microparticles. Temperature and addition of surfactant were investigated as a means of controlling particle properties. Increasing initial water temperature between 4 and 80 °C produced increasingly large agglomerates of uniform sub-micron <b>primary</b> particles, increasingly <b>fused</b> into monolithic masses. Faster removal of ethanol, hydrophobic interactions or an increase in rate of diffusion limited coalescence may be responsible for the increased fusion at higher temperatures. Incorporating the ionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in the water at temperatures of 20 - 60 °C during anti-solvent precipitation produced spherical, monodisperse lignin particles in the range 0. 1 - 0. 2 μm. However, concentrations of these surfactants greater than 1 % (w/v) caused aggregation of primary particles, probably due to bridging between bilayers of surfactant at high concentration. The non-ionic surfactants Tween 20 and sucrose ester were unable to prevent particle fusion at the 60 °C preparation temperature, indicating that the electrostatic repulsion between particles coated with SDS and CTAB is important to stability. The ability to manipulate the size of SDS-stabilised particles using added salt and adjustment of pH was determined. The electrostatic mechanism of stabilisation by SDS was confirmed by the ability of added potassium chloride and calcium chloride to destabilise lignin particles. Measured particle size increased with the concentration of added salt, due to either greater fusion of lignin during particle formation or to aggregation of primary particles, depending on whether the salt was added before or after particle formation. Decreasing the pH of the suspension of particles to 1. 5, which is lower than the pKa of SDS, caused primary particles to aggregate. For destabilisation with salt and pH, generally only the relative volumes of particles in two modal distributions (~ 0. 1 - 2 μm and ~ 1 - 100 μm) appeared to change. This indicates that the ability to control particle size may be limited by aggregation kinetics. Adjustment and control of pH throughout particle formation may enable the preparation of particles in the intermediate size range, such as narrowly distributed 1 - 10 μm particles. The ability to prepare particles of various and controlled size is important for maximising industry applications. To highlight a possible application of food-grade lignin microparticles, the performance of particles as Pickering stabilisers of oil-in-water emulsions was evaluated. A literature method of emulsion formation involving the redispersion of dried lignin particles and various pH-modification steps, and a method using lignin in the form of freshly prepared microparticle suspensions were explored. Both methods produced emulsions stable to coalescence for five months of chilled storage, although the pH-modification method produced slightly smaller (D[3, 2] of 2. 7 - 11. 9 μm) oil droplets than the fresh suspension method (D[3, 2] of 11. 6 - 31. 2 μm). It may be possible in the future to produce smaller emulsion droplets by using a higher energy emulsification technique and by utilising sub-micron lignin particles, rather than ~ 10 μm particles. Three main areas in which work could be carried out to move this project forward have been identified. These areas are: 1. Lignin characterisation – including molecular weight, chromatography to determine lignin fragment types and contact angle. 2. Control of particle size – including the investigation of more food-grade surfactants, ultrasonic mixing and controlled pH changes during anti-solvent precipitation. 3. Food applications – including further investigation into Pickering emulsions, foam stabilisation and fat mimetic applications...|$|R
40|$|A murine {{model of}} intra-abdominal (IA) abscess {{formation}} {{was used to}} study the interaction of murine strains of bacteria with peritoneal neutrophils. The intraperitoneal (IP) inoculation of non-immune mice with mixtures containing either 5 x 108 Bacteroides fragilis or Bacteroides vulgatus combined with 1 x 106 Escherichia coli and 1 mg of bran as a potentiating agent induced abscess formation after three days. Ten weeks after the IP inoculation of mice with B. fragilis, E. coli and bran IA abscesses containing viable bacteria at concentrations {{similar to those in}} the inoculum persisted in 71 % of the mice. During the first 24 hrs of infection B. fragilis and B. vulgatus were readily phagocytosed by neutrophils and some macrophages in the murine peritoneal cavity. However, after the first 4. 5 hrs of infection, there were significantly more viable intracellular B. fragilis than B. vulgatus. Furthermore, after up to 24 hrs of phagocytosis in vivo, B. fragilis was more resistant than B. vulgatus to killing when the leukocytes were incubated with normal serum (NS) in vitro. This suggests that B. fragilis persists in IA abscesses because of its resistance to the bactericidal mechanisms of neutrophils after phagocytosis. To test this hypothesis, the extent of fusion of peroxidase-liabelled primary granules with neutrophil phagosomes containing B. fragilis or B. vulgatus was examined by electron microscopy. After the in vivo phagocytosis of either B. fragilis or B. vulgatus, <b>primary</b> granules had <b>fused</b> with some bacteria-containing phagosomes of neutrophils. Intact primary granules were also visible in the neutrophils' cytoplasm. However, more damaged intracellular B. vulgatus than B. fragilis were observed. This was consistent with the significant {{reduction in the number of}} viable B. vulgatus in IA abscesses three weeks after the IP inoculation of mice with B. vulgatus, E. coli and bran. The E. coli strain was encapsulated and was relatively resistant to in vitro phagocytosis in either NS or NS and immune serum (IS). This may be important in the persistence of the infection. E. coli, either alive or killed, had no detectable effect on the phagocytic killing of B. fragilis in vitro. Although capsules were also detected on the B. fragilis and B. vulgatus strains by electron microscopy, both were readily phagocytosed in the presence of NS (a source of complement). In vitro phagocytic killing of B. vulgatus, at a ratio of one bacterium per ten peritoneal leukocytes, occurred in NS alone, whereas the maximal phagocytic killing of B. fragilis and E. coli was significantly reduced in anaerobic conditions. In the presence or absence of on-going phagocytosis, at a ratio of 100 bacteria per peritoneal leukocyte, a proportion of intracellular B. fragilis resisted the bactericidal mechanisms of neutrophils for at least 2 hrs in the in vitro assays. Intracellular B. fragilis were more resistant to ultrastructural damage than were B. vulgatus in the presence of on-going phagocytosis. Ingested B. fragilis were located within the phagosomes of neutrophils, and there was evidence of primary granule fusion with 15 % and 13 % of these phagosomes in NS and NS plus IS respectively. More phagocytic killing occurred in IS because, although the addition of IS to NS did not alter the percentage of phagocytes with intracellular bacteria, it did result in the phagocytosis of a greater number of bacteria per neutrophil. This resulted in more phagosomes per neutrophil in NS and IS, although the number of bacteria per phagosome and the proportion of peroxidase-positive phagosomes were similar to those in NS alone. Consequently, overall more bacteria were exposed to granule contents in NS and IS and more were killed by the peritoneal neutrophils than in NS alone. However, the small proportions of peroxidase-positive phagosomes in either NS or NS and IS, plus the survival of a greater proportion of B. fragilis when exposed to neutrophils at high vs low ratios of bacteria to peritoneal leukocytes, suggests that the fusion of an insufficient number of primary granules may influence the ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria readily phagocytosed at high ratios of bacteria to leukocytes. A role for extracellular NS in the process of phagosome-granule fusion within neutrophils was demonstrated. After the phagocytosis of pre-opsonized B. fragilis in the presence of NS, which supported intracellular killing of the majority of the bacteria, few peroxidase-positive or peroxidase-negative granules were seen in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, indicating that phagosome-granule fusion had occurred. In contrast, in either NS heated to inactivate complement or the absence of NS, which did not support intracellular killing of B. fragilis, many intact granules were visible in the cytoplasm of neutrophils. Bran was an essential component of the abscess-inducing mixture. In vitro, the phagocytic killing of B. fragilis and E. coli was reduced in the presence of bran. This effect of bran was observed with pre-opsonized bacteria in NS and suggests that bran affects the serum components, probably complement, necessary for the stimulation of intracellular killing. After 120 mins of in vitro phagocytosis, the coalescence of phagosomes containing B. fragilis was evident in some neutrophils. The disintegration of the membranes of some necrotic neutrophils released bacteria from the phagosomes. Intracellular killing assays indicated that 20 - 40 % of B. fragilis were viable at this time. Furthermore, bacteria were located in extracellular and intracellular sites within the abscesses. Thus, it is suggested that the establishment of a cycle of phagocytosis, limited intracellular killing due to insufficient fusion of primary granules with phagosomes in the presence of large numbers of bacteria, a situation compounded by the low levels of extracellular NS components, followed by release of the bacteria and limited bacterial replication, enabled the survival of bacteria in IA abscesses in mice...|$|R
