2500|$|Dualistic Petri Nets (dP-Nets) is a Petri Net {{extension}} {{developed by}} E. Dawis, et al. to better represent real-world process. [...] dP-Nets balance the duality of change/no-change, action/passivity, (transformation) time/space, etc., between the bipartite Petri Net constructs of transformation and place {{resulting in the}} unique characteristic of transformation marking, i.e., when the transformation is [...] "working" [...] it is marked. [...] This allows for the transformation to fire (or be marked) multiple times representing the real-world behavior of process throughput. [...] Marking of the transformation assumes that transformation time must be greater than zero. [...] A zero transformation time used in many typical Petri Nets may be mathematically appealing but impractical in representing real-world processes. [...] dP-Nets also exploit the power of Petri Nets' hierarchical abstraction to depict Process architecture. [...] Complex process systems are modeled {{as a series of}} simpler nets interconnected through various levels of hierarchical abstraction. [...] The process architecture of a <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> is demonstrated in, where development requirements are organized around the structure of the designed system.|$|E

Hurley Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC). [...] The DOTS, upgraded and frequently referred to as [...] "DOTS +", permits airlines to save fuel by flying random routes, in contrast to structured routes, and permits the air traffic controller to achieve lateral spacing requirements more efficiently. [...] The DOTS generates flexible oceanic tracks that are optimized for best airspace utilization and best time/fuel efficiency. [...] Flexible tracks are updated twice a day using forecasted winds aloft and separation (vertical and lateral) requirements. [...] The DOTS oceanic traffic display gives a visual presentation of tracks and weather. [...] The DOTS sends traffic advisories and track advisories to users and receives aircraft progress reports from the commercial communications service providers (CCSP). [...] These external data exchanges are achieved through interfaces with the National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN) <b>Packet</b> <b>Switch</b> Network (PSN) for Position Reports, Air Traffic Management (ATM) messages, Pilot Reports (PIREPS), and the Anchorage FDP2000. [...] An interface to the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) will improve coordination between the oceanic and domestic Traffic Flow Management (TFM) systems/activities. [...] The DOTS Weather Server, installed at the ATCSCC, receives National Weather Service (NWS) wind and temperature data via the Weather and Radar Processor / Weather Information Network Server (WARP/WINS) system.
