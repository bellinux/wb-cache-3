40|$|The {{theory of}} {{buckling}} strength of compression {{members in the}} plastic range has been extensively studied, and numerical methods already exist which deal with such behaviour. However, {{there is a significant}} research interest in developing analytical models for the <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling,</b> largely driven by the need for simplified mechanics based design tools, but also by the desire for enhanced understanding of this complex phenomenon. A thorough investigation into the inelastic buckling of columns and plates reveals the existence of two well-known inconsistencies recognised as the “Column Paradox” and the “Plate <b>Plastic</b> <b>Buckling</b> Paradox”. In the current research, addressing the conceptual issues related to the <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> of columns and plates, including the two associated paradoxes, has been achieved by means of development and application of analytical models that are verified against nonlinear finite element analysis. These models are based on sound principles of structural mechanics and are intended to illustrate the mechanics of the <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> response of stocky columns/plates by means of a simplified analytical approach, from the point of buckling initiation and considering the post-buckling response. In these models, the Rotational Spring Analogy is used for formulating the geometric stiffness matrix, whereas the material stiffness matrix is obtained with due consideration for the spread of material plasticity. It is shown that the buckling of stocky perfect columns starts at the Engesser load while the von Karman upper limit is typically not realised due to tensile yielding at the outer fibre of the column cross-section. Furthermore, it is established that beyond a threshold level of imperfection, as evaluated directly from the developed model, the plastic post-buckling response of columns is barely affected by a further increase in the out-of-straightness. Besides identifying previous misconceptions in the research literature, the proposed analytical models for the <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> of plates have proven to offer valuable insight into factors that influence the <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> of stocky plates, and hence succeeded in resolving the long-standing paradox. It is the major contention of this thesis, verified through extensive studies, that the “Plate <b>Plastic</b> <b>Buckling</b> Paradox” is resolved with the correct application of plasticity theory, considering not only the influence of initial imperfections but also the interaction between flexural and planar actions.

Discussion of the results herein also advances our understanding of the compact crushing behavior of square tubes beyond that given in LR. An important conclusion reached is that strain hardening cannot be neglected for the <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> analysis of square tubes even if the degree of hardening is small since doing so leads to an unrealistic buckling mode. ...|$|R

40|$|The general {{problem of}} <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> of flat metal plates is a {{fundamental}} area of investigation in mechanics {{not only because of}} its intrinsic importance in the design of engineering structures, but also because it still has not been settled in a satisfying manner. Which theory of plasticity is the correct one to predict the buckling loads in the plastic range is a long-argued problem. This thesis presents finite element analyses of <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> and postbuckling behaviour of columns and plates, taking into account the presence of initial out-of-plane imperfections. The FE programs constructed by the author for this purpose are used to analyze the imperfection growth of such columns and plates under axial loading and simply supported edge conditions. The material behaviour is modeled according to both the incremental and the deformation theories of strain-hardening plasticity. The programs combine both the geometric and material nonlinearities to trace the load-deflection behaviours of these structures in prebuckling (up to the maximum load) as well as postbuckling ranges. The results of the analyses for plates show the extreme sensitivity of the incremental theory, and the relative insensitivity of the deformation theory, to the initial imperfections. The programs are used to simulate the <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> experiments on Aluminum tubes, taking into account their measured imperfections. The imperfection growth analyses demonstrate that the maximum load predictions of the incremental theory are quite close to those recorded in the experiments...|$|R

40|$|The 'across grain' {{toughness}} of 51 {{woods has}} been determined on thin wet sections using scissors. The moisture content of sections and the varying sharpness of the scissor blades {{had little effect on}} the results. In thin sections (less than 0. 6 mm), toughness rose linearly with section thickness. The intercept toughness at zero thickness, estimated from regression analysis, was proportional to relative density, consistent with values reported for non-woody plant tissues. Extrapolation of the intercept toughness of these woods and other plant tissues/materials to a relative density of 1. 0 predicted a toughness of 3. 45 kJ m- 2, which we identify with the intrinsic toughness of the cell wall. This quantity appears to predict published results from KIC tests on woods and is related to the propensity for crack deflection. The slope of the relationship between section thickness and toughness, describing the work of <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> of cells, was not proportional to relative density, the lightest (balsa) and heaviest (lignum vitae) woods fracturing with less plastic work than predicted. The size of the plastic zone around the crack tip was estimated to be 0. 5 mm in size. From this, the hypothetical overall toughness of a thick (greater than 1 mm) block of solid cell wall material was calculated as 39. 35 kJ m- 2, due to both cell wall resistance (10 per cent) and the <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> of cells (90 per cent). This value successfully predicts the toughness of most commercial woods (of relative densities between 0. 2 and 0. 8) from 'work area' tests in tension and bending. Though density was the most important factor, both fibre width/fibre length (in hardwoods) and lignin/cellulose ratios were negatively correlated with the work of <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling,</b> after correcting for density. At low densities the work of <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> in the longitudinal radial (LR) direction exceeded that in longitudinal tangential (LT), but the reverse was true for relative densities above 0. 25. This could be attributed to the direction of rays. Density for density, the toughness of temperate hardwoods tested was about 20 per cent lower than that of tropical hardwoods. This is probably due to the much greater number of vessels in temperate hardwoods. Vessels appear either not to display buckling behaviour during fracture at all or to collapse cheaply.

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{compressive}} {{response of}} a sandwich {{plate with a}} metallic corrugated core is predicted. The back face of the sandwich plate is held fixed whereas the front face is subjected to a uniform velocity, thereby compressing the core. Finite element analysis is performed to investigate the role of material inertia, strain hardening and strain rate hardening upon the dynamic collapse of the corrugated core. Three classes of collapse mode are identified {{as a function of}} impact velocity: (i) a three-hinge <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> mode of wavelength equal to the strut length, similar to the quasi-static mode, (ii) a ‘buckle-wave’ regime involving inertia-mediated <b>plastic</b> <b>buckling</b> of wavelength less than that of the strut length, and (iii) a ‘stubbing’ regime, with shortening of the struts by local fattening at the front face. The presence of strain hardening reduces the regime of dominance of the stubbing mode. The influence of material strain rate sensitivity is evaluated by introducing strain rate dependent material properties representative of type 304 stainless steel. For this choice of material, strain rate sensitivity has a more minor influence than strain hardening, and consequently the dynamic collapse strength of a corrugated core is almost independent of structural dimension...|$|R
