These relations well support the conclusion held from the geological and petrographical points of view that the charnockitic rocks were originally formed under a granulite facies condition, but their characters were influenced more or less by the subsequent granitization under an amphibolite facies condition...|$|R

60|$|The granite which composes the {{magnificent}} bare pinnacles and the steep western {{flank of the}} Portillo chain, is of a brick-red colour, coarsely crystallised, and composed of orthitic or <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar,</b> quartz, and imperfect mica in small quantity, sometimes passing into chlorite. These minerals occasionally assume a laminar or foliated arrangement. The fact of the feldspar being orthitic in this range, is very remarkable, considering how rare, or rather, as I believe, entirely absent, this mineral is throughout the western ranges, in which soda-feldspar, {{or at least a}} variety cleaving like albite, is so extremely abundant. In one spot on the western flank, and on the eastern flank near Los Manantiales and near the crest, I noticed some great masses of a whitish granite, parts of it fine- grained, and parts containing large crystals of feldspar; I neglected to collect specimens, so I do not know whether this feldspar is also orthitic, though I am inclined to think so from its general appearance. I saw also some syenite and one mass which resembled andesite, but of which I likewise neglected to collect specimens. From {{the manner in which the}} whitish granites formed separate mountain-masses in the midst of the brick-red variety, and from one such mass near the crest being traversed by numerous veins of flesh-coloured and greenish eurite (into which I occasionally observed the brick-red granite insensibly passing), I conclude that the white granites probably belong to an older formation, almost overwhelmed and penetrated by the red granite.|$|E
60|$|The {{valley of}} Tenuyan, {{separating}} the Peuquenes and Portillo lines, is, as estimated by Dr. Gillies and myself, about twenty miles in width; the lowest part, {{where the road}} crosses the river, being 7,500 feet above the sea-level. The pass on the Portillo line is 14,365 feet high (1,100 feet higher than that on the Peuquenes), and the neighbouring pinnacles must, I conceive, rise to nearly 16,000 feet above the sea. The river draining the intermediate valley of Tenuyan, passes through the Portillo line. To return to our section:--shortly after leaving the lower beds [P2] of the gypseous formation, we come to grand masses of a coarse, red conglomerate [V], totally unlike any strata hitherto seen in the Cordillera. This conglomerate is distinctly stratified, some of the beds being well defined by the greater size of the pebbles: the cement is calcareous and sometimes crystalline, though the mass {{shows no signs of}} having been metamorphosed. The included pebbles are either perfectly or only partially rounded: they consist of purplish sandstones, of various porphyries, of brownish limestone, of black calcareous, compact shale precisely like that in situ in the Peuquenes range, and CONTAINING SOME OF THE SAME FOSSIL SHELLS; also very many pebbles of quartz, some of micaceous schist, and numerous, broken, rounded crystals of a reddish orthitic or <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar</b> (as determined by Professor Miller), and these from their size must have been derived from a coarse-grained rock, probably granite. From this feldspar being orthitic, and even from its external appearance, I venture positively to affirm that it has not been derived from the rocks of the western ranges; but, on the other hand, it may well have come, together with the quartz and metamorphic schists, from the eastern or Portillo line, for this line mainly consists of coarse orthitic granite. The pebbles of the fossiliferous slate and of the purple sandstone, certainly have been derived from the Peuquenes or western ranges.|$|E

30|$|The {{concentration}} of Ca 2 + is in between 55 and 90 {{with a mean}} of 65.67  mg/L, while that of Mg 2 + is from 42 to 105 {{with a mean of}} 76.87  mg/L (Table  1). The contributions of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + to the total cations are 5.48 – 20.49 % (12.48 %) and 13.06 – 31.51 % (22.34 %), respectively. The higher contribution of Mg 2 + than that of Ca 2 + is a result of ferromagnesium minerals, ion exchange between Na+ and Ca 2 +, and precipitation of CaCO 3 (Hem 1991). And, drainage wastewaters are also the source of Mg 2 + (Todd 1980). The Na+ content is from 185 to 823 with a mean of 444.73  mg/L, contributing 47.21 – 76.23 % (60.59 %) to the total cations. The higher contribution of Na+ than that of Ca 2 + to the total cations is due to ion exchange and/or precipitation of CaCO 3. The occurrence of CaCO 3 concretions in the soil cover supports the precipitation of CaCO 3, which is formed due to semi-arid climate of the study area. In contrast to the other concentrations of ions among the cations, the K+ content is observed to be low, which is in between 12 and 121 with a mean of 54.33  mg/L. This is because of more resistance of <b>potash</b> <b>feldspars</b> to chemical weathering and fixation of K+ on clay products (Hem 1991). However, its higher concentration could be due to application of chemical fertilizers (potash variety), since there is no other source of it in the study area.

Higher Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + are noted in PRM compared to POM. In many locations, Mg 2 + > Ca 2 +, due to the influence of seawater Mondal et al. (2008) and higher contribution of Mg 2 + than the contribution of Ca 2 +, is caused by the influences of ferromagnesium minerals, ion exchange between Na+ and Ca 2 +, precipitation of CaCO 3, and marine environment (Subba Rao et al. 2012). The Na+ concentration varies from 14.80 to 4488  mg l− 1 and 4 to 4250  mg l− 1 during PRM and POM. The sodium concentration also exceeds the permissible limit, and the increasing sodium in groundwater is likely due to seawater influence or salt pan deposits or ionic exchange process. Na+ is also attributed to be released by weathering of the sodic feldspar. This is because of the silicate weathering and/or dissolution of soil salts stored by the influences of evaporation and anthropogenic activities (Subba Rao et al. 2012), in addition to the agricultural activities and poor drainage conditions. In contrast to the concentrations of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and Na+ ions among the cations, a lower concentration of K+ is observed between 0.5 and 520  mg l− 1 during PRM and 2 and 213  mg l− 1 during POM in the groundwater, because the <b>potash</b> <b>feldspars</b> are more resistant to chemical weathering and are fixed on clay products.|$|R

30|$|In India, the {{excessive}} presence of fluorides in groundwater {{is present in}} nearly 177 districts covering 20 states and Telangana {{is one of them}} (Narsimha and Sudarshan 2016). In the early 1930 s, fluorosis was reported only in four states of India, in 1986 it was 13, in 1992 it was 15, in 2002 it was 17, and now it is 20, indicating that endemic fluorosis has {{emerged as one of the}} most alarming public health problems of the country (Ayoob and Gupta 2006). Fluoride is present in the form of naturally occurring minerals as fluorite (CaF 2), apatite [Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F], cryolite (Na 3 AlF 6), topaz, tourmaline, muscovite, biotite, hornblende and villianmite (Handa 1975). Fluoride concentration in natural water depends on various factors such as temperature, pH, solubility of fluorine-bearing minerals, anion exchange capacity of aquifer materials (OH– for F-), and the nature of geological formations drained by water and contact time of water with a particular formation (Mithas Ahmad Dar et al. 2011). The fluoride in drinking water is mainly reported in the hard rock terrains in India (Handa 1975; Reddy et al. 2010). A number of cases of fluorosis have been reported mostly from the granite and gneissic complex of different states such as Telangana State (Ram Mohan Rao et al. 1993; Narsimha and Sudarshan 2013, 2016), Andhra Pradesh (Nagaraju Arveti et al. 2011), Odisha (Kundu et al. 2001).

The PGC, which covers most of the area, comprises granites and gneisses. The Archaean crystalline rocks are represented by pink and grey granites and gneisses. Grey granites occupy dominant portion of the area. These rocks are composed of quartz, feldspars, biotite and hornblende. These are medium-grained to coarse-grained and equigranular in texture. The typical grey colour is due to the presence of the plagioclase feldspar and quartz. Pink granites are generally coarse and porphyritic and composed of <b>potash</b> <b>feldspars,</b> quartz, plagioclase, biotite and hornblende with some accessories.

40|$|Geology of {{the north}} half of the White Mountain Quadrangle, California-Nevada: The White Mountain range, the {{principal}} topographic unit of the White Mountain Quadrangle, is an up-faulted block between two relatively depressed areas. It differs from the ordinary basin range block {{in that it is}} a tilted horst. The marginal faults of the horst are of unusual complexity. Physiographically, the range is in the late youthful or early mature stage of the arid cycle of erosion. Glaciation has complicated to some degree the normal development of the cycle. Renewal of uplift by faulting appears to have taken place in recent times. Upon the crest of the range are remnants of land surfaces of low relief, formed, probably, by erosion before the block faulting which uplifted the range. These surfaces are designated herein as the "Pellisier Erosion Surface" and the "Sub-summit Oldland". It is probable that both were formed in the same cycle of erosion. The core of the range is a granite batholith, intrusive into Cambrian or pre-Cambrian sedimentary rocks, chiefly calcareous and argillaceous in composition. For this ancient sedimentary series the name "McNett Formation" is proposed. It is non-fossiferous but {{on the basis of its}} lithology it is considered to be the equivalent of a thick series of dolomites and "green knotted schists" which Turner described as underlying the lowest fossiliferous Cambrian in the Silver Peak Quadrangle. The contacts of the intrusive and the ancient sediments are everywhere characterized by intense contact metamorphism. This is described in some detail in the section on petrography. Overlying the older rocks is a volcanic series of Tertiary age. These are chiefly rhyolites with some andesites. They include flows and pyroclastics. Vertebrate remains discovered in playa deposits closely associated with the extrusive rocks indicate that the latter were accumulated in part during the upper Miocene and lower Pliocene. The most recent igneous rocks in the area are Quaternaty basalts which cover much {{of the north}}ers part of the quadrangle. In the petrography section of this thesis, separately paged and indexed, are to be found descriptions and discussions of certain types of alteration affecting the rocks of the batholith on an enormous scale. These alterations, believed to be of hydrothermal origin, include the albitization of the <b>potash</b> <b>feldspars</b> and the development of a replacement texture closely resembling cataclastic texture but distinguished from the latter by its corrosive pattern and by the formation accompanying it of a large number of minerals not present in the original rock. Petrography of the north half of the White Mountains Quadrangle California-Nevada: The igneous rocks of the north half of the White Mountain Quadrangle consist of a group of closely related intrusives, probably of Jurassic Age, and a Tertiary-Quaternary series of extrusives. The former, chiefly granitic in composition, compose the White Mountain batholith which intrudes calcareous and argillaceous rocks of early Cambrian or pre-Cambrian Age. The batholith is surrounded by a wide zone of intense contact metamorphism. The volcanic series may be subdivided into two groups. The earlier, whose accumulation probably occupied much of the middle and later Tertiary, is predominately siliceous in composition. The later, for the most part Quaternary in age, consists of basic andesites and basalts. In the following thesis all of these groups of rocks, including the contact metamorphics, are described in detail. Especial attention is paid to certain compositional and textural peculiarities exhibited by the intrusives. These peculiarities are highly significant, not only in the history of these particular rocks, but also in respect the general problem of the genesis of sodic and alkaline types. They are the result of replacement processes which appear to have been active on an enormous scale through the batholithic mass at a time considerably later than at least the outer parts of the magma. They involved the introduction of large quantities of material, especially sodium and silica and possibly also iron and magnesium from some source outside the field tion. The results are evident in the wholesale albitization of the <b>potash</b> <b>feldspars,</b> formation of secondary minerals including quartz, sericite, chlorite, epidote, biotite and hornblende and in the development of a texture here designated pseudo-cataclastic texture which closely resembles true cataclastic texture but is distinguishable from the latter by criteria set forth below. Stratigraphy and faunal relationships of Pliocene beds of San Diego age in the vicinity of Las Llajas Canyon, Simi Valley, California: The results of a careful search of the literature for material bearing upon replacement processes in igneous rocks are set forth in the thesis. Various theories which may account for the phenomena are critically discussed. Overlying the Modelo Formation of Upper Miocene age north of Simi Valley is a series of arenaceous beds of marine origin whose stratigraphy and faunal relationships have heretofore been in doubt. At the suggestion of Dr. W. P. Woodring, then Professor of Invertebrate Paleontology at the California Institute of Technology, I undertook to study some of these beds as part of my preparation for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The following report covers in particular the section exposed from Las Llajas Canyon west to about two miles beyond Tapo Canyon. </p...|$|R

Least square analysis for major elements and modelling of trace elements indicate that: a) the Li-bearing aplite-pegmatite veins were derived from the two-mica granite by factional crystallization of quartz, plagioclase, <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar</b> and biotite; b) the aplite veins were derived from muscovite granite by fractional crystallization of quartz, plagioclase, <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar</b> and ilmenite, which {{is supported by the}} similar δ 18 O values. The increase of δ 18 O values from two-mica granite to aplite-pegmatite veins suggests that fractional crystallization was accompanied by assimilation of metasedimentary material (AFC process). The pegmatite veins are REL-Li pegmatites and belong to the LCT family. The occurrence of amblygonite-montebrasite, lepidolite, cassiterite, ferrocolumbite, manganocolumbite and microlite suggest that Li-bearing granitic aplite-pegmatite veins are highly differentiated...|$|E
40|$|Staining of feldspars on rock-slab {{surfaces}} for {{modal analysis}} THE advantages of staining larger rock surfaces for modal {{analysis of the}} major minerals of granitic rocks are gradually becoming apparent to the geologist. The cost of preparing rock slabs for staining is minimal compared {{to the cost of}} thin-section preparation. Modal analyses on stained slabs cover much larger areas than thin sections and will yield more representative modes. In addition, larger-scale f atures commonly manifested on stained rock slabs are lost in the microanalysis of thin sections. The chief difficulty in two-feldspar staining of rock slabs is obtaining a distinct colour difference between the plagioclase and the <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar.</b> Sodium cobaltinitrite has long been used successfully for the staining of <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar</b> (Gabriel and Cox, I 9 z 9). Stains for plagioclase, to be used in conjunction with this K-feldspar stain, have been described by Reeder and McAllister (1957), Bailey and Stevens (I 96 O), and Laniz, Stevens, and Norman (1964). Plagioclase stains may have a destructive effect on the K-feldspar stain, they sometimes fail to stain soda-rich albite, and the...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of equilibrium in six specimens of garnet-biotite-sillimanite-plagioclase-potash feldspar-quartz [...] . gneiss from a metamorphic terrain in south-western Quebec. A nearly uniform Ti content of biotite may {{be accounted for}} by an equilibrium (a) involving biotite, sillimanite, quartz, garnet, <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar,</b> and H 2 O. The nature of the distribution of Fe and Mg between garnet and biotite may {{be accounted for by}} another equilibrium (b) involving the same mineral suite, or by a simple exchange equilibrium (c) involving only garnet and biotite. The distribution of Mn between garnet and biotite is accounted for by an exchange equilibrium (d). A nearly uniform value of the ratio Ca content of plagioclase/Ca content of garnet may be accounted for by an equilibrium (e) involving plagioclase, garnet, sillimanite, and quartz. A proposed equilibrium (f) involving biotite, quartz, ilmenite, <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar,</b> sillimanite, and H 2 O conflicts with equilibrium (a) and was evidently not established in the gneisses. The factors governing the Ca content of biotite remain largely unknown. Some of these equilibria form potential indicators of relative geologic temperature, pressure, and chemical potential of H 2 O...|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} of a sequence of igneous rocks south of Twentynine Palms has been undertaken {{for the purpose of}} describing and determining the origin of the major textural variations within individual igneous bodies. The work involved field mapping and sampling, petrographic study, and spectrochemical analysis. The Pinto gneiss, a middle rank metamorphic rock, is the oldest formation in the area. It is intruded by a sequence of plutonic rocks including (in chronologic order) the Gold Park gabbro-diorite (oldest intrusive rock), Palms quartz monzonite, monzonitic porphyry, and White Tank quartz monzonite. Other igneous rocks include basalt and silicic and basic dikes. The major rocks, and the ones most intensively studied, are the Palms quartz monzonite-monzonitic porphyry complex and the White Tank quartz monzonite. The Palms quartz monzonite is divided into three units on the basis of slight differences in mineralogy and texture. Most of the quartz monzonite is characterized by very complex, irregular intergrowths between <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar</b> and plagioclase; these intergrowths are possibly the result of crystallization from a relatively dry melt during the latter stages of formation of the rock. Widespread reaction between the quartz monzonite melt and portions of the Pinto gneiss has caused the formation of a monzonitic porphyry along some contacts between quartz monzonite and gneiss. Plots have been made of mineral compositions and grain sizes of a sequence of rocks from gneiss through porphyry to quartz monzonite. Potash and soda {{have been added to the}} gneiss by the melt, and development of coarse crystals of <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar</b> in the porphyry is caused by incorporation of solid gneiss in the melt. Some contacts (ranging from relatively abrupt to broadly gradational) between quartz monzonite and gneiss do not exhibit development of porphyry. The White Tank quartz monzonite is divided into four units, two of which have two separate facies. The units are distinguished by differences in mineralogic composition and texture. The different facies and units are grouped into two differentiation sequences: the trend in each sequence is toward a more silicic rock, but one sequence results in the formation of large crystals of microcline, whereas the other sequence results in the formation of muscovite and garnet. The trace element content of <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar</b> varies throughout each sequence roughly in accordance with differentiation trends previously established by other workers. Measurements of the grain sizes of <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar</b> (in the field) and quartz and plagioclase (in thin section) also reflect the sequence of differentiation. The White Tank quartz monzonite is believed to have formed by the intrusion, differentiation, and solidification of a magma...|$|E
40|$|High-temperature {{reactions}} (Ca 900 -degrees-C) involving albite, K-feldspar or plagioclase and K, Ba-or K, Sr chlorides were experimentally studied. These experiments {{reveal that}} the reaction between K-exchanged albite, <b>potash</b> <b>feldspar,</b> or plagioclase and Ba-chloride/Ba-K chloride results {{in the formation of}} celsian by the breakdown of the starting feldspar structure above 800 -degrees-C. Sr-feldspar does not form under similar conditions. A size-effect of the large M-site cation appears to be responsible for the formation of celsian. The reaction between K-feldspar and barium chloride may be used as a method for synthesizing celsian...|$|E
