50|$|Flores {{is running}} for {{a seat in the}} National Assembly in Venezuela's 2015 {{parliamentary}} elections as a candidate for the Great <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole.</b> She said she would use her seat to defend the social rights of citizens and the achievements of the Bolivarian Revolution.|$|E
50|$|At the 2015 {{parliamentary}} election, the MUD won 109 of the 164 general {{seats and}} all three indigenous seats, which gave them a supermajority in the National Assembly; while the government's own coalition, the Great <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole,</b> won the remaining 55 seats. Voter turnout exceeded 70 percent.|$|E

"A {{thousand}} years ago and more, the Polish population had supposedly lived on its ancestral land in unity and harmony, ruled by the benevolent hand of its first legendary ruler, a peasant called Piast....however, the Poles lost their unity and lost control of their native land. All manner of aliens and intruders - Germans, Jews, Ukrainians and Russians ...took large parts of Poland's towns and countryside for themselves....Poland was robbed of her inheritance. So the message was clear. All <b>patriotic</b> <b>Poles</b> had a duty to unite and drive all foreigners from their native soil: 'Poland for the Poles!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|For 400 years, Lithuania and Poland {{were united}} in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, until Poland was {{partitioned}} in 1795 by three nations at its borders: the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Habsburg Monarchy (see Partitions of Poland). At that point Poland, a formerly powerful state, simply ceased to exist. Yet one hope remained for the <b>patriotic</b> <b>Poles</b> yearning for autonomy - the First French Empire. Napoleon promised {{to restore the}} Polish homeland if Poles, in turn, helped him defeat the Russian Empire. Thousands of Poles {{were part of the}} Grande Armée during the French invasion of Russia. The invasion force reached the gates of Moscow before being forced into a long and bloody retreat. The film itself centers on two noble families who live in the Russian-controlled part of Poland: the Horeszko family, who ardently favor Polish independence, and the Soplica family, who support Russia.|$|R
25|$|Ratti {{intended}} {{to work for}} Poland by building bridges to men of goodwill in the Soviet Union, even to shedding his blood for Russia. Benedict, however, needed Ratti as a diplomat, not as a martyr, and forbade his traveling into the USSR despite his being the official papal delegate for Russia. The nuncio's continued contacts with Russians did not generate much sympathy for him within Poland at the time. After Pope Benedict sent Ratti to Silesia to forestall potential political agitation within the Polish Catholic clergy, the nuncio was asked to leave Poland. On 20 November, when German Cardinal Adolf Bertram announced a papal ban on all political activities of clergymen, calls for Ratti's expulsion climaxed. Ratti was asked to leave. “While he tried honestly to show himself {{as a friend of}} Poland, Warsaw forced his departure, after his neutrality in Silesian voting was questioned” by Germans and Poles. Nationalistic Germans objected to the Polish nuncio supervising local elections, and <b>patriotic</b> <b>Poles</b> were upset because he curtailed political action among the clergy.|$|R
50|$|The 131 member {{assembly}} {{was composed}} of 121 belonging to the Chávez's <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole,</b> which consisted of the Fifth Republic Movement, Movement for Socialism, Fatherland for All, the Communist Party of Venezuela, People's Electoral Movement and others, 3 indigenous representatives and 6 Democratic Pole and other party members consisting of Acción Democrática, Copei, Project Venezuela and National Convergence.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 {{the party}} split and the anti-Chávez faction {{supporting}} Ismael García joined the anti-Chávez faction of Fatherland for All, creating Progressive Advance, a centre-left party {{in opposition to}} the government. The leadership of PODEMOS was then taken by the pro-Chávez Didalco Bolívar. Under Bolívar's leadership, the party left the Democratic Unity Roundtable and joined the PSUV-led Great <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Chávez was {{supported}} by the Great <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole</b> (GPP), an electoral coalition led by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, PSUV). A member of a GPP collective said to Venezuelanalysis.com that the GPP was created in 2011 to support Chávez' re-election and [...] "formally unites 35,000 Venezuelan movements and collectives" [...] as well as Chávez-supporting political parties.|$|E
2500|$|After {{securing}} neutrality from Konstantin, {{the grand}} duke retreated behind Russian lines to watch how the scenario would play out. [...] This act further confused the Polish {{government on the}} matter of what its status was with Russia. [...] This was due to a promise by the Russians earlier {{that they were going to}} help put the rebellion down. [...] The <b>patriotic</b> <b>Poles</b> could not have been more pleased [...] they took the upper hand and the Grand Duke Konstantin on 3 December retreated toward Russia. He himself retreated behind Russian lines but following the failure of the uprising expressed admiration for the valor of the Polish insurgents. The policy of neutrality at all costs has led to Konstantin being viewed two ways through the scope of history, either he would be viewed by the Russian royal family as weak and a sympathizer to the Poles, or he would be seen as a seed for the idea of a soon to be independent Poland, though he was trying to effectively avoid a war.|$|R

6000|$|Dick for {{a moment}} was stupefied, but Jack {{recalled}} to mind three sentences which the countess had taught him and which might, she said, prove of use to them, did they happen to come across any insurgent bands in Poland; for vague reports were current, {{in spite of the}} efforts of the authorities to repress them, that the Poles were seizing the opportunity of their oppressors being engaged in war, again to take up arms. The sentences were pass-words of a secret association of which the countess's father had been a member, and which were widely whispered among <b>patriotic</b> <b>Poles.</b> [...] "The dawn will soon be at hand. We must get up in the morning. Poland will yet be free." [...] The sergeant stared at them in astonishment, and answering in a low tone in some words which were, the boys guessed, the countersign to the pass, sat down by them. [...] "But you are not Poles?" [...] he {{said in a low voice}} in Russian. [...] "Your language is strange. I could scarce understand you." ...|$|R
50|$|The Venezuelan {{regional}} elections, 2000 {{took place}} on 30 July 2000, alongside the Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2000 and Venezuelan presidential election, 2000. The regional elections were for Venezuelan state governorships and mayorships. The Fifth Republic Movement (supported by its <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole</b> partners) took 14 of the 23 governorships, while COPEI took 2 and joint Democratic Action-COPEI candidates took another 2. The new First Justice won two mayoral races for Chacao and Baruta.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reasons for}} Tymiński's {{unexpected}} success remain unclear. His vague promise to create wealth for everyone quickly, supported by his {{image as a}} <b>patriotic</b> <b>Pole</b> who had succeeded abroad, was well received {{at a time of}} radical political change and a worsening economic situation. There was increasing disappointment with the trench warfare that had broken out within the former anti-communist opposition so a mysterious, honest and patriotic stranger [...] "straight out of nowhere" [...] had considerable appeal.|$|E

5000|$|She wrote several {{plays for}} the local theater in Pleszew, likely {{inspired}} by and with the encouragement of Stanisław Sczaniecki from Karmin. She also wrote many poems, some of which she dedicated to the great Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. Most of her works were dedicated to rekindling the <b>patriotic</b> spirit of <b>Poles,</b> and used many elements from myths and legends of Greater Poland. Some of them were printed in the women's press ("Lechu", [...] "Dwutygodniku dla Kobiet").|$|R
50|$|This was {{the second}} legal act issued by the {{reformed}} Polish state (the first being the Constitution of May 3, considered the second oldest constitution in the world, and was {{the expansion of the}} 4th act of that constitution. It was also the last legal act of the Commonwealth, and just like the constitution that made it possible, it had a short lifespan and negligible impact on most of Commonwealth citizens. In many places where revolutionary forces could not enforce it, the local szlachta simply ignored the proclamation. However the news of the proclamation spread among the peasantry and was kept alive by the revolutionary and <b>patriotic</b> minded <b>Poles.</b> Over the next several decades, after the partitions of Poland ended the existence of Poland as a separate state, it became one of the symbols of Polish history.|$|R
5000|$|Kaczmarski was a {{voice of}} the Solidarity trade union {{movement}} in 1980s Poland, for his commitment to a free Poland, independent of Soviet rule. His songs criticized the ruling communist regime and appealed to the tradition of <b>patriotic</b> resistance within <b>Poles.</b> He remains {{best known for his}} protest songs on social and political subjects ("Mury" [...] (Walls) based on [...] "L'Estaca" [...] by Lluís Llach, [...] "Obława" [...] (Wolf hunt (lit. Raid))). However, he was more a poet than a political singer, and his texts have not lost their relevance with the demise of the Soviet union and its communist bloc.|$|R
50|$|In the 2015 {{legislative}} elections held on 6 December, Fatherland for All {{backed the}} governmental electoral alliance Great <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole</b> (GPP). On this occasion, the party {{did not win}} any constituency representative out of 167 seats available at the unicameral National Assembly. Thus, it has no deputies of its own for the 2016-2021 term and is bound by law to renew its credentials with the National Electoral Council to keep functioning as a political party. In the previous 2010 legislative elections, Fatherland for All had won 2 out of 165 seats in the National Assembly.|$|E
50|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{were held in}} Venezuela on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. They were the fourth parliamentary elections to take place after the 1999 constitution, which abolished the bicameral system in favour of a unicameral parliament, {{and the first to}} take place after the death of President Hugo Chávez. Despite claims from the opposition of a possible last-minute cancellation, the elections took place as scheduled, with the majority of polls showing the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) holding a wide lead over the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and its wider alliance, the Great <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole</b> (GPP).|$|E
5000|$|The Constituent National Assembly [...] - Asamblea Nacional Constituyente (ANC) - [...] is a {{constituent}} assembly elected in 2017 {{to draft a}} new constitution for Venezuela. The assembly also has constitutional supreme power above all other institutions in the republic. Its members were elected in a special 2017 election that was criticized by various parties internationally, with over forty countries condemning its creation. The Democratic Unity Roundtable - {{the opposition to the}} incumbent ruling party - also boycotted the election claiming that the Constituent Assembly was [...] "a trick to keep incumbent ruling party in power." [...] Since the opposition did not participate in the election, the incumbent Great <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole</b> won almost all seats in the assembly by default.|$|E
50|$|After the {{approval}} of the Amendment No. 1 of the Constitution of Venezuela in 2009, which abolished term limits; incumbent Hugo Chávez, representing the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, PSUV) was able to present himself again as a candidate after his reelection in 2006. His main challenger was Governor Henrique Capriles Radonski of Miranda, representing Justice First. The candidates were backed by opposing electoral coalitions; Chávez by the Great <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole</b> (Gran Polo Patriótico, GPP), and Capriles by the opposition Coalition for Democratic Unity (Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, MUD). There were four more candidates from different parties. Capriles ran an energetic campaign, and visited each of the country's states. Throughout his campaign, Capriles remained confident that he could win the election and be the country's next President. However, Chávez consistently led most established polls, generally by large margins. In the end, his popularity remained high, and went to win the election by a comfortable margin.|$|E
5000|$|The Great <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole</b> (Gran Polo Patriótico, GPP) is {{an electoral}} {{alliance}} of Venezuelan political parties created in 2011 {{to support the}} re-election of Hugo Chávez in the 2012 presidential election. The organisation, which [...] "formally unites 35,000 Venezuelan movements and collectives", is led by Nicolás Maduros' United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, PSUV). Although the coalition shares a name with the [...] "Patriotic Pole" [...] of the 1998 presidential election, the 1998 coalition was one of political parties, and {{did not include the}} wide range of social movements and community organisations involved in the GPP. For example, in Mérida state the GPP includes [...] "movements such as the Tupamaros, the Educational Community Socialist Front, the Frebin (the Bolivarian Front of Researchers and Innovators), the student movement Community Integration, the comrades in the rural workers front- the Campesino Front Ezequiel Zamora, the popular educators network, the Women’s Bicentennial Front, and... Tatuy TV".|$|E
5000|$|On 15 December 2006, Chávez {{publicly}} {{announced that}} those leftist political parties who had continually supported {{him in the}} <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Pole</b> would unite into one single, much larger party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, PSUV). In the speech which he gave announcing the PSUV's creation, Chávez declared that the old parties must [...] "forget their own structures, party colours and slogans, {{because they are not}} {{the most important thing for}} the fatherland". According to political analyst Barry Cannon, the purpose of creating the PSUV was to [...] "forge unity amongst the disparate elements the Bolivarian movement, providing grassroots input into policy and leadership formation, and uniting the grassroots and leadership into one single body". It was hoped that by doing so, it would decrease the problems of clientelism and corruption and also leave the movement less dependent on its leadership: as Chávez himself declared, [...] "In this new party, the bases will elect the leaders. This will allow real leaders to emerge." ...|$|E
