5000|$|In Tehsil Jaranwala of {{district}} Lyalpur (now Faisalabad), Ganga Ram built a unique travelling facility, Ghoda Train (horse <b>pulled</b> <b>train).</b> It was a railway line from Buchiana Railway station (on Lahore Jaranwala railway line) to the his village Gangapur. It remained in use for decades even after Independence. It became useless for {{need of repair}} in 1980s. It was unique of its kind. It was two simple trollies pulled on a narrow rail track with horse instead of railway engine.The same was resumed in 2010 by the Faisalabad District Authorities giving it a status of cultural heritage.|$|E

5000|$|Norfolk & Western 2156 is {{the sole}} {{survivor}} of the railroad's Y5, Y6, Y6a, and Y6b classes (in final form {{referred to as the}} [...] "Improved Y5/Y6 class"). These locomotives were among the hardest-pulling steam locomotives ever built. They were originally rated for a tractive effort of 152206 lbf kN, and improvements in the 1950s resulted in most of these locomotives (including N&W 2156) having their tractive effort increased to a measured 166000 lbf kN, which necessitated adding about 28000 lb of lead to the front engine frame, to improve traction. (By comparison, the famous Union Pacific Big Boy locomotives developed 135375 lbf kN of tractive effort.) This pulling power is all the more remarkable insofar as the only successful steam locomotives that developed somewhat more tractive effort, the Virginian AE class 2-10-10-2s, <b>pulled</b> <b>trains</b> at about 8 mph (13 km/h), while the N&W Y6’s regularly <b>pulled</b> <b>trains</b> 50 mph (80 km/h), and some anecdotal evidence exists that they <b>pulled</b> <b>trains</b> successfully up to 63 mph (101 km/h).|$|R
