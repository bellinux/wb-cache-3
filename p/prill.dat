40|$|Abstract. A {{comprehensive}} study of the internal flow field for the <b>prilling</b> application in a perforated rotating bucket has been carried out. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to investigate the flow field of urea melt inside the perforated rotating bucket. The bucket is mounted {{at the top of}} the <b>prilling</b> tower. In <b>prilling</b> process, urea melt is sprayed by the perforated rotating bucket to produce the urea droplets, which falls down due to gravity. These drops fall down through a cooling medium and solidify into <b>prills.</b> The velocity field in the bucket is very important to study, as it has great effect on the heat and mass transfer performance in <b>prilling</b> process. ANSYS 14. 0 CFD package is used to simulate and Design Modeler and Catia V 5 are used for geometrical model of the perforated <b>prilling</b> bucket. Velocity distribution on different planes are obtained and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Solid urea is {{the largest}} {{nitrogen}} fertilizer product which is produced in two forms of granules and <b>prills.</b> Although the chemical properties of both <b>prills</b> and granules remain similar, their different physical and mechanical properties are distinguishable and make them suitable for different application either as fertilizer or raw materials for chemical industry. The objective of this work is to analyses physical and mechanical properties of urea granules produced in two different plants in Malaysia using fluidized bed process and compare them with the imported urea <b>prills</b> to the country; hence make a process-product relationship for urea finishing processes. Results of size distribution of the samples show that {{the most of the}} granules fall in the size range between 2. 40 and 3. 50 mm, whereas the <b>prills</b> size is around 1. 60 mm. Strength measurement using side crushing test also shows that the <b>prills</b> with the average failure load of 3. 80 N remain significantly weaker than the granules with failure load of 10 - 17 N. Strength distribution of the particles also shows that a more uniform strength distribution is observed for the <b>prills</b> than the granules. It is concluded that the urea <b>prilling</b> process is the finishing process which produces the weaker and the more uniform size and strength of the particles than the fluidized-bed granulation process...|$|R

40|$|<b>Prilling</b> {{represents}} an innovative technology for continuous particle processing {{and has been}} intensively used {{for the production of}} urea pellets. The process converts a molten liquid into droplets followed by cooling of the droplets in a <b>prilling</b> tower, generating solid spherical particles with uniform size distribution. Up until now, only a few studies evaluated the suitability of the <b>prilling</b> technique for pharmaceutical applications. Furthermore, lipid matrix excipients offer an interesting alternative for conventional polymers to achieve controlled drug release as they cover a large group of non-toxic materials with highly versatile physicochemical properties. Hence, the combination of the continuous <b>prilling</b> technique and the use of lipid excipients provides an encouraging platform to address certain formulation challenges. The general aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of <b>prilling</b> as continuous process for the manufacturing of lipid-based multiparticulate dosage forms. As the use of fatty acids is rather limited in lipid-based drug delivery, this class of lipid excipients was selected as controlled release matrix formers...|$|R
50|$|Until the 1970s most urea plants {{produced}} their fertilizer in {{the form}} of <b>prills.</b> In the <b>prilling</b> process, droplets of urea ‘melt’ (obtained by concentrating the product solution from the urea plant to a very high level) are cast into an upward flow of air, solidifying as they fall. For air <b>prilling,</b> a concrete tower is required between 40 and 70 meters high, depending on the production capacity and climatic conditions. On account of their relatively low strength, <b>prills</b> are susceptible to breakage during handling and transportation, which increases the risk of caking (concretion) of the product during storage and gives rise to dust when the urea is spread on the land.Stamicarbon developed a new technology to improve the impact strength, known as ‘seeding’. This process involves blowing tiny urea particles (seeds) into the <b>prilling</b> tower. The seeds act as kernels for the crystallization of the urea melt droplets, and in so doing their strength is increased.|$|R

2500|$|For {{its main}} {{use as a}} {{fertilizer}} urea is mostly marketed in solid form, either as <b>prills</b> or granules. The advantage of <b>prills</b> is that, in general, they can be produced more cheaply than granules and that the technique was firmly established in industrial practice long before a satisfactory urea granulation process was commercialized. [...] However, {{on account of the}} limited size of particles that can be produced with the desired degree of sphericity and their low crushing and impact strength, the performance of <b>prills</b> during bulk storage, handling and use is generally (with some exceptions) considered inferior to that of granules.|$|R

40|$|Growth {{kinetics}} of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans {{in batch}} cultures, containing <b>prills</b> of elementary sulfur {{as the sole}} energy source, were studied by measuring the incorporation of radioactive phosphorus in free and adsorbed bacteria. The data obtained indicate an initial exponential growth of the attached bacteria until saturation of the susceptible surface was reached, followed by a linear release of free bacteria due to successive replication of a constant number of adsorbed bacteria. These adsorbed bacteria could continue replication provided the colonized <b>prills</b> were transferred to fresh medium each time the stationary phase was reached. The bacteria released from the <b>prills</b> were unable to multiply, and in the medium employed they lost viability with a half-life of 3. 5 days. The spreading of the progeny on the surface was followed by staining the bacteria on the <b>prills</b> with crystal violet; this spreading was not uniform but seemed to proceed through distortions present in the surface. The specific growth rate of T. ferrooxidans ATCC 19859 was about 0. 5 day− 1, {{both before and after}} saturation of the sulfur surface. The growth of adsorbed and free bacteria in medium containing both ferrous iron and elementary sulfur indicated that T. ferrooxidans can simultaneously utilize both energy sources...|$|R
