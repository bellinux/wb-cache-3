5|$|In {{a further}} step, some NAD is {{converted}} into NADP by NAD kinase, which phosphorylates NAD. In most organisms, this enzyme uses ATP {{as the source}} of the <b>phosphate</b> <b>group,</b> although several bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii, use inorganic polyphosphate as an alternative phosphoryl donor.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a <b>phosphate</b> <b>group,</b> {{and one of the}} four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.|$|E
5|$|These {{sections}} are subdivided {{by other}} {{features such as}} the substrate, products, and chemical mechanism. An enzyme is fully specified by four numerical designations. For example, hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) is a transferase (EC 2) that adds a <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> (EC 2.7) to a hexose sugar, a molecule containing an alcohol group (EC 2.7.1).|$|E
50|$|Receptor {{tyrosine}} kinases add <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> {{to other}} proteins {{to turn them}} on or off. Receptor kinases add <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> to receptor proteins at {{the surface of the}} cell (which receive protein signals from outside the cell and transmit them {{to the inside of the}} cell). Tyrosine kinases add <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> to the amino acid tyrosine in the target protein. They can cause cancer by turning the receptor permanently on (constitutively), even without signals from outside the cell.|$|R
50|$|Adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate {{is a form}} of an {{adenosine}} nucleotide {{with two}} <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> attached to different carbons in the ribose ring. This is distinct from adenosine diphosphate, where the two <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> are attached in a chain to the 5' carbon atom in the ring.|$|R
50|$|Zinc ions are {{surrounded}} by oxygen in a nearly perfect trigonal bipyramid and <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> are tetrahedral. The crystal structure consists of zig-zag chains of Zn1 polyhedra linked by <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> and pairs of Zn2 polyhedra. In each unit cell are two formula units of Zn2(PO4)(OH).|$|R
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
5|$|The first {{region on}} either side of the bilayer is the {{hydrophilic}} headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane, which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration.|$|E
5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> in the {{phosphodiester bond}} are {{negatively}} charged. Because the <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> have a pKa near 0, they are negatively charged at pH 7 [...] This repulsion forces the phosphates to take {{opposite sides of}} the DNA strands and is neutralized by proteins (histones), metal ions such as magnesium, and polyamines.|$|R
50|$|Alkaline {{phosphatase}} {{has become}} a useful tool in molecular biology laboratories, since DNA normally possesses <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> on the 5' end. Removing these phosphates prevents the DNA from ligating (the 5' end attaching to the 3' end), thereby keeping DNA molecules linear until the next step of the process {{for which they are}} being prepared; also, removal of the <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> allows radiolabeling (replacement by radioactive <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups)</b> in order to measure the presence of the labeled DNA through further steps in the process or experiment. For these purposes, the alkaline phosphatase from shrimp is the most useful, as it is the easiest to inactivate once it has done its job.|$|R
50|$|Acidic polysaccharides are polysaccharides {{that contain}} {{carboxyl}} <b>groups,</b> <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> and/or sulfuric ester groups.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show {{a high level}} of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorylation is a {{chemical}} reaction {{in which a}} small <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> is added to another molecule to change that molecule's activity. Autonomously active CaMKII and PKC use phosphorylation {{to carry out the}} two major mechanisms underlying the expression of E-LTP. First, and most importantly, they phosphorylate existing AMPA receptors to increase their activity. Second, they mediate or modulate the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Importantly, the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse during E-LTP is independent of protein synthesis. This is achieved by having a nonsynaptic pool of AMPA receptors adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane. When the appropriate LTP-inducing stimulus arrives, nonsynaptic AMPA receptors are rapidly trafficked into the postsynaptic membrane under the influence of protein kinases. As mentioned previously, AMPA receptors are the brain's most abundant glutamate receptors and mediate the majority of its excitatory activity. By increasing the efficiency and number of AMPA receptors at the synapse, future excitatory stimuli generate larger postsynaptic responses.|$|E
5|$|The {{backbone}} of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix, {{the direction of the}} nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime (5′) and three prime (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.|$|E

50|$|In biochemistry, a kinase {{is a type}} of {{enzyme that}} {{transfers}} <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> (see below) from high-energy donor molecules, such as ATP (see below) to specific target molecules (substrates); the process is termed phosphorylation. The opposite, an enzyme that removes <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> from targets, is known as a phosphatase. Kinase enzymes that specifically phosphorylate tyrosine amino acids are termed tyrosine kinases.|$|R
5000|$|Calf-intestinal {{alkaline}} phosphatase (CIAP/CIP) {{is a type}} of {{alkaline phosphatase}} that catalyzes the removal of <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> from the 5' end of DNA strands. This enzyme is frequently used in DNA sub-cloning, as DNA fragments that lack the 5' <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> cannot ligate. [...] This prevents recircularization of linearized vector DNA and improves the yield of vector containing the appropriate insert.|$|R
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a <b>phosphate</b> <b>group.</b> The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E

25|$|Induce {{glycogen}} synthesis – When glucose {{levels are}} high, insulin induces {{the formation of}} glycogen by the activation of the hexokinase enzyme, which adds a <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> in glucose, thus resulting in a molecule that cannot exit the cell. At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which removes the <b>phosphate</b> <b>group.</b> These two enzymes are key {{for the formation of}} glycogen. Also, insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and glycogen synthase which are responsible for glycogen synthesis.|$|E

50|$|In {{biochemistry}} {{and molecular}} biology, a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is a molecule containing a nucleoside bound to three <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups.</b> It is thus {{one type of}} nucleotide. Nucleoside triphosphates are necessary for life, as they provide {{the building blocks of}} nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and have many other roles in cell metabolism and regulation. NTPs generally provide energy and <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> for phosphorylation.|$|R
25|$|After a {{chloroplast}} polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol, {{an enzyme}} specific to chloroplast proteins phosphorylates, or adds a <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> to many (but not all) {{of them in}} their transit sequences.|$|E
25|$|The {{major reason}} for the {{immediate}} phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent diffusion out of the cell. The phosphorylation adds a charged <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> so the glucose 6-phosphate cannot easily cross the cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|A {{hexokinase}} is {{an enzyme}} that phosphorylates hexoses (six-carbon sugars), forming hexose phosphate. In most organisms, glucose {{is the most}} important substrate of hexokinases, and glucose-6-phosphate {{is the most important}} product. Hexokinase possesses the ability to transfer an inorganic <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> from ATP to a substrate.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, for cAMP, 3’5’-cyclic {{adenosine}} monophosphate {{indicates that a}} single <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> forms a cyclic structure with the ribose group at its 3’ and 5’ carbons, while the ribose group is also attached to adenosine (this bond is understood {{to be at the}} 1’ position of the ribose).|$|E
25|$|The free {{cysteine}} nucleophile forms a {{bond with}} the phosphorus atom of the phosphate moiety, and the P-O bond linking the <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> to the tyrosine is protonated, either by a suitably positioned acidic amino acid residue (Asp in the diagram below) or a water molecule. The phospho-cysteine intermediate is then hydrolysed by another water molecule, thus regenerating the active site for another dephosphorylation reaction.|$|E
25|$|Calcineurin is a -activated {{phosphatase}} (enzyme that {{removes a}} <b>phosphate</b> <b>group</b> from substrate) that regulates cardiac hypertrophy. Regulation occurs through NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) activation, which, when dephosphorylated, binds to GATA and forms a transcription factor (protein that can bind DNA and alter {{the expression of}} DNA) with ability to control the hypertrophic gene (2). Activation of calcineurin causes increases in hypertrophy.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of this molecule {{consists of a}} purine base (adenine) attached by the 9 nitrogen atom to the 1′ carbon atom of a pentose sugar (ribose). Three <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> are attached at the 5′ carbon atom of the pentose sugar. It is the addition and removal of these <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> that inter-convert ATP, ADP and AMP. When ATP is used in DNA synthesis, the ribose sugar is first converted to deoxyribose by ribonucleotide reductase.|$|R
5000|$|Magnesium ions are {{normally}} complexed to the <b>phosphate</b> <b>groups</b> the nucleotide substrates of PGK. It {{is known that}} {{in the absence of}} magnesium, no enzyme activity occurs. The bivalent metal assists the enzyme ligands in shielding the bound <b>phosphate</b> <b>group's</b> negative charges, allowing the nucleophilic attack to occur; this charge-stabilization is a typical characteristic of phosphotransfer reaction. [...] It is theorized that the ion may also encourage domain closure when PGK has bound both substrates.|$|R
