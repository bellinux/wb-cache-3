40|$|<b>Pedigreed</b> <b>breeding</b> {{often leads}} to severe health {{problems}} for, say, those dogs who exist {{as a result of}} the practice. It is also the case that virtually all of those unhealthy animals would not exist at all if it were not for the practice of <b>pedigreed</b> <b>breeding.</b> If those animals have lives worth living, then it follows that they are not harmed by the practice—assuming that a life worth living is better than no life at all. It would seem, then, that the standard account of harm cannot account for the wrongness of our intentionally creating pets with lower welfare. I argue that there is an overlooked aspect of harm that, when coupled with our responsibilities as animal caretakers, entails that we ought to cease the practice of <b>pedigreed</b> <b>breeding</b> for the sake of future pets, even if many actual pets are not made worse off by the practice...|$|R

5000|$|Simmental cattle {{were brought}} to Poland {{at the end of}} 18th century. In 1909, there were 21 Simmental cattle farms in the Polish Kingdom and in 1920 the Association of Highland Cattle Breeders was founded. In the period between the wars, {{breeding}} of Simmental cattle was concentrated in Eastern Małopolska Region and, specifically, in two districts: Krośnieński and Sanocki. At the time, the best cattle farms in Biłoboki reached the capacity of 6,295 kg of milk with 3.9 l fat content. From the outburst of the Second World War until 1995, a strong downward trend in the popularity of the breed among Polish breeders could be observed. Simmental bulls were liquidated and cows were typically mated with bulls of the Polish red breed. In 1955, by virtue of a decision issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, the breeding of Simmental cattle was located in south-eastern part of then Rzeszów Region in several counties and the <b>Pedigree</b> <b>Breeding</b> Center was set up in Brzozów. Between 1956 and 1950, cows and bulls were imported from Switzerland, Romania and Austria and, from 1972 to 1974, also from Germany. In total, between 1956 and 1974, 1,770 Simmental cows and 61 Simmental bulls were imported to Poland. From the early 1990s, the breeding of the Simmental cattle experienced another crisis resulting directly from a general recession in the whole Polish farming sector. The sale of the State <b>Pedigree</b> <b>Breeding</b> Center in Brzozów followed by the Center’s liquidation aggravated the crises. In the end of the 1990s, the condition of the sector began to improve slightly. At present, the population of Simmental cattle in Poland is nearly 40,000.|$|R

40|$|Mastitis is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} infectious disease in dairy herds. Breeding programs considering mastitis susceptibility were adopted as approaches to improve udder health status. In recent decades, conventional selection criteria based on phenotypic characteristics such as somatic cell score in milk {{have been widely used}} to select animals. Recently, approaches to incorporate molecular information have become feasible because of the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting mastitis resistance. The aims of the study were to explore molecular mechanisms underlying mastitis resistance and the genetic mechanisms underlying a QTL on Bos taurus chromosome 18 found to influence udder health. Primary cell cultures of mammary epithelial cells from heifers that were selected for high or low susceptibility to mastitis were established. Selection based on estimated <b>pedigree</b> <b>breeding</b> value or on the basis of marker-assisted selection using QTL information was implemented. The mRNA expression of 10 key molecules of the innate immune system was measured using quantitative real-time PCR after 1, 6, and 24 h of challenge with heat-inactivated mastitis pathogens (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) and expression levels in the high and low susceptibility groups were compared according to selection criteria. In the marker-assisted selection groups, mRNA expression in cells isolated from less-susceptible animals was significantly elevated for toll-like receptor 2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 8, RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal t-cell expressed and secreted), complement factor C 3, and lactoferrin. In the estimated <b>pedigree</b> <b>breeding</b> value groups, mRNA expression was significantly elevated only for V-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A, IL- 1 beta, and RANTES. These observations provide first insights into genetically determined divergent reactions to pathogens in the bovine mammary gland and indicate that the application of QTL information could be a successful tool for the selection of animals resistant to mastitis...|$|R
