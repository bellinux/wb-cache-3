40|$|The {{focus of}} the paper {{concerns}} the current discussion on {{the contribution of the}} hydrogen economy to a "sustainable energy system". It considers whether advantages for the environmental situation and energy carrier supply can be expected from the already visible future characteristics of hydrogen as a new secondary energy carrier. Possible production paths for hydrogen from hydrocarbon-based, renewable or carbon-reduced/-free primary energy carriers are evaluated with respect to primary energy use and CO 2 emissions from the fuel cycle. Hydrogen has to be packaged by compression or liquefaction, transported by surface vehicles or pipelines, stored and transferred to the end user. Whether generated by electrolysis or by reforming, and even if produced locally at filling stations, the gaseous or liquid hydrogen has to undergo these market processes before it can be used by the customer. In order to provide an idea of possible markets with special emphasis on the German energy sector, a technical systems analysis of possible hydrogen applications is performed for the stationary, mobile and portable sector. Furthermore, different "business as usual" scenarios are analysed for Germany, Europe and the World concerning end energy use in different sectors. The very small assumed penetration of hydrogen in the analysed scenarios up to the year 2050 indicates that the hydrogen economy is a long-term option. With reference to the assumed supply paths and analysed application possibilities, hydrogen can be an option for clean energy use if hydrogen can be produced with carbon-reduced or -free primary energy carriers like renewable energy or biomass. However, the energetic use of hydrogen competes with the direct use of clean primary energy and/or with the use of electric energy based on renewable primary energy. As a substitution product for other secondary energy carriers hydrogen is therefore under <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and/or must have advantages in comparison to the use of traditional energy carriers.

40|$|Abstract. Web {{application}} development {{is among the}} most rapidly changing areas in nowadays software industry. Both problem space and solution technologies affect the cost-effectiveness of such applications whose business <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost,</b> quality and time-to-market are among the most extreme. Model-driven architectures (MDA) separate the application logic from the underlying platform technology and represent this logic with precise semantic models. Web {{application development}} therefore has potentially the most to gain from adopting such techniques and models that can offer a greater return on development time and quality factors than traditional approaches. In this paper we describe a systematic approach to Model-driven development of data intensive web applications meant as hybrid between hypermedia and information systems. After first defining a suitably UML profile, the paper explains how data-intensive Web applications can be systematically and rigorously modeled using UML. It then describes how to perform model transformations to obtain a platform-specific model expressed by means of the Conallen’s profile and in turn how a suitable platform can be traceably generated. ...|$|R

The reason for the low profits of weavers {{has to do with the}} supply chain. Makers of Jamawar have to keep their costs low to sell to the majority of the consumers who cannot afford the cloth at higher prices. This means that the weaver suffers most, since they come last in the supply chain and cannot afford to be out of work and plus cannot dictate the price at which they will weave the cloth due to the almost monopoly of the few fixed designers cum wholesalers who dictate the market.|$|R

40|$|With complex buyer-driven global {{production}} {{networks and}} a labour-intensive manufacturing process, {{the fashion industry}} has become {{a focal point for}} debates on the social responsibility of business. Utilising an interview methodology with influential actors from seven export garment manufacturers in Sri Lanka, we explore the situated knowledge at one nodal point of the production network. We conceptualise factory management perspectives on the implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in terms of the strategic balancing of ethical considerations against the commercial <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> and lead time. Factory managers framed CSR in terms of compliance, rather than going above and beyond regulatory requirements; seeing it as a strategic competitive imperative and less a developmental mechanism. Sri Lankan manufacturers maintain that they have benefitted from a unique combination of factors, including strict national labour laws, an educated workforce, the characteristics of the garments produced, industrial upgrading, and long-term non-adversarial buyer-supplier relationships, which they argue has supported the establishment and maintenance of CSR practices. The paper thus provides managerial implications that relate CSR activities to CSR outcomes which include both reputational and production benefits. Such insights will be of strategic relevance for lead retail buyers as well as apparel producers keen to invest in CSR to partly mitigate against increasing price-based competition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{traditional}} IT environment, {{there is}} a constant <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> reduction. Unpredictable demands, rapid changes in technologies, complex IT portfolios and acquisitions, increased business competition, and revenue demands are the main factors which have compelled organizations to look for better alternatives. There is little automation and considerable amount of effort goes into resource provisioning of business processes. Approximately 80 percent of the average CIO’s time is spent on non-technical tasks such as cost, quality, and agility of service. Emergence of cloud computing is a boon for not only large organizations but SMBs also, considering agility, automation, on demand resources, scalability, low capital expense, and utility based billing model. Most of the organizations are inclined towards the use of cloud environment to be more strategic and to gain greater insight into business. Eighty Twenty Thinking has been applied in a variety of fields ranging from Economics, and Business, to Project Management and Software engineering to fine tune the practices in that field towards improved efficacy. Adoption of cloud models allows leaders and managers to devote relatively more time and effort to business strategy challenges and decision making.

40|$|The <b>cost</b> {{effective}} development <b>of</b> web applications {{is perhaps}} one of the most challenging areas of software engineering today. Not only are the problems to be solved, and the solution technologies to be used, in web application development among the most rapidly changing in the software industry, but the business <b>pressures</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost,</b> quality and time-to-market are among the most extreme. Web application development therefore has potentially the most to gain from software reuse approaches that can offer a greater return on development time than traditional approaches. However, simply combining ideas from these reuse paradigms and traditional web development technologies in ad-hoc ways will not result in sustainable improvements. In this paper we describe a systematic way of combining the benefits of component-based development and model driven architectures, two important reuse approaches, to support the cost effective development and maintenance of web applications. After first defining a suitably abstract component-model, the paper explains how component architectures can be systematically and rigorously modeled using UML. It then describes a powerful technique, known as stratification, for separating the various cross cutting aspects of a web application such that a suitable platform specific architecture can be traceably generated.

In this thesis, I aimed to investigate temporary agency workers’ dual affective commitment particularly in the South Korean institutional settings. My analysis implied that: (1) temporary agency workers’ affective organizational commitment to the user firm and to the agency would be cooperative rather than competing in general; (2) temporary agency workers would show higher level of affective organizational commitment to the user firm than to the agency; (3) perceived organizational supports from the user firm and from the agency respectively would have a significantly positive relationship with affective organizational commitment to the user firm and to the agency, which was consistent with the social exchange theory.
