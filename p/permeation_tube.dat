Mass flow controllers were used to control medical grade compressed air flowing through the <b>permeation</b> <b>tube</b> and a second dilution stream, introduced after the <b>permeation</b> <b>tube,</b> to produce concentrations of 101, 199, 484 and 924  ppb of ethanol based on the calibrated <b>permeation</b> <b>tube</b> emission rate. The concentration of ethanol produced with the <b>permeation</b> <b>tube</b> was checked using the platinum catalyst system as described previously (Baasandorj et al. 2015) resulting in a line with a slope of 1.1 and an R 2 value of 0.997 (data not shown). The temperature of the <b>permeation</b> <b>tube</b> was then increased to 80  °C to produce ethanol concentrations comparable to those observed in the fungal experiment (1.2 – 6.2  ppm). The humidity of the air was varied by utilizing a hydration flask before the dilution. Humidity was monitored via the ratio of the H 3 O+(H 2 O) to H 3 O+ ion intensities with calibration experiments performed under conditions that closely matched the humidity in the fungal experiments. At low humidity, the sensitivity factor had a relatively constant value of approximately 4.0. Calibrations were repeated after the experiments and yielded a sensitivity factor of approximately 3.9.|$|E

40|$|Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) {{and thermal}} {{desorption}} Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) allow for absolute quantification {{of a wide}} range of atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with concentrations in the ppbv to pptv range. Although often neglected, routine calibration is necessary for accurate quantification of VOCs by PTR-MS and GC-MS. Several gas calibration methods currently exist, including compressed gas cylinders, <b>permeation</b> <b>tubes,</b> diffusion tubes, and liquid injection. While each method has its advantages and limitations, no single technique has emerged that is capable of dynamically generating accurate concentrations of complex mixtures of VOCs over a large concentration range (ppbv to pptv), is technically simple and field portable, and affordable. We present the development of a new VOC calibration technique based on liquid injection with these features termed Dynamic Solution Injection (DSI). This method consists of injecting VOCs (0. 1 – 0. 5 mM) dissolved in cyclohexane (PTR-MS) or methanol (GC-MS) into a 1. 0 slpm flow of purified dilution gas in an unheated 25 mL glass vial. Upon changes in the injection flow rate (0. 5 – 4. 0 μL min&minus; 1 ), new VOC concentrations are reached within seconds to minutes, depending on the compound, with a liquid injection flow rate accuracy and precision of better than 7 % and 4 %, respectively. We demonstrate the utility of the DSI technique by calibrating a PTR-MS to seven different cyclohexane solutions containing a total of 34 different biogenic compounds including volatile isoprenoids, oxygenated VOCs, fatty acid oxidation products, aromatics, and dimethyl sulfide. In order to validate the new DSI method, a GC-MS and PTR-MS calibration intercomparison with VOC standards generated by dynamic dilution of NIST traceable <b>permeation</b> <b>tubes</b> (&alpha;-pinene, acetone, and ethanol) and a compressed gas cylinder (acetaldehyde) was made. The results revealed that while calibration of acetone is comparable between the methods, calibration curve slopes for other VOCs obtained by using <b>permeation</b> <b>tubes</b> and the compressed gas cylinder are lower than those obtained by the DSI technique by up to a factor of 2. This implies that concentration measurements of some VOCs may be overestimated using <b>permeation</b> <b>tubes</b> and/or compressed gas cylinders for calibration. Because of its high accuracy and precision, small size, low cost, and simplicity, we conclude that the Dynamic Solution Injection method will be of great use to both laboratory and field VOC studies...|$|R

The investigation of the developed systems in the laboratory and at real emission sources has shown the possibility of controlling the emissions of equipment in small businesses. The optimization of the systems can be performed by a GC/MS-Analysis of the emissions and adjusting the sensor arrays for the detection of the analyzed compounds. A gas sensor array based on semiconductor gas sensors without enrichment unit is suited for the controlling of one compound class, e. g. solvents in a paint shop or chlorinated substances at the dry cleaner's.

40|$|A flow {{injection}} analysis {{coupled with}} a gas permeation unit for the sensitive determination of ammonia was investigated to improve the sensitivity and the rapidity of the determination of trace amounts of ammonia in exhaust gas. As gas sampling times are shortened, ammonium concentrations in absorption liquid (boric acid solution) will be lowered; the determination sensitivity of ammonia in the absorption liquid needs to be improved. Various experimental conditions, such as reagent solutions, sample sizes, reaction temperatures, flow rates of the reagent solutions {{and the length of}} gas <b>permeation</b> <b>tube,</b> were investigated and optimized. Of these, the reaction temperature and the length of gas <b>permeation</b> <b>tube</b> were found to greatly effect the sensitivity improvement for the determination of ammonia. The effect of the length of the microporous PTFE tube used for the gas permeation system was investigated by varying the length from 5 cm to 50 cm. The results showed that is the 50 cm tube, the peak height was about 6 times higher than in the 10 cm tube, and the percentage of the permeation of ammonia was about 55 % and 9 % in the 50 cm and 10 cm tube, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection of ammonia was lowered down to on fifth of the previous system. The limit of detection corresponding to the standard deviation of the reagent blank of 3 was 4 μg l(- 1) of NH(4) (+). A calibration graph was linear from 10 μg l(- 1) to 500 μg l(- 1) of NH(4) (+). The relative standard deviations for 50 μg l(- 1) and 100 μg l(- 1) of NH(4) (+) were 4. 5 % and 2. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|An acid {{titration}} method for quantifying amine permeation rates {{was used to}} calibrate an Ambient pressure Proton transfer Mass Spectrometer (AmPMS) that monitors ambient amine compounds. The method involves capturing amines entrained in a N 2 flow by bubbling it through an acidified solution (~ 10 − 5 M HCl), and the amines are quantified via changes in solution pH with time.

40|$|With {{the signing}} of the Kyoto Protocol, New Zealand must reduce its {{national}} greenhouse gas emissions. As New Zealand has a large proportion of its national emissions as methane (~ 31 %), and methane (CH 4) has a short atmospheric lifetime, it provides a good target for mitigation strategies. The initial aim of this research was to identify high and low CH 4 -emitting cattle to assess factors that contribute to low CH 4 production. Initial studies using the SF 6 tracer technique to estimate CH 4 production could not identify consistently high and low CH 4 emitters. Research was therefore undertaken to confirm whether this was due to high variation in estimated CH 4 yields, and to quantify the within- and between-animal variation in CH 4 production when using the SF 6 technique. This research showed considerable within- (coefficient of variation, CV = 7 - 10 %) and between-animal (CV = 7 - 18 %) variation in CH 4 yield (g CH 4 /kg DMI) over time when using the SF 6 technique. This is larger than the within- (CV = 3 %) and between-animal (CV = 10 %) variation reported for calorimetry. This led to the recommendation that the SF 6 technique not be used in identifying animals for high or low CH 4 yield. A power analysis was developed based on the measured variances for the SF 6 technique. Results from this analysis provide researchers with important information on the number of animals and measurements per animal required when undertaking CH 4 experiments. One of the sources of variation with the SF 6 technique is the SF 6 release from <b>permeation</b> <b>tubes.</b> Estimated CH 4 yield increases by approximately 8. 5 % when going from a release rate of 3 mg SF 6 /day to a rate of 5 mg SF 6 /day. Further, an in vitro study indicated that SF 6 release from <b>permeation</b> <b>tubes</b> is approximately 8 % lower in rumen fluid than in air. While further research is required to confirm these results, they emphasise the need to allow time for the release rate to stabilise in the rumen for 4 - 5 days prior to undertaking measurements. It also led to the recommendation that release rates used in experiments should be within a narrow range, and balanced across experimental treatments...|$|R

The performance of the impinger standard gas generation system was assessed for four aromatic VOCs (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and m-xylene; BTEX) at varying flow rates (FR) of 50 to 800 mL·min− 1 . Because actual permeation rate (APR) values deviated from those computed by the manufacturer’s formula (MPR), new empirical relationships were developed to derive the predicted PR (PPR) of the target components. Experimental results corrected by such a formula indicate that the compatibility between the APR and MPR generally increased with low FR, while the reproducibility was generally reduced with decreasing flow rate.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the use of solid sampling-electrothermal vaporization-inductively. coupled plasma mass {{spectrometry}} (SS-ETV-ICPMS) for the direct and simultaneous determination of methylmercury and inorganic mercury in biological materials. The main advantage of this fast and sensitive method is that no sample preparation is required. In this way, the sample throughput can be considerably increased, problems of contamination and analyte losses are kept to a minimum and, even more important, the original chemical form of the different analyte species in the solid samples is preserved. To achieve this goal, a solid sample is inserted into a graphite furnace of the boat-in-tube type, and is subsequently submitted to an appropriate temperature program, leading to the separate vaporization of methylmercury and inorganic mercury, which are transported into the ICP by means of an argon carrier gas. The separation was accomplished within 75 s. For the quantification of the two peaks, species-unspecific isotope dilution was used. For this purpose, a stable flow of argon loaded with gaseous Hg isotopically enriched in Hg- 200 was generated using a <b>permeation</b> <b>tube</b> that was constructed in-house. Its emission rate was determined by collecting the mercury released during a given time interval on a gold-coated silica absorber, after which the amount, collected was released by heating of the absorber and determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS) and cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS). A reference material from the Canadian National. Research Council (NRC) (TORT- 2) was used to assess the accuracy of the,method. For.,the application of the method to samples with diverse mercury contents, the spike/sample ratio can be optimized by varying the emission rate of the <b>permeation</b> <b>tube</b> simply by adapting its temperature. To prove the feasibility of this approach, two reference materials (BCR 463 and DORM- 2) with a methylmercury content more than 10 times higher than that of TORT- 2 were also analyzed.

40|$|Abstract. Measurements of enteric methane (CH 4) {{emissions}} from individual animals {{have traditionally been}} made with indirect calorimetry techniques, which are both accurate and reliable. However, the expense and need for animal training {{and the extent to}} which calorimetric results can be extrapolated to free-ranging animals have been questioned and stimulated the development of the sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) tracer technique. The tracer technique is now widely used in New Zealand and many other countries for CH 4 emission measurements on grazing and pen-fed cattle, sheep, deer and alpacas. Few studies with cattle and sheep have examined the validity of the SF 6 tracer technique. Most of these studies have concluded that estimations of CH 4 emission by this technique do not differ from those of calorimetric techniques, though some exceptions have been reported. There is general agreement that the tracer technique is associated with large between-animal variability in the CH 4 emission estimates from animals on the same diet, but it remains unknown whether this is due to the environment, housing conditions or the technique itself. High within-animal variability has also been reported from tracer CH 4 measurements. There is growing evidence that CH 4 emission estimates by the tracer technique are positively influenced by the permeation rate (PR) of the SF 6 gas from <b>permeation</b> <b>tubes</b> and it has been suggested that fate of the tracer in the rumen rather than unrepresentative breath sample collection is the likely reason for the latter. It is concluded that although some issues related to the tracer technique need to be clarified, using a narrow range in PR and balancing of PR between treatments should be practised in order to overcome the relationship between PR and CH 4 emission estimates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{automated}} environmental air monitor {{has been}} developed to measure selected organic compounds in urban air. The instrument {{is based on a}} cryofocusing-thermal desorption gas chromatographic mass spectrometry technique where the mass spectrometer is a slightly modified residual gas analyzer (RGA). The RGA was chosen as a detector because the whole system must be robust for long periods, with 24 -h continuous air monitoring.

Moreover, because they have no physically limited ion source, contamination is considerably reduced, so maintenance intervals are longer.

Environmental air is enriched with an isotopically labeled internal standard in the sampling line. This internal standard is added with a validated, custom-made, <b>permeation</b> <b>tube</b> device. The “on-line” internal standard provides for high quality quantitative data because all variations in instrument sensitivity in cryofocusing or in thermal desorption efficiency are taken into account.

Laboratory validation of the method used a HF <b>permeation</b> <b>tube</b> in a Teflon and high density polyethylene (HDPE) sampling train with silica-dried ultra zero air and crushed sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reference samplers.

Here, under controlled conditions, we evaluated extended periods of sampling {{as an alternative to}} daily {{sample collection}}s. Eight rumen-fistulated cows were housed and fed lucerne silage to achieve common daily feed intakes of 6. 4 kg dry matter per cow. Following SF 6 <b>permeation</b> <b>tube</b> dosing, eight sampling lines were fitted to the breath collection harness, so that a common gas mix was available to each line. Half of the lines collected samples into PVC yokes using a modified capillary system as commonly used in New Zealand (NZL), and half collected samples into stainless steel cylinders using a ball-bearing flow restrictor as used in Argentina (ARG), all within a 10 -day time frame, either daily, across two consecutive 5 -day periods or across one 10 -day period (in duplicate). The NZL system had greater sampling success (97. 3 vs. 79. 5 %) and yielded more consistent CH 4 emission estimates than the ARG system. Emission estimates from NZL daily, NZL 5 -day and NZL 10 -day samplings were 114, 110 and 111 g d− 1 , respectively. Extended sample collection protocol may be feasible, but definitive evaluation of this alternative as well as sample collection systems is required under grazing situations before a decision on recommendation can be made...|$|E

40|$|Public {{concerns}} about offensive odor from livestock operations {{are on the}} rise, bringing up an increasing demand on odor treatment. In this work, a bench-scale standard gases generation and UV treatment system was built up, where standard gas mixtures including sulfuric compounds (H 2 S, methylmercaptan, ethylmercaptan, DMS and butylmercaptan), volatile fatty acids/VFAs (acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and isovaleric acid) and phenolic compounds (p-cresol, 4 -ethylphenol, indole and skatole), which have been proposed {{to be responsible for}} odor nuisance, were utilized to simulate aerial emissions from swine barn. <b>Permeation</b> <b>tubes</b> that carry unique compounds were weighed around every four weeks and the results showed a stable permeation rate for each compound. Solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) fiber was used to sample standard gases, and simultaneous chemical and olfactometry analyses of VOCs associated with odor were accomplished in a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O) system. Optimization of experimental conditions including the selection of SPME fiber and best extraction time was performed and thus Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 85 µm fiber and 10 min extraction was used in subsequent experiments. Gas samples with UV light off (control) and on (treatment) were extracted, respectively, and were sent to GC-MS-O system for analysis. When the total flowrate was 400 ml/min, at 10 min extraction, reduction rate for methylmercaptan, butyric acid and p-cresol was 96. 2 %, 48. 15 %, 92. 16 %, respectively, on chemical concentration, and 98. 4 %, 51. 1 %, 38. 9 %, on odor area count and 81. 48 %, 44. 69 % and 73. 36 % on odor intensity count. At 24 hr extraction, reduction rate for methylmercaptan, butyric acid and p-cresol was 99. 99 %, 62. 78 %, 96. 23 %, respectively, on chemical concentration, and 74. 66 %, 45. 06 %, 93. 56 %, on odor area count and 69. 93 %, 40. 01 % and 88. 66 % on odor intensity count. To better simulate swine barn emissions and evaluate flowrate effect on UV degradation rate, gases were extracted at higher flowrate, 1150 ml/min, 2150 ml/min and 3150 ml/min. The result showed reduction rate decreased as flowrate increased, but still a very good reduction rate of 79. 07 % on chemical concentration for p-cresol was obtained at flowrate 3150 ml/min, which further verified the powerful treatment effect of UV light on VOCs and odor and feasibility of extending this technique to field applications. Chemical reaction mechanism was preliminarily investigated based on the new compounds identified from the treatment sample, which was accordance with previous studies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{instrumental}} and methodological developments for speciation analysis of gaseous mercury (Hg(g)), based on isotope dilution analysis (IDA). The studied species include Hg 0, (CH 3) 2 Hg, CH 3 HgX and HgX 2 (where X symbolises a negatively charged counter ion {{in the form}} of a halide or hydroxyl ion). Gas chromatography hyphenated with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC-ICPMS) was used for separation and detection of Hg(g) species. <b>Permeation</b> <b>tubes</b> were used for the generation of gaseous isotopically enriched Hg standards (tracers). These tracers were continuously added to the sample gas stream during sampling of Hg(g). A mobile prototype apparatus incorporating both the permeation source and a sampling unit for collection of Hg(g) was developed and used for this purpose. Hg(g) species were pre-concentrated on Tenax TA and / or Carbotrap solid adsorbents. Au-Pt was used for pre-concentration of total Hg(g), either as the primary medium, or as backup. Collected species were eluted from these media and introduced to the instrument by thermal desorption. Various degrees of species transformations, as well as losses of analyte during pre-concentration and elution, were found to occur for both Tenax TA and Carbotrap. The performance characteristics of these media were shown to be species specific, as well as matrix dependent. The development of an on-line derivatisation procedure allowed for minimised species transformations, as well as reduced adsorption and memory effects of ionic Hg(g) species within the analytical system. In conclusion, IDA provides an important tool for identification, minimisation and correction of the above mentioned analytical problems. Furthermore, it offers significant advantages with respect to quality assurance, compared to conventional techniques, both when it comes to rational development of new methodology, as well as for continuous validation of existing procedures. The developed methodology for speciation analysis of Hg(g) has been tested in various applications, including the determination of Hg(g) species concentrations in ambient air (both in and outdoor) and in the head space of sediment microcosms. Hg(g) species were formed in the sediments as a result of naturally occurring redox and methylation processes, after addition of an isotope enriched aqueous Hg(II) precursor. The methodology has also been used for assessing the risk of occupational exposure to Hg(g) species during remediation of a Hg contaminated soil and for studying Hg 0 (g) transport and Au-Pt pre-concentration characteristics in natural gases. Hg 0 was used as the model species in the latter experiments, since it is believed to be the dominating form of Hg(g) in natural gas. The results indicate that the occurrence of H 2 S can cause temperature dependent adsorption and memory effects of Hg 0 (g) in the presence of stainless steel, thereby providing a plausible explanation to the variability of results for sour gases occasionally observed in the field. Hg 0 (g) has demonstrated overall high recovery during collection on Au-Pt tubes for all gases tested in this thesis. Recent (unpublished) results however indicate that there are potential species specific and matrix dependent effects associated with the Au-Pt based pre-concentration of Hg(g) in natural gases...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Volatile {{fatty acids}} (VFAs) are major {{components}} of odors associated with agricultural operations and livestock housing, solid waste processing and disposal, industrial and municipal wastewater collection, and treatment systems. Emission estimation {{and assessment of}} odor control methods depend on reliable air sampling and analysis methods for VFAs. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop and test a method for continuous and reliable generation of standard gas mixtures for VFAs based on permeation tubes. Standard gas mixtures for acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, valeric, and hexanoic acids were generated with permeation tubes and monitored for a 100 -day period. The gravimetric loss of VFAs from each tube was measured periodically and used to calculate the emission rate for each <b>permeation</b> <b>tube.</b> Emission rates were as high as 2, 011 ng/(min cm) for acetic acid to as low as 49 ng/(min cm) for isovaleric and hexanoic acids. The emission rate was combined with the dilution flow rate to calculate standard concentrations. Five different concentrations for each VFA were obtained by adjusting the dilution flow rate. Gas concentrations were monitored with DVB/Carboxen/PDMS 50 / 30 m SPME fibers using triplicate 1 min extractions. Maximum standard gas concentrations ranged from 21. 9 ppmv for acetic acid to 0. 22 ppmv for hexanoic acid. Minimum standard gas concentrations ranged from 3. 0 ppmv for acetic acid to 0. 03 ppmv for hexanoic acid. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for all VFA concentrations ranged from 1. 6 % to 7. 8 %. Rapid (1 min) SPME extractions were sufficient to preconcentrate significant amounts of VFAs for separation on a GC-FID without derivatization. The SPME technology proved to be very useful for monitoring standard gas mixtures. Dilution gas flow rat...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ruminant {{animals have}} a great {{advantage}} over simple-stomached animals, as their digestive process is able to release the energy contained in cellulosic material through carbohydrate fermentation by microorganisms enzymes from the rumen environment. However, carbohydrate fermentation results not only in short chain fatty acids (SCFA) but also in less desirable products such as heat, as well as methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) gases which represents energy loss for the animal estimated in 2 to 12 % of gross energy from feed (Johnson and Johnson, 1995). As an adult ruminant can produce up to 17 liters of methane per hour and this gas cannot be metabolized even by rumen microorganisms, {{most of it is}} removed from rumen by expiration or eructation (Moss, 1993), and released in the environment. There are different techniques for methane emissions measurements by ruminants in production conditions; among them there is one that uses an inert gas tracer, sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6). This technique results in a precise estimative of methane production by the animal besides enabling the evaluation of animals in normal pasture conditions, it consists in placing a <b>permeation</b> <b>tube,</b> which releases SF 6 at a previously known rate in the rumen, where by the contractions of this organ, CH 4 and SF 6 gases are released by eructation and samples are collected close to mouth and nostrils. This method assumes that the standard of SF 6 emission simulates the standard of CH 4 emission. The flow of CH 4 released by the animal is calculated in relation to SF 6 flow (Westberg et al., 1998). The objective with {{the present study was to}} evaluate energy sources inclusion in cattle diets on methane production determined by sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) tracer gas technique. 201...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} six fly ash samples on mercury {{speciation}} in simulated flue gas was evaluated in this study. A {{fixed bed reactor}} system was used to study the catalytic effect of fly ash on mercury oxidation at temperature of 140 °C in simulated flue gas consisting of N 2, CO 2, O 2, NO, NO 2, SO 2, HCl, and H 2 O. Mercury {{was introduced to the}} reactor using a temperature controlled <b>permeation</b> <b>tube.</b> Elemental and total mercury in the effluent were measured using a semi-continuous atomic fluorescence mercury monitor. Fly ash samples were characterized using SEM-EDAX, XRD, TGA, BET analyzer and particle size analyzer. Mercury uptake tests with different fly ash samples revealed that LOI (Loss On Ignition), surface area, and particle size all had positive effects on mercury oxidation and adsorption. Experiments with pure components showed that alumina (Al 2 O 3), silica (SiO 2), calcium oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), and titania (TiO 2) did not promote mercury oxidation or capture. Ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3), and unburned carbon were found to have profound effects on mercury oxidation and capture. Unburned carbon is considered the most important fly ash component for mercury oxidation due to much larger presence in fly ash than Fe 2 O 3. Experiments with carbon black and different flue gas composition revealed the importance of the interaction between flue gas and surface on mercury uptake. Oxygen containing surface functionalities did not enhance adsorption or oxidation of mercury by themselves. NO 2 and HCl promoted mercury oxidation and adsorption on carbon black. Addition of O 2 to HCl containing gas stream significantly improved mercury adsorption and oxidation. SO 2 seems to inhibit both mercury oxidation and adsorption. NO and H 2 O had little impact on mercury oxidation or adsorption in inert gas flow. H 2 O may inhibit mercury adsorption in early stages of the experiment, but the inhibitory effect diminished over time...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Grotthuss {{shuttling}} of {{an excess}} proton charge defect through hydrogen bonded water networks {{has long been}} the focus of theoretical and experimental studies. In this work we show that there is a related process in which water molecules move (“shuttle”) through a hydrated excess proton charge defect in order to wet the path ahead for subsequent proton charge migration. This process is illustrated through reactive molecular dynamics simulations of proton transport through a hydrophobic nanotube, which penetrates through a hydrophobic region. Surprisingly, before the proton enters the nanotube, it starts “shooting ” water molecules into the otherwise dry space via Grotthuss shuttling, effectively creating its own water wire where none existed before. As the proton enters the nanotube (by 2 − 3 Å), it completes the solvation process, transitioning the nanotube to the fully wet state. By contrast, other monatomic cations (e. g., K+) have just the opposite effect, by blocking the wetting process and making the nanotube even drier. As the dry nanotube gradually becomes wet when the proton charge defect enters it, the free energy barrier of proton <b>permeation</b> through the <b>tube</b> via Grotthuss shuttling drops significantly.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} Phase 1 of the ''Air Force Hydrazine Detector Characterization and Calibration Project''. A method for calibrating model MDA 7100 hydrazine detectors in the United States Air Force (AF) inventory has been developed. The calibration system consists of a Kintek 491 reference gas generation system, a humidifier/mixer system which combines the dry reference hydrazine gas with humidified diluent or carrier gas to generate the required humidified reference for calibrations, and a gas sampling interface. The Kintek reference gas generation system itself is periodically calibrated using an ORNL-constructed coulometric titration system to verify the hydrazine concentration of the sample atmosphere in the interface module. The Kintek reference gas is then used to calibrate the hydrazine monitors. Thus, coulometric titration is only used to periodically assess {{the performance of the}} Kintek reference gas generation system, and is not required for hydrazine monitor calibrations. One advantage of using coulometric titration for verifying the concentration of the reference gas {{is that it is a}} primary standard (if used for simple solutions), thereby guaranteeing, in principle, that measurements will be traceable to SI units (i. e., to the mole). The effect of humidity of the reference gas was characterized by using the results of concentrations determined by coulometric titration to develop a humidity correction graph for the Kintek 491 reference gas generation system. Using this calibration method, calibration uncertainty has been reduced by 50 % compared to the current method used to calibrate hydrazine monitors in the Air Force inventory and calibration time has also been reduced by more than 20 %. Significant findings from studies documented in this report are the following: (1) The Kintek 491 reference gas generation system (generator, humidifier and interface module) can be used to calibrate hydrazine detectors. (2) The Kintek system output concentration is less than the calculated output of the generator alone but can be calibrated as a system by using coulometric titration of gas samples collected with impingers. (3) The calibrated Kintek system output concentration is reproducible even after having been disassembled and moved and reassembled. (4) The uncertainty of the reference gas concentration generated by the Kintek system is less than half the uncertainty of the Zellweger Analytics' (ZA) reference gas concentration and can be easily lowered to one third or less of the ZA method by using lower-uncertainty flow rate or total flow measuring instruments. (5) The largest sources of uncertainty in the current ORNL calibration system are the permeation rate of the <b>permeation</b> <b>tubes</b> and the flow rate of the impinger sampling pump used to collect gas samples for calibrating the Kintek system. Upgrading the measurement equipment, as stated in (4), can reduce both of these. (6) The coulometric titration technique can be used to periodically assess the performance of the Kintek system and determine a suitable recalibration interval. (7) The Kintek system has been used to calibrate two MDA 7100 s and an Interscan 4187 in less than one workday. The system can be upgraded (e. g., by automating it) to provide more calibrations per day. (8) The humidity of both the reference gas and the environment of the Chemcassette affect the MDA 7100 hydrazine detector's readings. However, ORNL believes that the environmental effect is less significant than the effect of the reference gas humidity. (9) The ORNL calibration method based on the Kintek 491 M-B gas standard can correct for the effect of the humidity of the reference gas to produce the same calibration as that of ZA's. Zellweger Analytics calibrations are typically performed at 45 %- 55 % relative humidity. (10) Tests using the Interscan 4187 showed that the instrument was not accurate in its lower (0 - 100 ppb) range. Subsequent discussions with Kennedy Space Center (KSC) personnel also indicated that the Interscan units were not reproducible when new sensors were used. KSC had discovered that the Interscan units read incorrectly on the low range because of the presence of carbon dioxide. ORNL did not test the carbon dioxide effect, but it was found that the units did not read zero when a test gas containing no hydrazine was sampled. According to the KSC personnel that ORNL had these discussions with, NASA is phasing out the use of these Interscan detectors...|$|R
