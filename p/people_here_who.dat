2500|$|In a {{published}} {{report on the}} website of the newspaper trade journal Editor & Publisher, the editor of The Inter-Mountain, a local afternoon daily based in Elkins, West Virginia, blamed the national media's inaccurate reporting on {{a lack of knowledge}} of local culture. [...] "We get a lot of <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>who</b> sometimes believe they have an inside story because they hear it on a police scanner or listen to a conversation," [...] Linda Skidmore said. [...] "We know to be cautious of those situations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kramer {{currently}} {{lives in}} Manhattan, near Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, and in Connecticut. [...] Another resident of Kramer's Manhattan residential complex was Kramer's longtime nemesis, Ed Koch. [...] The two {{saw each other}} relatively infrequently, since they lived in separate towers. [...] When Kramer saw Koch looking at the apartment in 1989, Kramer reportedly told him, [...] "Don't move in here! There are <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>who</b> hate you!" [...] On another occasion, Koch tried to pet Kramer's dog in the building's mail area, and Kramer snatched the dog away.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2008, a {{handmade}} poster {{created by}} Elisabeth, {{her children and}} her mother at the therapy facility was displayed in the Amstetten town centre. The message thanked local people for their support. [...] "We, the whole family, {{would like to take}} the opportunity {{to thank all of you}} for sympathy at our fate", they wrote in their message. [...] "Your compassion is helping us greatly to overcome these difficult times, and it shows us there also are good and honest <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>who</b> really care for us.

5000|$|It {{is common}} for {{residents}} {{to move from one}} home to another in the neighborhood. The practice has been called the [...] "Shippan Shuffle."

6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] Norgate assented. [...] "Meanwhile, even a month {{away from}} London {{seems to have}} brought a fresh set of <b>people</b> <b>here.</b> <b>Who</b> is the tall, thin young man with the sunburnt face? He seems familiar, somehow, but I can't place him." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{was lucky}} to get into {{computers}} {{when it was a}} very young and idealistic industry.

500|$|After the war, Slotin {{expressed}} growing {{disdain for}} his personal involvement in the project. He remarked, [...] "I have {{become involved in the}} Navy tests, much to my disgust." [...] Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was still required because, as he said, [...] "I am one of the few <b>people</b> left <b>here</b> <b>who</b> are experienced bomb putter-togetherers." [...] He looked forward to resuming teaching and research into biophysics and radiobiology at the University of Chicago. He began training a replacement, Alvin C.

6000|$|... "But {{against all}} this I {{have to set}} the {{preservation}} of our lives, {{in a way the}} most awfully providential; and the safety of every one on the Estate. And I have also the great satisfaction of reflecting that all the Negroes from whom any assistance could reasonably be expected, behaved like so many Heroes of Antiquity; risking their lives and limbs for us and our property, while their own poor houses were flying like chaff before the hurricane. There are few White <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>who</b> can say as much for their Black dependents; and the force and value of the relation between Master and Slave has been tried by the late calamity on a large scale.|$|E

"Who can tell? <b>People</b> <b>here,</b> <b>who</b> don't {{study the}} nature of volcanoes much, though {{surrounded}} by them, will expect things ere long to resume their normal condition.

We cannot tell whether a great eruption similar to that of 1680 may not be in store for us. The only reason that I can see for the quiescence of this peak of Rakata is, as I said to you once before, that it stands not so much above the old crater as above and on the safe side of its lip." ...|$|E

Careless about their souls! Oh, father, how often I think of that, now. How strange it seems that we should ever be thus careless! What should we say of the jeweller who would devote all his time and care to the case that held his largest diamond, and neglect the gem itself? Nora has got up a Sunday school at the village, and Billy helps her with it. The Grotto did wonders for him--so he says himself.|$|E

5000|$|An {{influential}} July 2010 {{report by}} Paul Kerswill, Professor of Sociolinguistics at Lancaster University, Multicultural London English: the emergence, acquisition and diffusion {{of a new}} variety, predicted that the cockney accent will disappear from London's streets within 30 years. The study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, said that the accent, which {{has been around for}} more than 500 years, is being replaced in London by a new hybrid language. [...] "Cockney in the East End is now transforming itself into Multicultural London English, a new, melting-pot mixture of all those <b>people</b> living <b>here</b> <b>who</b> learnt English as a second language", Prof Kerswill said.|$|R

You know, there are so many stupid <b>people</b> around <b>here</b> <b>who</b> have never understood anything at all about the war, and he was very anxious to get Colonel Ray to talk to them. He had no idea, however, that it was the night fixed for your lecture, and he hopes that you will accept the loan of the village hall from him any night you like, and we should so much like all of us to come." ...|$|R

Why should I not give this little {{unprotected}} woman my arm? there are scarce half a dozen <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>who</b> can speak a word of her language. I can talk a little French, and she is welcome to it; and if Colonel Wolfe does not choose to touch his hat to me, when I am walking with her, by George he may leave it alone," [...] cried Harry, flushing up.|$|E
60|$|The {{offer was}} accepted, and the traitor {{and his two}} sons {{made their way to}} Bruce's place of concealment. As they approached, Bruce {{snatched}} his bow from his page and shot the traitor through the eye. One son attacked him with an axe, but was slain with a blow from the king's sword. The remaining assailant rushed at him with a spear; but the king with one blow cut off the spearhead, and before the assailant had time to draw his sword, stretched him dead at his feet. After this the king with his adherents eluded the search of the English and made their way into Galloway. The <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>who</b> were devoted to the English cause determined to hunt him down, and two hundred men, accompanied by some blood hounds, set off towards the king's retreat; but Bruce's scouts were on the watch and brought him news of their coming. The king with his party retired until they reached a morass, through which flowed a running stream, while beyond a narrow passage led through a deep quagmire.|$|E

[...] He took his little golden vase from the table behind him, and told me what I had already heard him tell Lucilla while I was listening at the window. [...] "You would have found me at work this morning," [...] he went on, [...] "if the stupid people who send me my metal plates had not made a mistake. The alloy, in the gold and silver both, is all wrong this time. I must return the plates to be melted again before I can do anything with them. They are all {{ready to go back}} to-day, when the cart comes.

5000|$|Kahiu situates {{her work}} as a filmmaker making films about Africa to combat these images.

6000|$|Then Dame Brysen {{leaned over}} the Lady Elaine and catched her beneath the arm and said: [...] "Lady, Lady! {{restrain}} your passion! remember yourself, and that <b>people</b> are <b>here</b> <b>who</b> will see you." [...] Therewith Dame Brysen lifted the Lady Elaine up from where she kneeled, and she brought her out of that gloomy place, still weeping with a great passion of love and pity. But yet the Lady Elaine had so much thought for herself that she drew her veil across her face so that none might behold her passion, and she said to Dame Brysen, [...] "Take me to my father," [...] and so, Dame Brysen, embracing her with one arm, led her to where King Pelles was.|$|R
6000|$|... "That man Phil Matlack, who {{is going}} with us to-morrow, is quite a character, and I expect I shall like him awfully.

There are <b>people</b> about <b>here</b> <b>who</b> believe that Phil Matlack would fight a bear single-handed if it happened to be necessary. Mr. Sadler would do it himself if he could walk. Nobody knows how many men he killed when he was fighting Indians; and, would you believe it? his wife is a plain, little, quiet woman, who lives in some part of the hotel where nobody ever sees her, because she is rather bashful and dislikes company.|$|R
