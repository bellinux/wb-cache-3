5|$|As it {{was easier}} to raise money for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of radioactive isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with leukemia. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human <b>patients.</b> <b>A</b> 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received neutron therapy from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of radioactive isotopes as radioactive tracers to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E
5|$|Her first magical mentor was the Irish occultist and Freemason Theodore Moriarty. She had befriended {{him while}} still {{involved}} in psychotherapy, believing {{that he could}} help one of her <b>patients,</b> <b>a</b> {{young man who had}} been fighting on the Western Front and claimed to be plagued by unexplained physical phenomena. Moriarty performed an exorcism, claiming that the young man was the victim of the soul of a deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite. Fortune became an acolyte of Moriarty's Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in Hammersmith, and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen's home in Bishop's Stortford. Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of Atlantis, a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune. Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as The Secrets of Dr. Taverner in 1926. Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of etheric vampires.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} section is {{a summary of}} a case study performed by Scheerer and Goldstei in 1966. <b>Patient</b> <b>A</b> was a 36-year-old mechanic, formerly in the Navy, who had a wife and three children. Due to <b>an</b> unfortunate accident, <b>Patient</b> <b>A’s</b> frontal lobe experienced significant damage. This brain damage resulted in a slight decrease in cognitive and physical skills {{as well as a}} change in personality. There were also some specific memory problems suggestive of selective amnesia. For example, <b>Patient</b> <b>A</b> worked with the same doctor for many years. However, if the doctor was absent for several days, <b>Patient</b> <b>A</b> was unable to remember him or, if <b>Patient</b> <b>A</b> did remember him, he thought the doctor was a Naval officer. Also, <b>Patient</b> <b>A</b> could only vaguely remember events that happened recently. For instance, he could remember if someone had visited him the day before but could not remember who had visited him. He could also report that he had formerly been in the Navy and that he had a wife and children, but there were many gaps and inconsistencies in his memory. While studying these inconsistencies, Scheerer and Goldstei found that <b>Patient</b> <b>A’s</b> memory was sharpest for positive memories and weakest for negative memories. The study of <b>Patient</b> <b>A</b> gives evidence to the theory that patients with selective amnesia cling to specific memories, specifically positive memories. However, this fixation on positive memories causes patients to misremember negative or neutral life events, causing their memory to appear disjointed and defective.|$|R

5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford <b>patients</b> <b>a</b> comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E
5|$|The mobile {{sections}} of the field ambulances followed their brigades to Es Salt with their camel transport. They travelled up the Umm esh Shert and Jisr ed Damieh tracks, while their wheeled transport followed by the Shunet Nimrim road. A divisional collecting station was established at Suweileh, during the Second Battle of Amman, by the immobile section of the 1st Light Horse Field Ambulance and the Anzac (No. 7) Sanitary Section. Both of these units arrived from Jerusalem early on 25 September, following the wheeled supply vehicles along the Shunet Nimrin road. Subsequently a dressing-station was opened {{in the ruins of}} the Roman amphitheatre at Amman. There, 268 sick and wounded light horsemen were admitted up to 30 September and evacuated from Amman by motor ambulance wagons. Two Ottoman hospitals in the town were found to hold 480 <b>patients,</b> <b>a</b> number which quickly grew to more than 1,000. These patients and the Ottoman medical staff were evacuated to Jerusalem by motor lorries. There were also 1,269 British and Indian sick evacuated from Amman in the ten days between 30 September and 9 October.|$|E
