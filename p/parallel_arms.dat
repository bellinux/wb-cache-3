40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to study the essential• factors {{involved}} in the execution of the <b>parallel</b> <b>arm</b> downswing in the sequence of the backward giant swing on the still rings. Comparisons were made among gymnasts who had had different amounts of experience in the use of the <b>parallel</b> <b>arm</b> downswing technique. The subjects were four male American collegiate gymnasts. Selected as the experienced performers were an Olympic gymnast from Indiana State University, Terre Haute, Indiana, and. a specialist on the still rings from Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana. Selected as the less experienced performers were two all around gymnasts from the Ball State University men's gymnastic team. The cinematographic method was used to collect the data. In order to identify the biomechanical differences between the subjects, seven categories were considered to be the essential factors possibly involved in the execution of the <b>parallel</b> <b>arm</b> downswing. The horizontal and linear velocities of the wrist, the body angles, the angular velocity of the body segments, and the total body's tangential forces were graphed and studied. Plots of the trajectory of the center of gravity and plots of the loci of the body joints were compared and interpreted. The performance times of the subjects were compared in terms of the time elapsed during the whole and a part of the downswing. It was concluded that for these subjects, the successful <b>parallel</b> <b>arm</b> downswing should be accomplished by using the following factors: a faster push of the rings, a lean of the shoulders, a straighter body, a stronger beat action of the trunk, a proper timing (after the bottom of the downswing) of the legs and. a closer trajectory of the center of gravity throughout the downswing. The total body's tangential force and the performance time, appeared to be essential factors for the successful <b>parallel</b> <b>arm</b> downswing. However, it was not determined whether a greater amount of force or a shorter execution time is necessary for the ideal execution of the reverse giant swing on the still rings. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the water}} of the Rehbach was already {{diverted}} from Speyerbach in the village of Winzingen, which is now a district of Neustadt. In the area of Haßloch and Böhl-Iggelheim, it was split into two <b>parallel</b> <b>arms</b> for about 8 km. They provided the water for the local drive watermills and sawmills. On the southern arm, the actual Rehbach, three mills have been preserved.

5000|$|The {{white clipper}} is a circuit that clips out the excess level of video signal. It is {{especially}} important for those transmitters that receive signals from other transmitters through professional receivers. The circuit has two <b>parallel</b> <b>arms.</b> In the first arm a Zener diode clips out the signal in excess of 1 volt. In the second arm, the chrominance signal bypasses the Zener diode through a band pass filter. Sometimes it is necessary or desirable to create a soft clipping action where some highlight detail can be preserved in high contrast scenes. This is known as a [...] "knee" [...] circuit after the shape of the transfer characteristic graph.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{greatest}} ecological losses in Brazil was {{the disappearance of the}} Sâo Simão Channel (Canal de São Simão) located on the lower stretch of the river. It was a narrow gorge cut into the basalt, with 23 kilometers length and 35 meters depth, situated on the boundary of the states of Minas and Goiás. The waters of the river, after dividing into two <b>parallel</b> <b>arms,</b> returned to a common bed, forming a corridor of waterfalls. Today this spectacle no longer exists. The building of the São Simão Dam, with the need to increase the capacity of power of the hydroelectric power station, has created a huge lake whose waters have covered the channel.|$|E
5000|$|The AKM has a {{modified}} trigger assembly, {{equipped with a}} hammer-release delaying device (installed on the same axis pin together with the trigger and disconnector) commonly called a [...] "rate reducer". In fact its primary purpose is not to reduce the rate of automatic fire; it is a safety device to ensure the weapon will only fire on automatic when the bolt is fully locked, as the hammer is tripped by the bolt carrier's last few millimetres of forward movement. The device also reduces [...] "trigger slap" [...] or [...] "trigger bounce" [...] and the weapon’s rate of fire, which also reduces the dispersion of bullets when firing in fully automatic mode. The hammer was also changed and equipped with a protrusion that engages the rate reducer and the trigger has only one notched hammer release arm (compared to two <b>parallel</b> <b>arms</b> in the AK-47).|$|E
5000|$|The {{major feature}} of the New Fifteen was the much further forward {{placement}} of the engine and more comfortable between-axles placement for passengers allowed by the fitting of “independent front wheel springing” [...] developed from an André-Girling design {{in the form of}} unequal-length <b>parallel</b> <b>arms</b> located with radius arms and using coil springs.

5000|$|The archetypical {{house of}} the late 17th century had several {{distinguishing}} features. The building was usually quite simple in design, with a similar plan to a contemporary English farmhouse. Though usually only one storey tall, most were built facing out from slopes (possibly to preserve the comparatively fertile valleys for agriculture, a dominant industry until the 20th century), thus necessitating a set of steps to the front entrance. These staircases were styled to curve out, so ending up far wider at the base than at the top. This flared style, known locally today as [...] "Welcoming Arm" [...] stairs, remains common. [...] Less common variants used <b>parallel</b> <b>arms,</b> and in the narrow streets of the Town of St. George staircases were often flush with the wall. [...] At {{the top of the}} stairs would be a porch-like vestibule, larger than was common elsewhere, where visitors and passersby could rest in the shade. These porch areas were continuously expanded with furniture and muslin mosquito nets. [...] Wooden window shutters became common, particularly [...] "jalousies" [...] — which were hinged at the top — that were probably imported from the West Indies. Food was often stored in a buttery removed from the main house, which were designed to keep food cool. This was achieved by keeping the actual storage room raised above the ground, typically five or six steps worth of height, and using a pointed roof, enabling convective heat transfer to keep warm air from the food. Kitchens were also distinctive, occasionally placed in out-buildings or in basements and noted for the use of wide, raised chimneys possibly inspired by the open hearth.|$|E

40|$|Male {{and female}} Wistar rats were treated postnatally (PND 5 - 16) with BSO (l-buthionine-(S,R) -sulfoximine) {{to provide a}} rat model of {{schizophrenia}} based on transient glutathione deficit. In the watermaze, BSO-treated male rats perform very efficiently in conditions where a diversity of visual information is continuously available during orientation trajectories [1]. Our hypothesis is that the treatment impairs proactive strategies anticipating future sensory information, while supporting a tight visual adjustment on memorized snapshots, i. e. compensatory reactive strategies. To test this hypothesis, BSO rats' performance was assessed in two conditions using an 8 -arm radial maze task: a semi-transparent maze with no available view on the environment from maze centre [2], and a modified 2 -parallel maze known to induce a neglect of the parallel pair in normal rats [3 - 5]. Male rats, but not females, were affected by the BSO treatment. In the semi-transparent maze, BSO males expressed a higher error rate, especially in completing the maze after an interruption. In the 2 -parallel maze shape, BSO males, unlike controls, expressed no neglect of the <b>parallel</b> <b>arms.</b> This second result was in accord with a reactive strategy using accurate memory images of the contextual environment instead of a representation based on integrating relative directions. These results are coherent with a treatment-induced deficit in proactive decision strategy based on multimodal cognitive maps, compensated by accurate reactive adaptations based on the memory of local configurations. Control females did not express an efficient proactive capacity in the semi-transparent maze, neither did they show the significant neglect of the <b>parallel</b> <b>arms,</b> which might have masked the BSO induced effect. Their reduced sensitivity to BSO treatment is discussed with regard to a sex biased basal cognitive style...|$|E
