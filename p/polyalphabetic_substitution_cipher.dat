25|$|The Enigma was an {{electro-mechanical}} {{rotor machine}} {{used for the}} encryption and decryption of secret messages. It was developed in Germany in the 1920s. The repeated changes of the electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard implemented a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher,</b> which turned plaintext into ciphertext and back again. The Enigma's scrambler contained rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverted the current to a different position on the two sides. On depressing a key on the keyboard, an electric current flowed through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turned it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to cause one lamp on the lampboard to be illuminated.|$|E
50|$|It {{produced}} a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> with a period (16,900) that was {{many times the}} length of the longest message.|$|E
50|$|The Enigma {{machines}} {{produced a}} <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b> During World War I, inventors {{in several countries}} realized that a purely random key sequence, containing no repetitive pattern, would, in principle, make a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> unbreakable. This {{led to the development}} of rotor cipher machines which alter each character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, by means of a scrambler comprising a set of rotors that alter the electrical path from character to character, between the input device and the output device. This constant altering of the electrical pathway produces a very long period before the pattern—the key sequence or substitution alphabet—repeats.|$|E
5000|$|Simple ciphers were {{replaced}} by <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> (such as the Vigenère) which changed the substitution alphabet for every letter. For example, [...] "GOOD DOG" [...] can be encrypted as [...] "PLSX TWF" [...] where [...] "L", [...] "S", and [...] "W" [...] substitute for [...] "O". With even {{a small amount of}} known or estimated plaintext, simple <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> and letter transposition ciphers designed for pen and paper encryption are easy to crack. It is possible to create a secure pen and paper cipher based on a one-time pad though, but the usual disadvantages of one-time pads apply.|$|R
50|$|In cryptanalysis, Kasiski {{examination}} (also {{referred to}} as Kasiski's test or Kasiski's method) is a method of attacking <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers,</b> such as the Vigenère cipher. It was first published by Friedrich Kasiski in 1863, but {{seems to have been}} independently discovered by Charles Babbage as early as 1846.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> {{were first}} {{described}} in 1467 by Battista Alberti {{in the form}} of disks. Trithemius, in his book Steganographia (Greek for [...] "hidden writing") introduced the now more standard form of a tableau (see below; ca. 1500 but not published until much later). A more sophisticated version using mixed alphabets was described in 1563 by Battista della Porta in his book, De Furtivis Literarum Notis (Latin for [...] "On concealed characters in writing").|$|R
50|$|The Enigma rotor {{cipher machine}} was {{potentially}} an excellent system. It generated a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher,</b> with a period before {{repetition of the}} substitution alphabet that was much longer than any message, or set of messages, sent with the same key.|$|E
50|$|A {{polyalphabetic}} cipher is any cipher {{based on}} substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The Vigenère cipher {{is probably the}} best-known example of a polyalphabetic cipher, {{though it is a}} simplified special case. The Enigma machine is more complex but still fundamentally a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example of}} a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> that is much more {{difficult}} to decode is the Vigenère square, an innovative encoding method. With the square, there are 26 different cipher alphabets that are used to encrypt text. Each cipher alphabet is just another rightward Caesar shift of the original alphabet. This is what a Vigenère square looks like: ...|$|E
50|$|In <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> {{where the}} <b>substitution</b> alphabets are {{chosen by the}} use of a keyword, the Kasiski {{examination}} allows a cryptanalyst to deduce the length of the keyword. Once the length of the keyword is discovered, the cryptanalyst lines up the ciphertext in n columns, where n is the length of the keyword. Then each column can be treated as the ciphertext of a monoalphabetic <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b> As such, each column can be attacked with frequency analysis. Similarly, where a rotor stream cipher machine has been used, this method may allow the deduction of the length of individual rotors.|$|R
5000|$|In 1863, Kasiski {{published}} a 95-page book on cryptography, Die Geheimschriften und die Dechiffrir-Kunst (German, [...] "Secret {{writing and the}} Art of Deciphering"). This was the first {{published a}}ccount of a procedure for attacking <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers,</b> especially the Vigenère cipher (although it is possible Charles Babbage was already aware of a similar method but had not published it). The method relied on the analysis of gaps between repeated fragments in the ciphertext; such analysis can give hints as {{to the length of}} the key used. This technique is known as Kasiski examination.|$|R
5000|$|Regular <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> often rely on {{code words}} to {{determine}} alphabet changes. Each {{letters of the}} code work references a different alphabet. With the ten charts of Hyakutake's system, a code number {{would be easy to}} use for pseudo-random changes --- [...] "301934859762" [...] means encode the first word or phrase with the third table, the second word or phrase with the tenth (zeroth) table, etc. The thirteenth word or phrase would be encoded with the third table again. Of course to give maximum security this code number needs to be changed frequently.|$|R
50|$|In {{classical}} cryptography, {{the running}} key cipher {{is a type}} of <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> in which a text, typically from a book, is used to provide a very long keystream. Usually, the book to be used would be agreed ahead of time, while the passage to be used would be chosen randomly for each message and secretly indicated somewhere in the message.|$|E
50|$|The grill method (metoda rusztu), in cryptology, was {{a method}} used chiefly early on, {{before the advent}} of the cyclometer, by the mathematician-cryptologists of the Polish Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów) in decrypting German Enigma machine ciphers. The Enigma rotor cipher machine changes {{plaintext}} characters into cipher text using a different permutation for each character, and so implements a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b>|$|E
50|$|By itself, a rotor {{performs}} only a {{very simple}} type of encryption—a simple substitution cipher. For example, the pin corresponding to the letter E might be wired to the contact for letter T on the opposite face, and so on. Enigma's security came from using several rotors in series (usually three or four) and the regular stepping movement of the rotors, thus implementing a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b>|$|E
50|$|Between circa World War I and the {{widespread}} availability of computers (for some governments this was approximately the 1950s or 1960s; for other organizations {{it was a}} decade or more later; for individuals it was no earlier than 1975), mechanical implementations of <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> were widely used. Several inventors had similar ideas about the same time, and rotor cipher machines were patented four times in 1919. The most important of the resulting machines was the Enigma, especially in the versions used by the German military from approximately 1930. The Allies also developed and used rotor machines (e.g., SIGABA and Typex).|$|R
40|$|Graphs may be {{used for}} the design of stream ciphers, block ciphers or public-key ciphers. This paper {{presents}} a method of using paths between a pair of graph vertice for designing effective <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers.</b> A similar method can be developed basing on cut-sets or spanning trees. The period of alphabet changeovers is equal to the number of paths between a pair of selected vertices on the graph, the number of spanning trees, cut-sets or is a multiple of these values. The results of statistical tests and an assessment of the cryptographic strength of these ciphers are presented. Also proposed are modifications of these ciphers based on modifying the labels of vertices or edges (arcs) of the graph. These modifications influence the statistical properties and period lengths. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{possibility}} of exploiting the features of Genetic Algorithm with poly substitution methods in a linear way, to generate ASCII values of the given text and then applying conversion, transposition with the features of Cryptography. In <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> the plaintext letters are enciphered differently depending upon their placement in the text. As the name polyalphabetic suggests this is achieved by using several two, three keys and random keys combinations instead of just one, {{as is the case}} in most of the simpler crypto systems. Using two keys, we take 2 keys e 1,e 2 and let the ASCII values of e 1 be 1 and e 2 be 2 and take the text, add ASCII values of e 1 to first character and ASCII values of e 2 to second character. Alternatively add the value of e 1 and e 2 to consecutive characters. We can use Poly substitution method combining the features of cryptography for text encryption by 2 keys and 3 keys and even more then 3 keys to make the decryption process more complicated.

50|$|Rotor {{machines}} {{build on}} this idea by, in effect, changing the wiring with each key stroke. The wiring is placed inside a rotor, and then rotated with a gear {{every time a}} letter was pressed. So while pressing A the first time might generate a Q, the next time it might generate a J. Every letter pressed on the keyboard would spin the rotor and get a new substitution, implementing a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{component}} {{is a set}} of rotors, also termed wheels or drums, which are rotating disks with an array of electrical contacts on either side. The wiring between the contacts implements a fixed substitution of letters, replacing them in some complex fashion. On its own, this would offer little security; however, after encrypting each letter, the rotors advance positions, changing the substitution. By this means, a rotor machine produces a complex <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher,</b> which changes with every keypress.|$|E
50|$|As a concept, polygraphic {{substitution}} {{contrasts with}} monoalphabetic (or simple) substitutions in which individual letters are uniformly substituted, or polyalphabetic substitutions in which individual letters are substituted {{in different ways}} depending on {{their position in the}} text. In theory, there is some overlap in these definitions; one could conceivably consider a Vigenère cipher with an eight-letter key to be an octographic substitution. In practice, this is not a useful observation since it is far more fruitful to consider it to be a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b>|$|E
40|$|Pattern {{recognition}} {{approach is}} used in this research {{as an alternative to}} univariate and rule-based systems for recovering source text encrypted in monoalphabetic and <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers.</b> The approach uses a multivariate statistical technique called discriminant analysis to classify encrypted characters as source text symbols. It requires the generation of invariant measurement vectors for all groups of characters from the source and the encrypted text to classify and to identify characters. The measurement vectors consist of the values of variables generated from one-graph and digraph structures of the text.;The research suggests that quadratic discriminant analysis, which requires more time and space in the process of computation is not better than linear discriminant analysis. Furthermore, the stepwise linear discriminant procedure is useful in selecting variables in the measurement vector and in reducing the number of redundant variables. The use of digraph structures of text improves the total and individual percentages of correctness for the groups of characters in comparison to the use only of one-graph structures. They also improve the results of recovering the plain or source text.;The research suggests that the use of trigraph structures will further improve the percentages of correctness and should be taken into consideration for continuing this research...|$|R
50|$|Because both ciphers classically {{employed}} novels as part {{of their}} key material, many sources confuse the book cipher and the running key cipher. They are really only very distantly related. The running key <b>cipher</b> is a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution,</b> the book <b>cipher</b> is a homophonic substitution. Perhaps the distinction is most clearly made by the fact that a running cipher would work best of all with a book of random numbers, whereas such a book (containing no text) would be useless for a book cipher.|$|R

50|$|The {{previous}} examples {{were all}} examples of monoalphabetic substitution ciphers, where just one cipher alphabet is used. It {{is also possible}} to have a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher,</b> where multiple cipher alphabets are used. The encoder would just make up two or more cipher alphabets using whatever techniques he or she chooses, and then encode their message, alternating what cipher alphabet is used with every letter or word. This makes the message much harder to decode because the codebreaker would have to figure out both cipher alphabets.|$|E
50|$|To avoid merely {{implementing}} a simple (and easily breakable) substitution cipher, every key press caused {{one or more}} rotors to step by one twenty-sixth of a full rotation, before the electrical connections were made. This changed the substitution alphabet used for encryption, ensuring that the cryptographic substitution was different at each new rotor position, producing a more formidable <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b> The stepping mechanism varied slightly from model to model. The right-hand rotor stepped once with each keystroke, and other rotors stepped less frequently.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is clear}} from Yardley's {{description}} that Hyakutake's new system was not very effective. The system used 10 charts, each with 26 rows and columns labeled from [...] to [...] This gives 626 two-letter code groups. Most words and phrases {{will not be in}} the code and must be spelled out in kana. In this respect it is similar to, but larger than, the first Japanese code that Yardley broke in 1919. The difference is that this time however there were ten codes instead of just one.Basically, Hyakutake created a poly-code system where the code changes every few words. This is just a code version of a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b> Polyalphabetic ciphers use several different enciphering alphabets and change between them at some interval, usually after every letter. The strength of a polyalphabetic cipher comes from how many alphabets it uses to encipher, how often it switches between them, and how it switches between them (at random or following some pattern for example). The Vigenere is probably the most famous example of a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b> The famous cipher machines of World War II encipher in a polyalphabetic system. Their strength came from the enormous number of well-mixed alphabets that they used and the fairly random way of switching between them.|$|E
40|$|As {{synthetic}} biology advances, labeling of genes or organisms, like other high-value products, will become {{important not only}} to pinpoint their identity, origin, or spread, but also for intellectual property, classification, bio-security or legal reasons. Ideally information should be inseparably interlaced into expressed genes. We describe a method for embedding messages within open reading frames of synthetic genes by adapting steganographic algorithms typically used for watermarking digital media files. Text messages are first translated into a binary string, and then represented in the reading frame by synonymous codon choice. To aim for good expression of the labeled gene in its host as well as retain {{a high degree of}} codon assignment flexibility for gene optimization, codon usage tables of the target organism are taken into account. Preferably amino acids with 4 or 6 synonymous codons are used to comprise binary digits. Several different messages were embedded into open reading frames of T 7 RNA polymerase, GFP, human EMG 1 and HIV gag, variously optimized for bacterial, yeast, mammalian or plant expression, without affecting their protein expression or function. We also introduced Vigenère <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> to <b>cipher</b> text messages, and developed an identifier as a key to deciphering codon usage ranking stored for a specific organism within a sequence of 35 nucleotides...|$|R

50|$|The cipher was trivial to break, and Alberti's machine {{implementation}} {{not much}} more difficult. Key progression in both cases was poorly concealed from attackers. Even Alberti's implementation of his polyalphabetic cipher was rather easy to break (the capitalized letter is a major clue to the cryptanalyst). For most of the next several hundred years, the significance of using multiple substitution alphabets was missed by almost everyone. <b>Polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> designers seem to have concentrated on obscuring {{the choice of a}} few such alphabets (repeating as needed), not on the increased security possible by using many and never repeating any.|$|E
50|$|In Europe {{during the}} 15th and 16th centuries, {{the idea of}} a <b>polyalphabetic</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> was developed, among others by the French diplomat Blaise de Vigenère (1523-96). For some three centuries, the Vigenère cipher, which uses a repeating key to select {{different}} encryption alphabets in rotation, was considered to be completely secure (le chiffre indéchiffrable—"the indecipherable cipher"). Nevertheless, Charles Babbage (1791-1871) and later, independently, Friedrich Kasiski (1805-81) succeeded in breaking this cipher. During World War I, inventors in several countries developed rotor cipher machines such as Arthur Scherbius' Enigma, in an attempt to minimise the repetition that had been exploited to break the Vigenère system.|$|E

It was broken by the US Army Signal Intelligence Service and disseminated as MAGIC. Detailed reports by the Japanese ambassador to Germany were encrypted on the Purple machine. His reports included reviews of Germany assessments of the military situation, of strategy and intentions, reports on direct inspections (in one case, of Normandy beach defences) by the ambassador and reports of long interviews with Hitler.|$|E
