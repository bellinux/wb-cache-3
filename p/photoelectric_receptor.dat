40|$|An {{intellectual}} sensor module of soil light-color control {{designed for}} an accurate agriculture technology which comprises functions of self-diagnostics, self-corrections and self-attestation. Circuit diagrams sensor module components {{have been developed}} {{on the basis of}} a micro-controller, a photo-diode driver, an interface integrated circuit and a receiving block of optical pulses. An algorithm and an operational program of a microcontroller have been devised for executing control over light pulses, processing of  <b>photoelectric</b> <b>receptor</b> signals, data receive-transmit operations, correction of sensitive elements, diagnostics of system failure and attestation of control results...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} a method and {{an instrument for}} measuring amplitudes and  periods of physical pendulum oscillations with rolling-contact bearing in the regime of micro-swings when the oscillation amplitude is significantly less of an elastic contact angle. It has been established that the main factors limiting a measuring accuracy are noises of the measuring circuit, base vibration and analog-digital conversion. A new measuring methodology based on original algorithms of data processing and application of the well-known methods for statistic processing of a measuring signal is  proposed in the paper. The paper contains error estimations for measuring oscillation amplitudes justified by discreteness of a signal conversion in a <b>photoelectric</b> <b>receptor</b> and also by the influence of measuring circuit noise. The paper reveals that the applied methodologies {{make it possible to}} ensure measuring of amplitudes with an error of 0. 2 second of arc and measuring of a period with an error of 10 – 4 s. The original measuring instrument including mechanical and optical devices and also an electric circuit of optical-to-electrical measuring signal conversion is described in the paper.   </p...|$|E
