40|$|Background: Casein kinase 1 delta (CK 1 d) phosphorylates many key {{proteins}} playing {{important roles}} in such biological processes as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, circadian rhythm and vesicle transport. Furthermore, deregulation of CK 1 d {{has been linked to}} neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In this study, the cell specific distribution of CK 1 d in various tissues and organs of young adult BALB/c mice was analysed by immunohistochemistry. Methodology/Principal Findings: Immunohistochemical staining of CK 1 d was performed using three different antibodies against CK 1 d. A high expression of CK 1 d was found in a variety of tissues and organ systems and in several cell types of endodermal, mesodermal and ectodermal origin. Conclusions: These results give an overview of the cell-type specific expression of CK 1 d in different organs under normal conditions. Thus, they provide evidence for possible cell-type specific functions of CK 1 d, where CK 1 d can interact with and modulate the activity of key regulator proteins by site directed phosphorylation.

40|$|Abstract: Illegally paid blood {{donation}} {{was a risk}} factor for HIV acquisition exclusively in Henan and Hubei Provinces of China, and not in Shanghai. Nucleotide sequences in the gag and env genes of HIV- 1 were compared between isolates from Henan and Shanghai regions of China to test whether an expected higher degree of a common source of infections from this unique {{blood donation}} transmission risk would be evident as decreased variation among Henan isolates in an exploratory cross-sectional analysis. Among 38 isolates studied, 23 of 23 (100 %) from Henan and 8 of 15 (54 %) from Shanghai were subtype B. In addition, fewer sequence differences were found in gp 41 of subtype B isolates from Henan than from Shanghai isolates. Further studies with additional controls are therefore warranted to confirm the role of the degree of a common source of infections in differences in HIV variation across populations.

40|$|To cause food-borne botulism, botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) in the {{gastrointestinal}} lumen must {{traverse the}} intestinal epithelial barrier. However, the {{mechanism by which}} BoNT crosses the intestinal epithelial barrier remains unclear. BoNTs are produced along {{with one or more}} non-toxic components, with which they form progenitor toxin complexes (PTCs). Here we show that serotype A 1 L-PTC, which has high oral toxicity and makes the predominant contribution to causing illness, breaches the intestinal epithelial barrier from microfold (M) cells via an interaction between haemagglutinin (HA), one of the non-toxic components, and glycoprotein 2 (GP 2). HA strongly binds to GP 2 expressed on M cells, which do not have thick mucus layers. Susceptibility to orally administered L-PTC is dramatically reduced in M-cell-depleted mice and GP 2 -deficient (Gp 2 /) mice. Our finding <b>provides</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>fo...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on Formal/Informal Institutions for Citizen Engagement for the Post- 2015 Development Agenda aims {{to examine}} {{potential}} contributions and challenges posed by informal systems to formal institutions {{in the context of}} citizen engagement for development management. It also intends to provide advice on ways to achieve greater coherence between formal and informal citizen engagement in development management. The ongoing post- 2015 discussion among development stakeholders can benefit from information, better insight and proposals on improving service delivery through engaging non-State actors and addressing challenges while leveraging opportunities of the informality context. The services of a consultant will be required to write an analytical background paper on the EGM topic: Formal/Informal Institutions for Citizen Engagement for the Post- 2015 Development Agenda; participate as a resource person in substantive sessions of the EGM and prepare a consolidated thematic report that will document the preparation, proceedings, discussions and conclusions of the EGM.

40|$|Economists {{interpret}} "institutions " in {{at least}} two ways. Institutions can be the "rules of the game " (which provide the context-such as markets-in which actors make decisions), or they can be organizations (typically, systems of nonmarket relations). What is the role of public policy in influencing the rules of the game, and what is its role in public sector economic organizations? Informal conventions and informal rules of the game make institutions function differently than their formal structure might lead us to expect. Governments can intervene and influence the rules of the game, but their interventions should be based on an adequate perception of existing formal and informal arrangements and on processes of adaptation that were under way before intervention was initiated. The literature does not adequately explore the normative arguments for public economic organizations, nor has there been enough rigorous analysis of the causes of public sector failure. Many institutions are dysfunctional in terms of development, however, not because they are inefficient but because their intended purposes conflict with the requirements of economic growth. Diagnosing the causes of good or bad performance by public organizations could <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>fo...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{requirements}} specification defines {{the requirements for}} the future system at a conceptual level (i. e. class or type level). In contrast, a scenario represents a concrete example of current or future system usage. In early RE phases, scenarios are used to support the definition of high level requirements (goals) to be achieved by the new system. In many cases, those goals can {{to a large degree}} be elicited by observing, documenting and analysing scenarios about current system usage, i. e. the new system must often fulfil many of the functional and non-functional goals of the existing system. To support the elicitation and validation of the goals achieved by the existing system and to illustrate problems of the old system we propose to capture current system usage using rich media (e. g. video, speech, pictures etc.) and to interrelate those observations with the goal definitions. Thus, we particularly aim at making the abstraction process which leads to the definition of the conceptual models more transparent and traceable. More precisely, we relate the parts of the observations which have caused the definition of a goal or against which a goal was validated with the corresponding goal. These interrelations <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>fo...</b>|$|E
40|$|Conversion of {{tropical}} forests reduces biodiversity and releases stored carbon. Although a part {{of tropical}} deforestation resulting from slash-and-burn is linked to poverty of people living at the forest margins, the conditions necessary for increased productivity of agroforestry and other land use systems to reduce poverty and reduce deforestation are not well understood. The key hypothesis underlying Phase II of the ASB research project in Indonesia can be summarized as: Intensifying land use {{as an alternative to}} slash-and-burn simultaneously can reduce deforestation and reduce poverty. This research problem was identified at the conclusion of Phase I of the project and has remained the focus of research through Phase II. The research programme in Phase II was designed to better understand how the Government of Indonesia and donor agencies could balance global environmental objectives with economic development and poverty reduction. While conversion of primary forest has the major effect on biodiversity and carbon stocks, the resulting land uses also matter a great deal for the supply of these global public goods.

40|$|The {{objective}} of simulation modeling is to {{gain insight into}} the dynamics of complex systems. Simulation models of complex systems consist of numerous input variable, linked together by logical relationships. The process of determining the set of input variable values that produce the optima output has often posed the greatest challenge during simulation studies. In recent years, the ability to integrate optimization technology into simulation models has significantly improved this process. To effectively utilize optimization technology, however, modelers must define optimization variables. In this paper, an approach is developed that <b>provides</b> information concerning <b>the</b> interrelationship between input variables used in a simulation model.

This static index is an inadequate measure of resource availability, one which could cause severe misjudg-ments concerning resource supplies. Long-term re-source planning requires a better understanding than that afforded by the static reserve life index.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{presented}} in this thesis was to explore and understand the mechanisms governing toughness, ductility and ballistic performance {{in a class of}} nanostructured carbide-free bainite-austenite steels, sometimes known as ‘superbainite’. The mechanical properties of these alloys have been extensively reported, but their interpretation is not clear. The thesis begins with an intro-duction to both the relevant nanostructures and some of the difficulties involved in explaining observed properties, alongside a summary of the role of mixed-microstructures in alloy development. An overview of the debate regarding the mechanism of bainite formation is pre-sented in Chapter 2, {{in the form of a}} literature survey encompassing the period of explicit recognition of the bainite microstructure. Of note is the role played by the displacive theory of formation in the development of the alloy structures investigated in this thesis.
