Water {{resources}} in South Africa are scarce, and {{should therefore be}} protected against pollutants, also from persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This is emphasised by the Stockholm Convention on POPs, which aims at reducing and ultimately eliminating POPs. South Africa signed and ratified the treaty, and it became international law on 17 May 2004. POPS are highly stable, toxic, hydrophobic and lipophilic compounds, {{with the ability to}} accumulate in biological tissues. Previous research had shown that dioxin-like POPS are present in the aquatic environments of South Africa, with the highest concentrations of these substances measured in industrialised areas of South Africa. The present study aimed at investigating the extent of polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxin (PCDD), <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo-furan</b> (PCDF) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) pollution in the Vaal Triangle, by targeting aquatic sediments and biota. Sediment samples were collected from the Blesbok Spruit, Taaibos Spruit, Leeu Spruit and Suikerbosrand River, and fish tissue samples were collected from Blesbok Spruit and Suikerbosrand River, to determine bio-accumulation. The samples were extracted with organic solvents, cleaned-up and fractionated. Raw extracts and fractions were analysed with the H 4 IIE-luc reporter gene bio-assay. This bio-assay is a rapid, sensitive and relatively cost-effective method, which measures the effects of dioxin-like compounds on rat hepatoma cells, transfected with firefly luciferase gene. Selected samples were analysed with gas chromatographylmass spectrometry (GCIMS) to confirm results. Only one site had quantifiable amounts of dioxin-like substances in the sediment, measured to be 52. 35 ng/kg [Effective Concentration 50 (EC 50) ]. This value exceeds many of the European and USA quality guidelines, proposed for sediments. No dioxin-like substances were found in fish tissues. The absence of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in aquatic sediments and fish tissues from the Vaal Triangle area might be due to the climatic conditions of the area, dilution effects in streams, and degradation of these compounds by UV-radiation and microbial organisms.

40|$|There are {{concerns}} that postnatal exposure to organochlorines present in breast milk {{could lead to}} adverse health effects. We reconstituted four mixtures of aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists (3 non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], 6 poly-chlorinated dibenzodioxins [PCDDs], 7 <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo-furans</b> [PCDFs], or all 16 chemicals together [referred to as AhRM]) based on their concentrations in breast milk, and exam-ined their effects following exposure by gavage from day 1 until day 20 of age. Female neonates received dosages of AhRM equiv-alent to 1, 10, 100, or 1000 times the amount consumed by an infant over the first 24 days of life. Other groups received the PCBs, the PCDDs, or the PCDFs at the 1000 level. All rats were sacrificed at 21 days of age. Changes in ethoxyresorufin-o-deeth-ylase hepatic activity, thymus and body weights, and serum thy-roxin were linked to the 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxi...|$|R
40|$|MSWI fly ash is {{susceptible}} to contain high amount of polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins and <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo-furans.</b> However, the use of MSWI residue for road construction started in France at a period when MSWI Bottom Ash and MSWI fly ash were not separated. From four old road sites, MSWI residue, road soils, reference soils and geo-textiles were sampled and their PCDD/F contents were analyzed. MSWI residue show a great heterogeneity but also high amounts of PCDD/F (142960 ng ITEQ kg- 1 dm). Soils underlying the road show less heterogeneity and PCDD/F contents between 0. 57 and 7. 23 ng I-TEQ kg- 1 dm, lower than ordinary soils. Moreover, the specific analysis of the 17 toxic PCDD/F congeners (notably the 2, 3, 7, 8 -TetraCDD) indicates the very low harmfulness of road soils. The study also allows to assert {{the relation between the}} MSWI residue particle size and the PCDD/F content...|$|R
40|$|The Istituto Zooprofilattico dell’Abruzzo e Molise ‘G. Caporale’ (IZS A&M) {{has been}} {{monitoring}} contamination of food by the polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD) and <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo-furans</b> (PCDF) {{as part of}} the National Surveillance Plan (NSP) in Italy since 1999, on license from the Italian Ministry of Health. Between 1999 and 2000, 238 samples (including meat, fish, eggs, milk, fat, feedstuffs) were analysed. The results of the tests were expressed in terms of international toxic equivalents (I-TEQs from NATO/CCMS, 1988) and World Health Organization toxic equivalents (WHO-TEQs). These results showed contamination levels comparable to those detected in similar studies conducted in other European countries for products such as milk (mean: 0. 81 pg I-TEQ/g fat), meat (mean: 0. 73 pg I-TEQ/g fat) and fat (mean: 0. 51 pg I-TEQ/g fat). The highest dioxin content was found in fish (mean: 5. 28 pg I-TEQ/g fat) and fish feeds (mean 6. 60 pg ITEQ/ g fat). These two matrices also showed complete duplication of contamination profiles. Other edible matrices (milk, meat, eggs) revealed the presence of HpCDD and OCDD. This could be due to the introduction into Italy of the animal feed additive choline chloride contaminated by these congenerse...|$|R
40|$|This review {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the significance of the use of molecular biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic tools for marine pollution monitoring. In order {{to assess the impact of}} highly persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polychlorinated dibenzo–dioxins (PCDD), <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo–furans</b> (PCDF), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), tributyltin (TBT) and other toxic metals on the marine ecosystem a suite of biomarkers are being extensively used worldwide. Among the various types of biomarkers, like cytochrome P 4501 A induction, DNA integrity, and acetylcholinesterase activity, metallothionein induction re{{presents an}} excellent biomarker. MTs are induced by toxic metals such as Cd, Hg, and Cu by chelation through cysteine residues and are used in both vertebrates and invertebrates as a biomarker of metal exposure. Sea bream is sentinel fish of its native sandy costal habitat as it is widely distributed throughout the entire Mediterranean Sea. Many studies, which results are further shown in this paper, has proposed metallothionein as a biomarker of heavy metal exposure in Sparus aurata. Recently MT expression profiles have been used as perfect diagnostic instruments to determine the physiological impact of aquaculture systems in S. aurata. All these knowledge could be very helpful to improve fish productivity and the aquaculture production system qualit...|$|R
40|$|The term dioxins usually {{refers to}} polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDDs) and <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo-furans</b> (PCDFs). As 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) {{has the highest}} toxic potential, the toxic {{potentials}} of other PCDDs and PCDFs are defi ned in comparison with it. Human exposure to dioxins can be environmental (background), occupational, or accidental pollution. In the human body, dioxins are in part metabolised and eliminated, {{and the rest is}} stored in body fat. People vary in their capacity to eliminate TCDD, but it is also dose-dependent; the elimination rate is much faster at higher than lower levels. The liver microsomal P 4501 A 1 enzyme oxygenates lipophilic chemicals such as dioxins. It is encoded by the CYP 1 A 1 gene. Cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediates their carcinogenic action. It binds to dioxin, translocates to nucleus and together with hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT) and xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) increases the expression of CYP 1 A 1. Dioxins are classifi ed as known human carcinogens, but they also cause noncancerous effects like atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. Long-term exposures to dioxins cause disruption of the nervous, immune, reproductive, and endocrine system. Short-term exposure to high levels impairs the liver function and causes chloracne. The most sensitive population to dioxin exposure are the foetuses and infants. A large number of health effects have been documented in the scientifi c literature, and they all place dioxins among the most toxic chemicals known to man.

40|$|Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo-furans</b> (PCDFs) {{belong to}} the most toxic {{compounds}} known to science and they are defined as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) under the Stock-holm Convention. The general human exposure to PCDD/Fs is primarily through dietary intake. The importance of contaminated sites as secondary PCDD/F sources (i. e. sources that once received its contamination from a primary source) are getting increased attention. To be able to assess the risks for human exposure at PCDD/F contaminated sites, the environmen-tal distribution of PCDD/Fs and the potential mobilization between dif-ferent environmental media (e. g. food chain transfer) must be known. The primary aim of the work presented in this thesis was to investigate human exposure pathways associated with PCDD/F contaminated sites by combining field measurements and modeling. Site specific field measurements were made at a PCDD/F contaminated site in Sweden and multimedia modeling scenarios were evaluated against site specific data and national reference data. The {{results show that the}} congener distributions in exposure media affected by contaminated soil may differ significantly from the distribu-tions found in media from reference locations. Higher chlorinated PCDD/Fs may be transferred into food chains where they contribute to a large fraction of the toxic equivalent concentration (TEQ). Ingestion of locally produced animal food may be an important exposure pathway al-ready at low or moderate PCDD/F soil concentrations. However, the con-gener composition of the source is critical for the exposure. The signifi-cance of the individual exposure routes varies depending on e. g. the spatial distribution and magnitude of the soil contamination, the pro-perties of the exposure media and the human behavior. Multimedia mo-deling can be used in risk assessments as long as model algorithms and model parameters are representative for the superhydrophobic properties of PCDD/Fs. However, selection of physical-chemical PCDD/F properties is a challenge due to large variation in reported values. For some proper-ties, data is scattered or completely lackin...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Increased {{concentrations}} of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>dibenzo-furans</b> (PCDFs) in pooled blood samples from workers at municipal waste incinerators have been reported. This study was undertaken to confirm these results in individual blood samples from potentially exposed and unexposed workers at municipal waste incinerators compared with matched unexposed controls and compared with {{concentrations in the}} slag and fly ash from the municipal waste incinerators. METHODS [...] Concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs were determined {{in the blood of}} 10 workers from an old municipal waste incinerator without adequate pollution controls, 11 workers from a newer incinerator with modern pollution controls, and 25 controls from the general population group matched for age (+/- 10 years), sex, and race, and in the slag and fly ash from the older incinerator. RESULTS [...] Significant increases of certain PCDDs and PCDFs were found in the blood of the workers from the older incinerator compared with the controls as follows: octaCDD (1051 (438) v 637 (344), P < 0. 001), hexaCDF (52. 3 (28. 7) v 30. 2 (18. 2), P < 0. 01), heptaCDF (43. 9 (30. 4) v 22. 7 (12. 4), P < 0. 001), total PCDDs (1262 (484) v 825 (454), P < 0. 001), total PCDFs (133. 0 (68. 1) v 93. 7 (36. 7), P < 0. 05), and total PCDD/Fs (1395 (537) v 918 (437), P < 0. 001). The workers from the older incinerator with the greatest exposure were found to have the most significant increases of the blood PCDDs and PCDFs, and the pattern of increased PCDD and PCDF congeners in the blood corresponded to the pattern in the incinerator slag and ash. No {{significant differences were found between}} the blood {{concentrations of}} the workers at the newer incinerator and the controls. CONCLUSION [...] Occupational exposure to slag and fly ash from municipal waste incinerators may increase the blood concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs. Modern pollution control technology in new incinerators may be able to minimise potential exposure to slag and fly ash and thus the absorption of PCDDs and PCDFs from this source...|$|R
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{have been}} determined in 30 samples, including soil, biota and plant collected from an electronic waste recycling site and its vicinage towns. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), <b>polychlorinated</b> dibenzo-p-dioxins and <b>dibenzo-furans</b> (PCDD/Fs) were also simultaneously analyzed in 20 samples. PBDEs were detected in all soil samples {{and the highest}} was up to 789 ng/g dry weight (dw). The toxic equivalency (TEQ) of PCBs and PCDD/Fs detected in E-waste recycling site is significant higher {{than those in the}} vicinage samples. Biota and plant were also contaminated with high level of PBDEs, PCBs and PCDD/Fs in this area. High levels of the three kinds of organic compounds in the environmental samples showed that the E-waste recycling have induced serious environmental problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{method was}} developed for quantitative analysis of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and <b>polychlorinated</b> dibenzo-p-dioxins and <b>dibenzo-furans</b> (PCDD/Fs) in one single extract of environmental samples. The sample preparation procedure included two fractionation steps using silver nitrate silica chromatography to separate PBDEs from PCBs and PCDD/Fs and florisil column to separate PCBs from PCDD/Fs. Acidic silica, acidic alumina and gel permeation chromatography (GPC, for PCBs) or activated carbon column (for PCDD/Fs) were used for further clean-up. The sample extracts were analyzed by using high-resolution gas chromatography/highresolution mass spectrometry. The entire method was validated from the analysis of mixed standards of PBDEs, PCBs and PCDD/Fs (n = 3); the analysis of certified reference biota (WMF- 01). The method was applied {{for the analysis of}} 10 sediment samples collected from Haihe River and Dagu Drainage River in Tianjin City. No significant PBDEs pollution was found in the areas.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{procedure was}} {{established for the}} fractionation of solvent-extracted environmental samples into three fractions containing polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and <b>polychlorinated</b> dibenzo-p-dioxins and <b>dibenzo-furans</b> (PCDD/Fs), respectively. The procedure includes multi-layer silica gel chromatography to separate PBDEs from PCBs and PCDD/Fs, and subsequent separation of PCBs from PCDD/Fs using a florisil column. The numbers of congeners involved were 16, 19, and 17, for PBDEs, PCBs, and PCDD/Fs, respectively. The separation of the three chemical groups overcomes the potential mutual interferences, which are difficult to avoid even {{by the use of}} high resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS). In addition, this procedure efficiently eliminates most interfering substances from sample matrices for the subsequent instrumental analyses. The method was validated using mixed chemical standards, and applied for the analysis of environmental samples including sediment, sewage sludge and fish tissue. All the recoveries are within the acceptable ranges specified in the USEPA standard methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Gegenstand der Untersuchungen waren zwei Klassen von Umweltchemikalien: Polychlorierte Dibenzodioxine und -furane (PCDD/F) und polycyclische aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (PAH) als Vertreter organischer Umweltschadstoffe sowie ausgewaehlte Schwermetalle als Repraesentanten anorganischer Kontaminanten. Ziel des Forschungsauftrages war eine Bestandsaufnahme, in welchem Masse die {{genannten}} Schadstoffe das Untersuchungsgebiet belasten und wie sie sich auf die einzelnen Probemedien 'bulk'-Deposition, Boeden und Nutzpflanzen, verteilen. Ausgehend von Emissionsuntersuchungen wurden Studien zur Immission bzw. zum Transportverhalten der Schadstoffe durchgefuehrt. Das vorliegende Foerderprojekt ist auf auf drei thematische Schwerpunkte fixiert: 1. Rauchgasemissionen organischer Komponenten aus braunkohlegefeuerten Hausbrandfeuerstaetten 2. organische Schadstoffimmissionen in dichtbesiedelten Stadtregionen 3. Transfer ausgewaehlter anorganischer Stoffe in Wild- und Nutzpflanzen in Abhaengigkeit von den Eintragspfaden Luft - Pflanze und Boden - Pflanze sowie ihren bioverfuegbaren Anteilen im Boden. (orig. /SR) The {{research project}} ''Incidence {{and distribution of}} toxicity-relevant organic components and heavy metals in selected areas of investigation'' {{is a continuation of}} the project ''Incidence and transfer of dioxins and heavy metals in the areas of Merseburg, Luetzen, Naumburg and Zeitz'', which was finalized in November 1994. Its object - not explicitly mentioned in the title - were two classes of environmental chemicals: <b>polychlorinated</b> dibenzo-dioxins and <b>dibenzo-furans</b> (PCDDs/PCDFs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as representatives of organic environmental pollutants, as well as selected heavy metals as representatives of inorganic contaminants. All of these compounds stand out by their high ecotoxicological relevance, even if they have rather different effects. The project aimed to make an inventory of the extent of pollution with the compounds mentioned in the area of investigation, and to show how they distribute to the following individual sampling media: bulk deposition, soil, and crop plants. Starting from investigations on emission, nuisances, respectively the transport behaviour of pollutants, were studied. - As it was realized that there is need for further research regarding the incidence, distribution and transfer behaviour of organic and inorganic toxic components, this research project was drawn up. It has three points of emphasis: 1. Emission of organic components in flue gas from housefold furnaces fired with brown coal; 2. Nuisances from organic pollutants in densely populated urban areas; 3. Transfer of selected inorganic compounds in wild plants and crop plants {{as a function of the}} deposition pathways air - plant and soil - plant, and as a function of their biologically available proportion in soil.
