5|$|However, <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> P by a chip {{is given}} by the {{equation}} P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle (proportional {{to the number of}} transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{the use of}} low latency {{deterministic}} network (LLDN) in the IEEE 802.15. 4 e standard [21] for realizing a cooperator-assisted WBAN [22], where we show two superframe designs using a TDMA and a hybrid-TDMA/CSMA. Furthermore, these two designs introduce different <b>power</b> <b>consumptions,</b> so using the values of <b>power</b> <b>consumptions</b> for a typical transceiver module, we compare the <b>power</b> <b>consumptions</b> between them.|$|R

Based on this information, an active node creates a communication path with the neighboring active nodes. As a result, the total distance to the BS {{as well as the}} <b>power</b> <b>consumptions</b> is minimized as compared to existing tree-based routing protocols since <b>power</b> <b>consumptions</b> are proportional to the distance of transmission path.|$|R
5|$|Krypton {{is mixed}} with argon in energy {{efficient}} fluorescent lamps, reducing the <b>power</b> <b>consumption,</b> but also reducing the light output and raising the cost. Krypton costs about 100 {{times as much as}} argon. Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures. A brighter light results with more blue color than conventional incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|Moore's {{law is the}} {{empirical}} observation {{that the number of}} transistors in a microprocessor doubles every 18 to 24months. Despite <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> issues, and repeated predictions of its end, Moore's law is still in effect. With the end of frequency scaling, these additional transistors (which are no longer used for frequency scaling) can be used to add extra hardware for parallel computing.|$|E
5|$|The USB 3.0 {{specification}} {{was published}} on 12 November 2008. Its main goals were {{to increase the}} data transfer rate (up to 5Gbit/s), decrease <b>power</b> <b>consumption,</b> increase power output, and be backward compatible with USB 2.0. USB 3.0 includes a new, higher speed bus called SuperSpeed in parallel with the USB 2.0 bus. For this reason, the new version is also called SuperSpeed. The first USB 3.0 equipped devices were presented in January 2010.|$|E

5|$|Two {{versions}} of the Manchester Mark 1 were produced, the first of which, the Intermediary Version, was operational by April 1949. The Final Specification machine, which was fully working by October 1949, contained 4,050 valves and had a <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> of 25kilowatts. Perhaps the Manchester Mark 1's most significant innovation was its incorporation of index registers, commonplace on modern computers.|$|E

40|$|Herein, we {{prove that}} {{self-heating}} effects occur in sensor films made of randomly oriented nanoparticles (electro-sprayed, drop-casted and paint-brushed films of carbon nanofibers). A 2 -point calibration method, reliable enough {{to overcome the}} lack of reproducibility of low cost fabrication methods, is also proposed. Self-heating operation makes possible reaching temperatures up to 250 °C with <b>power</b> <b>consumptions</b> {{in the range of}} tens of mW. For certain low-temperature applications (< 100 °C) typical <b>power</b> <b>consumptions</b> are as low as tens of μW. The method is suitable to modulate the response towards gases, such as humidity, NH 3 or NO 2. This approach overcomes the complex fabrication requirements of previous self-heating investigations and opens the door to use this effect in cost-effective devices...|$|R
