His early interests included <b>pigeon</b> <b>rearing</b> and art. In 1994, he fled rebelliously to Philadelphia and {{became involved in the}} local punk squatting scene.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pigeon</b> <b>rearing</b> was an {{integral}} part of the agricultural regime that dominated the Negev region in Israel throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods. Dozens of structures have been documented that relate to the raising of pigeons and the exploitation of their dung as a fertilizer as is attested in the literary sources (Pliny, Columella and Varro). Excavation of a dovecote near Shivta produced large quantities of pigeon dung and sediments. The material recovered was processed for floral remains (both macro and micro) and archaeozoological remains. We present a holistic look at pigeon diet and local environmental conditions in the Byzantine Negev through the archaeobotanical remains. Demographic and morphometric analysis of size and shape of the pigeon bones refine our understanding of pigeon species that were bred in antiquity as well as inform on their life-histories. This integrated examination from an agro-archaeological perspective illustrates the complexity of desert agriculture. 10 page(s...|$|E

5000|$|The Vienna long-faced-tumbler {{is one of}} {{numerous}} breeds of tumbler <b>pigeons,</b> <b>reared</b> and exhibited {{for their ability to}} spin and tumble down suddenly whilst in flight. Originating in Austria, in and around Vienna, it is an old breed that was known there in the 17th century. It was introduced by the Turks and was crossed with the Barb. It was exhibited in Hamburg in 1867. Dürien (1886) described nine color varieties. In Germany this breed is considered a [...] "medium-faced" [...] one, but in the United States it is considered [...] "long-faced". It mostly occurs in large cities within the United States, since it is usually brought to this country by immigrants.|$|R
40|$|The diurnal {{variations}} of several plasma hormones and {{free fatty acids}} (FFA) were studied during periods in summer and winter for <b>pigeons</b> <b>reared</b> either outdoors or indoors. The latter were subjected to constant temperature and naturally varying photoperiods. A significant seasonal variation in the mean daily levels of triiodothyronine (T 3), thyroxine (T 4), corticosterone (B), lutropin (LH) and FFA {{was seen in the}} outdoor birds and in the T 4 and B levels of indoor birds. The diurnal variation of hormone levels was generally more pronounced in winter in both groups. Cold ambient temperature significantly decreased the plasma LH level and potentiated the increasing effect of short photoperiod on plasma B level. Diurnal variation of plasma FFA level seems to be under the control of photoperiod, without any effects due to the ambient temperature. No significant correlation was found between FFA and GH concentrations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of pigeon homing {{are still not}} understood, in particular how they determine their position at unfamiliar locations. The "gravity vector" theory holds that pigeons memorize the gravity vector at their home loft and deduct home direction and distance from the angular difference between memorized and actual gravity vector. However, the gravity vector is tilted by different densities in the earth crust leading to gravity anomalies. We predicted that <b>pigeons</b> <b>reared</b> on different gravity anomalies would show different initial orientation and also show changes in their flight path when crossing a gravity anomaly. We reared one group of pigeons in a strong gravity anomaly with a north-to-south gravity gradient, and the other group of pigeons in a normal area but on a spot with a strong local anomaly with a west-to-east gravity gradient. After training over shorter distances, pigeons were released from a gravitationally and geomagnetically normal site 50 km north {{in the same direction}} for both home lofts. As expected by the theory, the two groups of pigeons showed divergent initial orientation. In addition, some of the GPS-tracked pigeons also showed changes in their flight paths when crossing gravity anomalies. We conclude that even small local gravity anomalies at the birth place of pigeons may have the potential to bias the map sense of pigeons, while reactivity to gravity gradients during flight was variable and appeared to depend on individual navigational strategies and frequency of position updates...|$|R
50|$|Such an {{experiment}} was conducted, where {{two groups of}} <b>pigeons</b> were <b>reared</b> in separate, although identical aviaries composed of bamboo. Group one had air blown from the south containing olive oil and air from the north containing synthetic turpentine. This was reversed for group two. The pigeons were then released east of the loft; half had a drop of synthetic turpentine added to the bill, while the others were given a drop of olive oil. Pigeons from group one exposed to olive oil flew north, contrary to birds sentient to synthetic turpentine, which flew south. Consistent, but reversed results were found in group two.|$|R

5000|$|Until the {{domestication}} of the chicken, {{eggs were}} available in limited quantities and were considered a delicacy, as in ancient Egypt. The most common birds - turtledoves and <b>pigeons</b> - were <b>reared</b> for their meat and not for their very small eggs. Biblical references to eggs are only in reference to gathering them from the wild (for example, [...] and [...] ). Eggs seem to have increased in use for food only {{with the introduction of}} chickens as food, and were commonly used as food by Roman times.|$|R
40|$|Depriving homing pigeons of {{olfactory}} {{information by}} spraying an 18 % zinc sulphate solution onto their olfactory ephithelium results in anosmia that persists {{for at least}} 5 days (tested using the ‘orienting response’). To study whether anosmic zinc-sulphate-treated pigeons (ZnSO 4 -pigeons) were able to compensate for their loss of olfactory information by using familiar landmarks, we made releases from two different distances (9 – 24 km, 54 – 70 km). The birds had homed once before from each release site. At shorter distances, ZnSO 4 -pigeons, sham-treated controls and untreated super controls were well oriented. At the longer distances, the anosmic pigeons and the sham-treated controls did not show any directional preference whereas the super controls were oriented towards home. In all cases, however, fewer anosmic pigeons homed successfully and their homing speed was slower {{than the speed of}} either control group. In order to determine whether experience during ontogeny affects the orientation behaviour, a group of young <b>pigeons</b> was <b>reared</b> anosmically by application of ZnSO 4 solution once a week. A second group of experimental pigeons was made anosmic just before the critical release. When released at unfamiliar sites located between 15 an...|$|R
6000|$|Change of habits {{appears to}} be often a result of imitation, of which Mr. Tegetmeier gives some good examples. He states that if <b>pigeons</b> are <b>reared</b> {{exclusively}} with small grain, as wheat or barley, they will starve before eating beans. But when they are thus starving, if a bean-eating pigeon is put among them, they follow its example, and thereafter adopt the habit. So fowls sometimes refuse to eat maize, but on seeing others eat it, they {{do the same and}} become excessively fond of it. Many persons have found that their yellow crocuses were eaten by sparrows, while the blue, purple, and white coloured varieties were left untouched; but Mr. Tegetmeier, who grows only these latter colours, found that after two years the sparrows began to attack them, and thereafter destroyed them quite as readily as the yellow ones; and he believes it was merely because some bolder sparrow than the rest set the example. On this subject Mr. Charles C. Abbott well remarks: [...] "In studying the habits of our American birds--and I suppose it is true of birds everywhere--it must at all times be remembered that there is less stability in the habits of birds than is usually supposed; and no account of the habits of any one species will exactly detail the various features of its habits as they really are, in every portion of the territory it inhabits."[27] ...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{scientists}} {{hypothesized that}} pigeons were using olfactory information {{as part of}} the process in finding their way back to the loft. In Italy, a study by N.E. Baldaccini, in which the bills of pigeons were applied with a strong odor, showed results that the pigeons had less accurate initial orientation. Baldaccini also performed an experiment in which he <b>reared</b> <b>pigeons</b> in a loft in which the wind was deflected by 45 degrees. Baldaccini's results showed that a deflection in the wind while the pigeons were young proved to have an effect on their initial orientation after being released. Keeton replicated this experiment but found that there was a smaller deflection than the results in Baldaccini's experiment in Italy. [...] Keeton speculated that there may be an effect on initial orientation based on an olfactory map, but the experiment was too general for proving that this was indeed what was occurring in this experiment.|$|R
40|$|The blood {{protozoa}} of {{two important}} domestic birds namely chickens (Gallus domesticus) and <b>pigeon</b> (Columba livia) <b>reared</b> in the hilly areas of Bangladesh were studied. A total of 400 birds (200 chicken and 200 pigeons) were examined of which 149 (37. 3 %) [95 % CI] birds were found infected {{by one or}} more haemoprotozoan parasites. Haemoprotozoa belonging to three genera were identified. Pigeon 80 (40 %) was recorded more susceptible to haemoprotozoa infection than chicken 69 (34. 5 %). 118 birds (29. 5 %) were found to be infected with single infection where as mixed infections were found in 31 birds (7. 8 %). The prevalence of blood protozoa in female birds (69. 5 %) was found significantly higher (p ≤ 0. 0001) [95 % CI] than male birds (5 %). Within the study period, the prevalence rate of Haemoprotozoa was 60. 6 % in summer season, 36. 7 % in rainy and 23 % winter seasons. This study has archived a high prevalence of haemoparasites, henceforth encourage further to determine the effect of contamination on the productivity and profitability of these birds, and evaluation of cost-benefit of various control strategies need to be undertaken...|$|R
