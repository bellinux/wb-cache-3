This song is a classic ode to the supremacy of the blackest of Metal. 'Where Splendid Corpses Are Towering Towards The Sun' ravishes straight through the high hopes of a self-proclaimed righteous people and their plastic vanity. And at the triumph of their death, scorched by the sun of their own divinity, in the serene mist from their ashen skulls, we dance.” ...|$|E

40|$|Following {{a record}} number of {{submissions}} to the North Carolina Sociological Society's call for papers for the Himes Awards, it became obvious that there was much quality work being done by future sociologists. Professor Lippard comments: As the special focus editor, I am <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>you</b> this volume on student writing. Traditionally, the North Carolina Sociological Association has emphasized and championed student research and writing as a pivotal part of the future of sociology. Much of this emphasis has focused on paper competitions through the Himes Paper Awards but at the 2012 NCSA meetings, members agreed to further this emphasis by setting aside a special issue of Sociation Today to showcase student writing. In this volume, you will find student authors who have a growing command of the skills necessary to be great researchers and writers. Several pieces present new spins on how to analyze traditional topics that include race, gender, sexuality, and gerontology. Many of these pieces were completed by undergraduate students and they came from a variety of institutions across the South. Overall, these students should be commended for their work and being fine examples of what 21 st century Sociology has to offer to the world. In addition, the introduction discusses acceptance rate for the journal and presentes a case-example of how our information spreads out from sociology to the mass media...|$|E
40|$|We {{are very}} <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>you</b> {{the book of}} {{proceedings}} of the SMC 2009 scientific program. We were able to put together this program thanks to the numerous contributions {{of the scientific community}} in response to our call for participation. The biggest thanks therefore goes to you, reading this book of proceedings. When we started to organise this year's conference we were not sure of the appeal that this conference would have for the research community. The Sound and Music Computing conference is a very young event that was born with a somewhat local perspective and that competes with a number of consolidated conferences. But the large number of submissions in all the different categories and the involvement of the research community in the peer review process of the submissions allowed us to organise a conference that we are proud of. We sincerely hope that these proceedings will be of interest for all of you. In organising the scientific program we had two objectives in mind: To push for a high quality technical program and promote the involvement of young researchers; The best recipe for quality requires first to get many submissions and then to organise a good peer review process of the submissions. This year we received 160 paper and poster submissions, the largest number to date. The review...|$|E
40|$|From {{the gallery}} {{information}} sheet: “One Paved Court and Terra-Arte are honoured to present UNSCRIPTED Bruce Mclean & Flora Mclean, their third exhibition together, and are <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>you</b> with {{a selection of}} finished work by this duet, sculptor and father Bruce and fashion designer and daughter Flora, set against drawings, sketchbooks, magazines, photos, catalogues and other pieces of studio work and materials that inform their practice. The show focuses on the dialogue between Bruce’s and Flora’s extraordinary creative minds; on the projects and objects {{that come out of}} their shared studio based in in West London, although each of them have a separate practice and work totally independently, thus offering a better understanding of their creative processes and tracing what goes into the process of making. … UNSCRIPTED provides a rare opportunity to experience the works and artistic vision of Bruce and Flora as they come from their studio and with the chance to understand a little bit about their shared lives. It encapsulates a lively and challenging relationship and work production between them while placing strong emphasis on the idea that contemporary conceptual works more often embrace interdisciplinary approaches than the historical Conceptual Art, that has in Bruce’s case, a predecessor in the 1960 s. … It is these connections and unsettling spirits of both Mcleans, Bruce and Flora, and the traces of a shared interest between their works beyond the boundaries of art disciplines that this exhibition wants to capture. UNSCRIPTED is curated by Dr Paula Terra Neale and is {{the first in a series}} of exhibitions under her own curatorial practice TERRA-ARTE, exploring the relationship between duets of artists working and living alongside each other, exploring both art and life’s aspects. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{session is}} devoted to the launch of an online {{knowledge}} database specific to GP / FM. This work {{is the result of a}} two years’ work of a cooperative project between participants from 12 countries and 8 languages. People are now used to the International classification of Primary Care (ICPC- 2) which addresses the clinical issues in GP/FM, ie Symptoms, Process and Diagnosis. We have work on non-clinical issues i. e. all themes addressed by GPs during congresses which concern organizational, ethical, structure, teaching or patient related issues not encompassed by ICPC- 2. The letter Q was used to name Q-Codes because this letter wasn’t yet used in ICPC- 2. Q-codes are a classification of non-clinical items in General Practice / Family Medicine (GP/FM). Q-codes are a classification of non-clinical items in General Practice / Family Medicine (GP/FM).

40|$|Writers {{are very}} much united in their love of stories; however, it is {{important}} to note that we are unique in temperament, influence, style, taste and attitude. We’d be lying if we told you that the process of producing Tide was all peaches and lavender. Tide is difficult. It is the clash of creative opinions, perspectives and goals—as diverse as we are as people. Despite the struggle, it was the culmination and transcendence of these aspects which gives rise to Tide: something unique in both the experience and the finished product. Tide is a foray into the scary world of organised creativity. It’s mighty hopeful to ask creative writers to take on the roles of editors, designers, fundraisers and production managers. We may have eaten far more Caramello Koalas than any human should consume, and did not receive the recommended eight hours of sleep per night, but we reached the finish line and are <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> the ninth edition of Tide. This year we have asked contributors to explore the theme of ‘endings’. The finality of such a topic is sometimes dark, sometimes nostalgic and often illuminating. It encompasses the cyclic nature of not only the writing process but also of life. While we may never re-friend each other on Facebook, we will always have our memories and, like us, you will always have Tide...|$|R
40|$|On {{behalf of}} the Mayor’s MMSD Audit Committee, we are <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> <b>present</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> the {{following}} Final Recommendations and Performance Review of MMSD. While running for Mayor of Milwaukee, you announced as part of The Barrett First 100 Days Action Plan that you would initiate an independent audit of MMSD. At your directive, the Committee has conducted all of its proceedings in public and has heard extensive testimony {{from a variety of}} outstanding individuals and organizations. The Committee {{would like to thank the}} many scientists, local public officials, environmentalists, fishing organizations, national wastewater treatment experts, and staff members from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Southeastern Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC) who appeared before the Committee. Their expertise, base of knowledge, commitment to clean water and unique perspectives were invaluable in producing this audit of MMSD’s practices and performance. This review has been conducted over the past three months with the assistance of nationally respected leaders in the wastewater industry including Dick Sandaas, a consultant with extensive history in the wastewater treatment industry, and Andy Lukas and staff from Brown and Caldwell. The Final Recommendations and Performance Review of MMSD contains new scientific information developed specifically for purposes of this audit. The review also consisted of document reviews as well as extensive discussions and testimony from MMSD executives and staff. United Water Services staff also provided input. Clean water is a regional challenge that will take a coordinated regional response. The Committee hopes that its audit will benefit MMSD, the 28 municipalities it serves, and all those dedicated to improving water quality and moving the region forward...|$|R
40|$|Creation of the Q-Codes online {{knowledge}} base The list of themes, called Q-Codes has been elaborated in a bottom-up approach, by retrieving, in a qualitative analysis study, the themes most frequently addressed by GPs {{when they meet}} in congresses. A taxonomy has been build. A multilingual terminological record has been developed {{for each of the}} 182 items identified. This work is freely available online on www. hetop. eu/Q (free access after inscription) and is supported by the Rouen (France) biomedical informatics department of the University of Rouen (France). All the data are available in the Web Ontology language (OWL- 2), an ontology-ready format fit for future use in the semantic web.
