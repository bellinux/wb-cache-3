Each cutoff minimax of EF superimposes and entangles conjugated fractions in microprocess, enclosing the captured entropy fractions as source of an <b>information</b> <b>unit.</b> The impulse step-up action launches the unit formation and step-down action finishes it and brings {{energy from the}} interactive jump. This finite jump transfers the entangled entropy from uncertain Yes-logic to the certain-information No-logic <b>information</b> <b>unit</b> whose measuring at end of the cut kills final entropy-uncertainty and limits unit. The Yes-No logic holds Bit Participator creating elementary information observer without physical pre-law. Cooperating two units in doublet and an opposite directional <b>information</b> <b>unit</b> in triplet forms minimal stable structure. <b>Information</b> <b>path</b> functional (IPF) integrates multiple hidden information contributions along the cutting process correlations in <b>information</b> <b>units</b> of cooperating doublets-triplets, bound by free information, and enfolds the sequence of enclosing triplet structures in the information network (IN) that sequentially decreases the entropy and maximizes information. The IN bound triplets release free information rising information forces enable attracting new <b>information</b> <b>unit</b> and ordering it. While IPF collects the <b>information</b> <b>units,</b> the IN performs logical computing using doublet-triplet code. The IN different levels unite logic of quantum micro- and macro- information processes, composing quantum and/or classical computation.

40|$|How does visual <b>path</b> <b>information</b> {{influence}} people's {{perception of}} their instantaneous direction of self-motion (heading) ? We have previously shown that humans can perceive heading without direct access to visual <b>path</b> <b>information.</b> Here we vary two key parameters for estimating heading from optic flow, {{the field of view}} (FOV) and the depth range of environmental points, to investigate the conditions under which visual <b>path</b> <b>information</b> influences human heading perception. The display simulated an observer traveling on a circular path. Observers used a joystick to rotate their line of sight until deemed aligned with true heading. Four FOV sizes (110 × 94 °, 48 × 41 °, 16 × 14 °, 8 × 7 °) and depth ranges (6 - 50 m, 6 - 25 m, 6 - 12. 5 m, 6 - 9 m) were tested. Consistent with our computational modeling results, heading bias increased with the reduction of FOV or depth range when the display provided a sequence of velocity fields but no direct <b>path</b> <b>information.</b> When the display provided <b>path</b> <b>information,</b> heading bias was not influenced as much by the reduction of FOV or depth range. We conclude that human heading and path perception involve separate visual processes. Path helps heading perception when the display does not contain enough optic-flow information for heading estimation during rotation. © ARVO. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|One's {{instantaneous}} {{direction of}} self-translation (heading) and one's future trajectory (path) are two defining features of human locomotion. Using a dynamic optic-flow display in which environmental points were periodically redrawn {{to minimize the}} <b>path</b> <b>information,</b> we have previously shown that humans can perceive heading without visual <b>path</b> <b>information</b> (Li, Sweet, & Stone, JOV 2006). Here we explore the use of visual <b>path</b> <b>information</b> in active heading control. The display (110 ° H × 94 ° V) simulated an vehicle traveling on a clockwise or counterclockwise circular path (yaw rate: ± 4 °/s) through a random-dot 3 D cloud (depth range: 6 – 50 m) at 8 m/s under two conditions: “static scene” in which dots were displayed until they left {{the field of view}} thus containing both optic flow and <b>path</b> <b>information,</b> and “dynamic scene” in which dot lifetime was limited to 100 ms thus removing <b>path</b> <b>information.</b> Five observers (3 naïve) used a joystick to steer and align their vehicle line of sight with true heading as their simulated vehicle yaw orientation was perturbed by the sum of 7 harmonically-unrelated (0. 1 to 2. 19 Hz) sinusoids. The joystick displacement generated a command proportional to the rate of change of the simulated yaw vehicle angle. Time series (90 s) of heading error and joystick displacement were Fourier analyzed and averaged across 6 trials. For all observers, overall error was similar in both conditions (mean absolute heading error ± RMS across observers: 4. 2 ± 5. 9 ° and 4. 0 ± 6. 3 °, for static and dynamic scenes, respectively). However, model-based analysis of the frequency response (Li, Sweet, & Stone, IEEE 2006) shows a significant decrease in lead time constant (ratio of velocity to position gain) for static scenes. We conclude that humans can accurately control their heading from optic flow independent of <b>path,</b> but <b>path</b> <b>information</b> reduces low-frequency ([[lt]] 0. 3 Hz) drift, when available. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
