50|$|Live green plants absorb solar {{radiation}} in the {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (PAR) spectral region, which they use {{as a source of}} energy in the process of photosynthesis. Leaf cells have also evolved to re-emit {{solar radiation}} in the near-infrared spectral region (which carries approximately half of the total incoming solar energy), because the photon energy at wavelengths longer than about 700 nanometers is not large enough to synthesize organic molecules. A strong absorption at these wavelengths would only result in overheating the plant and possibly damaging the tissues. Hence, live green plants appear relatively dark in the PAR and relatively bright in the near-infrared. By contrast, clouds and snow tend to be rather bright in the red (as well as other visible wavelengths) and quite dark in the near-infrared.The pigment in plant leaves, chlorophyll, strongly absorbs visible light (from 0.4 to 0.7 µm) for use in photosynthesis. The cell structure of the leaves, on the other hand, strongly reflects near-infrared light (from 0.7 to 1.1 µm). The more leaves a plant has, the more these wavelengths of light are affected, respectively.Since early instruments of Earth Observation, such as NASA's ERTS and NOAA's AVHRR, acquired data in visible and near-infrared, it was natural to exploit the strong differences in <b>plant</b> <b>reflectance</b> to determine their spatial distribution in these satellite images.|$|E

40|$|Illumination of European {{greenhouses}} consumes electricity {{equivalent to}} 1. 5 times the electricity production in Sweden. This amount {{could be reduced}} by approximately 75 % by improving the illumination. Today HPS lamps (High pressure sodium lamps) are used. The spectrum of the HPS lamp fits poorly with the action spectrum of the photosynthesis, why most of the illumination cannot be used. By combining LEDs of different wavelengths, a spectrum closer to the action spectrum of the photosynthesis can be achieved. Experiments carried out with Heliospectra HB LED-lamp on the crop basil showed 40 % improved efficiency compared to HPS lamps. Further improvements are possible, since the LED-lamp allows the intensity of each wavelength-band to be adjusted to the varying needs of plants. A plant’s need, and its efficiency in using light, can be measured through plant fluorescence and reflectance. The aim of this project is to derive mathematical models that correlate plant growth with reflectance and illumination, and fluorescence with physiological state of the plant and plant stress. These models will then {{be used for a}} control system for the LED-lamp with which the plants are able to modulate their own light environment. Expected results are decreased energy use, predictable harvest and higher crop quality. Reflectance and growth rate Reflectance from plants has showed a general relationship to chlorophyll content in leafs, leaf area index and plant hight. Estimates of green biomass has been done from remote sensing of reflectance from satellites as well as on ground level through the use of reflectance indices. These indices, for example the NDVI, are based on relations between the reflectance of the wavelengths that are the least and the most sensitive to chlorophyll content. Since <b>plant</b> <b>reflectance</b> is sensitive to chlorophyll content {{it is reasonable to assume}} that it can be correlated also to growth rate. By remote (at about one meter distance) and on leaf measurements of <b>plant</b> <b>reflectance</b> and measurements of dry matter content in plants we hope to find a correlation between growth rate and <b>plant</b> <b>reflectance.</b> The relationship between growth rate and reflectance is then to be used for non destructive determination of biomass content and prediction of time for harvest. Fluorescence and plant stress Fluorescence measurements contains information about the physiological state of plants. The physiological state of a plant is affected by access to specific wavelengths of light (especially 680 and 700 nm), CO 2, water and nutrients. Unbalanced access to these growth factors blocks the transfer of absorbed light energy and causes deexcitation of chlorophyll molecules, which gives rise to fluorescence. Hence fluorescence intensity can be used to measure if the plants are stressed due to lack of any of these parameters. From fluorescence measurements it can also be determined whether the plants are exposed to damaging light intensities. Damaging light intensities causes break down of chlorophyll...|$|E

30|$|The FMC can be {{estimated}} from field work, but this process is laborious and costly. For this reason, most operational estimates of FMC, particularly for dead fuels, are based on meteorological indices (Simard 1968, Finney 1998, Aguado et al. 2007). These methods require spatial interpolation to obtain complete spatial coverage. Due {{to the fact that}} live fuels are associated with more than weather conditions, alternative methods based on satellite images have been used to estimate FMC of live fuels (LFMC). These methods can be divided in two large groups, depending on whether they use empirical or simulation models. The former rely on statistical fittings between satellite derived indices and field measurements, and therefore are site-specific, but can be extended to areas with similar conditions (Chuvieco et al. 2004 b, García et al. 2008). The simulation models are based on radiative transfer equations and try to account for the impact of water content on <b>plant</b> <b>reflectance</b> at different wavelengths.

30|$|For this reason, {{the use of}} {{alternative}} tools for interpreting remotely sensed data is desirable. In recent years, physical models have been proposed as {{a viable alternative to}} derive quantitative information from reflectance calibrated images. Successful application of these models has been reported in the estimation of chlorophyll (Zarco-Tejada et al. 2001), moisture content (Danson and Bowyer 2004), and dry matter (Riaño et al. 2005). Simulation models attempt to account for the effects of different factors that modify <b>plant</b> <b>reflectance</b> and transmittance: chemical composition, geometrical configuration, illumination and observation angles, etc. The large number of proposed models can be classified into general groups depending on their main assumptions: turbid medium models, geometrical models, stocastic models and ray-tracing models (Liang 2004). Most common models are based on the radiative transfer equation and therefore are named radiative transfer models (RTM) since they account for the multiple scattering of radiation as it interacts with the vegetation canopy and soil background. Such interaction can be modeled assuming that the vegetation represents one or more homogenous layers. Other possibilities include the consideration of discontinuous canopies, such as row structure in crops or grid structure in tree plantations, and higher levels of complexity such as the consideration of three-dimensional vegetation structure models (Pinty et al. 2004). Although more complex models are closer to reality than those based on homogeneous canopies, they require a large number of input variables, making them harder to parameterize with real data.|$|E

Remote sensing are the most suitable means to obtain this information. This requires that remote sensing data employed in a forest survey be properly chosen and utilized {{for their ability to}} measure canopy spectral features directly related to key tree and canopy properties that are indicators of forest health and vitality. <b>Plant</b> <b>reflectance</b> in the visible to short wave IR regions (400 to 2500 nm) provides information on its biochemical, biophysical, and morphological make up, whereas plant fluorescence in the 400 to 750 nm region is more indicative of the capacity and functioning of its photosynthetic apparatus.

While infestation with an aggressive soil pathogen can be detected via reflected light spectra, it is unknown to what extent hyperspectral reflectance {{could be used to}} detect overall changes in soil biodiversity. We tested the hypotheses that spectra can be used to (1) separate plants growing with microbial communities from different farms; (2) to separate plants growing in different microbial communities due to different land use; and (3) separate plants according to microbial species loss. We measured hyperspectral reflectance patterns of winter wheat plants growing in sterilized soils inoculated with microbial suspensions under controlled conditions. Microbial communities varied due to geographical distance, land use and microbial species loss caused by serial dilution. After 3 months of growth in the presence of microbes from the two different farms plant hyperspectral reflectance patterns differed significantly from each other, while within farms the effects of land use via microbes on <b>plant</b> <b>reflectance</b> spectra were weak. Species loss via dilution on the other hand affected a number of spectral indices for some of the soils. Spectral reflectance can be indicative of differences in microbial communities, with the Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index the most common responding index.

There is considerable variation between the soil origins and currently it is not possible yet to make sufficient reliable predictions about the soil microbial community based on the spectral reflectance.

40|$|It {{is known}} that natural gas in the soil affects {{vegetation}} health, which may be detected through analysis of reflectance spectra. Since natural gas is invisible, changes in the vegetation could potentially indicate gas leakage. Although it {{is known that}} gas in soil affects <b>plant</b> <b>reflectance,</b> the relationship between natural gas and the development and reflectance properties of plants has not been studied. The objective {{of this study was to}} test whether natural gas and its two main components, methane and ethane, affect vegetation reflectance in the chlorophyll and water absorption regions. An experiment was carried out in which maize (Zea mays) plants were grown in pots that were flushed with 10 l of gas per day for 39 ± 4 days. Leaf reflectance was measured once a week with a spectrophotometer. The reflectance was analysed using continuum removal of the blue (400 - 550 nm), red (550 - 750 nm) and two water absorption features (1370 - 1570 nm and 1870 - 2170 nm), after which the band depths and normalized band depths were analyzed for each treatment. The band depth analysis showed that ethane caused an initial increase of 10 % in reflectance between 560 and 590 nm, followed by a decrease during the course of the experiment. Normalized band depth analysis showed that ethane caused a reflectance shift of 1 to 5 nm towards longer wavelengths compared to the control reflectance in the visible region. All gases caused an increase in reflectance in the water absorption bands. The physiological reflectance index, PRI, which has previously linked water stress to photosynthetic activity, suggested that the hydrocarbon gases (particularly ethane) decreased the photosynthetic activity of the plants. The combination of reduced band depths in the chlorophyll and water absorption regions and the increased PRI suggests that ethane gas in the soil hampered a normal water uptake by maize plants in an early stage of their growth. Although further research is necessary to upscale the results from the laboratory to the field, the increased reflectance in the 560 - 590 nm region caused by ethane together with the increased PRI are promising indicators for gas leakage...|$|E

Soybean aphid, Aphis glycines (Hemiptera: Aphididae) {{is the primary}} insect pest of soybean in the northcentral United States. Soybean aphid may cause stunted plants, leaf discoloration, plant death, and decrease soybean yield by 40 %. Sampling plans {{have been developed for}} supporting soybean aphid management. However, growers’ perception about time involved in direct insect counts has been contributing to a lower adoption of traditional pest scouting methods and may be {{associated with the use of}} prophylactic insecticide applications in soybean. Remote sensing of plant spectral (light-derived) responses to soybean aphid feeding is a promising alternative to estimate injury without direct insect counts and, thus, increase adoption and efficiency of scouting programs. This research explored the use of remote sensing of soybean reflectance for detection of soybean aphids and showed that foliar insecticides may have implications for subsequent use of soybean spectral reflectance for pest detection. Chapter 1 was the first publication showing that feeding from soybean aphid affects soybean spectral reflectance. Using ground-based spectroradiometers at canopy-level, it was found that soybean aphids affected <b>plant</b> <b>reflectance</b> at a narrowband wavelength within the near-infrared spectral range (800 nm), but had no effect at a red narrowband wavelength (680 nm). Soybean aphids also affected a vegetation index referred to as NDVI (i. e., normalized difference vegetation index), which combines the near-infrared and red wavelengths into a value representing photosynthetic pigment content and potential ultrastructure changes in soybean leaves. In general, soybean aphids induced similar effects on canopy- and leaf-level spectral measurements, but there were a few instances that significant effects at leaf-level were not detected by canopy-level. Chapter 2 used hyperspectral data and simulated wide-band sensors for detection of soybean aphid. While the first chapter showed that remote sensing is a promising solution based on results from two narrowband wavelengths, the second chapter provided an extensive search for band sensors that could optimize the use of soybean canopy reflectance for soybean aphid detection. Akaike’s Information Criteria (AIC) was used to rank and select sensors. Lower AIC values were considered to provide better models. The subset of narrowband wavelengths that optimized estimation of soybean aphid abundance was similar to that obtained using simulated wide-band sensors. Increasing sensor bandwidth corresponded to larger AIC values (worse models). The smallest AIC values (better models) were observed with narrow- and wide-band sensors centered around 780 nm. Chapter 3 assessed effects of foliar insecticides on spectral response of soybean plants under greenhouse and field conditions. Such effects could potentially confound measures of pest-induced spectral changes. Representatives of the two most commonly used insecticides (i. e., chlorpyrifos and λ-cyhalothrin) and a novel active ingredient referred to as sulfoxaflor affected soybean leaf reflectance. λ-cyhalothrin had the least effect on spectral reflectance and only affected a few near-infrared wavelengths, but sulfoxaflor and chlorpyrifos affected leaf reflectance at several visible and near-infrared wavelengths. I speculated that foliar insecticides had immediate effects via surface residues on plants and delayed effects via morpho-physiological changes induced by the insecticides. The potential leaf surface residues had transitory effects on soybean reflectance and no consistent pattern of spectral changes was associated with the insecticides. Overall, my results hold promise to identify and characterize injury of soybean aphid using remote sensing of soybean canopy reflectance. The information provided in this research may help to design optimized sensors for soybean aphid detection and contribute to the understanding of insect- and insecticide-induced effects on plants. It may also improve the current field-wide management tactics by making decisions for pest control when plant spectral reflectance indicates that soybean aphid abundance reached its economic threshold. To incorporate remote sensing into IPM programs, this new scouting method based on plant spectral reflectance will need further research to adjust economic thresholds, application of insecticides with no or short-duration effects on plant spectral data, and better understanding of other plant-pest interactions affecting plant morpho-physiology. It will be important to distinguish spectral changes induced by soybean aphid from other confounding factors such as other herbivores, nutritional deficiencies, diseases, and water stress. Future research will be needed to determine if the ground-based effects documented in our studies can be detected from space- and air-based platforms, such as satellites and unmanned aerial systems. Moreover, advancing our results may contribute to determine where and when insecticides are needed by using the spatial location of soybean spectral responses to soybean aphid infestations. Remote sensing has the potential to expand the use of IPM practices and collaborate to the mission of feeding an increasing population that has been changing diet habits and will require more production of food...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to design and evaluate a novel dual camera sensor for use in an accurate single leaf level plant detection and classification system for weed control purposes. The system was to utilise and combine the benefits of colour and spectral imaging technologies together with novel data processing techniques. Such combination of colour and spectral imaging devices has not been previously used in precision agriculture. Environmental consciousness and requirements for production volumes of organic produce are constantly increasing. Reductions or total elimination of chemical spraying is needed, and a technological solution of automating the weed control has been seen as one solution to solve the limitations in current crop production methods. Recent studies have shown automatic plant detection and classification to be the only economically viable solution for the problem of automatic weed control. Previous detection systems have shown adequate capabilities to detect and classify weeds and crop plants with certain limitations. Depending on the system, these limitations have been in spatial accuracy, operation in certain lighting conditions or selection of plants to be classified. A flexible system capable of robust plant classification under any circumstances and plant combinations has not yet been realised. It would be desirable to introduce a system capable of detecting any plant species and plants separately, thus allowing targeted and optimal weed control methods for each plant species. The proposed system addressed the problem of automatic plant detection and classification by providing sub-centimetre level information on plant part locations separately for each plant species. This information could then be directly used to guide mechanical weeding tools or precision sprayers. The detection system was based on a novel combination of a sub-millimetre level colour camera and an accurate hyperspectral line scanning camera (spectrometer) in the spectral range of 400 – 1000 nm. The spatial accuracy of the spectrometer was approximately five times lower than that of the colour camera. The system operated under controlled lighting conditions. The colour camera allowed precise segmentation of plant borders, while the spectral camera produced detailed reflectance information to discriminate between plant types. The system was able to collect data for classification from an area on a plant of approximately 6. 5 mm by 6. 5 mm, although typically areas as small as 3. 5 mm by 3. 5 mm were detected. These were also the spatial resolution boundaries of the system with the used test settings. The system was first designed and evaluated in laboratory conditions using controlled lighting and a selection of leaves from 6 plants. Data collection and analysis methods were designed for a scanning system with simultaneous image acquisition from both cameras. Shape, colour and spectral reflectance information were used to correctly classify these individual leaves with a probability of up to 98 % using linear stepwise discriminant analysis. A method of classifying separate leaves is not robust in a real field environment where plant leaves are often overlapping. This makes the use of shape calculations difficult. A novel method of extracting data from the small windows was proposed. Colour and spectral data within these windows was classified separately and the windows formed a grid like structure with approximately 3. 5 mm spacing between them. This allowed spatial filtering of the classification data and noise reduction for the results by utilising information in a 3 by 3 window neighbourhood around each data window. During laboratory tests the windows for 6 plant leaves were correctly classified at 97. 8 % when the leaves were separated, and at 85. 2 % with overlapping leaves. The system operation was also evaluated in real field conditions. Four crop plants and 16 weed plant types were imaged on a field over a period of 11 to 25 days after sowing. Total average classification performance in field conditions with linear discriminant analysis was up to 85. 1 %, while classification results investigated as a two-class case of crop vs. weed plants was up to 99. 5 % and 83. 8 %, respectively. The spatial filtering method was shown to improve results on average by 7. 5 %. <b>Plant</b> <b>reflectance</b> measurements on different days allowed a novel analysis of short term temporal changes in the plant spectra due to growing conditions and growth stages. Analysis on short term spectral changes and their effects on classification accuracies have not been found in the literature. The temporal analysis showed that the average spectra of any plant type changes considerably over a period of just few days, and has a trend like behaviour when investigated at individual wavelengths. Classification models with training set data from previous days did not perform well. This indicates the need to have an up to date training set available at all times explaining the subtleties in local conditions. The proposed detection and classification system with intelligent data processing methods has been shown to perform at a comparable level with previous systems. The novel system does not suffer from the typical limitations of previous systems, and is flexible to be used with any plant types in their early growth stages. There is also potential to include plant height, shape or any other relevant feature to the classification for increased robustness. The presented data processing method allows considerable processing and data reductions within the camera hardware. Only small fractions of the processed image data would need to be transferred via the camera interface. This would compensate for the increased data flow created by using two cameras. Therefore, the real-time implementation of the system is thought possible with the right hardware choices and optimised data processing algorithms.

40|$|Anomalous {{concentrations}} {{of natural gas}} in the soil may be sourced from leaking underground gas pipelines or from natural microseepages. Due to the explosive nature of hydrocarbon gases, early detection of these gases is essential to avoid dangerous situations. It is known that natural gas in the soil affects vegetation health, which may be detected through analysis of reflectance spectra. This thesis characterizes the effects of underground gas leakage on plant and canopy development and reflectance. Based on the reflectance properties, a general gas leak detection method is proposed. It was assumed that natural gas displaces the soil air and that oxygen shortage {{is the cause of}} changes in vegetation growth and reflectance; however it was not known whether the hydrocarbon gases have an additional effect on the vegetation. Therefore two experiments were performed to compare the effects of small gas leaks (without oxygen shortage) with large leaks (with oxygen shortage) on plant growth and reflectance. The small gas leaks were simulated by delivering natural gas, methane and ethane to pots with maize (Zea mays) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants. The large natural gas leak was simulated by delivering 2200 1 of gas per day to 2 by 2 m maize and wheat canopy plots. Whereas in several studies a decrease in vegetation chlorophyll {{was one of the main}} indicators of large gas leaks, this study showed that leaf area is a better indicator of gas leakage. Moreover, it was shown that when the ethane concentration in the soil reaches 0. 75 %, plant growth is not only affected by oxygen shortage but also by the gas itself. The leaf reflectance of the plants was analysed using continuum removal of the blue (400 - 550 nm), red (550 - 750 nm) and two water absorption features (1370 - 1570 nm and 1870 - 2170 nm). The analysis showed that ethane caused an initial increase of 10 % in reflectance between 560 and 590 nm, followed by a decrease during the course of the experiment. All gases caused an increase in reflectance in the water absorption bands. The physiological reflectance index PRI, which has previously linked water stress to photosynthetic activity, suggested that the hydrocarbon gases (particularly ethane) decreased the photosynthetic activity of the plants. The combination of reduced band depths in the chlorophyll and water absorption regions and the increased PRI suggests that ethane gas in the soil hampered a normal water uptake by maize plants in an early stage of their growth. Since gas leaks are often accompanied by elevated carbon dioxide concentrations due to bacterial methane oxidation, an additional experiment was performed to study the effects of CO 2 gas in concentrations ranging from 2 % to 50 % on vegetation reflectance. The red edge position in combination with a new index named the 'yellow edge position' showed that an increasing CO 2 concentration corresponded to decreasing leaf chlorophyll. Two water absorption features at 1400 and 1900 nm indicated that a concentration of 50 % COi decreased leaf water content. However, since other aspects such as the effects of oxygen shortage and ethane may either diminish or enhance the effects of CO 2 on <b>plant</b> <b>reflectance,</b> the effects should be separated to know whether CO 2 affects vegetation reflectance in a larger leak. To define the effects of oxygen shortage on vegetation reflectance, measured oxygen concentrations were correlated with reflectance indices. Statistical covariance analysis indicated that at 29 days after oxygen shortage occurred, the reflectance indices had the highest correlation with oxygen concentrations in the soil, for both species. The effect was consistent within species, but the absolute values varied between the species. Normalization between species resulted in significant linear regression models for six reflectance indices. However, the performance of each index varied in time, resulting in the best predictions 29 days after gassing started, which was halfway through the growth cycle of the plants. When the same normalization procedure was applied to differences in time, the Vogelmann index (Vogl; R 740 IR 12 Q) could predict oxygen concentrations under the maize canopy at any timestep. Oxygen concentrations predicted from the Lichenthaler index (LIC 3; R 440 /R 740) based on the wheat canopy were less reliable (R 2 of 0. 55) due to patchy growth on the control plots. When these indices were used to predict the oxygen concentration in the soil in order to detect the gas leak, the maximum distance to the gas source at which the oxygen concentration was reduced was just 0. 5 m. However, when a filter is applied that searches for the round shape of the leak, the chance of detecting a gas leak is increased significantly. Leak detection should optimally take place when canopy cover is between 40 and 80 %, or when the NDVI is between 0. 6 and 0. 9. LIC 3 should be used at NDVI values below 0. 75, while Vogl will be a better predictor under canopies of higher NDVI. In a large leak, ethane, CO 2 and oxygen shortage all occur together. The effect of oxygen shortage in the simulated gas leak however was so strong that the additional effect of ethane could not be measured. The actual CO 2 concentrations in the leak were calculated using a model that incorporates bacterial oxidising activity and continuous replenishment of the soil with methane and air. Soil CO 2 concentrations did not reach values that are harmful to plants. It is therefore concluded that in a large leak, low oxygen concentrations are the main cause for changes in reflectance. Finally, the results of the simulated gas leaks were tested in the field in a natural hydrocarbon seepage area. Even though the hyperspectral imagery dated from several years earlier, the patterns observed in the field were also observed in the image using the indices proposed earlier. This supports the conclusion that the selected indices are not season dependent and can be used at any moment in time. Moreover, using indices that are related to biomass makes the method generally applicable. The disadvantage is that such indices lead to large number of false anomalies, however, including a filter in the analysis reduced the number of false anomalies remarkably and should therefore be an integral part of the detection process. In conclusion, this thesis has shown that gas leaks cause changes in vegetation reflectance as early as 2 weeks after gas leakage starts. If the spectral resolution of the sensor is high in the visible and NIR and the spatial resolution as high as possible (preferably as high as 1 m), vegetation reflectance can be used as indicator of gas leakage...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this study was ?Use of sensor {{technologies}} to estimate and assess the effect of various plant diseases on crop growth and development?. The background of the investigation {{can be seen in the}} challenge of developing a sensor system for the site-specific identification of plant diseases. The most widely used practice in disease control is still to spray fungicides uniformly over fields at different times during the vegetation period. However, most diseases are not distributed uniformly across a field, but occur in patches. During the early stage of epidemics large areas of the field are disease free. Excessive use of fungicides increases costs and can increase fungicides residue levels on agricultural products. As there is an increasing pressure to reduce their use by targeting fungicide spraying only on those places in the field where they are needed, the challenge is to provide farmers the the appropriate technological solutions. A simple and cost-effective optical device, based on the measurement of canopy reflectance in several wavebands, would allow disease patches to be identified and thus controlled. The implementation of these reflectance measurement data into crop growth models would allow for the development of site-specific decision rules whether to spray or not to spray. The specific objectives of the Ph. D. thesis were to: develop and test reflectance measurements as a possible technology to identify reflectance signatures of various plant diseases; develop suitable sets of calibrations that can be used for the identification and quantification of plant diseases; test different sensor systems at different spatial resolutions for their ability to identify plant diseases; develop a strategy to use plant disease information gained from sensor measurements as input dataset for the simulation of wheat growth under disease pressure in CERES-Wheat. In greenhouse experiments at the University of Hohenheim and in field experiments at the experimental station ?Ihinger Hof? of the University of Hohenheim the influence of the diseases powdery mildew, septoria leaf blotch and wheat eyespot on the reflectance of winter wheat was analyzed. To measure the reflectance of the plants three different sensor systems were used. <b>Plant</b> <b>reflectance</b> was measured with a digital camera (LEICA S 1 PRO, LEICA Kamera AG, Solms, Germany) at leaf scale (0. 5 cm²) and with the spectroradiometer Field Spec® Hand Held (ASD, Inc. Boulder, CO, USA) (0. 5 m²) and the Yara N-Sensor in the field-scan modus (12 m²) 2 m above the canopy. The diseases powdery mildew, septoria leaf blotch and wheat eyespot have been analyzed. In a first approach it was tested if it is possible to detect plant diseases using reflectance measurements. The greenhouse studies showed that powdery mildew could be identified especially in the visible wavelength range. Also a correlation between powdery mildew pustules and reflectance changes was possible. Powdery mildew is a leaf disease and changes could directly be detected by a sensor system (Chapter 5). Out of this the second approach was to analyze if a stem disease that cannot directly be detected could be identified using a sensor system. The influence of wheat eyespot was investigated in a field experiment with winter wheat. The results showed that wheat eyespot could not be detected with the digital camera and the spectroradiometer. The problem was the low infection level and the distance between the measuring place and the infection place (Chapter 6). In a next step common vegetation indices were tested for their ability to identify plant diseases. Different vegetation indices were selected out of the literature to detect powdery mildew and septoria leaf blotch in the field using a spectroradiometer. Results indicated that the common vegetation index REIP was able to detect powdery mildew at an infection level of 7 %. With the common vegetation indices septoria leaf blotch could be detected only at a late infection level of 13. 7 %. Out of this the new vegetation index DII was developed, which was able to detect septoria leaf blotch at an early infection level of 4 % (Chapter 7). Not only the place of infection but also the spatial resolution seems to play an important role in the identification of plant diseases. In a further approach different sensor systems with different spatial resolutions were tested in a field experiment for the identification of septoria leaf blotch. The results showed in general that septoria leaf blotch could be identified especially in the infrared wavelength range compared to powdery mildew that could especially identified in the visible wavelength range. The results showed further that the lower the spatial resolutionthe more difficult it gets to identify plant diseases site-specifically. With a spatial resolution of 0. 5 cm² a identification and quantification was possible. With a spatial resolution of 0. 5 m² only a identification was possible and with a spatial resolution of 12 m² not identification and quantification was possible. That might be because of the resulting mixture of healthy and diseased plants (Chapter 8). The last step of this work was then to show how reflectance measurements could be implemented into crop growth models to calculate decisions whether to spray or not to spray fungicides on a site-specific level. Summarizing, the overall results {{of this study}} indicated that an identification of plant diseases was possible under certain conditions. An identification was possible if the infection place was also the measuring place and if a sensor system was used with a high spatial resolution. The results also showed that it was possible in a certain way to differ between biotroph and necrotroph plant diseases. For a holistic farming concept it is necessary in the future that reflectance measurements are integrated in a crop growth model to give farmers a decision tool that decides whether the infection is critical enough to spray or not. Die vorliegende Arbeit stand unter dem Titel ?Use of sensor technologies to estimate and assess the effect of various plant diseases on crop growth and development?. Hintergrund der Untersuchung war die Entwicklung eines Sensor Systems für die teilflächenspezifische Identifizierung von Pflanzenkrankheiten. Die am meist verbreiteste Technik im Bereich der Krankheitskontrolle ist immer noch die einheitliche Bearbeitung von Feldern mit Fungiziden zu verschiedenen Zeitpunkten innerhalb der Vegetationsperiode. Jedoch sind die meisten Pflanzenkrankheiten nicht einheitlich über einem Feld verbreitet, sondern treten nur auf einzelnen Teilflächen auf. Während der anfänglichen Krankheitsentwicklung sind viele Teile des Feldes noch frei von Krankheiten. Der übermäßige Gebrauch von Pflanzenschutzmitteln erhöht die Kosten und kann die Rückstände von Pflanzenschutzmitteln auf landwirtschaftlichen Produkten erhöhen. Da ein erheblicher Druck besteht, den Gebrauch von Pflanzenschutzmitteln zu reduzieren und nur noch an den Stellen im Feld einzusetzen, an denen Pflanzenkrankheiten auftreten, ist die Herausforderung, Landwirten eine geeignete technologische Lösung bereit zu stellen. Eine einfache und kostengünstige optische Erfindung, basierend auf der Messung der Bestandesreflexion in verschiedenen Wellenlängenbereiche, würde es ermöglichen, Krankheiten im Feld teilflächenspezifisch zu erkennen und zu kontrollieren. Die Einbindung dieser Reflexionsmessungen in Pflanzenwachstumsmodellen würde es ermöglichen, teilflächenspezifische Entscheidungsregeln zu entwickeln, die entscheiden, ob es notwendig ist zu behandeln oder nicht. Die einzelnen Ziele der Arbeit waren: die Entwicklung und das Testen von Reflexionsmessungen als eine geeignete Technologie um Pflanzenkrankheiten anhand der Reflexion zu erkennen; die Entwicklung von geeigneten Kalibrierungsserie, die zur Identifizierung und Quantifizierung von Pflanzenkrankheiten verwendet werden können; das Testen von unterschiedlichen Sensor-Technologien mit einer unterschiedlichen räumlichen Auflösung im Hinblick auf die Erkennung von Pflanzenkrankheiten; die Entwicklung von Strategien um die Information über Pflanzenkrankheiten, gewonnen von den Sensormessungen, als Eingangsparameter in CERES-Wheat zu integrieren, um die Entwicklung von Weizen unter Krankheiten zu simulieren. In Gewächshausversuchen an der Universität Hohenheim und in Feldversuchen auf der Versuchsstation ?Ihinger Hof? der Universität Hohenheim wurde der Einfluss der Krankheiten Mehltau, Blattdürre und Halmbruch auf die Reflexion von Winterweizen untersucht. Um die Reflexion der Pflanzen zu untersuchen wurden drei verschiedenen Sensoren verwendet. Die Reflexion wurde mit einer digitalen Kamera (LEICA S 1 Pro, LEICA Kamera AG, Solms, Deutschland) auf der Blattebene (0, 5 m 2) und mit dem Spectroradiometer Field Spec® Hand Held (ASD, Ic. Boulder, CO, USA) (0, 5 m 2) und dem Yara N-Sensor im field-scan Modus (12 m 2) 2 m über dem Bestand gemessen. In einem ersten Ansatz wurde getestet, ob es möglich ist, Pflanzenkrankheiten mittels Reflexionsmessungen zu erkennen. Die Gewächshausversuche zeigten, dass es möglich ist, Mehltau zu erkennen, vor allem im sichtbaren Wellenlängenbereich. Auch eine Korrelation zwischen Mehltaupusteln und der Reflexionsänderung war möglich. Mehltau ist eine Blattkrankheit und kann somit direkt von den Sensoren erkannt werden (Kapitel 5). Daraufhin wurde in einem zweiten Ansatz untersucht ob es möglich ist ein Stängelkrankheit, die nicht direkt von Sensoren erkannt werden kann zu identifizieren. Der Einfluss von Halmbruch wurde in einem Feldversuch mit Winterweizen untersucht. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass Halmbruch nicht mit der digitalen Kamera und dem Spectroradiometer erkannt werden konnte. Das Problem war die geringe Infektionsrate und der Abstand zwischen Ort der Messung und Ort der Infektion (Kapitel 6). In einem nächsten Schritt wurden gebräuchliche Vegetationsindizes im Hinblick auf ihre Fähigkeit, Pflanzenkrankheiten zu erkennen, getestet. Verschiedenen Vegetationsindizes wurden aus der Literatur ausgewählt, um Mehltau und Blattdürre im Feld mittels des Spectroradiometers zu erkennen. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass der gebräuchliche Index REIP Mehltau bei einem Infektionslevel von 7 % erkennen konnte. Blattdürre konnte jedoch mittels den gebräuchlichen Indizes erst ab einem Infektionslevel von 13. 7 % erkannt werden. Aus diesem Grund wurde der neue Vegetationsindex DII entwickelt, der Blattdürre bei einem frühen Infektionslevel von 4 % erkennen konnte (Kapitel 7). Aber nicht nur der Ort der Infektion, sondern auch die räumliche Auflösung scheint eine wichtige Rolle bei der Erkennung von Pflanzenkrankheiten zu spielen. In einem weiteren Ansatz wurden unterschiedliche Sensorsysteme mit einer unterschiedlichen räumlichen Auflösung in Feldversuchen für die Erkennung von Blattdürre getestet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen generell, dass Blattdürre besonders im infraroten Wellenlängenbereich erkannt werden konnte verglichen mit Mehltau, der besonders im sichtbaren Wellenlängenbereich erkennbar war. Die Ergebnisse zeigen ferner, dass je geringer die räumliche Auflösung ist, desto schwieriger wird es, Pflanzenkrankheiten teilflächenspezifisch zu erkennen. Mit einer räumlichen Auflösung von 0, 5 cm² war eine Erkennung und Quantifizierung möglich. Mit einer räumlichen Auflösung von 0, 5 m² war nur noch eine Erkennung, aber keine Quantifizierung und mit einer räumlichen Auflösung von 12 m² war keine Erkennung und Quantifizierung möglich. Eine mögliche Ursache hierfür liegt in der Mischung aus gesunden und kranken Pflanzen (Kapitel 8). Der letzte Schritt dieser Arbeit war dann aufzuzeigen, wie Reflexionsmessungen in Pflanzenwachstumsmodellen integriert werden können, um Entscheidungen teilflächenspezifisch zu ermitteln, die entscheiden, ob es notwendig ist Fungizide auszubringen oder nicht. Zusammenfassend zeigten die Ergebnisse, dass ein Erkennen von Pflanzenkrankheiten unter gewissen Bedingungen möglich war. Ein Erkennen war dann möglich, wenn der Messort dem Infektionsort entsprach und wenn ein Sensor mit einer hohen räumlichen Auflösung verwendet wurde. Die Ergebnisse zeigten auch, dass es möglich war, in gewisser Weise zwischen biotrophen und nekrotrophen Krankheiten zu unterscheiden. Für ein ganzheitliches Bewirtschaftungskonzept ist es in der Zukunft notwendig, dass Reflexionsmessungen in Pflanzenwachstumsmodellen integriert werden, um dem Landwirt eine Entscheidungshilfe zu geben, die ermittelt, ob die Infektion kritisch genug ist für eine Behandlung mit einem Fungizid...|$|E

Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for cotton production; consequently {{there is a tendency to}} over-apply nitrogen. High N causes excessive vegetative growth and delayed crop maturity, which result in increased cost in pesticides, growth regulator, and defoliant. Currently, the most common methods for obtaining information about the nitrogen needs of cotton are labor-intensive and time-consuming limiting their use. Reflectance sensors offer the potential to diagnose N needs immediately in a spatially intensive manner. The objective of this study was to develop on-the-go sidedress N rate recommendations based on sensor readings and quantify variability during the day for both passive and active sensors mounted above cotton <b>plants.</b> <b>Reflectance</b> was measured with three sensors (Crop Circle, GreenSeeker, and Cropscan) at three growth stages (early square, mid square and early bloom) and at three heights above the cotton canopy (25, 50, and 100 cm) in 2006 and 2007. Results indicated that all three sensors have potential for accurate prediction of optimal N rate. Prediction accuracy was low at the first square stage but acceptable at mid square or early flower. These results suggest that variable-rate N applications to cotton based on real-time reflectance sensor readings are feasible for the mid-square to first flower growth stages. Variability in reflectance values during the day was relatively large for all three sensors. Mid-day was the time with the least error introduced into N rates by drift in sensor readings...|$|R

Consequently, the objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the use of hyperspectral data in predicting yield of Swiss chard grown under different irrigation water sources. Swiss chard groundbased hyperspectral data were collected at canopy level using a handheld spectroradiometer at 2 and 2. 5 months after <b>planting.</b> <b>Reflectance</b> spectra were transformed to their first-order derivative and partial least squares (PLS) and sparse PLS (SPLS) regressions (R) were used for data analysis. Results showed that 95 % and 97 % of Swiss chard fresh and dry yields variation, respectively could be explained. SPLSR outperformed PLSR models for predicting Swiss chard fresh and dry yields. Results further showed that models developed using data collected when the crop was 2. 5 months old performed more accurately than models derived using a 2 -month old crop data, except when the dry yield predicted using SPLSR. Fresh yield estimates could be accurately modeled (root mean square error: RMSE = 23. 97 % of the mean, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency: NSE = 0. 93.

40|$|Natural {{gas leakage}} from {{underground}} pipelines {{is known to}} affect vegetation adversely, probably by displacement of the soil oxygen needed for respiration. This causes changes in <b>plant</b> and canopy <b>reflectance,</b> which may serve as indicators of gas leakage. In this study, a covariance analysis was performed between reflectance indices of maize (Zea mays) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) canopies and oxygen concentrations in a simulated natural gas leak. Twenty-nine days after oxygen shortage occurred, the reflectance indices had the highest correlation with oxygen concentrations in the soil, for both species. The effect was consistent within species but the absolute values varied between the species. Normalization by adding a constant value to the control index of one species resulted in significant linear regression models for several indices. The indices with the highest regression coefficients were used to predict the oxygen concentration in the soil. This showed that the gas leakage caused reflectance changes up to 0. 5 m from the source.

Early detection of SCN is difficult because soybean plants infected by SCN often do not exhibit visible symptoms.

Moreover, reflectance measurements may be related to soybean growth and yield.;Two field experiments were conducted from 2000 to 2002 to study the relationships among reflectance data, quantity and quality of soybean yield, and SCN population densities. The best relationships between reflectance and the quantity of soybean grain yield occurred when reflectance data were obtained late August to early September. Similarly, reflectance was best related to seed oil and seed protein content and seed size when measured during late August/early September.
