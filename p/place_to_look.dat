At age six, he observed the Great Comet of 1577, writing that he [...] "was taken by [...] mother to a high <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at it." [...] In 1580, at age nine, he observed another astronomical event, a lunar eclipse, recording that he remembered being [...] "called outdoors" [...] {{to see it and}} that the moon [...] "appeared quite red". However, childhood smallpox left him with weak vision and crippled hands, limiting his ability in the observational aspects of astronomy.|$|E
500|$|A Fast-Track {{audition}} {{that was}} to be held at SM City Sta. Mesa was canceled, leading to complaints from hopefuls and their parents. [...] After hours of waiting, a representative of ABC arrived and relocated each of the 160 frustrated applicants to other scheduled screening. [...] Meanwhile, Filipinos living in Mindanao reacted negatively to what Philippine Idol judges said after a low Gold Pass turnout at the Davao Main Auditions, with Corrales (a Cebuana herself) saying that [...] "Davao is not the <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for an Idol" [...] and [...] "all the good ones are in Cebu". [...] Corrales later clarified in the Wildcard Round that she said such a statement because of the low turnout in the Davao auditions and the even lower Gold Pass output. She added that [...] "Davao's best talents" [...] might have probably auditioned earlier in Manila.|$|E
500|$|The author {{describes}} his experiences {{growing up in}} a church that, despite preaching about grace, did not demonstrate it to others; the church excluded African Americans, dismissed other Christians on the basis of slightly different beliefs, and depicted God as tyrannical and vengeful. Yancey writes, [...] "I grew up with the strong impression that a person became spiritual by attending to grey-area rules," [...] and that church was a <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> good rather than be honest. He contrasts the teachings of early Christians Pelagius and Augustine of Hippo on the subject of grace, with Pelagius believing that divine grace must be earned and Augustine contending that grace is a gift that cannot be earned. Pelagius was declared a heretic by his peers; Augustine was canonized. According to Yancey, many Christians follow Pelagius's teaching on grace during the week but espouse Augustine's on Sunday.|$|E

It's the same for videogames. While Itchy and Scratchy appeared in a hilarious cameo on the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis game Bart's Nightmare, here they duke it out in an interminable, multistage whackfest."

2500|$|The CMST {{researchers}} believe that the most likely explanation of the hydroacoustic data is that {{they come from the}} same event, but unrelated to Flight 370. They note that [...] "the characteristics of the [...] are not unusual, it is only their arrival time and to some extent the direction from which they came that make them of interest". If the data relates to the same event, related to Flight 370, but the arc derived from analysis of the aircraft's satellite transmission is incorrect, then the most likely <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the aircraft would be along a line from HA01 at a bearing of 301.6° until that line reaches the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge (approximately 2.3°S, 73.7°E). In the latter possibility, if the acoustic recordings are from the impact of the aircraft with the ocean, they likely came from a location where water is less than 2,000m deep and the seabed slopes downwards towards the east or southeast; if they came from debris imploding at depth, the source location along this line is much less certain. The lead CMST researcher believed the chance the acoustic event was related to Flight 370 to be very slim, perhaps as low as 10%. The audio recording of the suspect detection was publicly released on 4 June 2014; the ATSB had first referenced these signals in a document posted on its website on 26 May.|$|E
2500|$|On December 19, the Pickering–Mullen Accountability Review Board {{report on}} the Benghazi matter was released. It was sharply {{critical}} of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It explicitly criticized the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs: [...] "Systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department ... resulted in a special mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate {{to deal with the}} attack that took place." [...] Four State Department officials were removed from their posts as a consequence, including Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric J. Boswell (who resigned completely), a deputy assistant secretary for embassy security, Charlene R. Lamb, and a deputy assistant secretary for North Africa, Raymond Maxwell. The report did not criticize more senior officials in the department; Pickering said: [...] "We fixed it at the assistant secretary level, which is, in our view, the appropriate <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> where the decision-making in fact takes place, where, if you like, the rubber hits the road." [...] Clinton said in a letter to Congress that she accepted the conclusions of the Pickering–Mullen report, and a State Department task force was formed to implement some sixty action items recommended by the report. On December 20, the Deputy Secretary of State, William J. Burns, and the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, Thomas R. Nides, testified in her place before two Congressional committees, and said that many of the report's recommendations would be in place before year-end. Clinton planned to testify herself in January.|$|E
