40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the cognate and concreteness effects in Bulgarian-English bilinguals at two levels of proficiency, using a visual word translation task. While the well-established cognate facilitation effect was replicated in both experiments, some novel findings emerged. First, a reversed concreteness effect was observed in backward translation at both levels of proficiency. In addition, the highly proficient participants displayed differential <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>cognates,</b> so that they were translated faster from the native into the second language than in the opposite direction. The implications and possible interpretations of these findings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} development of visual word recognition in bilingual children {{at the beginning of}} initial reading acquisition. The central aim was to contribute to the debate on differences in orthographic processing between bilinguals and monolinguals, expanding the body of existing research by knowledge on bilingual word recognition mechanisms in beginning readers of German. The two main goals were to (1) study differences in the developmental trajectories of reading between first (L 1) and second (L 2) language speakers, and (2) to investigate {{the development of}} orthographic processing mechanisms that are specific to the bilingual word recognition system. To disentangle developmental effects between dominant and balanced bilinguals, four studies were conducted, of which two focused on children learning to read in German as their L 2, and two examined German-English balanced bilinguals learning to read concurrently in both languages. Study 1 investigated performance differences between L 1 and L 2 speakers in different component processes of reading, while controlling for the impact of linguistic and executive functioning skills. Study 2 zoomed in on the mechanisms of lexical access and compared L 1 and L 2 speakers’ lexical decision performance with regard to the impact of linguistic characteristics throughout elementary school. In study 3, the parallel activation of orthographic as well as semantic representations in both languages of balanced bilingual children was examined by studying the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>cognates</b> and false friends in German and English. Study 4 investigated the presence of an early language detection mechanism by exploring balanced bilingual children’s sensitivity to language-specific nonwords...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of phonological and orthographic overlap in the recognition <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> words by recording electrophysiological and behavioral data. One hundred and ninety-two words were selected: 96 cognate words listed according to their phonological and orthographic overlap vs. 96 noncognate words. Twenty-four proficient European Portuguese-English bilinguals performed a silent reading task with a masked priming paradigm. The results showed that phonology interacts with semantic activation at N 400 modulations. Phonological priming effects were dependent on the orthographic overlap <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> words. Thus, the distinctive <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> words seems {{to be due to}} their cross-linguistic similarity, which is consistent with a localist connectionist account on cognate representation and processing.

40|$|Heterochromatin {{assembly}} in fission yeast {{relies on the}} <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> noncoding RNAs by both the RNA interference and the exosome degradation pathways. Recent evidence indicates that splicing factors facilitate the cotranscriptional <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> centromeric transcripts into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In contrast, how the exosome contributes to heterochromatin assembly and whether it also relies upon splicing factors were unknown. We provide here evidence that fission yeast Spf 30 is a splicing factor involved in the exosome pathway of heterochromatin silencing. Spf 30 and Dis 3, the main exosome RNase, colocalize at centromeric heterochromatin and euchromatic genes. At the centromeres, Dis 3 helps recruiting Spf 30, whose deficiency phenocopies the dis 3 - 54 mutant: heterochromatin is impaired, as evidenced by reduced silencing and the accumulation of polyadenylated centromeric transcripts, but the production of siRNAs appears to be unaffected. Consistent with a direct role, Spf 30 binds centromeric transcripts and locates at the centromeres in an RNA-dependent manner. We propose that Spf 30, bound to nascent centromeric transcripts, perhaps with other splicing factors, assists their processing by the exosome. Splicing factor intercession may thus be a common feature of gene silencing pathways. In eukaryotic cells, RNA processing {{plays a key role}} in proper genetic expression, heterochromatin assembly, and mi...|$|R

HEL-specific B cells stimulated CD 8 + T cell responses in vitro {{to the same}} extent as bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Cross-presentation by specific B cells required endosomal acidification, proteasomal processing and classical MHC class I/peptide transport. Specific B cells also acquired both antigens rapidly in vivo and presented them to CD 4 + T cells. However, only HEL-specific B cells from OVA-HEL ISCOMS-immunised mice could cross-present OVA to naive OVA-specific CD 8 + T cells. Antigen-specific B cells were also activated selectively by OVA-HEL ISCOMS in vitro and importantly, the presence of HEL-specific B cells promoted the persistence of clonal expansion of OVA-specific CD 8 + T cells after in vivo immunisation with OVA-HEL ISCOMS. These results demonstrate preferential MHC class I and class II <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> antigen incorporated in ISCOMS by specific B cells in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the ability of ISCOMS to target B cells and offering novel insights into the role of B cells in cross-presentation to CD 8 + T cells...|$|R

Results are based on Northern blot analyses which show that in cbp 7 mutants with the short cytochrome b gene the maturase encoding intervening sequence fails to be excised although, at the same time, at least wild-type levels of the maturase are present as indicated by antibodies specific to it in Western blot analyses...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of global context and local context on the time course <b>of</b> activation <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> homonyms for bilingual readers. Of interest was whether meaning frequency, context, and cross-language activation modulated the time course of activation of the subordinate meaning <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> homonyms. Also, whether the subordinate bias effect would be altered or even eliminated by the combined influence of such contextual factors and cross-language activation. Eye movements of Spanish-English bilinguals were measured using an eye-tracking device while they read English paragraphs. The paragraphs contained cognate homonyms (e. g. novel/novela), cognate non-homonyms (e. g. plastic/plástico), non-cognate homonyms (e. g. slip), or non-cognate non-homonyms (e. g. hook) all in English. The topic of the paragraph (global context) was either biasing the subordinate meaning of the homonym or was neutral. The sentence where the target word was embedded (local context) had a preceding region that was either biasing the subordinate meaning or was neutral. Analyses revealed that that the combination of strong, contextual support and cross-language activation of the subordinate meaning resulted in the reduction <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> homonyms. ...|$|R

We {{demonstrate}} that the CRD confers to PC 5 A and PACE 4 properties to bind tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and the cell surface. Confocal microscopy and biochemical analyses revealed that the CRD is essential for cell surface tethering of PC 5 A and PACE 4 and that it colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with the full-length and C-terminal domain of TIMP- 2. Surface-bound PC 5 A in TIMP- 2 null fibroblasts was only observed upon coexpression with TIMP- 2. In COS- 1 cells, plasma membrane-associated PC 5 A can be displaced by heparin, suramin, or heparinases I and III and by competition with excess exogenous TIMP- 2. Furthermore, PC 5 A and TIMP- 2 are shown to be colocalized {{over the surface of}} enterocytes in the mouse duodenum and jejunum, as well as in liver sinusoids. In conclusion, the CRD of PC 5 A and PACE 4 functions as a cell surface anchor favoring the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> their <b>cognate</b> surface-anchored substrates, including endothelial lipase...|$|R
40|$|The {{currently}} {{widespread and}} increasing prevalence of resistant bacterial pathogens {{is a significant}} medical problem. In clinical strains of staphylococci, the genetic determinants that confer resistance to antimicrobial agents are often located on mobile elements, such as plasmids. Many of these resistance plasmids are capable of horizontal transmission to other bacteria in their surroundings, allowing extraordinarily rapid adaptation of bacterial populations. Once the resistance plasmids have been spread, they are often perpetually maintained in the new host, {{even in the absence}} of selective pressure. Plasmid persistence is accomplished by plasmid-encoded genetic systems that ensure efficient replication and segregational stability during cell division. Staphylococcal plasmids utilize proteins of evolutionarily diverse families to initiate replication from the plasmid origin of replication. Several distinctive plasmid copy number control mechanisms have been studied in detail and these appear conserved within plasmid classes. The initiators utilize various strategies and serve a multifunctional role in (i) recognition and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cognate</b> replication origin to an initiation active form and (ii) recruitment of host-encoded replication proteins that facilitate replisome assembly. Understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms that underpin plasmid replication may lead to novel approaches that could be used to reverse or slow the development of resistance...|$|R
40|$|BCR-mediated antigen {{processing}} occurs at immunologically relevant antigen concentrations and {{hinges on the}} trafficking of antigen-BCR (Ag-BCR) complexes to class II–containing multivesicular bodies (MVBs) termed MIICs. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the trafficking of Ag-BCR complexes to and within MIICs is not well understood. In contrast, the trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to and within MVBs occurs via a well-characterized ubiquitin-dependent mechanism, which is blocked by acute inhibition of proteasome activity. Using a highly characterized antigen-specific model system, {{it was determined that}} the immunoglobulin heavy chain subunit of the IgM BCR of normal (ie, nontransformed) B cells is ubiquitinated. Moreover, acute inhibition of proteasome activity delays the formation of ubiquitinated ligand–BCR complexes, alters the intracellular trafficking of internalized Ag-BCR complexes, and selectively blocks the BCR-mediated <b>processing</b> and presentation <b>of</b> <b>cognate</b> antigen, without inhibiting the endocytosis, <b>processing,</b> and presentation <b>of</b> non–cognate antigen internalized by fluidphase endocytosis. These results demonstrate that the trafficking of Ag-BCR complexes to and within MVB-like {{antigen processing}} compartments occurs via a molecular mechanism with similarities to that used by the EGFR, and establishes the EGFR as a paradigm for the further analysis of Ag-BCR trafficking to and within MIICs...|$|R

40|$|We {{considered}} {{the role of}} orthography and task-related processing mechanisms in the activation of morphologically related complex words during bilingual word processing. So far, it has only been shown that such morphologically related words (i. e., morphological family members) are activated through the semantic and morphological overlap they share with the target word. In this study, we investigated family size effects in Dutch-English identical cognates (e. g., tent in both languages), non-identical cognates (e. g., pil and pill, in English and Dutch, respectively), and non-cognates (e. g., chicken in English). Because of their cross-linguistic overlap in orthography, reading a cognate can result in activation of family members both languages. Cognates are therefore well-suited for studying mechanisms underlying bilingual activation of morphologically complex words. We investigated family size effects in an English lexical decision task and a Dutch-English language decision task, both performed by Dutch-English bilinguals. English lexical decision showed a facilitatory effect of English and Dutch family size on the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> English-Dutch <b>cognates</b> relative to English non-cognates. These family size effects were not dependent on cognate type. In contrast, for language decision, in which a bilingual context is created, Dutch and English family size effects were inhibitory. Here, the combined family size of both languages turned out to better predict reaction time than the separate family size in Dutch or English. Moreover, the combined family size interacted with cognate type: the response to identical cognates was slowed by morphological family members in both languages. We conclude that (1) family size effects {{are sensitive to the}} task performed on the lexical items, and (2) depend on both semantic and formal aspects <b>of</b> bilingual word <b>processing.</b> We discuss various mechanisms that can explain the observed family size effects in a spreading activation framework...|$|R

VEGF-D serum levels are increased in LAM compared to other cystic lung diseases, including pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, emphysema, Sjögren's syndrome, or Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. VEGF-D levels correlate with the severity of LAM, evaluated {{as a measure of}} CT grade (the abundance of chylous effusions and lymphatic involvement).

VEGF-D binds to the receptor protein tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-349 in humans, and to VEGFR3 in mice. Surprisingly, knock-out of VEGF-D in mice has little effect on lymphatic system development. Nevertheless, during tumorigenesis VEGF-D promotes formation of tumor lymphatic vessels and facilitates metastatic spread of cancer cells. However, little is known about a role of abnormal lymphatics and VEGF-D in LAM pathogenesis.|$|R
