Many such airlines sell each flight leg independently {{and have no}} concept of round-trip ticketing or connecting flights so baggage must be collected and rechecked even to transfer between flights booked {{at the same time}} on the same airline. Although there are many point-to-point airlines, most have at least a [...] "homebase" [...] airport where most flights originate or depart. The United States airport system was <b>point-to-point,</b> <b>controlled</b> by CAB, until deregulation late 1960s/early 1970s, and eventually the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act when they switched to the hub concept, until the advent of low-cost carriers, when point-to-point air transport increased. Some full-service network carriers operate the point-to-point model alongside the hub-and-spoke system for certain high-density routes between focus cities. In Europe, for example, most traditional full-service airlines operate seasonal point-to-point service outside their hubs to serve Mediterranean and Alpine holiday resorts.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel technique for {{the solution of}} an optimal input for trajectory tracking. Many researchers have documented the performance advantages of command shaping, which focuses {{on the design of}} an optimal input. Nearly all research in command shaping has been centered on the <b>point-to-point</b> motion <b>control</b> problem. But tracking problems are also an important application of control theory. The proposed optimal tracking technique extends the <b>point-to-point</b> motion <b>control</b> problem to the solution of the tracking problem. Thus two very different problems are brought into one solution scheme. The technique uses tolerances on trajectory following to meet constraints and minimize either maneuver time or input energy. A major advantage of the technique is that hard physical constraints such as acceleration or allowable tracking error can be directly constrained. Previous methods to perform such a task involved using various weightings that lack physical meaning. The optimal tracking technique allows for fast and efficient exploration of the solution space for motion control. Practical issues are addressed such as how to use feedforward and feedback inputs concurrently and how to achieve robustness to parameter error. Experimental work confirms the validity of the approach and further highlights how to implement real control schemes. ...|$|R
