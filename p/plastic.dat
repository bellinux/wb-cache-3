5|$|Glass-reinforced <b>plastic</b> (GRP) is a {{composite}} material or fiber-reinforced <b>plastic</b> made of a <b>plastic</b> reinforced by fine glass fibers. Like graphite-reinforced <b>plastic,</b> the composite material is {{commonly referred to as}} fiberglass. The glass can be {{in the form of a}} chopped strand mat (CSM) or a woven fabric.|$|E

5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to welding glass. The <b>plastic</b> first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the <b>plastic</b> is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and <b>plastic</b> are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating <b>plastic</b> to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the <b>plastic.</b> Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the <b>plastic,</b> which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the <b>plastic,</b> melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped <b>plastic</b> shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This <b>plastic</b> lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable <b>plastic</b> lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the <b>plastic</b> lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E

5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} <b>plastic</b> bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in <b>plastic,</b> as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the <b>plastic</b> can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the <b>plastic,</b> the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
50|$|The ban on {{concentrations}} of brominated flame retardants (BFR) above 0.1% in <b>plastics</b> has affected <b>plastics</b> recycling. As {{more and more}} products include recycled <b>plastics,</b> it has become critical to know the BFR concentration in these <b>plastics,</b> either by tracing {{the origins of the}} recycled <b>plastics</b> to establish the BFR concentrations, or by measuring the BFR concentrations from samples. <b>Plastics</b> with high BFR concentrations are costly to handle or to discard, whereas <b>plastics</b> with levels below 0.1% have value as recyclable materials.|$|R

5|$|Ingestion of <b>plastic</b> flotsam {{is another}} problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of <b>plastic</b> in the seas has {{increased}} dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition. This <b>plastic</b> is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested <b>plastic</b> in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this <b>plastic</b> causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.|$|E

5|$|Much {{floating}} <b>plastic</b> trash {{does not}} biodegrade, instead disintegrating {{over time and}} eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly <b>plastic</b> waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible <b>plastic</b> in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with <b>plastic</b> bags and fishing line in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of <b>plastic</b> are dumped into the ocean each year.

40|$|The {{electroplating}} {{process to}} <b>plastics</b> materials has been studied. The {{aim of this}} work is to propose a new electroplating process to general <b>plastics</b> materials without using harmful chromic acid and expensive Pd. By shot-blasting the surface of <b>plastics</b> using the metal powder such as Fe and Ni as shot materials, the metal powder stuck on the surface. And on dipping this <b>plastics</b> into electroless-plating bath, Ni began to deposit on stuck metal powder on <b>plastics</b> and covered surface overall. After electroless plating, Ni deposited on this electroless-plated <b>plastics</b> by electroplating. By this fact, it was understood that the metallization of <b>plastics</b> surface by shot-blasting was carried out and electroplating to <b>plastics</b> was possible...|$|R
40|$|Biobased <b>plastics</b> have {{experienced}} fast {{growth in the}} past decade thanks to the public concerns over the environment, climate change and the depletion of fossil fuels. This perspective provides an overview of the current global market of biobased <b>plastics,</b> their material properties, technical substitution potential and future market (for 2020). In addition, the technology and market development of three biobased <b>plastics,</b> namely polylactide (PLA), biobased polyethylene (PE) and biobased epoxy resin, are discussed in detail. The emerging biobased <b>plastics</b> market is still small compared to traditional biobased polymers and biomaterials. The global capacity of the emerging biobased <b>plastics</b> was only 0. 36 million tonnes in 2007. However, the market grew strongly between 2003 and 2007 (approx. 40 % per year). The technical substitution potential of biobased <b>plastics</b> replacing petrochemical <b>plastics</b> is estimated at 90 %, demonstrating the enormous potential of biobased <b>plastics.</b> Global capacity of biobased <b>plastics</b> is expected to reach 3. 45 million metric tonnes in 2020. Starch <b>plastics,</b> PLA, biobased PE, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and biobased epoxy resin are expected to be the major types of biobased <b>plastics</b> in the future...|$|R

5|$|The Jif <b>plastic</b> {{containers}} {{were originally}} made from polythene, and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The <b>plastic</b> containers served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The <b>plastic</b> container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with fresh lemon peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to characterize the chemical and bonding properties of coastal <b>plastics</b> waste. Growing of economic, human activity and industrial procedure are resulting in the increased of the <b>plastics</b> wastes. <b>Plastics</b> waste generates cause major challenge in waste handling because of the varying properties due to degradation. Furthermore, the harmful effect and toxical hazard of <b>plastics</b> is a real threat to the health and environment. In order to study the properties, two method of testing are used. The samples are sorted base on their four types of <b>plastics.</b> The type of <b>plastics</b> that were used in this study was PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride), PS (Polystyrene), PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) and PP (Polypropylene). The samples of <b>plastics</b> that have been sorted then were shred using shredding machine. All the shredded samples were fed into the extrusion machine to get the long-shape of <b>plastics</b> which later pelletized using pelletizing machine. The testing methods involve in this study were TGA (Thermogravimetric) and FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). The result obtained for FTIR analysis shows the different of bonding between coastal and virgin <b>plastics.</b> Other group of homologous series was found in the bonding of coastal <b>plastics</b> waste. The resulted data for TGA analysis show the higher value of thermal degradation for coastal <b>plastics</b> waste compared to virgin <b>plastics.</b> Sample of PVC, PS PET and PP was degrading at temperature of 357. 77 oC, 384. 25 oC, 397. 97 o C and 362. 61 oC which is much higher than the virgin <b>plastics</b> that degrade at temperature of 333 oC, 330 oC, 265 oC and 315 oC. It can be concluded that the coastal <b>plastics</b> waste differ from the virgin <b>plastics</b> in term of bonding and temperature resistant. It is due to the long exposure to the sun and presence of other minerals on coastal <b>plastics</b> waste. This study shows that the coastal <b>plastics</b> waste have an advantages and unique properties compared to the virgin <b>plastics.</b> This study will provide foundation for future research on desirable method to handle the coastal <b>plastics</b> waste. It will enable for greater research and their potential to be used in technologies of <b>plastics</b> recycling...|$|R
