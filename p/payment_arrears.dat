50|$|Before Obasanjo's administration, Nigeria's GDP growth {{had been}} painfully slow since 1987, and only managed 3 per cent between 1999/2000. However, under Obasanjo {{the growth rate}} doubled to 6 per cent until he left office, helped in part by higher oil prices. Nigeria's foreign {{reserves}} rose from $2 billion in 1999 to $43 billion on leaving office in 2007. He was able to secure debt pardons from the Paris and London club amounting to some $18 billion and paid another $18 billion to be debt free. Most of these loans were accumulated from short term trade arrears during the exchange control period. (Point of correction). Most of these loans were accumulated not out of corruption but during a period 1982-1985 when Nigeria operated exchange control regime that vested all foreign exchange transactions on the central bank of Nigeria. The naira exchange rate to the US dollar and other major currencies during this period was highly regulated and artificially high. Nigerian importers paid local currency equivalent to the central bank through their local commercial banks but during the oil glut period of 1982-86 when foreign exchange was scarce the central bank {{did not have enough}} foreign exchange to pay for current imports. This resulted in short term foreign trade <b>payment</b> <b>arrears.</b> Short term trade arrears averaged about US$3.0 billion each year between 1983 and 1986 when the new military government of General Babangida floated the naira and imports were thereafter paid for on a current basis.|$|E

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Minister for Climate and Energy, Paul Magnette, who is also {{responsible}} for Consumer Affairs, the NBB's Microeconomic Analysis Service conducted an investigation into the link between <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> for mobile telephony and arrears on loan repayments. In this inquiry, which was carried out using data drawn from the Preventel records and from the Central Individual Credit Register, the profile of people with arrears for both types of debt was also analysed. The profile analysis shows that defaulters with a Preventel registration form a specific group among CICR defaulters. People with <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> for both types of debt tend to have a demographic and credit profile which to a large extent matches that of CICR defaulters with no mobile phone <b>payment</b> <b>arrears,</b> but a few differences were also found between both groups of defaulters. A number of trends in borrowing and repayment behaviour turn out to be much more pronounced in the first of these two defaulter groups, but it is above all in regard to the age aspect that the differences are most striking. In cases where people have fallen behind in their payments for both types of debt, it actually {{turns out to be a}} younger group. Generally speaking, these borrowers take out their first loan at an earlier age, and they also tend to run up their first arrears when they are younger. The inquiry further revealed that there is a statistically significant link between <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> for mobile telephony and credit arrears, and this applies for various definitions of <b>payment</b> <b>arrears.</b> Repayment problems generally tend to emerge sooner in <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> for mobile telephony bills than in arrears on loans. A simple logistic regression model indicates that dummy variables for a Preventel registration, and for the duration of that registration, still have a definite predictive value with regard to credit arrears, after controlling for a number of demographic and credit variables in the model. As the assessment of the credit risk of private individuals is based on a set of socio-economic variables, <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> for mobile telephony could therefore be a useful complementary variable in that assessment. consumer credit bureau, credits, mobile telephony, <b>payment</b> <b>arrears...</b>|$|E
40|$|As in many countries, the Dutch {{housing market}} was {{severely}} {{hit by the}} recent financial crisis. Following the recession, the average house price in the Netherlands fell by almost 25 % {{and the proportion of}} homeowners with mortgage <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> nearly doubled. In this paper, we study mortgage <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> in the Netherlands and investigate the contribution of the credit crisis {{to the development of the}} current phenomenon of mortgage default. An aggregate distributed-lag model is employed for the period between 2004 and 2013 to assess the influence of various socio-economic factors. The variables considered include: aggregate mortgage debt, mortgage interest rate, unemployment rate and the dissolution of families. The paper concludes that family break-down remains the most important risk factor associated with mortgage default in the Netherlands. The effect of unemployment is generally minor while mortgage interest rates have no statistically significant impact except that they implicitly contribute to the level of mortgage debt. The impact of mortgage debt on <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> is limited because of the unique characteristics of the housing market. OTBArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|E
40|$|A decade {{into the}} transition, many {{successor}} {{states of the}} Former Soviet Union (FSU) continue to use pervasive energy sector quasi-fiscal activities, especially low energy prices and the toleration of <b>payment</b> <b>arrears,</b> to provide large implicit and untargeted subsidies to households and enterprises. These quasi-fiscal activities disguise {{the size of the}} government, cause over-consumption and waste, and contribute to macroeconomic imbalances. Based on two case studies [...] one of an energy-exporting country (Azerbaijan) and one of an energy-importing country (Ukraine) [...] and a survey of other FSU countries, the study finds that energy quasi-fiscal activities have declined in some of the energy-importing countries (e. g., Armenia, Kyrgyz Republic, Ukraine), but risen in energy-rich countries (e. g., Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkmenistan), largely on account of higher international oil prices. We found that energy sector <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> have triggered tax and other <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> by energy companies, and helped to perpetuate a vicious circle involving arrears, offsets, netting operations, and noncash payments. Policy recommendations are straightforward, but politically difficult to implement: increase energy prices and eliminate preferential tariffs or the free provision of services for specific consumer groups, combined with the provision of explicitly budgeted and better targeted cash transfers to needy population groups, and, if necessary, explicit subsidies to enterprises. We also argue that greater efforts are required to capture energy quasi-fiscal activities through improved public data dissemination, fiscal analysis, and measures that promote fiscal transparency and accountability. energy prices, energy sector, fiscal policy, Former Soviet Union transition countries, implicit subsidies, implicit taxes, <b>payment</b> <b>arrears,</b> quasi-fiscal activities,...|$|E

40|$|<b>Payment</b> <b>arrears</b> {{have been}} an endemic {{phenomenon}} throughout Romania's economic transition and {{have been widely used}} as financing for both state-owned and private companies. Political economy considerations and a vertically-integrated industrial structure lay behind the persistence of arrears. Only in recent years the accumulation of new arrears to general government has been significantly reduced, thereby improving fiscal transparency and reducing the hidden subsidies provided to households and companies via the tolerance of unpaid tax and social security obligations. Efforts to step up the restructuring of state-owned enterprises and stricter enforcement of overdue claims lay behind these results. The repeated use of debt cancellation has given rise to adverse incentives and seems to have failed in improving financial discipline. Weak creditor protection and protracted bankruptcy proceedings remain main obstacles to effectively hardening the budget constraint.

40|$|Payment {{problems}} have continually raised grave concerns in construction industries throughout the world. The Chinese construction industry is just recovering, with reported success, from {{an era of}} serious payment problems, manifested in high levels of arrears and prolonged payment delays. It has been seen that payment problems can arise from both contractual conflicts and willful delays. The Chinese government began to intervene in these payment issues during the late 1990 s, both by legislation and direct administrative input. Given {{the characteristics of the}} Chinese construction industry and its special payment problems, the direct administration mode was seen to be effective in reducing existing <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> in mainland China.
