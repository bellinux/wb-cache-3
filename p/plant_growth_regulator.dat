25|$|On the {{molecular}} level, all auxins are compounds with an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group. The most important {{member of the}} auxin family is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which generates the majority of auxin effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native auxin. And as native auxin, its stability is controlled in many ways in plants, from synthesis, through possible conjugation to degradation of its molecules, always {{according to the requirements}} of the situation. However, molecules of IAA are chemically labile in aqueous solution, so it is not used commercially as a <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> <b>regulator.</b>|$|E
500|$|The most {{critical}} factors in flowering and fruit set are physiological, {{having to do}} with the age of the plant and whether it already has developing fruit. The plant hormones ethylene and auxin are key in fruit set and development. Ethylene promotes the production of female flowers. When a plant already has a fruit developing, subsequent female flowers on the plant are less likely to mature, a phenomenon called [...] "first-fruit dominance", and male flowers are more frequent, an effect that appears due to reduced natural ethylene production within the plant stem. Ethephon, a <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> <b>regulator</b> product that is converted to ethylene after metabolism by the plant, can be used to increase fruit and seed production.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to evaluate the effect of <b>plant</b> <b>growth</b> <b>regulators</b> in biomass production and essential oil yield content in lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus (DC.)

The treatments consisted of GA 3 (50 and 100 mg L- 1); Ethrel (100 and 200 mg L- 1); CCC (500 and 1000 mg L- 1); Alar 85 (1000 and 2000 mg L- 1); Accel (20 and 40 mg 0 L- 1) and control.
