25|$|Depending on the parameter, each ANSI test is graded from 0.0 to 4.0 (F to A), {{or given}} a <b>pass</b> <b>or</b> <b>fail</b> mark. Each grade is {{determined}} by analyzing the scan reflectance profile (SRP), an analog graph of a single scan line across the entire symbol. The lowest of the 8 grades is the scan grade, and the overall ISO symbol grade is {{the average of the}} individual scan grades. For most applications a 2.5 (C) is the minimal acceptable symbol grade.|$|E
25|$|Three sets of grades {{exist in}} Swedish {{universities}} and university colleges. Some universities have introduced a seven-grade scale (A-F, Fx), that {{similar to the}} ECTS scale, but with a criterion-referenced grading instead of relative grading. The most common scale is a three-grade scale that consists of U (Underkänd in Swedish, fail), G (Godkänd, pass) and VG (Väl godkänd, pass with distinction). In this set VG is the highest. The other grade set consists of (U, 3, 4, 5) where 5 is the highest. This grade set is normally given in courses within technical professional degrees. Finally there are some courses, within two systems of grading, {{in which you can}} only get G (pass) or U (fail). For instance, for a one semester thesis (specialized level) in Computer Science for a Master's degree at some institutions one can only get the grade G (<b>pass)</b> <b>or</b> <b>fail,</b> while for an equivalent thesis at other institutions one can also receive the grade VG.|$|E
