50|$|The {{goal was}} to {{construct}} a black square made from vitriﬁed nuclear waste that would hold within it a letter that I had written to the future. The process of vitriﬁcation converts radioactive waste from a volatile liquid to a stable, solid mass resembling <b>polished</b> <b>black</b> <b>glass.</b> It {{is considered to be}} one of the safest and most effective methods for the long-term storage and neutralization of radioactive waste.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{instruments}} are commercially available that {{conform to the}} above standards {{in terms of their}} measurement geometry. The instruments are calibrated using reference standards that are usually made from highly <b>polished,</b> plane, <b>black</b> <b>glass</b> with a refractive index of 1.567 for the Sodium D line, and these are assigned a gloss value of 100 for each geometry.|$|R
50|$|The {{measurement}} scale, Gloss Units (GU), of a glossmeter is a scaling {{based on}} a highly <b>polished</b> reference <b>black</b> <b>glass</b> standard with a defined refractive index having a specular reflectance of 100GU at the specified angle.This standard is used to establish an upper point calibration of 100 with the lower end point established at 0 on a perfectly matte surface. This scaling is suitable for most non-metallic coatings and materials (paints and plastics) as they generally fall within this range. For other materials, highly reflective in appearance (mirrors, plated / raw metal components), higher values can be achieved reaching 2000 Gloss Units. For transparent materials, these values can also be increased due to multiple reflections within the material. For these applications {{it is common to}} use % reflection of incident light rather than Gloss Units.|$|R

50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>glass</b> {{is often}} green or brown when {{held up to}} light, {{although}} it appears black to the unaided eye. Weathering and oxidation, together with UV light interacting with metallic oxides and chemicals in the glass and seawater are all factors affecting the color of sea glass over long exposure and time frames. In texture and color <b>black</b> sea <b>glass</b> resembles <b>black</b> beach rock, very much resembling the extrusive igneous rock basalt, or weathered black obsidian, a natural <b>black</b> volcanic <b>glass.</b> Gas bubbles are often trapped in old glass, impurities and irregularities in the original bottles were common and one indicator of age. Early examples were hand blown, later ones utilized a mold. Due to the inherent strength, you'll find larger size pieces of old <b>black</b> <b>glass,</b> including pieces that survived for centuries. Potential age of <b>black</b> beach <b>glass</b> found depends on your search location. Small pieces require a trained eye to spot. Texture is a good tool to employ along with color. <b>Black</b> <b>glass</b> is the rarest of all the sea/beach glasses due to age and difficulty in finding it. Although when you find an old, long used location it can produce {{a considerable amount of}} material.|$|R
