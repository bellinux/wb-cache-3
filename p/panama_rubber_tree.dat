40|$|Phloem turgor {{pressure}} (PTP) is the initial driving force for latex flow after a <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> is tapped and therefore {{plays an important}} role in <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> latex production. Variation in PTP with <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clone, age, yield potential and commonly used Ethrel (an ethylene releaser) stimulation have, however, not been comprehensively studied to date. The aim of this study was to investigate these relations and examine whether PTP can be used as an index for <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clone assessment and tapping system optimization. The results showed that: (1) the daily change of PTP in the foliation season suggests that a high PTP can ensure a high latex yield and tapping could be moved forward to midnight or earlier in the night; (2) the decrease of PTP from the basal to distal stem indicates the benefit of a controlled upward tapping system; (3) the logarithmic increase in PTP with <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> planting age and age-based mean girth suggests that the preferred age for the commencement of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> tapping is eight years; (4) the change of PTP with regenerated bark age suggests that the regenerated bark could be exploited again after the second year; (5) PTP is positively related to the yield potential of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> clones; (6) although Ethrel stimulation could not significantly increase the initial PTP of a <b>rubber</b> <b>tree,</b> it delays the recovery of PTP after tapping. Therefore, PTP is an indicator of <b>rubber</b> <b>tree</b> latex yield and can be used for tapping system optimization. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
