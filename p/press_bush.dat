2500|$|Acting Attorney General Laurence Silberman {{learned of}} the {{existence}} of the Family Jewels, he issued a subpoena for them, prompting eight congressional investigations on the domestic spying activities of the CIA. Bill Colby's short tenure as DCI would end with the Halloween Massacre. His replacement was George H.W. Bush. At the time, the DOD had control of 80% of the intelligence budget. Communication and coordination between the CIA and the DOD would suffer greatly under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The CIA's budget for hiring clandestine officers had been squeezed out by the paramilitary operations in south-east Asia, and hiring was further strained by the government's poor popularity. This left the Agency bloated with middle management, and anemic in younger officers. With employee training taking five years, the Agency's only hope would be on the trickle of new officers coming to fruition years in the future. The CIA would see another setback as communists would take Angola. William J. Casey, a member of Ford's Intelligence Advisory Board, would <b>press</b> <b>Bush</b> to allow a team from outside the CIA to produce Soviet military estimates as a [...] "Team B". Bush gave the OK. The [...] "B" [...] team was composed of hawks. Their estimates were the highest that could be justified, and they painted a picture of a growing Soviet military when the Soviet military was actually shrinking. Many of their reports found their way to the press. As a result of the investigations, Congressional oversight of the CIA eventually evolved into a select intelligence committee in the House, and Senate supervising covert actions authorized by the President.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2012, during oral {{argument}} in a Fifth Circuit case involving the Affordable Health Care Act (ACA), Smith ordered the Department of Justice to provide his panel of three judges with a three-page, single-spaced report explaining President Obama's views on judicial review. Smith's order {{was prompted by}} Obama's recent press conference remarks on a case pending before the Supreme Court in which the Court was considering, among other things, whether to strike down the entire ACA as unconstitutional. Obama had {{said that if the}} Supreme Court overturned the ACA, it would be [...] "an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress," [...] and that a law that was passed by Congress on an economic issue had not been overturned by the court [...] "going back to the ’30s, pre New Deal," [...] remarks that were criticized by many as historically and legally inaccurate. Though Smith's response and order were criticized by some legal scholars and members of the <b>press,</b> <b>Bush</b> administration U.S. Attorney General and former judge Michael Mukasey defended Smith, stating that Obama's remarks had called judicial review [...] "into question," [...] so that [...] "the court has, it seems to me, every obligation to sit up and take notice." [...] U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that the Justice Department would respond [...] "appropriately" [...] to the judge's request and filed a short response, conceding that the federal courts have the power to strike down laws passed by Congress but citing Supreme Court precedent for the proposition that those laws are presumed constitutional and should only be overturned [...] "sparingly".|$|E

Libby resigned on October 28, hours after his indictment by a grand jury on multiple counts of perjury, false statements, and obstruction in this case. In March 2007, Libby was convicted on four counts, and Cheney <b>pressed</b> <b>Bush</b> to pardon Libby.
