5000|$|During 1943, USAAF Training Command {{received}} {{a number of}} complaints about durability issues with the plywood wings of the PT-19 and the PT-23 when exposed to the high heat and/or humidity of training bases located in Texas and Florida. [...] Maintenance officers at the USAAF overhaul depots {{had been forced to}} order replacement of the wooden wing sections after only two to three months' active service because of wood rot and <b>ply</b> <b>separation</b> issues. [...] Subsequent to this incident, the USAAF incorporated a demand for all-metal wing sections on all future fixed-wing training aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Extended tire life: Under {{inflated}} {{tires are}} the #1 cause of tire failure {{and contribute to}} tire disintegration, heat buildup, <b>ply</b> <b>separation</b> and sidewall/casing breakdowns. Further, a difference of [...] in pressure {{on a set of}} duals literally drags the lower pressured tire 2.5 metres per kilometre (13 feet per mile). Moreover, running a tire even briefly on inadequate pressure breaks down the casing and prevents the ability to retread. It {{is important to note that}} not all sudden tire failures are caused by under-inflation. Structural damages caused, for example, by hitting sharp curbs or potholes, can also lead to sudden tire failures, even a certain time after the damaging incident. These cannot be proactively detected by any TPMS.|$|E

Method {{was developed}} for assembling bellows made of four plies of iron/nickel alloy sheets. Method consists of making successive stitch welds with electron beam until weld seam is completely filled in and all plies have been penetrated...|$|E
50|$|Once {{the paper}} plies were {{saturated}} with the gelatinizing zinc chloride, they were pressed together. The pressing allowed intimate contact of the cellulose fibres, thus promoting bonding between the cellulose chains. Once the bonding was established, {{the process of}} leaching out the zinc chloride from the vulcanized fibre could begin. The leaching (removal by diffusion out) of the zinc chloride was accomplished by subjecting the vulcanized fibre to successively less concentrated baths of zinc chloride. The rate at which this could occur was constrained by osmotic forces. If {{the rate at which}} the vulcanized fibre was subjected to lower and lower concentrations of zinc chloride solution were too rapid, the osmotic forces could result in <b>ply</b> <b>separations.</b> The final leaching bath concentration was 0.05% zinc chloride.Thicknesses up to 0.093”, can be made on continuous lines that stretch up to 1,000 feet (305m) in length.|$|R
40|$|Deformation {{mechanisms}} and failure of textile laminates are strongly affected by inter-layer configurations – a mutual {{shift of the}} plies. To model it within a traditional framework, one must construct a representative volume element (RVE), which includes all the plies. This is a time consuming and computationally expensive work. As an alternative, the paper suggests boundary conditions (BC) imitating the interaction with the surrounding non-periodic media. This makes possible analysis on a single unit cell of one ply. The proposed BC respect inter-ply configurations, account {{for the number of}} plies, distinguish the ply position, and reproduce the meso stress state with a good accuracy. The BC are constructed through (1) averaging of the known periodic solutions with respect to the <b>ply</b> shifts, (2) <b>separation</b> of the solution to the outer and inner ply cases, (3) energy equilibrium of heterogeneous and effective media. The unit cell finite element (FE) modelling is validated by reference full scale solution on the entire laminate...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic resin, Amberlite XAD- 4 {{was linked}} covalently {{with the third}} {{generation}} supramolecule, octa- O -methoxy re sorcin [4] arene through - N=N-group to form chelating resin, which has been characterized and effectively used for the separation and preconcentration of metal ions such as Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II). Critical parameters such as pH, flow rate, sorption capacity, breakthrough studies, distribution coefficient, preconcentration factor, concentration of eluting agents responsible for quantitative extraction of metal ions were optimized. The synthesized resin showed good binding affinity towards Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) under selective pH conditions. Good breakthrough capacity and fast exchange kinetics of the resin lead to effective separation of metal ions from their binary and ternary mixture by column method {{on the basis of}} pH and eluting agents. The resin could be reused for about 8 - 10 cycles. The pro posed method having the analytical data with the relative standard deviation (RSD) 2 % and with recoveries of ana lytes higher than 98 %, reflect s upon the reproducibility and reliability of the method which has been successfully ap <b>plied</b> in the <b>separation</b> and determination of Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) ions in synthetic, natural and ground water samples. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{development of}} a Unitary graphite composite instrument boom that incorporates carpenter-tape like hinges for stowage. While light and stiff, graphite composite is not ordinarily {{thought of as a}} flexible material. This design has taken advantage of the stiffness of the composite in tubular geometry, yet leveraged its thin- section behavior to place flexibility at the required locations. Key is the proprietary layup, which results in a tough yet flexible hinge capable of rotating over 90 degrees in each direction. When the boom deploys, there is enough torque to overcome parasitic resistance from harness, etc. It will snap to the fully extended, rigid shape. The design has addressed materials issues such as out-of-plane bending, edge cracking, and interlaminar <b>ply</b> <b>separation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{creaseability}} test {{according to}} DIN 55 437 is - {{on account of}} its standardized visual method - not suitable {{for the evaluation of}} the technical quality of creasings. This was demonstrated in tests with twelve different carton boards. Qualitative indications are given by the force/deformation-diagramm during the erecting. Curves not too flat and not to steep and a hardly perceptible curve bend for the moment of the <b>ply</b> <b>separation</b> indicate a technically satisfactory creasing. Quantitative indications are given by the stiffness ratio. According to the investigations made in the past, it can be expected that MD-creasings with values from 0, 2 to 0, 6 and CD-creasings with values from 0, 1 to 0, 4 meet the technical requirements for the opening of the folding carton during machine-packaging as well as the optical requirements according to DIN 55 437. Definitive details concerning the limiting values in relation to practice can only be obtained by machine tests...|$|E
40|$|Delamination is a {{fundamental}} failure mode of laminated composites. When laminates are subjected to out-of-plane loading, the resin matrices between the plies often fail, resulting in <b>ply</b> <b>separation</b> or delamination failure. Such loading conditions occur in various ways and depend heavily on the load transfer mo~es in the composite structures. Delamination cracks can be visualised in the fracture mechanics sense to grow, and thus can be characterised in Mode I (opening), Mode II (shear) and Mode III (scissoring or anti-plane shear) and their combinations. __The test techniques for delamination in Mode I and Mode II, as well as mixed Mode IIII, have been well established. However, few workers have investigated the Mode III interlaminar fracture properties of composites, {{partly because of the}} experimental difficulties associated with the introduction of pure Mode III loading to the delamination crack. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the Mode III interlaminar fracture properties of composite materials based on both thermoplastic and thermosetting matrices, adhesive joints and bi-material samples. For this reason, both numerical and experimental methods were used. The Edge Crack Torsion (ECT) test geometry was employed in order to evaluate the Mode III response of the samples studied, as it is commonly accepted that this is the most effective technique for cllaracterising this mode of delamination. The Virtual Crack Closure Integral has also been extensively used to characterise the loading conditions at the crack tip in these samples. Once the quasi-static response of the composites were analysed, dynamic tests were undertaken to investigate the rate-sensitive behaviour of these high-performance materials. Finally, the Mode III geometry was modified to look at possible mixed-mode failure involving Mode II contributions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
