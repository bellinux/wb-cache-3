I have written six more {{chapters}} of the book, all good I potently believe, and given up, as a deception of the devil's, the High Woods. I have been once down to Apia, to a huge native feast at Seumanutafa's, the chief of Apia. There was a vast mass of food, crowds of people, the police charging among them with whips, the whole in high good humour on both sides; infinite noise; and a historic event - Mr. Clarke, the missionary, and his wife, assisted at a native dance. On my return from this function, I found work had stopped; no more South Seas in my belly. Well, Henry had cleared a great deal of our bush on a contract, and it ought to be measured. I set myself to the task with a tape-line; it seemed a dreary business; then I borrowed a <b>prismatic</b> <b>compass,</b> and tackled the task afresh. I have no books; I had not touched an instrument nor given a thought to the business since the year of grace 1871; you can imagine with what interest I sat down yesterday afternoon to reduce my observations; five triangles I had taken; all five came right, to my ineffable joy. Our dinner - the lowest we have ever been - consisted of ONE AVOCADO PEAR between Fanny and me, a ship's biscuit for the guidman, white bread for the Missis, and red wine for the twa.

Most of these compasses are designed for heavy-duty use, with high-quality needles and jeweled bearings, and many are fitted for tripod mounting for additional accuracy.|$|R

50|$|A <b>prismatic</b> <b>compass</b> is a {{navigation}} and surveying instrument which is extensively {{used to find}} out the bearing of the traversing and included angles between them, waypoints (an endpoint of the lcourse) and direction. Compass surveying is a type of surveying in which the directions of surveying lines are determined with a magnetic compass, and the length of the surveying lines are measured with a tape or chain or laser range finder. The compass is generally used to run a traverse line. The compass calculates bearings of lines with respect to magnetic north. The included angles can then be calculated using suitable formulas in case of clockwise and anti-clockwise traverse respectively. For each survey line in the traverse, surveyors take two bearings that is fore bearing and back bearing which should exactly differ by 180° if local attraction is negligible. The name <b>Prismatic</b> <b>compass</b> is given to it because it essentially consists of a prism which is used for taking observations more accurately.|$|E
50|$|Cadets {{are taught}} {{navigation}}al skills {{in line with}} the Australian Army's navigation training for all ranks. There is an emphasis on military equipment and maps. Consequently, cadets are taught to use the standard issue service <b>prismatic</b> <b>compass</b> along with the lightweight compass, protractor and standard issue service topographical survey maps. Some units incorporate orienteering and rogaining into their programs, however the TMP does not include, nor suggest this.|$|E
50|$|As in all {{mountains}} care {{is needed}} {{when the weather}} is poor, when visibility falls due to mist, fog or driving rain and snow. Navigation can become difficult when landmarks disappear, and especially dangerous when walking {{along the edge of the}} escarpment. A <b>prismatic</b> <b>compass</b> and local map are essential companions to aid route finding. There are relatively few walkers on the Black Mountain, even {{when the weather is}} good and clear, so the walker must rely on his or her own resources to complete a circuit.|$|E
50|$|A {{much simpler}} sun compass, {{developed}} by Lt-Col. James Allason, a mechanised cavalry officer, {{was adopted by}} the British Army in India in 1938, following distortion in the magnetic field experienced when the standard issue <b>prismatic</b> <b>compass</b> was used in or near tanks and other armored vehicles. Cloudy European skies prevented its adoption in European theaters during World War II although it became standard for the Long Range Desert Group operating in the North African desert.

50|$|A {{sun compass}} uses the {{position}} of the Sun in the sky to determine the directions of the cardinal points, making allowance for the local latitude and longitude, time of day, equation of time, and so on. At fairly high latitudes, an analog-display watch {{can be used as a}} very approximate sun compass. A simple sundial can be used as a much better one. An automatic sun compass developed by Lt. Col. James Allason, a mechanised cavalry officer, was adopted by the British Army in India in 1938 for use in tanks and other armoured vehicles where the magnetic field was subject to distortion, affecting the standard issue <b>prismatic</b> <b>compass.</b> Cloudy skies prohibited its use in European theatres.

5000|$|A {{bearing compass}} is a {{magnetic}} compass mounted {{in such a way}} that it allows the taking of bearings of objects by aligning them with the lubber line of the bearing compass. A surveyor's compass is a specialized compass made to accurately measure heading of landmarks and measure horizontal angles to help with map making. These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 Cyclopaedia. The bearing compass was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand. In 1885, a patent was granted for a hand compass fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the <b>prismatic</b> <b>compass.</b> [...] Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror. First patented in 1902, the Bézard compass consisted of a field compass with a mirror mounted above it. [...] This arrangement enabled the user to align the compass with an objective while simultaneously viewing its bearing in the mirror.|$|E

40|$|The Lower Dwyka Shales in South Africa oocur {{south of}} {{latitude}} 32 ⁰; resting conformably upon the Witteberg quartzites, which extend as coastal mountain rangee {{along the length}} of the South Coast. The shales, being less resistant to weathering than the quartzites below, and the Dwyka Tillite immediately above, are consequently found in valleys between these two formations. In one of these valleys Grahamstown is situated; where the Lower Dwyka Shales have been eroded by the various rivulets forming the eource of the Blaauwkrantz River. A geological map of the country round Grahamstown was prepared in eome detail, showing all the various rock formations occurring in the area, the full extent of the Lower Dwyka Shales being mapped with the Dwyka Tillite and the Witteberg Quartzite along its margins.

40|$|A most {{important}} and extremely interesting discovery of glaciation was made by Mr. E. J. Dunn, F. G. S., of Victoria, {{in the first week}} of October, 1892, on the high plateau in the vicinity of Lake Dora, Tasmania. Having been with Mr. Dunn at the time of his discovery, and as it was his intention to write on the subject, I now wish to record in the proceedings of our Royal Society the result of a more extended search made by me on the high peaks and surrounding tableland, and illustrate the {{most important}} features of the glacial action on the accompanying sketch map compiled from <b>prismatic</b> <b>compass</b> bearings. The Tyndall Range and Mount Sedgwick have been the principal seats of the prehistoric glaciers; respectively these mountains are about thirteen (13) and nineteen (19) miles in a direct line from the town of Zeehan, and twenty-two (22) and nineteen (19) miles from the port of Strahan. They rise 1, 500 ft. to 1, 600 ft. above an elevated plateau, on which are situated Lake Dora and numerous other lakes and tarns at an altitude of 2, 400 ft. above the sea level. Includes supplenentary notes. Thomas Bather Moore, (1851 – 1919), foremost of the west coast prospectors and track-makers, was widely respected for his skills, endurance and knowledge of the country. A self-taught naturalist, Moore studied the standard texts of his day and was a close observer of his surroundings. He contributed papers on geology and glaciation to Royal and Geographical Societies, and collected botanical and geological specimens for Baron von Mueller, Leonard Rodway and Robert Johnston...|$|E
