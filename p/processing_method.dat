25|$|The {{most common}} {{ethylene}} oxide <b>processing</b> <b>method</b> is {{the gas chamber}} method. To benefit from economies of scale, ethylene oxide has traditionally been delivered by filling a large chamber {{with a combination of}} gaseous ethylene oxide either as pure ethylene oxide, or with other gases used as diluents (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), or carbon dioxide).|$|E
25|$|Further to {{what has}} been {{mentioned}} it should be stressed that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all things in life, there will come a time when a pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different <b>processing</b> <b>method</b> used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each age will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to know when they peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.|$|E

40|$|In {{collaboration}} with Shell and Agip oil companies, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture {{carried out a}} training campaign on the <b>methods</b> of <b>processing</b> cooking bananas (i/lusa ssp., ABB genome) among farmers in Southeast Nigeria. This study examined the factors that have influenced {{the spread of the}} processing knowledge from farmers who were initially trained by the institutions. Data were collected from a random sample of 232 respondents using structured questionnaire. Results show that about 47 % of farmers who initially received training from institutions on cooking banana <b>processing</b> <b>methods</b> have taught an average of 3 <b>processing</b> <b>methods</b> to about 5 other people. This diffusion level is considered encouraging realising that the crop was entirely new to the people. Among the variables that were significant in shaping the decisions of the respondents regarding spread or non-spread of the <b>processing</b> <b>methods</b> are the level of educational attainment, primary occupation, social status, intensity of training received on cooking banana <b>processing</b> <b>methods,</b> and the degree of adoption ofthe <b>processing</b> <b>methods...</b>|$|R
25|$|Processing {{of coffee}} in India is {{accomplished}} using two methods, dry processing and wet processing. Dry processing is the traditional method of drying in the sun which is favoured for its flavour producing characteristics. In the wet <b>processing</b> <b>method,</b> coffee beans are fermented and washed, which is the preferred method for improved yields. As to the wet processing, the beans are subject to cleaning to segregate defective seeds. The beans of different varieties and sizes are then blended to derive the best flavour. The next procedure is to roast either through roasters or individual roasters. Then the roasted coffee is ground to appropriate sizes.|$|E
500|$|The ancient Chinese society first {{encountered}} the tea plant {{in what is}} now southern China and processed it as another medicinal herb for use in Chinese herbology. The processing technique used to process fresh tea leaves was to immediately steam the fresh tea leaves and dry them for preservation, which is likely the most ancient Chinese form of tea leaf processing. This <b>processing</b> <b>method</b> was perfected {{near the end of the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) and produced a dried tea that would be classified today as [...] "green tea" [...] and quite similar to modern Japanese sencha. For consumption, dried tea leaves were either decocted with water around with other herbs, or ground into a powder to be taken straight, or in a liquid in the manner of matcha.|$|E
