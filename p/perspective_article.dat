2500|$|In April 2012 PLOS Medicine {{published}} an article by three researchers {{who were involved in}} ongoing updates of a Cochrane Collaboration review of neuraminidase inhibitors for treating influenza, describing their experience of trying to gain access to clinical study reports for the antiviral Tamiflu (oseltamivir) from the drug's manufacturer Roche. The article outlined the need for access to all clinical trial data held by pharmaceutical companies and regulators, and detailed reasons given by Roche for not sharing data on Tamiflu. In a commissioned <b>perspective</b> <b>article</b> published in the same issue of PLOS Medicine, regulators from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other national regulatory bodies outlined a shift in their stance on access to clinical trial data but also highlighted challenges that would need to be overcome. The regulators noted, [...] "e consider it neither desirable nor realistic {{to maintain the status quo}} of limited availability of regulatory trials data" [...] and concluded, [...] "e welcome debate on these issues, and remain confident that satisfactory solutions can be found to make complete trial data available in a way that will be in the best interest of public health". The article marked a move towards the proactive disclosure of clinical trial data and led to the EMA holding a workshop to establish how this could be done. At the workshop Guido Rasi, the EMA’s Executive Director, announced [...] "oday represents the first step in delivering our vision. We are not here to decide if we will publish clinical-trial data, only how. We need to do this in order to rebuild trust and confidence in the whole system". PLOS Medicines chief editor, Virginia Barbour, was an invited speaker at the workshop representing the media.|$|E

5000|$|The film law rephrased the {{censorship}} {{requirement in}} June 2015. To control the rating system requirement from a legislative <b>perspective,</b> <b>article</b> 9 {{of the new}} Motion Picture Act (t=電影法-中華民國104年), promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, maintains that motion pictures and their advertisements shall not be screened if not granted a rating by the central competent authority which shall convene a rating commission to rate films. Members of the commission shall be representatives of government agencies, and scholars and experts having academic or practical experience in related fields. The commission’s conclusions shall be made public and clear rationales for ratings given be listed. Article 10 maintains if motion pictures and their advertisements violate restrictions or prohibitions laid out in law, the central competent authority shall not grant a rating. The Ministry of Culture established by the Executive Yuan further specifies that not more than {{one third of the}} committee members can come from the Bureau of Audiovisual and Music Industry Development.|$|E
5000|$|Fontana {{is also an}} environmentalist. In 2013, {{he wrote}} with Daniel Kammen and Vincenzo Atella a <b>perspective</b> <b>article</b> on the {{beneficial}} role of efficient use of energy and food in promoting human, environmental, and planetary health, and sustainable economic development. Fontana and colleagues {{believe that it is}} possible to [...] "substantially enhance human and environmental health, societal wealth and well-being, but this requires a profound transformation in the way we live, and a new environment-centered industrial and economic system". They argue that most of the knowledge and technology to transform the world and begin a new industrial revolution already exist today. We only need to relinquish the idea of [...] "producing more energy, food, and other products at lower cost in favor of a new paradigm that opts for less but high-quality energy, food and materials for a healthier life and environment". Fontana thinks that it is essential to educate people and the next generation of health professionals about the importance of [...] "reducing calorie intake by increasing the consumption of a variety of minimally processed plant foods and by significantly reducing the intake of animal source foods"; interventions that will result in [...] "a significant increase in healthspan and reduction of health care costs, environmental pollution, soil erosion, water pollution and shortage, CO2 production and global warming". Fontana, Atella & Kammen also claim that “both individual and societal wealth, happiness, and well-being do not depend merely on the acquisition of material goods and on economic growth, but are powered by our physical and psychological health, the quality of life and the richness of our social relationships, and foremost by the health of the environment that supports all life on earth, our Natural Capital that must be preserved”.|$|E

40|$|In an {{accompanying}} <b>Perspectives</b> <b>article,</b> Cryer (1) identifies {{a number of}} different areas where thera-peutic interventions have the potential to reducehypoglycemia without compromising glycemic con-trol. Some approaches provide well-defined clinical bene-fits, a few offer dramatic reductions in hypoglycemia but remain out of reach for most people, and others, although promising, have yet to be properly evaluated (Table 1). In this <b>Perspectives</b> <b>article,</b> I examine the evidence that underpins these interventions. It {{is beyond the scope of}} this article to review the data for each potential interven-tion in detail, but the reader is directed to the source where appropriate.
