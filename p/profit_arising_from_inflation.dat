40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new theory}} of seigniorage suited to modern economies {{where the majority of}} money is created not by the state or central bank but by commercial banks and other monetary financial institutions via their lending activity. We identify four different forms of seigniorage that take account of the modern institutional separation between the state, the central bank, commercial banks and the non-bank private sector in terms of their identities as ‘money creators’ and ‘money users’. The new typology differentiates between seigniorage <b>profits</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> interest rate spreads on stocks of created money and <b>profits</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> flows of interest payments on newly created assets. We illustrate our theoretical framework with empirical data on commercial bank seigniorage and related variables in the United Kingdom and the Denmark over the past quarter century...|$|R
