25|$|There are a {{few simple}} {{measures}} to protect people in the OR from scatter radiation, thus lower their dose. Awareness is one critical issue, otherwise the available protection tools might be neglected. Among these tools is protective clothing {{in the form of}} a protective apron for the trunk, a protective thyroid shield around the neck and <b>protective</b> <b>glasses.</b> The later may be replaced by a ceiling-suspended lead glass panel. Additional lead curtains can be installed at the table side to protect the lower body region. Even more restrictive rules apply to pregnant staff members.|$|E

50|$|Producing {{laser beams}} that are visible in normal air {{requires}} a relatively powerful laser, at least 20 mW, {{depending on the}} laser type and instrument design. However, it takes a considerably more powerful laser to yield visually spectacular results, generally 500 mW or more. In any case, class IIIb or IV lasers are usually necessary, introducing a significant risk of skin and eye damage unless the player wears gloves and <b>protective</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|E

For example, P. chrysogenum, P. steckii, P. notatum, P. cyclopium, and P. nalgiovensis affect fuels; P. chrysogenum, P. rubrum, and P. verrucosum cause damage to oils and lubricants; P. regulosum damages optical and <b>protective</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} the design, fabrication and performance {{analysis of a}} cover slide monitoring system for an active-fibre laser cladding head. The cover slide prevents contamination of the optical chain by the process powder. The possibility of monitoring the life of this component in real time is important in gaining information regarding failure and degradation state. Cover slide monitoring was achieved using two approaches: one based on the measurement of reflectivity and the other based on that of temperature. In this way light scattered from the <b>protective</b> <b>glass</b> and {{the temperature of the}} <b>protective</b> <b>glass</b> holder were acquired. The developed monitoring device is compact and able to detect both small (cracks, for example) and large defects (opacity, for example) {{on the surface of the}} protective slide. The performance of the monitoring system was validated by conducting several case studies that reproduced normal industrial practices in the laser cladding field...|$|R

5000|$|Glassblower's {{cataracts}} are {{a form of}} cataract. They {{are formed}} by many years or decades of exposure to infrared radiation while workingin the occupation of glass blowing, or working close to hot or molten metals such with [...] metal foundry workers or [...] blacksmiths. Glassblower's cataracts are due to chronic exposure to infrared radiation emitted due to heating of glass or molten metal. The infrared radiation is absorbed by the [...] iris and [...] lens of the eye. This causes cataracts after decades of exposure. This condition may be prevented by wearing <b>protective</b> <b>glasses</b> while practicing these occupations.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} [...] frescoes, {{dating to the}} late 13th century, survive on the southwestern wall of the church, and can be seen behind a <b>protective</b> <b>glass.</b> Fourteen of them form a cycle narrating the life and martyrdom of Saint Euphemia, while another fresco depicts the martyrdom of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste, a theme unique among the churches of the capital.|$|R
