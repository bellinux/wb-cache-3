500|$|By 2:30pm the {{shooting}} {{from the house}} had ceased. One of the detectives present walked close {{to the wall and}} <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open, before retreating. Other police officers, and some of the soldiers, came out and waited for the men to exit. None did, and as part of the roof collapsed, it was clear to onlookers that the men were both dead; the fire brigade was allowed to start extinguishing the fire. At 2:40 Churchill left the scene, at about the time the Royal Horse Artillery arrived with two 13-pounder field artillery pieces. When the firemen entered the property to douse the flames, they soon located Sokoloff's body, which was extracted. A wall collapsed on a group of five [...] firemen, who were all taken to the London Hospital. One of the men, Superintendent Charles Pearson, had a fractured spine; he died six months after the siege {{as a result of his}} injuries. After shoring up the building, the firemen resumed their search of the premises. At around 6:30pm the second body—that of Svaars—was found; it was taken to the mortuary.|$|E
