We assume that the transmit antennas at each BS are correlated and propose a decentralized solution to compute an approximation of the optimal beamforming vectors. The analysis is conducted in the asymptotic regime in which N and K grow large with a given ratio K/N. In particular, the proposed solution relies on the exchange of intercell interference terms whose large system approximations are computed at each BS using knowledge of local transmit correlation matrices and non-local <b>pathlosses.</b> Numerical results are {{used to evaluate the}} performance loss of the proposed solution compared to the optimal one and to investigate its accuracy in system of finite size...|$|R

We study the max-min fairness (MMF) problem, where channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter {{is used to}} design precoding vectors that maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) of the system, given fixed power budgets for uplink training and downlink transmission. Our system model accounts for channel estimation, pilot contamination, arbitrary <b>pathlosses,</b> and multi-group multicasting. We consider six scenarios with different transmission technologies (unicast and multicast), different pilot assignment strategies (dedicated or shared pilot assignments), and different precoding schemes (maximum ratio transmission and zero forcing), and derive achievable spectral efficiencies for all possible combinations. Then we solve the MMF problem {{for each of these}} scenarios and for any given pilot length we find the SE maximizing uplink pilot and downlink data transmission policies, all in closed-forms. We use these results to draw a general guideline for massive MIMO multicasting design, where for a given number of base station antennas, number of users, and coherence interval length, we determine the multicasting scheme that shall be used...|$|R
50|$|Link adaptation, or {{adaptive}} coding and modulation (ACM), {{is a term}} used in wireless communications to denote the matching of the modulation, coding and other signal and protocol parameters to the conditions on the radio link (e.g. the <b>pathloss,</b> the interference due to signals coming from other transmitters, {{the sensitivity of the}} receiver, the available transmitter power margin, etc.). For example, WiMAX uses a rate adaptation algorithm that adapts the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) according {{to the quality of the}} radio channel, and thus the bit rate and robustness of data transmission. The process of link adaptation is a dynamic one and the signal and protocol parameters change as the radio link conditions change—for example in High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) this can take place every 2 ms.|$|E

To assess this, we selected four scenarios with no people, 5, 10, and 20 people in the room. We created two regions in the room, one near two side walls and the other in the center aisle. In each scenario, we measured the channel at 24 receiving points from a fixed transmitting point in the room. At each receiving point, the receiver was moved around to 9 local positions to obtain a local average. In this paper, the considered UWB channel parameters are a frequency-independent <b>pathloss</b> model and a frequency-dependent <b>pathloss</b> model. We find that the <b>pathloss</b> exponent for the region of the center aisle decreases as more people are in the room, while the <b>pathloss</b> exponent for the region near the side walls increases when there are more people in the room.
