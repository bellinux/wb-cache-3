The VT101 {{was essentially}} a base-model VT100, while the VT102 came standard with the AVO and serial printer <b>port</b> <b>options</b> pre-installed. The VT105 contained a simple graphics subsystem known as waveform graphics which was mostly compatible with same system in the earlier VT55. This system allowed two mathematical functions to be drawn to the screen {{on top of the}} normal text display, allowing text and graphics to be mixed to produce charts and similar output. The VT125 added an implementation of the byte-efficient Remote Graphic Instruction Set, ReGIS, which used custom ANSI codes to send the graphics commands to the terminal, rather than requiring the terminal to be set to a separate graphics mode like the VT105.|$|R

5000|$|In {{competition}} with the proposed port, the majority of existing east coast ports are now investing in dredging and expansion projects to attract the larger post-Panamax vessels. In February 2011, Alberto Aleman, the CEO of the Panama Canal, {{addressed the issue of}} expanding capacity on the east coast [...] "Two deeper, wider ports along the US Eastern seaboard and one in the Gulf coast should be enough to handle the growth in traffic, instead of the approximately 13 port expansions now underway. The East Coast has many ports, and the large container ships are not going to stop at every port." [...] Given a future environment of such excess capacity where the new post-Panamax vessels can find existing east coast ports competing with each other for business, {{it is likely that the}} proposed Southport site would have been in a difficult competitive position. North Carolina manufacturers have a number of existing cost-competitive overseas shipping <b>port</b> <b>options</b> to keep them competitive with other east coast manufacturers without a taxpayer-subsidized port in Southport.|$|R

5000|$|While the DisplayPort {{specification}} {{can support}} digital audio, the older 2009 line of MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and Mac Minis cannot provide an audio signal through the Mini DisplayPort, and {{only do so}} over USB, Firewire, or the audio line out port.

This {{can be a problem}} for users who want to connect their computers to HDTVs using a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. To work around this issue, some third-party manufacturers have created dual or triple-headed adapters that get power for the adapter from a USB port, video from the Mini DisplayPort, and audio from either the USB port or the optical-out <b>port.</b> Either <b>option</b> terminates with a single female HDMI connector, thus allowing both video and audio to be channeled over the single HDMI cable.|$|R

40|$|Port {{planning}} {{should take}} into account the following elements: port development strategy; the relationship between port and city; port financing; the key financial players; economic impacts, both local and national; and environmental impacts. The master plan usually sets out a 10 -year <b>port</b> development <b>option,</b> where many different interests come into play, and it requires an agreed course of action. This paper examines the challenges that a port faces in achieving its primary objectives as outlined in its master plan. Namely, economic expansion; employment; the strengthening of the maritime industry; the creation of value-added services – benefiting city and port alike; the provision and upgrading of infrastructure; and the development of an efficient management strategy. In what direction are we moving in terms of port planning models? This article is designed to stimulate a debate that may provide some of the answers for the future, where each individual port can tailor its own solution.

30|$|The {{value of}} {{connectivity}} is straightforward for scheduled maritime services (shipping services operated {{according to a}} schedule). The higher the connectivity of a <b>port,</b> the more <b>options</b> for shippers and consignees to receive and send goods to/from overseas destinations. For unscheduled services (often termed tramp shipping, most bulk flows are unscheduled), the value of connectivity is not straightforward; shippers generally have large volumes and charter and fill complete ships and thus do not depend on pre-determined routes and networks. While most liquid and dry bulk flows are not scheduled, most general cargo flows rely on the scheduled networks of container and Roll-on Roll-off (RoRo) shipping companies.|$|R
50|$|The TURBOchannel bus uses a 32-bit {{data and}} address {{multiplexed}} bus for transferring data and addresses. Every TURBOchannel option slot {{has its own}} set of seven point-to-point control lines and five lines for universal control and arbitration. The point-to-point control lines are connected directly to the TURBOchannel interface. The TURBOchannel interface was not defined in the TURBOchannel specification, although Digital introduced three possible schemes and an example ASIC. The three possible schemes were divided into a low-cost, a mid-range and high performance system implementations. The system can either time-multiplex multiple option slots in order to use a single memory port to share its bandwidth or dedicate a memory <b>port</b> to each <b>option</b> slot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} surgical {{approach to}} a mitral valve repair is a full or partial sternotomy, in which the surgeon cuts through the breastbone {{at the center of}} the chest to access the heart. There are minimally invasive (<b>port</b> access) <b>options</b> available pioneered by Hugo Vanerman in Belgium. The minimally invasive approach does not involve cutting the breastbone, but instead uses multiple incisions in the side of the chest and the leg. Cardiac surgeons are not unanimous about the relative merits of sternotomy versus the minimally invasive approach. The minimally invasive approach can produce a less prominent scar, is beneficial for very obese patients, and may allow the patient to return to their normal activity sooner than a sternotomy. But some cardiac surgeons argue that unless performed by the most experienced cardiac centers, minimally invasive surgery can involve a longer time on a bypass machine, a lower repair rate, and higher (although still low) risk of stroke. One cardiac surgery professor said, [...] "I think the only benefit is for cosmesis for the patient and the benefit is for marketing and growing our practices for ourselves because it’s a good way to grow one's practice." ...|$|R
50|$|DECserver 500/550The DECserver 500 series server was an Ethernet Communications Server for Ethernet Local Area Networks (LANs), {{configurable}} {{to provide}} 128 EIA-423-A or 64 RS-232 asynchronous port connections to DEC asynchronous terminals. Both RS-232, via the 8 port CXY08 Q-Bus communication option card, and EIA-423-A, via the 16 <b>port</b> CXA16 communication <b>option</b> card and EIA-422 16 <b>port</b> CXB16 communication <b>option</b> card could be mixed together in any combination {{from two to}} eight cards in one server. The DECserver 510 and 550 would also support CXM04 IBM 3270 Terminal option cards, but on VMS only. The DECserver 500 series server provided a convenient method to connect logically up to 128 Digital asynchronous terminals {{to one or more}} service nodes (hosts) on an Ethernet. The DECserver 500 series server also allowed for ULTRIX host-initiated connections to asynchronous printers. The DECserver 500 series server implemented the LAT protocol for communication with service nodes that implemented this protocol on the same Ethernet. The 500 series differed from other DECservers in that the configuration was not stored in nonvolatile storage locally on the server itself, but rather downline loaded from a file on a MOP host. Configuration changes which needed to remain permanently had to be changed locally on the DECserver and also updated on the MOP host using the OpenVMS Terminal Server Configurator utility (SYS$COMMON:DECSERVERDS5CFG on VMS or /usr/lib/dnet/tsc on Ultrix) so that it would return the next reboot. The 500 and 550 models are based on the PDP-11/53 chipset with 512kb or 1.5mb of on-board ram and can be reverted to a full PDP-11/53 system with a PROM swap and console port re-wire.|$|R
40|$|Modular space {{exploration}} {{systems have been}} built in the past and they exist today. Most of these systems, starting with Apollo and Soyuz, assign high level functions to var-ious physical spacecraft modules and assemble these in a linear stack. The predominant building block for such systems is the cylinder. Unfortunately, this configuration is inflexi-ble and does not promote reuse of modules over a broad range of missions. We argue that future {{space exploration}} systems should be reconfigurable and therefore require additional docking <b>ports,</b> reconfiguration <b>options</b> and improved structural and volumetric efficiency. A survey of the modular spacecraft literature and our own analysis reveal that the trun-cated octahedron emerges as the most promising polyhedron-based spacecraft geometry for future application to space exploration. This argument is supported by comparison of various spacecraft geometries with four metrics: volumetric efficiency, launch stowage and packing efficiency, reconfigurability, and stability. In addition, extensible spacecraft design is enabled by this design concept. This is shown in a preliminary design of manned exploration vehicles based on the truncated octahedron concept in which a mass penalty in designing a modular version of a Mars transfer and surface habitat vehicle compared to a “point design, ” linear stack concept, was found to be approximately 25 %...|$|R
