40|$|Twenty-three {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} duodenal ulceration complicated by pyloric stenosis who {{came under the}} care of one surgeon were treated by highly selective vagotomy (HSV) combined with digital dilatation of the stenosis through a gastrotomy. No form of drainage procedure was used. Thus the antral "mill" and the pyloric sphineter were left intact. Since the stenosis is usually distal to the pylorus rather than truly pyloric such dilatation does not damage the pyloric ring, although it may on occasion lead to perforation of {{the first part of the}} duodenum. The subsequent progress of these patients was compared with that of a similar, consecutive series of 23 patients with pyloric stenosis who were treated by truncal vagotomy with a drainage procedure by other surgeons on the same surgical unit. Patients were followed up for between four months and five years. The clinical assessment was carried out in "blind" fashion at a special gastric follow-up clinic. No evidence of recurrent ulceration was found in either group of patients. Two patients from each group subsequently came to reoperation for the relief of gastric stasis. Twenty-two of the 23 patients (96 %) who had undergone HSV plus dilatation eventually achieved a good-to-excellent clinical result (Visick grades 1 + 2), wheras only 17 of the 23 patients (74 %) who had undergone truncal vagotomy with drainage achieved such a result. The main clinical difference between the two groups was that side effects such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain or discomfort were more common after vagotomy with drainage than after HSV. These results bear witness to the remarkable <b>propulsive</b> <b>powers</b> of the gastric antrum after HSV, which were evidently sufficient to overcome any tendency to re-stenosis in more than 90 % of patients. The 9 % incidence of failure due to re-stenosis could perhaps be avoided if a small duodenoplasty were performed instead of simple digital dilatation. The results support the hypothesis that damage to the antral mill and pyloric sphincter can be avoided in the course of operations for "pyloric" stenosis secondary to duodenal ulceration. Avoidance of the drainage procedure is of benefit to the patient, just as it is in patients who have duodenal ulceration without stenosis...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{physical}} rehabilitation {{of individuals with}} lower limb loss has traditionally been guided by a device driven paradigm, with much less attention, if any, allocated to {{the manner in which}} established motor learning strategies may be used to learn prosthetic locomotor skills. Much of this gap is attributable {{to the fact that the}} efficacy of most motor learning strategies has been derived from constrained upper extremity motor skills. Motor learning strategies that increase practice difficulty and the size of movement errors are thought to facilitate motor learning. In contrast to this, gradual training minimizes movement errors and reduces practice difficulty by incrementally introducing task requirements, yet remains as effective as sudden training and its large movement errors for learning novel reaching tasks. While attractive as a locomotor rehabilitation strategy, it remains unknown whether the efficacy of gradual training extends to learning locomotor tasks and their unique functional requirements. Therefore, a series of experiments were designed to examine whether gradual versus sudden training influenced the acquisition of task specific dynamics, the maintenance of lateral balance control and the cognitive demand required among unimpaired adults during training as well as 24 hour retention and transfer performance of a novel locomotor task, asymmetric split belt treadmill walking. The potential clinical application of this work was then examined by studying the ability of individuals with transtibial limb loss to use a novel powered prosthetic foot based upon either a gradual or sudden restoration of <b>propulsive</b> ankle <b>power.</b> Despite more specific and difficult practice for the sudden cohort, gradual training preserved motor learning of the novel locomotor task, reduced the challenge to lateral balance control and altered the whole-body kinematic strategy selected to regulate lateral balance while reducing the cognitive demand required during training. This suggests that large movement errors and increased practice difficulty may not be necessary for learning locomotor tasks, and that gradual training may present a viable locomotor rehabilitation strategy. Indeed, among a small cohort of individuals with unilateral transtibial limb loss, a gradual restoration of <b>propulsive</b> ankle <b>power</b> was found to promote more consistent elicitation of prosthetic peak ankle power...|$|R

INTRODUCTION: Swimming speed depends on the interaction of propulsive and resistive forces (Takagi and Sanders, 2000). The swimmers can increase their speed by increasing the propulsive forces or reducing the resistive forces that retard the body at a given velocity.

Objective: To compare upper-limb joint power magnitude and distribution between the shoulder, elbow, and wrist during maximal acceleration (MAC) versus steady-state, self-selected speed (SSS) manual wheelchair propulsion. Design: Cross-sectional biomechanic study. Setting: Research university and teaching hospital. Participants: Volunteer sample of 13 manual wheelchair users with {{spinal cord injury}} below T 1. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: <b>Propulsive</b> joint <b>power</b> magnitude and fractional distribution among upper-limb joints. Results: Wilcoxon signed-rank testing revealed shoulder power was larger for MAC versus SSS (median peak, 101. 5 W; interquartile range [IQR], 74. 6; median peak, 37. 7 W; IQR, 22. 9; respectively) (P <. 01). Elbow and wrist power were unchanged. Peak shoulder power fraction was larger for MAC versus SSS (median peak, 1. 055; IQR,. 110 vs peak,. 870; IQR,. 252) (P <. 01). Peak elbow power fraction was smaller for MAC versus SSS (median peak, -. 012; IQR,. 144 vs peak,. 146; IQR,. 206) (P <. 05).

Peak shoulder joint power and power fraction was larger during MAC versus SSS propulsion. Elbow and wrist power fractions were smaller for MAC versus SSS propulsion.

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{signals from}} {{turbulence}} and waves may provide marine invertebrate larvae with behavioral cues {{that affect the}} pathways and energetic costs of larval delivery to adult habitats. Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) live in sheltered estuaries with strong turbulence and small waves, but their larvae can be transported into coastal waters with large waves. These contrasting environments have different ranges of hydrodynamic signals, because turbulence generally produces higher spatial velocity gradients, whereas waves can produce higher temporal velocity gradients. To understand how physical processes affect oyster larval behavior, transport, and energetics, we exposed larvae to different combinations of turbulence and waves in flow tanks with 1) wavy turbulence, 2) a seiche, and 3) rectilinear accelerations. We quantified behavioral responses of individual larvae to local instantaneous flows using two-phase, infrared particle-image velocimetry. Both high dissipation rates and high wave-generated accelerations induced most larvae to swim faster upward. High dissipation rates also induced some rapid, active dives, whereas high accelerations induced only weak active dives. In both turbulence and waves, faster swimming and active diving were achieved through an increase in <b>propulsive</b> force and <b>power</b> output that would carry a high energetic cost.
