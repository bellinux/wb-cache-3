Gordon was quoted as saying that he wanted to test local interest in his Big Show tours in Newcastle, that if it was successful, he would charter another special train from the upcoming Nat King Cole tour, and that he would consider scheduling dates for future tours in Newcastle itself.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a case study, {{presented}} as {{a contribution to the}} theorisation of the visual construction of childhood, in opposition to adulthood. The research involved the semiological analysis of all the images of childhood published in three broadsheet newspapers throughout 200 I, comprising approximately 1400 images. The analyses focussed upon the meanings of the images and the uses to which they were put in the angling, ideological inflection, and narrativisation of the advertisement or <b>press</b> <b>item.</b> The research draws upon literature relating to photographic realism, the construction of meaning in photographs, and the history of visual representations of childhood from the sixteenth to the twenty-first centuries. It was found that images of childhood played a major part in the development and universalization of the modem construction of childhood as innocent and, in key respects, distinct from adulthood. The findings are developed over three chapters. It was found that the tropes used to construct ideal, innocent childhood could be manipulated to produce narratives of threatened childhood and victimhood, and further manipulated to figure a transgressive childhood in which the adult-child binary has been breached. These variations are further explored in relation to conflict, disaster, and crime, an exploration in which childhood is viewed as a terrain for the mapping of hopeful futures, victimhood, the aetiology of criminality, and threats to cultural survival. In the context of debates about the imminent demise of childhood innocence, the themes of sexuality, consumerism, and knowingness are examined for ways in which they present threats to the adult-child binary. The thesis concludes with further analyses of the representational functions of childhood and their implications for adult and children, with reference to the uses of images of childhood in myth-making, in representing goodness, and in the envisaging of dystopian futures. The merits and shortcomings of the research are reviewed, and areas for further enquiry identified. Some updating is included in view of the passage of time since the collection of images in 2001.

It argues that through their training in impoverished communities in the United States and their intervention in similar contexts in South America, these volunteers connected diverse visions of community action aimed at eradicating poverty. This allows an inclusion of a historical comprehension of the Peace Corps within the scenario of a Global War on Poverty. The argument derives from the analysis of letters and testimonies, <b>press</b> <b>items,</b> and official documents found in archives and libraries both in the United States and South America...|$|R

Based on Colombian cases, the paper shows how the practices, beliefs, values and emotions associated with automobiles have transcended the universe of cars, {{to the point that}} many of the cultural changes in cities were related to automobilities. The argument is developed through a discussion of the role of autonomy, the notion of the driver personality and the automobility system’s own socio-material hierarchies. The research is based on the review and analysis of <b>press</b> <b>items</b> and statistical bulletins from the period of 1950 - 1968 referring to the cases of Bogota and Barranquilla...|$|R

After analyzing political documents and <b>press</b> <b>items</b> of a conservative tendency, it deduces four aspects that were present in the construction of the anticommunist discourse of the conservatives: 1) the crisis and the defense of the historical project; 2) the defense of authority and discipline for institutional stability; 3) the moral recomposition of the citizens; and 4) the defense of the hierarchy, liberty and the unequal nature of the citizens...|$|R

40|$|For half {{a million}} ‘Syrian’ Ottoman {{subjects}} living outside the empire, the First World War initiated a massive political rift with Istanbul. Beginning in 1916, Syrian and Lebanese emigrants from both North and South America sought to enlist, recruit, and conscript immigrant men into the militaries of the Entente. Employing <b>press</b> <b>items,</b> correspondence, and memoirs written by émigré recruiters during the war, this article reconstructs the transnational networks that facilitated the voluntary enlistment of an estimated 10, 000 Syrian emigrants into the armies of the Entente, particularly the United States Army after 1917. As Ottoman nationals, many Syrian recruits used this as a practical means of obtaining American citizenship and shedding their legal ties to Istanbul. Émigré recruiters folded their military service into broader goals for ‘Syrian’ and ‘Lebanese’ national liberation {{under the auspices of}} American political support...|$|R

During that period his father owned a kiosk, typical of Greek city landscapes, selling printed <b>press</b> <b>items,</b> like newspapers, magazines, pocket books, postcards, etc. Working at the kiosk as well gave {{him the opportunity to}} read a lot and grow his appetite for the Greek lyrics of rebetika, a.k.a. the songs of manges, members of a sort of inner city and urban slums gangs in the early 20th century. When most of his age peers enjoyed pop and rock, Hapsiadis was discovering little known events and details surrounding rebetika songs, their performers and lyrics. He developed a habit of collecting rebetika lyrics and writing them down in a notebook as his favorite pastime. That helped him a lot in being accepted in the circles of key rebetika industry players, in later years.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND - We {{examined}} the Finnish concept of “nikotiiniriippuvuus” (nicotine addiction or dependency in English) in two public arenas in recent Finnish history (1970 s, 1990 s and 2000 s). One {{was the biggest}} daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the other the medical professional journal Lääkärilehti. DATA & DESIGN - A total of 102 print <b>press</b> <b>items</b> from the 1990 s and the 2000 s were collected through electronic archives with the search word “nikotiiniriippuvuus”. In addition, 41 texts were collected manually from the 1970 s. RESULTS - Of the items from the 1970 s, only three mentioned the concept of “riippuvuus”. Overall, {{we found that the}} use of “nikotiiniriippuvuus” has increased greatly over time. In order {{to know more about the}} implications of this, we identified some themes as meaning-making traits surrounding the concept in the materials. The analysis points to four main meaning-making functions of the concept: i) agenda-setting, ii) introducing and explaining self-governance techniques, iii) introducing a medical understanding, and iv), mediating views on responsibility division...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the reports of the Swedish {{newspaper}} Aftonbladet and the British newspaper the Daily Express during the first week of the Asian tsunami 2004. To be able to fulfill the purpose three questions have been made: What is the main theme of the reports? Which country are the reports from? Who gets to speak?The study is based on theories on news values, media logic and earlier research about crisis communication. The chosen method is quantitative research and it has been executed through a code schedule. The total number of researched articles is 223 from three different genres: <b>press</b> <b>items,</b> news articles and feature articles. The results show that the reports of Aftonbladet and the Daily Express are rather similar. The main theme of the reports was personal stories. Reports from Thailand were most common in both newspapers, but even more so in Aftonbladet. Civilians got to speak the most. British civilians were most common to speak in the Daily Express and Swedish civilians in Aftonbladet. Most of the newspapers articles didn´t contain any authorities at all, but of the authorities that did get to speak, politicians/authorities from their own nation were the most frequent in both newspapers.
