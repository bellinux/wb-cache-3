Each affected state guaranty association pays out claims to the insurance company's policyholders in the state; in some instances, the associations arrange for policies to be transferred to a financially sound insurer. [...] Each state guaranty association is governed by state law; most associations cover up to at least $300,000 for life insurance death benefits, $100,000 in cash surrender value for life insurance, $250,000 in withdrawal and cash values for annuities, and $100,000 in health insurance <b>policy</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E
