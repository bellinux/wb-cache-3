5|$|R. v. Kent <b>Police</b> <b>Authority,</b> {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which an order of prohibition was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent <b>Police</b> <b>Authority,</b> was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the <b>police</b> <b>authority</b> informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E

ACPO was half-funded by the Home Office and half by 44 <b>police</b> <b>authorities.</b> A third of <b>police</b> <b>authorities</b> refused to pay in 2010 and another third were undecided. The Association of <b>Police</b> <b>Authorities</b> said the withdrawal of funding by <b>police</b> <b>authorities</b> was [...] "partly due to a squeeze on their income".

5000|$|In the 2010 British general {{election}} campaign, both the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats' manifestos outlined plans, respectively, to replace or reform <b>police</b> <b>authorities,</b> both parties raising {{concerns about the}} perceived lack of accountability of <b>police</b> <b>authorities</b> to the communities they served. The Conservatives proposed to replace them with a single elected individual (a 'Police & Crime Commissioner', criticised as a model by some in policing [...] ), whilst the Liberal Democrats proposed to introduce direct elections to <b>police</b> <b>authorities,</b> whilst strengthening their powers. Following Royal Assent of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 <b>police</b> <b>authorities</b> were abolished and replaced with directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners on 22 November 2012. Many of the outgoing members of <b>Police</b> <b>Authorities</b> stood {{for the role of}} PCC, highlighting their successive experience in the field, and many were elected.|$|R

5|$|In 1998, {{the city}} gained {{autonomy}} from county council control as a unitary authority area, but {{it continues to}} form part of Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes. Policing in the city remains the responsibility of Cambridgeshire Constabulary. The <b>police</b> <b>authority</b> comprises 17 members, including nine councillors, of which seven are nominated by Cambridgeshire county council and two are nominated by Peterborough city council. Firefighting remains the responsibility of Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service. The joint fire authority comprises 17 elected councillors, 13 from Cambridgeshire county council and four from Peterborough city council. Nowadays the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade, one of few of its kind, effectively functions as a retained fire station, responding to calls as directed by Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service.|$|E

5|$|On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione {{walked to}} the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, but while {{crossing}} Kensington Road, Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle, the last in a convoy of three, which was responding to an emergency call. Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss of her left leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the <b>police</b> <b>authority</b> as recompense for her injuries, even though the police motorcyclist, PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly children, who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E
