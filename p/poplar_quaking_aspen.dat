50|$|Some plants {{normally}} develop adventitious buds {{on their}} roots, which can extend quite {{a distance from}} the plant. Shoots that develop from adventitious buds on roots are termed suckers. They are a type of natural vegetative reproduction in many species, e.g. many grasses, <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen</b> and Canada thistle. The Pando <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen</b> grew from one trunk to 47,000 trunks via adventitious bud formation on a single root system.|$|R
40|$|Growth of {{red pine}} (Pinusresinosa Ait.) and <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen</b> (Populustremuloides Michx.) target trees {{with varying degrees}} of {{competition}} by neighboring aspen was measured in a 7 -year-old clearcut in northeastern Minnesota. Competitive conditions were measured using indices of resource availability (percent open sky) and neighborhood stand density. Three-year diameter growth of target trees was reduced by more than 50 % in both species because of competition from neighboring <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen.</b> The last 2 year's height growth was also reduced by approximately 30 % for both species. The relationship between growth and percent open sky was convex for red pine and concave for <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen,</b> potentially indicating a greater sensitivity in aspen to any reduction below optimal resource availability. Competition reduced crown size in both species, but self-pruning occurred only in <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen.</b> Needle and leaf size were not affected by competition, but red pine needle density was lower in highly competitive environments. Red pine had a higher specific gravity when growing under competition, partially offsetting the reduction in wood volume...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} environmental {{conditions on the}} wetting properties and surface morphology of surperhydropho bic <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen</b> leaves harvested during the 2011 growth season are examined.

Representative scanning electron microscopy images and wetting property measurements of <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen</b> leaf surfaces harvested throughout this season are presented and discussed with the objective of linking weather induced environmental stresses that occurred in 2011 to the sudden and unusual reduction in non-wetting properties and drastic changes in leaf surface structure. Erosion and regeneration rates of leaf wax crys tals and the impact that environmental factors can have on these are considered and used to explain the occurrence of these unexpected changes. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{described}} 15 Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) drumming {{logs and}} adjacent habitat within Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming. Drumming logs and adjacent habitat differed from 30 random non-drumming sites. Drumming logs had fewer limbs (8; P = 0. 003) {{and a smaller}} percentage of bark remaining (12 %; P = 0. 0001). These logs were in advanced stages of decay but were still firm to the touch. Additionally, drumming logs were found close to clearings but in areas with increased amounts of undergrowth and mature trees. Adjacent habitat analysis (0. 04 -ha circular plot centered on logs) indicated drumming locations had significantly greater average canopy height, more vegetative cover consisting of conifer and total canopy cover, and more vertical foliage between 0. 3 m and 3. 0 m in height. Adjacent habitat was in advanced stages of maturity as indicated by significant numbers of both large-diameter logs and largediameter lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen</b> (Populus tremuloides) snags. Tree species dominating the canopy and subcanopy were large-diameter Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), lodgepole pine, and <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen.</b> Subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and <b>quaking</b> <b>aspen</b> saplings were more numerous at used sites.
