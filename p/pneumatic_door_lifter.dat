50|$|The entire train {{composition}} from was designed {{the beginning to}} be operated by one man. Therefore, all doors are equipped with a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>door</b> locking feature that can be operated from the cab (side selective door release). The doors have push button pre-selection keys adjacent to them. They also have a door closure system that closes the doors automatically when the vehicle starts moving, and keeps them closed while driving.|$|R
50|$|Budd's coaches comfort {{features}} included: speakers on the seats, individual {{lights and}} tables, carpeted floor, venetian blinds, arm chairs in saloon coaches, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>doors,</b> and reclining chairs. Coaches were towed by Caprotti steam locomotives, eventually using diesel machines. In 1952 diesel locomotives by local company Fábrica Argentina de Locomotoras (FADEL) named Justicialista made their debut on the line. Those machines {{had been built}} at Liniers workshops. In 1952, the locomotives began {{to serve on the}} Constitución-Mar del Plata section to tow the Marplatense express with a journey time of 3 hours and 45 minutes.|$|R
50|$|When delivered, the R16's {{quickly became}} the new {{standard}} in car design for the New York City Transit Authority. Structurally and mechanically, they were the larger versions of the R17s and yet basically an improved version of the R10s with same exact dimensions except that the R16's had electrically operated door motors while the R10s had <b>pneumatic</b> <b>door</b> engines. When they were new, the R16's could give the R10 some competition {{when it came to}} speed - both cars were mechanically similar with four 100 horsepower motors and a balancing speed of 55 MPH.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} Komuter {{rolling stock}} {{consists of three}} versions of three-car EMUs added {{over the course of}} three years, beginning in 1994. The EMUs were the first in KTM's history. All Komuter EMUs operate in multiple-unit formation, running from overhead single-phase 25kV AC 50Hz catenary supply, with two driving cars and 1 - 4 trailer cars in between. The EMUs were state-of-the-art, with remote-controlled <b>pneumatic</b> <b>doors,</b> Automatic Train Protection (ATP), train data recorder, wheel-slip control, GTO/IGBT traction electronics and regenerative braking. Up to the point of their introduction no other KTM motive power used these modern train control systems.|$|R
50|$|Wood Lane {{became the}} western {{terminus}} of the CLR. Until the late 1920s, the railway used carriages that were accessed by gated entrances at the carriage ends. When new rolling stock was introduced with sliding <b>pneumatic</b> <b>doors,</b> Wood Lane's loop platforms {{had to be}} extended {{to provide access to}} all doors but {{it was not possible to}} extend the platform on the inside of the loop (the south side) as it interfered with an access track to the depot. A pivoting section of platform was constructed that could be moved to allow access to the depot to be made when required.|$|R

5000|$|Argo Bromo Anggrek {{trains are}} {{composed}} of 5 to 7 executive class passenger carriages, pulled by GE CM20EMP (previously U20C) class locomotives. Argo Bromo Anggrek {{is one of the}} most known train in Indonesia which used a set of special coaches with [...] "K9" [...] bolsterless bogies. Since December 2010, carriages from the Sembrani and other standard executive class trains (K1) substitute the K9 carriages, which in that stage underwent refurbishment and renovation at Industri Kereta Api, Madiun, East Java. Currently, Argo Bromo Anggrek has a white exterior with blue stripes along the sides of the train, the same livery as other Trains in Indonesia nowadays (but with manual <b>door,</b> instead of <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>door).</b>|$|R
5000|$|These trains has {{a similar}} IGBT-VVVF {{traction}} system to the existing C751B and C151A {{and it is the}} first train to have a white front with a smaller logo. These trains are the first to be fitted with STARiS 2.0, which is embedded in the door's overhead panels, as factory stock and also the first amongst the rolling stock used on the North South Line and East West Line to have electric door actuators rather than the traditional <b>pneumatic</b> <b>door</b> actuators on previous generations of rolling stock, allowing smoother and more reliable door operations, reducing delays. The first C151B train 601/602 made its debut on the North South Line on 16 April 2017.|$|R
25|$|The first Chicken, no. 33, was {{met with}} dissatisfaction by the employees. They were built without air brakes, which meant that the {{conductor}} would have to traverse a full tram to reach the emergency brake should the motorman fall unconscious. The railway authorities sided with the employees, requiring the company to rebuild the unit. A similar concern was raised concerning the trailers. As air brakes are fail safe, the trailers would automatically brake should the trailer become disconnected. With the need for pressurized air system in place, the advantages of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>door</b> were reaped. However, the pneumatics systems largely ate up the costs savings of rebuilding material. Most of the work was carried out at Sagene Depot, and was carried out between mid-1954 to 1958.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rolling stock}} {{was made in}} Italy by OM-CGE-Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie. It {{consisted}} of 12 (numbered from 71 to 82) very innovative for the time electric vehicles, fitted with pantograph (rail), Scharfenberg couplers and driver operated <b>pneumatic</b> <b>doors.</b> The vehicles could reach a speed of 50 km/h and had enough space for about 100 passengers. The [...] "little trains", as the locals affectionally called them, were stored and serviced in the depot located in the Hellenic Electric Railways premises, next to Piraeus station. Some survive at various locations e.g. Kasomouli and Pikrodaphne tram stop used as rest places for the tramway drivers, STASY S.A. children's camp at Varybobi, Thission depot of ex ISAP, Greek Railway Museum but none are in good condition.|$|R
500|$|The Enola Gay (Model number B-29-45-MO, Serial number 44-86292, Victor number 82) {{was built}} by the Glenn L. Martin Company (later part of Lockheed Martin) at its Bellevue, Nebraska plant, located at what {{is now known as}} Offutt Air Force Base. The bomber was one of the 15 initial {{examples}} of B-29s built to the [...] "Silverplate" [...] specification— 65 of these eventually being completed during and after World War II— giving them the primary ability to function as nuclear [...] "weapon delivery" [...] aircraft. These modifications included an extensively modified bomb bay with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>doors</b> and British bomb attachment and release systems, reversible pitch propellers that gave more braking power on landing, improved engines with fuel injection and better cooling, and the removal of protective armor and gun turrets.|$|R
50|$|At that time, {{even with}} larger buses and {{increased}} ridership, costs were still high. On KMB buses, there {{were up to}} four people employed on each bus - a driver, one or two conductors to collect the fares and the last, the gateman, supervised boarding and alighting by opening and closing the gates at each end. CMB buses had two crew on each bus, with the fare collector and the door-keeper being the same person. This level of manning was soon deemed unacceptable and the bus companies replaced manual doors and gates or open platforms with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>doors,</b> which eliminated {{the need for the}} gateman. However, there were no layoffs, as both bus companies were expanding and the surplus staff were soon retrained and deployed on new routes.|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of the sustainer [...] "Turbo" [...] version went through several iterations with the original prototype being manufactured by Rolladen Scheider for Peter Wright who designed a unique turbo design where the engine remained in the engine bay and drove the propeller via a belt. Peter had many years experience working in composites, design and the Formula 1 industry.The prop which extended rapidly through a pneumatic mechanism was belt driven via a belt that ran inside the pylons which were Carbon Fibre aerofoil sections to minimise drag. The engine could be started using a starter motor before deploying the prop with the engine already running, a small alternator then recharged the battery and pneumatic reservoir. Air inlet and exhaust were accomplished through small <b>pneumatic</b> <b>doors</b> it {{the bottom of the}} fuselage again to allow engine running with the prop/pylons still in the bay and the main fuselage doors still closed.|$|R
50|$|Each Class 315 unit {{is formed}} of four {{vehicles}}; some vehicles {{are attached to}} another set of four vehicles to make 8 vehicles. In the past, some further vehicles attached to another four to make 12 vehicles on long distance journeys, such as ones to Southend Victoria or Southminster (operated by Greater Anglia). The vehicles include: Driving Motor Standard Open (DMSO), Pantograph Trailer Standard Open (PTSO), Trailer Standard Open (TSO), and Driving Motor Standard Open (DMSO). Each DMSO carries four traction motors (315801-841 originally had Brush TM61-53 and 315842-861 had GEC G310AZ but these motors are interchangeable and nowadays any type {{can be found on}} any unit) rated at 110hp each and a main compressor and air reservoir which carries air for the brakes and suspension. The original <b>pneumatic</b> <b>door</b> system has been replaced by an all-electric door system. The PTSO carries the main and auxiliary transformers, batteries and battery charger, Stone Faiveley AMBR Mk.1 pantograph, vacuum circuit breaker and auxiliary compressor. The TSO carries no equipment other than that which is standard to all coaches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was an inoperative No. 2 engine reverse thrust system, even though indications in the cockpit were that the reverser had deployed. This {{was caused by the}} disconnection of a duct with resulting lack of pressure in the <b>pneumatic</b> clamshell <b>door</b> actuating mechanism. This malfunction allowed the development of considerable forward thrust by No. 2 engine even though the thrust levers for all four engines were in the [...] "reverse" [...] position.|$|R
50|$|On 10 June 2006, 222 009 working 1D17 10:30 London to Sheffield had to {{be taken}} out of service due to a door being {{discovered}} open at Desborough, Northamptonshire whilst at speed. The RAIB report determined that the incident was probably caused by a sequence of events which {{would not have been possible}} with a traditional manually-operated mechanical door: a combination of a piece of dirt incorporated in the door lock switch during manufacture and a software bug in the door control system allowed the door to remain unlocked after the train called at Luton, but prevented this condition being detected. Deflation and inflation of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>door</b> seals, initiated automatically by detectors responding to the train stopping and starting at subsequent stations, then gradually prised the door out of its socket until at a point north of Kettering it became able to open. This condition was detected and an automatic brake application initiated, whereupon the inertial forces caused the door to slide open fully; however the indications presented in the driver's cab were ambiguous and were interpreted as caused by faulty systems, and he therefore cancelled the brake application. The train was finally halted at Desborough summit after a passenger reported that the door was open.|$|R
5000|$|More trains {{were bought}} in 1914 for the Bakerloo line {{extension}} to Paddington. To speed up boarding these cars had inward swinging centre doors that {{were under the}} control of the gatemen. From 1915 the Bakerloo was extended to a junction with the London & North Western Railway (LNWR) at Queens Park and because of the difficulties of World War I, cars were transferred from the Piccadilly line. From 1917 tube trains ran through to [...] using Central London Railway motor cars that had been built for an uncompleted extension to Ealing. These returned in 1920 when the extension opened and the Watford Joint Stock, two thirds owned by the LNWR, arrived. Four and six car trains were formed, a motor car permitted in the middle of a tube train as there was an emergency passage through the control compartment. Access was by three single inwardly swinging doors on either side of the cars. Cars with sliding <b>pneumatic</b> <b>doors</b> were ordered in 1919 for the Piccadilly line. No gatesmen were needed and these trains were staffed by a driver and two guards. An open door was first indicated by a semaphore arm, but these were easily damaged, and by 1923 interlock switches proving the doors were closed were introduced.|$|R
50|$|There {{were major}} {{extensions}} of the City & South London and the Hampstead lines in the 1920s. The tunnels of the City & South London Railway were rebuilt {{to have the same}} diameter of the other tubes, and extended north to a junction with the Hampstead line at Camden Town, and south to Morden. The Hampstead line was extended to Edgware and south to another junction with the City & South London at Kennington, this opening in 1926. New stock was required to run on the rebuilt City & South London and extensions so in 1922 six prototype cars were ordered from five manufacturers. With attention given to noise reduction, there were two 4 ft <b>pneumatic</b> <b>doors</b> {{on each side of the}} trailers. From this development work a total of 1460 cars of Standard Stock would be built by six manufacturers in 18 batches between 1923 and 1934. Production cars were first ordered in 1923, and the Hampstead line received the first of these later in the same year. Motor cars had a control compartment with a central gangway over the motored bogie and seated 30. The trailers seated 48 and the control trailers 44, with transverse and longitudinal seating. Initially trains had a crew of three, a driver and two guards. In 1928, once the use of air-operated doors had proved to be successful, modifications were made to enable a train to be operated by a crew of two.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the Mark III trains were showing their {{age and the}} wear of years. In 1985, Disneyland began phasing out the Mark III trains one by one. The older trains were {{stripped}} to the chassis and rebuilt as Mark V trains. The Mark III Green went first, to become the Mark V Purple followed by the Mark III Yellow becoming the Mark V Orange. The Mark III Blue remained blue (albeit a lighter shade) and the last was Red, remaining Red. The notable difference was {{the loss of the}} bubble-top driver's area in favor of a streamlined [...] "Learjet" [...] look similar to the Mark IV trains at the Walt Disney World Resort. The new trains also sported closed passenger compartments (with windows that could be opened) and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>doors.</b> Following the 1985 Disney World monorail fire, a safety handrail was added along the spine of the train, as well as emergency fire exit hatches leading to the roof. The attraction's name remained the [...] "Disneyland Monorail System", as it had been painted on the Mark III trains' skirts. The Mark V trains were built by Ride & Show Engineering, Inc., incorporating bodies that were produced by Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm of Germany. Purple first made its appearance for testing in Autumn of 1986 and began regular operations a few months later. Orange was delivered in late Summer of 1987, followed by Blue in early 1988. The oldest train, Red, was also the last to be removed from the line for refurbishment in the Spring of 1988.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{controlling}} emergency escaping by a {{bus driver}} {{in the case of}} air control door cannot be opened normally, the paper presented a multi-manual emergency escaping system of <b>pneumatic</b> bus <b>door.</b> Bus driver and passenger can control <b>doors</b> expediently. The <b>pneumatic</b> circuit of the system and its overall arrangement is discussed. A manual control device with special valve core structure is designed. The working performance of the manual shift directional valve is analyzed. The results indicate that driver and passengers can control the bus doors under the state of abnormal condition via manual control devices in series connection rapidly. Driver and passengers control is without mutual interference. Manual shift directional valves are convenient, reliable and fast...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{carriage}} {{is equipped}} with two sets of automatic, <b>pneumatic</b> powered <b>doors</b> and is split into three sections with seating [...] - [...] a central aisle running between the seats. The front and rearmost passenger sections of the control car are arranged differently from the rest: they contain foldable seats built into {{the wall of the}} carriage, as well as an extra set of doors that can be opened manually. According to need, these sections can also serve as compartments for staff or for transporting bicycles, pushchairs, and oversize luggage. The driver's cab is accessible via a separate, manually operated door {{at the front of the}} carriage. In contrast to the EN57 series, all EN71s (with exception to EN71-100) are equipped with racks for skis located next to the passenger compartment doors.|$|R
50|$|In subways, {{derailment}} {{is usually}} less dangerous (speeds are lower, trains cannot jackknife in tunnels and so on). It {{is dangerous to}} stop in a tunnel if a fire develops; an emergency exit could lead to electrocution by the third rail (typically energized with 825 volts DC). Instead drivers try to reach the next station, even in an emergency. As a result, there are no emergency brakes directly visible to passengers. However, there are hidden stop valves and simplified train controls, allowing each car to act on its own in need. In an emergency, there are door-control handles (visible to passengers) which are intended to make the <b>pneumatic</b> train <b>doors</b> able to be opened by removing air pressure. Subway trains have mechanisms and alarms which prevent trains from moving if the doors are open, and alert the driver or engage the brakes if doors open while a train is moving. Penalties for misuse of emergency door-opening handles {{are similar to those}} for stop-valve misuse.|$|R
5000|$|Services {{started in}} 1863 when the Metropolitan Railway opened using steam {{locomotives}} hauling gas-lit wooden carriages, braked from guards' compartment. In 1890, the first tube railway opened, using electric locomotives hauling carriages with small windows, nicknamed [...] "padded cells". Other tube railways {{opened in the}} early 20th century using electric multiple units known as gate stock, as access to was via lattice gates {{at each end of}} the car. The earlier railways had electrified the underground sections of their lines by 1907. <b>Pneumatic</b> sliding <b>doors</b> were introduced on tube trains in 1919 and sub-surface trains in the late 1930s. Until the early 1960s an electric locomotive was exchanged for a steam locomotive on Metropolitan line services beyond Rickmansworth. The Victoria line opened in the late 1960s using Automatic Train Operation (ATO), and the last trains ran with a guard in 2000. [...] the Central, Jubilee and Northern lines also use forms of ATO, the latter two using a system called TBTC (Transmission Based Train Control).|$|R
40|$|The railway assets {{studied in}} this project, are those widely {{distributed}} {{pieces of equipment}} that are critical to the dependable operation of the railway system. A failed asset is likely to cause significant delay to rail services, and may even place the system into an unsafe state. A generic fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) solution {{for a number of}} railway assets of different types is therefore desired. In this thesis, five assets, namely the <b>pneumatic</b> train <b>door,</b> point machine and train-stop, the electric point machine and the electro-hydraulic level crossing barrier, are considered as case studies. Based on their common dynamic characteristics, these assets are also known as Single Throw Mechanical Equipments (STMEs). A generic FDD method is proposed for these STMEs, which consists of sensor inputs and pre-processing, fault detection processes and fault diagnosis processes. A generic model, composed of a series of sub-models, is constructed to describe the behaviour of each asset. The results of fault detection approaches indicate that the proposed method has good performance and is generically applicable to the five assets. Two fault diagnosis methods using fault model and residual analysis are proposed and the fault model based fault diagnosis is preliminarily approached. Finally, a new three level architecture for railway condition monitoring is discussed for practical applications. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
