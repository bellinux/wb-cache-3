40|$|An {{increase}} in the dynamic level of a brass instrument from forte to fortissimo generally brings about a change in timbre to a much brighter sound, often described as ‘brassy'. This phenomenon is due to non-linear wave propagation along the bore of the instrument, which generates significant spectral enrichment in the higher harmonics. The dynamic level at which this change occurs is not always clearly defined and some brass players have found that, by employing slight changes in embouchure, they have a degree {{of control over the}} level of brassiness at a constant dynamic. Experimental data from playing tests are presented, showing that players employing this technique are able to modify the gradient of the input <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> <b>front</b> as it is formed in the mouthpiece.

50|$|The term wave-riding is most {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} surface activity of cetaceans that approach boats and jump repeatedly in the waves produced by the boats. This includes bow-riding, where cetaceans are in the <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> in <b>front</b> of the boat, and wake-riding, where they are off the stern in the wake. Cetaceans swim using fluke propulsion when experiencing wave energy below the threshold needed for riding, such as when boats travel at speeds slower than 3 m/s or when they are outside of the peak wave energy zone. However, at higher speeds dolphins and porpoises will seek out the <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> and its maximum energy zone in order to ride the wave by holding their flukes in a fixed plane, with only minor adjustments for repositioning. Wave-riding reduces the energetic cost of swimming to the dolphin, even when compared to slower swimming speeds. For example, heart rate, metabolic rate and transport cost was reduced by up to 70% during wave-riding compared to swimming at speeds 1 m/s slower in bottlenose dolphin Wave-riding behaviour can be performed by dolphins from minutes up to several hours, and therefore is a useful energy-saving mechanism for swimming at higher speeds.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 19 th July 2018. <b>Pressure</b> <b>wave</b> {{propagation}} behavior {{is an essential}} feature for the combustion under enclosed conditions, e. g. internal combustion engines. Previous work by Pan et al. (2016) and Yu et al. (2015) showed that <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> disturbance not only affects hot-spot formation and knocking origin, but also induces detonation wave through a coupling mechanism between <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> and flame <b>front.</b> On this basis, this study further investigates the role of <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> disturbance in auto-ignition mode and knocking intensity by means of detailed numerical simulations with stoichiometric H 2 /air mixture. Firstly, the <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> with different levels in strength have been obtained by adjusting ignition temperature of hot ignition kernel. It shows that as ignition temperature is raised at each initial temperature, <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> strength is decreased monotonously, with declining compression ratio and temperature rise caused by <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> disturbance. Secondly, three auto-ignition modes have been observed with the variations of <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> strength, i. e. detonation, mixed mode and supersonic deflagration. As the weakness of <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> strength, there is an auto-ignition mode transition from detonation to supersonic deflagration, accompanied by rapid decreases in pressure peak, obvious pre-flame partial reaction and significant increases in auto-ignition reaction front speed. These observations are still maintained at elevated initial pressure conditions. Finally, such auto-ignition modes and knocking intensity for the detailed computations are summarized in the non-dimensional Bradley's diagram. The results show that both auto-ignition mode and initial thermodynamic state can affect knocking intensity, and the modifications in knocking intensity by <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> disturbance are mainly through auto-ignition mode transition. This is qualitatively consistent with the distribution of combustion regimes in Bradley's diagram, even though some deviations do exist because the diagram is constructed on basis of initially non-reactive flows...|$|R

50|$|The {{forces in}} the Hertzian {{solution}} above were assumed to be propagated in the balls immediately {{which is not the}} case. Sudden changes in the force between the atoms of a material builds up to form a <b>pressure</b> <b>wave.</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>waves</b> (aka sound) in steel travel about 5 cm in 10 microseconds which is about 10 times faster than the time between the first ball striking and the last ball being ejected. The <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> reflect back and forth through all 5 balls about 10 times, although dispersing to less of a <b>wave</b> <b>front</b> with more reflections. This is fast enough for the Hertzian solution to not require a substantial modification to adjust for the delay in force propagation through the balls. In less-rigid but still very elastic balls such as rubber, the propagation speed is slower, but the duration of collisions is longer, so the Hertzian solution still applies. The error introduced by the limited speed of the force propagation biases the Hertzian solution towards the simple solution because the collisions are not affected as much by the inertia of the balls that are further away.|$|R

The two waves meet up at the last contact point because the first wave reflects off {{the opposite side of the}} last ball and it meets up at the last contact point with the second wave. Then they reverberate back and forth like this about 10 times until the first ball stops connecting with the 2nd ball. Then the reverberations will reflect off the contact point between the 2nd and 3rd balls, but still converging at the last contact point, until the last ball is ejected.

40|$|Given a known {{signal and}} perfect {{knowledge}} of the environment there exist few detection and estimation problems that cannot be solved. Detection performance is limited by uncertainty in the signal, an imperfect model, uncertainty in environmental parameters, or noise. Complex environments such as the ocean acoustic waveguide and the human anatomy are difficult to model exactly as they can differ, change with time, or are difficult to measure. We address the uncertainty in the model or parameters by incorporating their possibilities in our detection algorithm. Noise in the signal is not so easily dismissed and {{we set out to}} provide cases in which what is frequently termed a nuisance parameter might increase detection performance. If the signal and the noise component originate from the same system then it might be reasonable to assume that the noise contains information about the system as well. Because of the negative effects of ionizing radiation it is of interest to maximize the amount of diagnostic information obtained from a single exposure. Scattered radiation is typically considered image degrading noise. However it is also dependent on the structure of the medium and can be estimated using stochastic simulation. We describe a novel Bayesian approach to signal detection that increases performance by including some of the characteristics of the scattered signal. This dissertation examines medical imaging problems specific to mammography. In order to model environmental uncertainty we have written software to produce realistic voxel phantoms of the breast. The software includes a novel algorithm for producing three dimensional distributions of fat and glandular tissue as well as a stochastic ductal branching model. The image produced by a radiographic system cannot be determined analytically since the interactions of particles are a random process. We have developed a particle transport software package to model a complete radiographic system including a realistic x-ray spectrum model, an arbitrary voxel-based medium, and an accurate material library. Novel features include an efficient voxel ray tracing algorithm that reflects the true statistics of the system as well as the ability to produce separable images of scattered and direct radiation. Similarly, the ocean environment includes a high degree of uncertainty. A <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> propagating through a channel produces a measurable collection of multipath arrivals. By modeling changes in the <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> <b>front</b> we can estimate the expected pattern that appears at a given location. For this purpose we have created an ocean acoustic ray tracing code that produces time-domain multipath arrival patterns for arbitrary 3 -dimensional environments. This iterative algorithm is based on a generalized recursive ray acoustics algorithm. To produce a significant gain in computation speed we model the ocean channel as a linear, time invariant system. It differs from other ocean propagation codes in that it uses time as the dependent variable and can compute sound pressure levels along a ray path effectively measuring the spatial impulse response of the ocean medium. This dissertation also investigates Bayesian approaches to source localization in a 3 -D uncertain ocean environment. A time-domain-based optimal a posteriori probability bistatic source localization method is presented. This algorithm uses a collection of acoustic time arrival patterns that have been propagated through a 3 -D acoustic model as the observable data. These replica patterns are collected for a possible range of unknown environmental parameters. Receiver operating characteristics for a bistatic detection problem are presented using both simulated and measured data. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} years the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) program REACFLOW has been {{developed}} at JRC. With REACFLOW numerical simulations of hydrogen explosions can be performed in order to evaluate the explosion consequences. Such explosions could occur in a severe nuclear accident when large amounts of hydrogen might be produced and released into the reactor containment during the core melt down. A hydrogen explosion could jeopardise the containment integrity, causing the release of radioactivity into the external environment. Simulating such explosions is therefore of particular interest for safety considerations. Such an explosion will develop through many stages starting as a laminar flame after ignition. In the flame front the hot combustion products will expand and drive some flow also {{in front of the}} flame. This flow can cause some turbulence. In return this turbulence may enhance the heat and mass transfer into the flame front, which will increase the burning rate causing the combustion products to expand even faster. As a consequence the turbulence might increase even more causing a self-acceleration of the flame. As long as the flame speed is rather slow compared to the speed of sound of the unburned mixture, the pressure increase within a closed volume will be slow as shown in Fig. 1 left and almost equal everywhere in the volume. As soon as the flame reaches a speed close to the speed of sound, <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> generated by the flame due to the expanding hot combustion products build {{up in front of the}} flame front. A typical pressure profile is shown in Fig. 1 middle. In general the higher the flame speed, the higher and steeper the pressure peak in front of the flame and the shorter the distance between the flame front and the pressure peak. In case the flame accelerates even further, the pressure peak in front of the flame will build up even further and the distance between pressure peak and flame will become smaller. This means that for fast turbulent flames the <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> and the flame front are decoupled in space. In case of a rapid geometrical expansion in the path of the flame, the flame speed normally decreases whereas any <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> in <b>front</b> of the flame will proceed with its own speed. In such a case the flame and the <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> are fully decoupled. Under certain conditions DDT (Deflagration to Detonation Transition) is possible. In detonations the very fast combustion is caused by an abrupt adiabatic compression within the shock wave. In detonations the <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> and the flame front propagate coupled together causing an even larger pressure peak. Adaptive meshing is a numerical strategy that is well suitable of describing these different combustion regimes. Adaptive meshing is the capability of performing the refinement of the computational mesh in regions where a high spatial resolution is required and to carry out the de-refinement when the finer mesh is not required anymore.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} drag {{of a body}} for instance of an air plane mainly depends on {{the conditions of the}} flow in the near-wall region, called boundary layer. Classically, one distinguishes between laminar and turbulent boundary layer, with the later one causing higher drag. The change of boundary layer condition from laminar to turbulent is called transition. The position of as well as the process of transition strongly depends on body shape, steady-state flow characteristics and especially on flow fluctuations. The fluctuations appear either inside the boundary layer or outside. Outer fluctuations have to be coupled inside the boundary layer flow and increase in magnitude while moving downstream to finally lead to transition. Wing or blade/vane trailing edges are sources of acoustic <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> generation. The <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> propagate in all direction from this source. The upstream moving part of the <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> propagates against the main flow direction leading to small wave velocities relative to the airfoil surface. Dependent on <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> amplitude and frequency initially harmonic waves steepen non-linear to shocks. A self-organization process of these weak shocks is observed during their further motion. Namely, the frequency and amplitude of the <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> that is random and chaotic at the trailing edge due to their generation by turbulent vortices become ordered in the mid-chord region. Stronger shock waves that are moving faster catch up the weaker ones and merge with them. At the end, the frequency is dramatically reduced towards the position of airfoil maximum thickness and the <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> are oriented nearly orthogonal to the airfoil surface. In technical literature strong supposition that weak upstream moving shock waves influence the transition process is expressed. In this work the interaction of weak shocks and transitional boundary layer are assessed with means of CFD under geometrically simplified conditions.

40|$|The {{influence}} of nonlinearities on {{the propagation of}} stress waves through soft tissues is currently an open research area. Understanding this influence could yield insights into the damage mechanisms of soft tissues in response to rapid and strong external excitations. In {{the context of this}} dissertation, soft tissues are idealized as nonlinear viscoelastic materials, and {{the focus is on the}} mechanical aspects of the tissue behavior. Two nonlinear material models are explored. One of them, a nonlinear extension of the standard solid viscoelastic model, is employed first to describe brain tissue behavior, and second, to study the interaction of blast <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> with viscoelastic systems. The second material model, obtained through a maximum dissipation, thermodynamically consistent construction, is employed for the studies of longitudinal wave propagation. In order to focus on the effects of the material nonlinearity, a geometrically fundamental model for longitudinal stress waves is employed. Theoretical studies including dispersion and asymptotic analyses are carried out in order to further the current understanding of wave propagation characteristics, such as the dependence of the wave speed and attenuation on the frequency, the effect of material dissipation, and the nonlinear steepening of <b>wave</b> <b>fronts.</b> Computational studies are carried out to examine various aspects of the nonlinear wave propagation. A unique nonlinear phenomenon related to the steepening of <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> is observed: the tissue absorbs energy in a localized fashion at the location of the moving steep <b>wave</b> <b>front.</b> This situation could be potentially detrimental to the tissue.

In literature the origin, propagation and attenuation ofpressure waves in gas-solids fluidized beds is still subject of discussion. For Geldart group B particles, <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> generated by a gas pulse are characterized as compression waves propagating at velocities of 10 m/s and higher, in agreement with results by Bi et al. [2] The attenuation ofupward traveling <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> {{is determined by the}} distance ofthe origin ofthe wave to the bed surface. Downward traveling <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> are not attenuated. In freely bubbling beds a major source offast <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> is bubble coalescence, which generates <b>pressure</b> <b>waves</b> traveling upwards and downwards. The average <b>pressure</b> <b>wave</b> propagation velocity in circulating fluidized beds is adequately predicted by the pseudo-homogeneous flow rnodelfor voidages above 0. 6...|$|R
