40|$|Amylases and proteases are {{utilized}} in industrial {{processes such as}} starch liquefaction or as supplements for washing agents. For these applications it is desirable to have en-zymes active at high temperatures (> 70 °C). In this work, thermostable a-amylase and ne-utral proteases were produced using the thermophilic strain Bacillus caldolyticus DSM 405. The goal of this work {{is to reduce the}} cost of production media by substituting expensive medium components such as prehydrolyzed starch and peptone, used in control fermenta-tions, by inexpensive food industry wastes such as potato fruit water, potato pulp, cheese whey, draff, <b>pea</b> <b>pulp,</b> pea fruit water, bread residues, and pork blood. Comparative stud-ies were conducted in shake flasks. With the use of such wastes, significant improvements in the activities of the enzyme a-amylase were obtained along with concomitant reduc-tions in medium costs. With the use of <b>pea</b> <b>pulp,</b> 160 % increase in the activity of a-amyla-se was observed with 97 % reduction in medium costs compared to control medium. The cost of medium for the production of proteases also decreased by more than 50 %...|$|E
40|$|Carboxylic cation-exchange resins having both acrylic and {{methacrylic acid}} units and {{enhanced}} content of cross-linking agent triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate have been synthesized. Relative sorption values of Methyl violet and pea protein have been shown. Highly cross-linked cation-exchange resins having 20 and 24 % of cross-linker {{was shown to}} have the same relative sorption ability towards protein as the resin with 14 % of triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, but smaller specific swelling.. <b>Pea</b> <b>pulp</b> has been used for preparative protein sorption. Desorption of protein takes place at pH 6. 5 - 7. 5 what provides for protein native form preservation...|$|E
40|$|The {{date palm}} {{is a typical}} plant of the arid and semi arid areas. Unfortunately in fact they are not all the {{varieties}} that profits from an economic interest except for Deglet-Nour. Thus, it represents {{a danger to the}} genetic inheritance and the biodiversity. The three varieties studied in this work are: Mech-Degla, Degla-Beida and Frezza, which are common varieties cultivated in the south of Algeria. They are characterized by a good availability and an interesting aptitude for the conservation. In this work (included in our project consisting in the valorization of the common local dates) were presented only the obtained first results. The morphological characteristics (weight of whole date, <b>pea</b> of <b>pulp</b> (pulpit), weight of the seed, length and width of whole date and the seed, pulp/seed ratio, pulp/date ratio, seed/date ration) are given. The physicochemical parameters studied are: pH, ashes, flavonoid, minerals and antioxidant activity. All three varieties are particularly rich in minerals (K, Ca, Na, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn), in flavonoïd. Concerning the antioxidant activity, different cultivars is endowed with an extraordinary capacity (61. 82, 61. 56 and 61. 61 % respectively for Mech-Degla, Degla-Beida and Frezza). © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 200...|$|R
