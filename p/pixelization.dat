25|$|As {{a result}} of {{pressure}} from the United States government, the residence of the Vice President at Number One Observatory Circle was obscured through <b>pixelization</b> in Google Earth and Google Maps in 2006, but this restriction has since been lifted. The usefulness of this downgrade is questionable, as high-resolution photos and aerial surveys of the property are readily available on the Internet elsewhere. Capitol Hill also used to be pixelized in this way. The Royal Stables in The Hague, Netherlands also used to be pixelized, and are still pixelized at high zoom levels.|$|E
500|$|Inafune {{created the}} {{character}} Zero, whom he {{originally intended to}} be the game's main, playable protagonist. [...] "When the X series came out, I really wanted to redesign Mega Man," [...] Inafune explained. [...] "I wanted a totally different Mega Man. I’m a designer, a creator; I wanted something new. I didn’t {{want to use the}} same old Mega Man." [...] Fearing a negative reaction from fans, Zero was ultimately reduced to a role secondary to Mega Man X. The development team additionally wanted the world of Mega Man X to be much more sophisticated than in the first Mega Man series. They wanted to accomplish this with Zero's [...] "hardcore" [...] personality and the game's antagonist Sigma. As stated by Inafune, the original series' villain Dr. Wily had [...] "a side to him you couldn't really hate". Sigma, however, was written as a once-good character suffering an [...] "unforeseen error" [...] that leads him to be completely evil. The game's story went through several changes during development. Two allies of Mega Man X, named RX and RY, appeared in previews for the game, but were later taken out. Mega Man X altered the franchise tradition of having themed boss characters with a [...] "Man" [...] moniker by replacing them with anthropomorphic animal-like androids. The art and <b>pixelization</b> for these eight bosses were divided among three illustrators: Inafune did Storm Eagle and Chill Penguin; Kaji did Spark Mandrill, Launch Octopus, and Sting Chameleon; and Kazunori Tazaki (credited as Ikki) did Flame Mammoth, Armored Armadillo, and Boomer Kuwanger. The team was careful in making the bosses distinct from one another in both stature and coloring. Tatsuya Yoshikawa (credited as Tatsunoko), a fourth artist who had recently been hired by Capcom, was given the task of assisting {{the rest of the team}} by designing, illustrating, and creating the sprites for the game's minor enemies. The musical score for Mega Man X was composed by Capcom's Alph Lyla group. Setsuo Yamamoto (credited as Setsuo) was initially the sole composer assigned to the game, and contributed the vast majority of the soundtrack, but four other composers, Yuki Iwai (credited as Sato), Toshihiko Horiyama (credited as Kirry), Yuko Takehara (credited as Yuko) and Makoto Tomozawa (credited as Tomozou), were brought in late in production to help finish the soundtrack. Iwai and Horiyama would later compose the soundtracks for Mega Man X2 and X4 respectively. The Japanese division of Sony Records published an arranged album featuring ten songs on March 9, 1994. Music using the SNES instrumentals was included as part of the Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6 soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Because Deadliest Catch is {{essentially}} a filmed record of everyday life in a stressful working environment, the producers have to censor gestures and language deemed inappropriate for television audiences. For example, under the U.S. Television Ratings system, Deadliest Catch is rated TV-14 with inappropriate language ("L") as a highlighted concern. For visual disguise of such items as finger gestures, bloody injuries, or non-featured crew member anonymity, the producers use the traditional <b>pixelization</b> or simple blurring. However, due to {{the sheer volume of}} profanities used in the course of everyday crew member conversation, the producers occasionally employ alternate methods of censoring profanities, using sound effects such as a ship's horn, the [...] "clang" [...] of a hatch door, or a burst of radio static in place of the traditional [...] "bleep".|$|E

She overlays black and white views of archetypical family activities {{from the turn of}} the 20th c., a now by-gone age, with small, nearly incoherent bit-streamed fragments, shards, and <b>pixelizations</b> of contemporary life. Presented as large velvety dark digital prints or ephemeral wall-sized projections, they contrast the fixity of the past with the near dictatorship of movement in the present. As if viewed through the lenses of memory, some details resonate in crystal-clear sharp focus, while others remain forever out of reach, shrouded in a resolute, but enigmatic fog, riveting viewer attention while denying perceptual closure.|$|R
40|$|Our {{purpose is}} to state {{quantitative}} conditions ensuring the rectifiability of a d [...] varifold V obtained as the limit of a sequence of d [...] varifolds (V_i) _i which need not to be rectifiable. More specifically, we introduce a sequence E_i _i of functionals defined on d [...] varifolds, such that if _i E_i (V_i) < +∞ and V_i satisfies a uniform density estimate at some scale β_i, then V = _i V_i is d [...] rectifiable. The main motivation of this work {{is to set up}} a theoretical framework where curves, surfaces, or even more general d [...] rectifiable sets minimizing geometrical functionals (like the length for curves or the area for surfaces), can be approximated by "discrete" objects (volumetric approximations, <b>pixelizations,</b> point clouds etc.) minimizing some suitable "discrete" functionals.

40|$|An exact fast {{algorithm}} is {{developed for the}} spin-weighted spherical harmonics transforms of band-limited spin ± 2 functions on the sphere. First, we recall the notion of spin functions on the sphere and their decomposition in an orthonormal basis of spin-weighted spherical harmonics. Second, we discuss the a priori O(L 4) asymptotic complexity of the spin ± 2 spherical harmonics transforms, where 2 L stands for the square-root {{of the number of}} sampling points on the sphere, also setting a band limit L for the spin ± 2 functions considered. We derive an explicit expression for the spin ± 2 spherical harmonics ± 2 Ylm (of integer l and m, with l ≥ 2, |m | ≤ l) as linear combinations of the standard scalar spherical harmonics Ylm and Y (l− 1) m. An exact {{algorithm is}} developed for the spin ± 2 spherical harmonics transforms on equi-angular grids, based on the Driscoll and Healy fast scalar spherical harmonics transform. The theoretical exactness of the transform relies on a sampling theorem existing on equi-angular grids. The associated asymptotic complexity is of order O(L 2 log 2 2 L). Alternative algorithms exist on other <b>pixelizations,</b> based on the technique of separation of variables. However, they are not theoretically exact and have an associated asymptotic complexity of order O(L 3). Finally, we consider the application of these generic developments in cosmology, for the efficient computation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) invariant angular power spectra from the observable temperature T and the linear polarization Stokes parameters Q and U (direct transform), or for the simulation of temperature and polarization maps from theoretical spectra (inverse transform) ...|$|R

50|$|Nudity is {{obscured}} {{on television}} {{networks in the}} United States. Japanese pornography laws require that genitals in films (including animated works) and other media (such as eroge, drawings, etc) be obscured. In Thailand, restrictions are placed on television broadcast depiction of cigarettes being smoked, alcohol being consumed, or guns being pointed at people. <b>Pixelization</b> is one method of censoring this content; otherwise, censor bars are used.In the Philippines, <b>pixelization</b> is also used if there are scenes of naked people or cadavers, bloody depiction of death by any means (e.g. gunshot wounds) and exposure of innards (sometimes rendered {{in black and white}} and blurred), and the finger gesture, among objectionable content.However, nudity and some bloody scenes are cut entirely and pointing of guns or blades to oneself or others are cropped.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pixelization</b> (British English, pixelisation) is any {{technique}} used in editing images or video, whereby an image is blurred by displaying part {{or all of}} it at a markedly lower resolution.

50|$|In 1999, {{digital cinema}} {{projectors}} were being tried {{out in some}} movie theatres. These early projectors played the movie stored on a server and played back through the projector. Due to their relatively low resolution (usually only 2K), the images at the time showed <b>pixelization</b> blocks in some scenes, much like images on early widescreen televisions. By 2006, the advent of much higher 4K resolution digital projection had removed any traces of <b>pixelization.</b> The systems became more compact than the larger machines of four years earlier. By 2009, movie theatres started replacing the film projectors with digital projectors. In 2013, {{it was estimated that}} 92% of movie theatres in the United States had converted to digital, with 8% still playing film. In 2015, numerous popular filmmakers—including Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan—lobbied large studios to commit to purchase a minimum amount of 35 mm film from Kodak. The decision ensured that Kodak's 35mm film production would continue for several years.|$|E
50|$|Assayas {{has claimed}} that he trimmed at least 10 minutes of footage out of the film after its premiere at Cannes.

Additionally, this R-rated release featured heavy <b>pixelization</b> over the hentai scenes shown at the Japanese animation studio.|$|E
50|$|Fogging {{is a type}} {{of visual}} {{censorship}}. An area for a picture or movie is blurred to obscure it from sight. This form of censorship is used for sexually related images/scenes, hiding genitals, pubic hair, or sexual penetration of any sort. <b>Pixelization</b> is a form of fogging. In Japan, where it is called bokashi, fogging is employed on most films that show pubic hair or genitals, including hardcore pornography.|$|E

Jamster! voluntarily censored the characters genital area (via <b>pixelization)</b> in later broadcasts of its advertisements. Similar action occurred in Australia, with similar results.|$|E
50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} <b>pixelization</b> {{can be found}} in television news and documentary productions, in which vehicle license plates and faces of suspects at crime scenes are routinely obscured to maintain the presumption of innocence, as in the television series COPS. Bystanders and others who do not sign release forms are also customarily pixelized. Footage of nudity (including genitals, buttocks, nipples or areolae) is likewise obscured in some media: before the watershed in many countries, in newspapers or general magazines, or in places in which the public cannot avoid seeing the image (such as on billboards). Drug references, as well as gestures considered obscene (such as the finger) may also be censored in this manner. <b>Pixelization</b> is not usually used for this purpose in films, DVDs, subscription television services, or pornography (except for countries in which the law requires it). When obscene language is censored by an audible bleep, the mouth of the speaker may be pixelized to prevent lip reading, often as in COPS graphic injuries and excess blood will be pixelized.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, the {{editor-in-chief}} of Expressen, Thomas Mattsson, claimed that talk of a [...] "tacit agreement", where [...] "Svenska journalistklubben" [...] met at the Grand Hotel in Saltsjöbaden 1987 and signed Lilla Saltsjöbadsavtalet on {{trying to cover up}} problems of the multicultural society", was a myth and conspiracy theory. He however acknowledged that a policy of white <b>pixelization</b> (vitpixling) - i.e. digital <b>pixelization</b> and whitening the skin color of a perpetrator of crime to avoid any [...] "unnecessary identification" [...] - had been used by Expressen. Mattsson said this had been done in accordance with the [...] "Ethical rules for press, television and radio" [...] of the Press Cooperation Board (Pressens Samarbetsnämnd), specifically § 10 (Do not emphasize the person's ethnic origin, gender, nationality, occupation, political affiliation, religious beliefs or sexual orientation if it is irrelevant in this context and is discrediting). Mattson however said that since he became editor-in-chief in 2009, Expressen had a policy of not [...] "white-pixelizating", describing the former policy to have been a [...] "mistake".|$|E
5000|$|Censor bars (often {{known as}} black bars or censor boxes) are a basic form of text, photography, and video {{censorship}} in which [...] "sensitive" [...] information or images are occluded by black, gray, or even white rectangular boxes. These bars {{have been used}} to censor various parts of images. Since the creation of digital editing software which can apply less obtrusive effects such as <b>pixelization</b> and blurring, censor bars are usually only used for satire.|$|E
5000|$|The Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is Microsoft's UI {{framework}} to create applications {{with a rich}} user experience. It {{is part of the}} [...]NET framework 3.0 and higher. WPF's emphasis on vector graphics allows most controls and elements to be scaled without loss in quality or <b>pixelization,</b> thus increasing accessibility. With the exception of Silverlight, Direct3D integration allows for streamlined 3D rendering. In addition, interactive 2D content can be overlaid on 3D surfaces natively.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Trent Reznor and Rob Sheridan and debuted on the official Nine Inch Nails website. The video features the live band, featuring Aaron North, Jeordie White, Jerome Dillon, and Alessandro Cortini, performing the song in close quarters. The video features {{the use of the}} pan and scan technique, resulting in video distortion such as <b>pixelization</b> and interlacing. During the final chorus, the band members become intentionally more distorted by additional interlacing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{series is}} edited to meet FCC {{regulations}} for indecency and obscenity, including bleeping of profane language and <b>pixelization</b> of nudity, though other censoring does take place; the series purposefully has guests avoid using their last names, mainly {{for the protection}} of minors and outside third parties, and said mentions of last names by guests (except for the show's rotation of experts) are bleeped in line with this policy. Additionally, no [...] "uncut" [...] versions of the show exist.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, under Article 175 of the Criminal Code of Japan {{people who}} sell or {{distribute}} obscene materials can be punished by fines or imprisonment. Article 175 {{was included in}} the original document in 1907 and remains relatively unchanged. Showing pubic hair and adult genitalia was once considered obscene. Video pornography routinely depicts explicit sex scenes with the participants's genitalia obscured by <b>pixelization.</b> The amount of censorship of the penis can vary. The publication of Waterfruit and Santa Fe by Kishin Shinoyama was likely the first publication that featured pubic hair. Many video production companies belong to ethical associations which provide guidance on what is acceptable and what is not. The Nihon Ethics of Video Association, the Ethics Organization of Computer Software and the Contents Soft Association are examples of three such organizations. Recent controversies have frowned upon both pubic hair and even genitalia itself being displayed in works of art and in educational settings. In 2014 Japanese police discovered an underground pornography store that possessed a machine which was claimed to be able to remove <b>pixelization</b> from the images contained on censored DVDs.|$|E
50|$|A {{drawback}} of <b>pixelization</b> is {{that any}} differences between the large pixels can be exploited in moving images to reconstruct the original, unpixelized image; squinting at a pixelized, moving image can sometimes achieve a similar result. In both cases, integration of the large pixels over time allows smaller, more accurate pixels to be constructed in a still image result. Completely obscuring the censored area with pixels of a constant color or pixels of random colors escapes this drawback but can be more aesthetically jarring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pixelization</b> {{has also}} been used for artistic effect, notably in the art print The Wave of the Future, a reinterpretation of Katsushika Hokusai's The Great Wave at Kanagawa. In this updated print, {{the image of the}} large ocean wave shifts from the {{traditional}} style of the Japanese woodcut print to a pixelized image and finally to a wireframe model computer graphics image. Westworld (1973) was the first feature film to use digital image processing to pixelize photography to simulate an android's point of view.|$|E
