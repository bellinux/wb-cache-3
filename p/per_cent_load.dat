The proposed project, which straddles the border that lies along the median point of the river, envisages a 293 m high rock fill dam (to be the largest rock fill dam in the world), just downstream of {{the confluence of the}} Mahakali and Sarju river, having a live storage capacity of 9.24 BCM and a dead storage capacity of 2.15 BCM. In the project area, the river forms the border between India and Nepal, dividing the Far Western Development Region of Nepal from the Uttarakhand State in India. The PMP also envisages a re-regulating dam for which two alternatives at Purnagiri (1020 MW) and Rupaligad (500 MW) have been considered, to hold the waters passing through the turbines and provide regulated back season release to irrigate designated commands in Nepal and India. Two power stations are projected, one on either bank, with an overall installed peaking capacity, between 5,500 and 6,480 MW at 20 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> <b>load</b> factor. As per the Treaty principles both sides are committed to design and operate the project as a single, integrated scheme to yield, [...] "the maximum total net benefits accruing to them". The power benefit is to be assessed on the basis of saving in costs as compared with the relevant alternatives available. As per the Treaty [...] "equal entitlement in the utilisation of the waters of the Mahakali River [...] "without prejudice to their respective existing consumptive uses" [...] is also planned to be ensured from the PMP.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: When {{vehicle speed}} is low, {{it is hard}} for the {{intercooler}} to cool the charging air owing to a reduction of the ram air effect. The performance of the vortex tube is not only independent of the vehicle speed but it is also independent of the ambient temperature. This benefit motivates a feasibility study of the vortex tube as a replacement for the intercooler in a diesel engine. In this study, the performance of a diesel engine with an intercooler was com-pared with that of a diesel engine with a vortex tube. The engine experimental results showed that the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) improved up to 3 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> at 1750 r/min and 25 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> partial <b>load.</b> The results also showed the soot (particulate matter) from the diesel engine equipped with a conventional intercooler was reduced up to 60 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> at 1500 r/min and 25 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> partial <b>load</b> when the vortex tube was used. As the engine speed increased, the intercooling with the vortex tube showed a similar performance, except at high speed and full load. This study demonstrates that the overall performance of the vortex tube makes it appropriate as a replacement for the intercooler, but the result also shows that the design parameters of the vortex tube need to be optimized to cover the whole operating range...|$|R

The purpose of this research was describing model of empowering managers by applying structural equation modeling (SEM) at Ardabil universities. Two hundred and twenty managers of Ardabil universities including chancellors, managers, and vice presidents of education, research, and studies participated in this study. Clear and challenging goals, evaluation of function, access to resources, and rewarding were investigated. The results indicated that the designed SEM for empowering managers at university reflects a good fitness level. As it stands out, the conceptual model in the society under investigation was used appropriately. Among variables, access to resources with 88 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> of <b>load</b> factor was known as the affective variable. Evaluation of function containing 51 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> of <b>load</b> factor was recognized to have less effect.

40|$|International audiencePerformance of a single-cylinder, water-cooled, direct-injection {{diesel engine}} on dual-fuel {{operation}} with Jatropha oil (JO) as pilot fuel and orange oil as primary fuel was evaluated. Constant load test at different power outputs {{was conducted at}} the rated speed of 1500 r/min with varying orange oil quantities. The loads were fixed as 20 per cent, 40 per cent, 60 per cent, 80 per cent, and 100 per cent. In dual-fuel operation with orange oil induction, the thermal efficiency of JO was increased mainly at high power outputs. Maximum thermal efficiency with JO was found as 29 per cent at 31 per cent of orange oil induction at 100 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> <b>load.</b> Smoke was reduced significantly with all orange oil induction rates at all power outputs in dual-fuel operation with JO. It was reduced from 4. 4 to 3. 3 BSU (Bosch Smoke Units) with JO at the maximum efficiency point at 100 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> <b>load.</b> HC emissions were increased further at all power outputs in the dual-fuel mode with all rates of orange oil induction. Dual-fuel operation increased the ignition delay of JO. However, peak pressure and energy release rates were improved in the dual-fuel operation with orange oil induction. In general, dual-fuel operation with orange oil as inducted fuel with JO as pilot fuel showed inferior performance and emissions at part loads. It is concluded that the JO as pilots fuel and orange oil as the inducted fuel {{could be used in}} diesel engines with reduced smoke levels and improved thermal efficiencies with no major detoriation in performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{sequential}} loop closing technique {{combined with}} high-frequency decoupling {{was applied to}} the design of a control scheme for a gasifier unit that forms part of an integrated gasification combined cycle power plant. The data describing the plant were provided by ALSTOM, in the form of three locally linearized state-space models. Although the initial analysis tests were frustrated by the extremely ill-conditioned nature of the model data, which yielded erroneous results when used with standard test procedures, it was possible to design a control system for the gasifier at the 100 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> <b>load</b> condition by making use of certain scaling and decoupling algorithms. The robustness of this control scheme was then assessed by applying it (unchanged) to the 50 and 0 per cent operating conditions. The resulting closed-loop systems were simulated and the results obtained show that the controlled system performed quite well at all load conditions, albeit with the violation of input constraints in the face of pressure disturbances...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of natural}} fibers as {{reinforcement}} in thermoplastics presents an interesting alternative {{for the production of}} low cost and ecologically friendly composites. One of the advantages of using natural fibres is their low specific weight, resulting in higher specific strength and stiffness when compared to glass reinforced composites. Natural fibres also present safer handling and working conditions. They are non-abrasive to mixing and can contribute to significant cost reduction. This work is divided into two phases: Phase 1 deals with developing nonwoven mats composites from flax/polypropylene (PP) and evaluating their properties. Flax/polypropylene fibres (at different weight ratios) were processed by needle-punching technique in order to form nonwoven mats. The mats were compression-molded at a temperature of 180 oC to form composite materials. The mechanical, thermal and viscoelastic properties of the composites were analyzed. Composites (untreated and silane-treated) were also subjected to varying conditions of temperature and humidity and the tensile properties of the conditioned and unconditioned composites were investigated. The mechanical properties (tensile, flexural and impact) of flax/PP composites were found to increase and reach maximum values at 30 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> fibre <b>loading</b> and then decrease at higher fibre content. Thermal studies revealed that the composites were stable up to 320 oC and samples containing 40 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> flax fibres were found to exhibit greater thermal stability than neat PP. The dynamic mechanical analyses of the composites showed that the incorporation of flax in the composites resulted in an increase of the storage modulus with a maximum value exhibited by composite containing 40 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> fibre <b>loading.</b> Composites containing chemically modified fibres exhibited low tensile modulus after conditioning. Phase 2 is based on the investigation of the effect of nano-calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) on the properties of two types of polymer matrices: recycled PP and virgin PP. In this case, composites were prepared by melt-mixing and injection molding. The mechanical and thermal properties of the composites were characterized. The tensile modulus of the nano-CaCO 3 filled PP (virgin and recycled) composites were found to increase and reach maximum at 30 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> nano-CaCO 3 <b>loading,</b> while the tensile strength decreased with increasing filler content. Thermal studies showed that the nano-CaCO 3 filled PP samples exhibited a one-step degradation pattern and are thermally stable up to 450 oC. The thermal stability of the samples was found to decrease following the addition of nano-CaCO 3. SEM micrographs of the tensile fractured surfaces of composites of the nano-CaCO 3 filled virgin and recycled PP revealed the presence of nano-CaCO 3 agglomeration...|$|R

40|$|The study {{reports the}} {{variation}} in acoustic emission signals acquired during combustion of typical propellants with varying aluminium and ammonium perchlorate content. It was observed that when propellant strands having the same composition undergo combustion under similar conditions, they produce consistent acoustic emission signals. To study the effect of variation of aluminium content in the propellant composition on the acoustic emission produced during combustion, the aluminium content was varied from 6 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> to 18 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> in a HTPB-based composite propellant with 86 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> solid <b>loading.</b> Experiments were carried out with propellant strands under the same conditions for a comparative study.

The effect of cumulative values of energy, frequency and ring-down counts, the effect of burn rate and theoretical specific impulse against the aluminium percentage variation, and the variation of specific impulse against acoustic energy can all be correlated. The clear trend is indicative of possible prediction of propellant performance parameter like specific impulse from acoustic emission parameters. </span...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the clinical and laboratory findings from 264 cases of toxic mastitis in cows in Northern Ireland between October 1995 and May 1997. Nearly {{all the cases}} occurred during the winter housing period, with 84 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> occurring between November and March inclusive, and 30 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> in March. Sixty <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> of the cases occurred within one month of calving, and 29 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> within four days of calving. The most common clinical signs were lethargy (92 <b>per</b> <b>cent),</b> discoloured milk (90 <b>per</b> <b>cent),</b> anorexia (72 <b>per</b> <b>cent),</b> tachypnoea (23 <b>per</b> <b>cent),</b> diarrhoea (23 <b>per</b> <b>cent),</b> recumbency (18 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> and staggering (15 <b>per</b> <b>cent).</b> Severe pyrexia (18 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> and clinical dehydration (44 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> were relatively common findings. Pure growths of Escherichia coli were isolated from 50 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> of the milk samples, but 1 1 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> yielded no bacterial growth. In vitro sensitivity tests indicated that enrofloxacin was effective against 98 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> of the baderia isolated, and framycetin and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid against 91 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> Abnormally high blood urea levels were observed in 31 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> of cases, high blood creatinine levels in 42 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> and severe leucopenia in 56 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> Of the cases which were followed up, 14 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> died, 21 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> were culled early and a further 22 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> lost milk production from the affected quarter.

40|$|The present work {{aimed to}} evaluate, through ten {{different}} studies, the therapeutic efficacy {{of a new}} pour-on formulation, containing 1. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> ivermectin + 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> abamectin, against parasites of cattle. Results obtained on trials against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus showed that the pour-on combination of 1. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> ivermectin + 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> abamectin obtained superior efficacy indexes against this ectoparasite, when compared with formulations containing 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> ivermectin, 1 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> ivermectin and the combination of 1 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> abamectin + 20 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> levamisole. The results of efficacy of the ivermectin+abamectin and the 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> ivermectin against Haematobia irritans were similar. Against Cochliomyia hominivorax larvae, all pour-on formulations tested (1. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> ivermectin + 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> abamectin, 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> ivermectin and 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> abamectin), as well as 1 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> doramectin administered subcutaneously, were considered ineffective. Cattle medicated with 1. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> ivermectin + 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> abamectin, pour-on, remained free from parasitism by Dermatobia hominis larvae during 42  days (96 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> efficacy), while values superior to 90 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> were obtained by 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> ivermectin (92 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> and 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> abamectin (93 <b>per</b> <b>cent)</b> until the 42 nd and 35 th days post treatment, respectively. Against Haemonchus placei and Oesophagostomum radiatum, the pour-on of ivermectin+abamectin showed better efficacy than the 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> ivermectin and 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> abamectin.
