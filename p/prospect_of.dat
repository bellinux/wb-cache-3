40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} the spatial pattern <b>of</b> known <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> the deposit-type sought {{is the key}} to link {{predictive}} mapping of mineral prospectivity (PMMP) and quantitative mineral resource assessment (QMRA). This proposition is demonstrated by PMMP for hydrothermal Au-Cu deposits (HACD) and by estimating the number <b>of</b> undiscovered <b>prospects</b> for HACD in Catanduanes Island (Philippines). The results of analyses of the spatial pattern <b>of</b> known <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> HACD and their spatial associations with geological features are consistent with existing knowledge of geological controls on hydrothermal Au-Cu mineralization in the island and elsewhere, and are used to define spatial recognition criteria of regional-scale prospectivity for HACD. Integration of layers of evidence representing the spatial recognition criteria of prospectivity via application of data-driven evidential belief functions results in a map of prospective areas occupying 20 % of the island with fitting- and prediction-rates of 76 % and 70 %, respectively. The predictive map of prospective areas and a proxy measure for degrees of exploration based on the spatial pattern <b>of</b> known <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> HACD were used in one-level prediction of undiscovered mineral endowment, which yielded estimates of 79 to 112 undiscovered <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> HACD. Application of radial-density fractal analysis of the spatial pattern <b>of</b> known <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> HACD results in an estimate <b>of</b> 113 undiscovered <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> HACD. Thus, {{the results of the study}} support the proposition that PMMP can be a part of QMRA if the spatial pattern <b>of</b> discovered <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> the deposit-type sought is considered in both PMMP and QMRA...|$|R

Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy.|$|E
