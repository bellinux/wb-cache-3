40|$|Bifacial <b>photovoltaics</b> {{are widely}} {{investigated}} {{with the aim}} of reducing the amount of silicon used and increasing conversion efficiencies. The output power of bifacial <b>photovoltaics</b> depends on the quantity of solar radiation incident on the reverse face. Furthermore, controlling the orientation can distribute the times of peak power output in the morning and afternoon to better match the demand. In this study, the demand patterns of individual houses or the whole Hokkaido region were analyzed assuming the substitution of a conventional large-scale electric power system with one using bifacial <b>photovoltaics.</b> The supply–demand balances and electrical storage capacities were investigated. When comparing a large scale solar power plant (mega-solar power plant) using monofacial <b>photovoltaics</b> or vertical bifacial <b>photovoltaics</b> (in which the orientation could be adjusted), the supply–demand could be better balanced for individual houses in the latter case, thereby allowing the storage capacity to be reduced. A bifacial solar module was modeled by 3 D-CAD (three dimensional computer aided design) and thermal fluid analysis. The module temperature distribution of bifacial <b>photovoltaics</b> was calculated with respect to the environmental conditions (wind flow, direct and diffuse solar radiation, etc.) and internal heat generation, as well as the orientation of the solar panels. Furthermore, the output power of bifacial <b>photovoltaics</b> can be easily obtained from the analysis result of modular temperature distribution and the relation between temperature and output power...|$|R

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory {{concluded}} that the average large <b>photovoltaic</b> plant in the United States occupied 3.1 acres of permanently disturbed area and 3.4 acres of total site area per gigawatt-hour per year. The average concentrated solar power plant in the US occupied 2.7 acres of disturbed area and 3.5 acres of total area per GWh/yr, A 2015 life-cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity concluded that concentrating solar power had a land-use footprint of 9.0 m2/MWhr for trough, and 14 m2/MWhr for power tower. The concentrating solar footprint was smaller than that of coal power (18 m2/MWhr), but larger than the other sources studied, including ground <b>photovoltaic</b> (7.9 m2/MWhr), natural gas (0.49 m2/MWhr), and wind power (0.26 m2/MWhr).|$|E
40|$|The Regional Council of Jämtland has {{a goal to}} {{increase}} the export of renewable energy and with that reduce the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One of the measures used to reach this goal is to give subsidies and tax reductions for investments in <b>photovoltaics.</b> <b>Photovoltaics</b> are generally perceived as “good for the environment” and give a “good image” to companies. They are marketed as interesting for private persons and farmers from a profitability point of view. Sweden has an electricity mix with average CO 2 emissions of 20 - 30 g/kWh. Compared to other countries in Europe this is very low. The CO 2 emissions of <b>photovoltaics</b> during their lifetime are 46 g/kWh according to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Taking this in consideration {{it can be concluded}} that <b>photovoltaics</b> actually increase GHG emissions as they have higher emissions of CO 2 than the average in Sweden. When the decision to invest in <b>photovoltaics</b> is made with profitability as a main reason, it is debatable if the subsidies and tax reductions are needed. When the decision to invest in <b>photovoltaics</b> is made with environmental concern as a main reason, the subsidies might be given to other environmental technologies that are better from a climate perspective. Considering this, the push for profitability of <b>photovoltaics</b> can be seen as just another increase in consumption...|$|R
