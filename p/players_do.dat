5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive more information about the setting and more direction from the GMs than <b>players</b> <b>do.</b> In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E
5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades {{that increase the}} rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold {{is added to the}} stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. <b>Players</b> <b>do</b> not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other <b>players</b> <b>do</b> about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

50|$|Additionally, a <b>player</b> <b>does</b> not {{necessarily}} have to continue the system until the table limit is met or exceeded, but could instead pick a single bet that the <b>player</b> <b>does</b> not wish to exceed and make that bet their own personal limit.|$|R
50|$|Time {{limits are}} imposed on spins as well. If a <b>player</b> <b>does</b> not begin his spin within a time limit, he loses that spin. If a <b>player</b> <b>does</b> not mark off all {{possible}} numbers or jokers within the time limit, those are considered lost.|$|R

50|$|Back-counting is {{different}} from traditional card-counting, in that the <b>player</b> <b>does</b> not play every hand he sees. This offers several advantages. For one, the <b>player</b> <b>does</b> not play hands at which {{he does not have}} a statistical advantage. This in turn reduces variance and fluctuations, and increases the total advantage of the player. Another advantage is that the <b>player</b> <b>does</b> not have to change their bet size as much, or at all if they choose. Large variations in bet size are one way that casinos detect card counters, and this is eliminated with back-counting.|$|R

25|$|A key-point of {{the game}} is that the actions of the <b>players</b> <b>do</b> not always have the {{expected}} outcome. For example, an Israeli proposal for medical aid shortly after an air strike will be turned down, and will detoriate even further the relation with the Palestinians.|$|E

25|$|A major {{difference}} between Australian Powerball versus the US game is that the latter was created in part to allow a player to win by matching only one number, {{if it is the}} Powerball. Also, while US Powerball prizes are taxable, its <b>players</b> <b>do</b> not pay agents' commission, so wagers are always a multiple of US$2.|$|E
25|$|Importantly, {{in these}} models players only {{choose the best}} {{response}} on the next round that would give them the highest payoff on the next round. <b>Players</b> <b>do</b> not consider the effect that choosing a strategy on the next round would have on future play in the game.

25|$|Typically <b>players</b> <b>do</b> {{practise}} on {{the field}} of play, but not on the cricket square, during the game. Also bowlers sometimes practise run ups during the game. However, no practice or trial run-up is permitted {{on the field}} of play during play if it could result in a waste of time. The rules concerning practice on the field are covered principally by Law 26 of the Laws of Cricket.|$|E
25|$|In general, a foul {{that would}} cause an {{ejection}} of a field player might bring on a five-metre shot on the goalkeeper. The goalkeeper also has one limitation that other <b>players</b> <b>do</b> not have: he or she cannot cross the half-distance line. Also, if a goalkeeper pushes the ball under water, the action will not be punished with a turnover like with field players, but with a penalty shot.|$|E
