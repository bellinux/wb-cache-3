40|$|Chemical <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers</b> {{are often}} used to enhance transdermal drug delivery. However, the {{fundamental}} mechanisms that govern the interactions between <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers</b> and skin are not fully understood. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} work was to identify naturally fluorescent <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers</b> (FPEs) in order to utilize well-established fluorescence techniques to directly study the behavior of FPEs within skin. In this study, 12 fluorescent molecules with amphiphilic characteristics were evaluated as skin <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers.</b> Eight of the molecules exhibited significant activity as skin <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers,</b> determined using skin current enhancement ratios. In addition, to illustrate the novel, direct, and non-invasive visualization of the behavior of FPEs within skin, three case studies involving the use of two-photon fluorescence microscopy (TPM) are presented, including visualizing glycerol-mitigated and ultrasound-enhanced FPE skin penetration. Previous TPM studies have indirectly visualized the effect of <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers</b> on the skin by using a fluorescent dye to probe the transdermal pathways of the enhancer. These effects can now be directly visualized and investigated using FPEs. Finally, future studies are proposed for generating FPE design principles.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a non-invasive technique to assess the interaction between chemical and electrical modes of percutaneous penetration enhancement in vivo. Methods: Impedance spectroscopy, a non-invasive biophysical technique, was used to monitor the effect of iontophoresis on skin and to determine the extent to which this effect was modulated by pretreatment with <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers</b> of different physicochemical properties. Results: Azone®/propylene glycol and sodium lauryl sulfate had a profound effect on post-iontophoretic skin impedance, considerably amplifying the effect of current passage. Post-iontophoretic impedance spectra of skin pretreated with oleic acid showed a smaller decrease in skin impedance. Neither stearic acid nor linoleic acid had comparable effects, however. For these enhancers, the changes observed were attributable to the vehicle, propylene glycol, which complemented the action of iontophoresis and increased its effectiveness. A parameter, analogous to the membrane time constant, was introduced that enabled the degree of perturbation and the rate of recovery of skin impedance to be gauged.

Changes in the reduction of skin impedance induced by the passage of current have been used as indicators of the interaction between an array of diverse <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers</b> and iontophoresis.

Lipid Res. 46 (2005), 2192 - 2201.) that correlations exist between the activity of the aforementioned transdermal <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers</b> (TPE) {{and the extent to which}} these agents bind to DMPC vesicles and perturb the gel to liquid crystal phase transition measured by calorimetry. The degree to which the perturbation of these compounds extends into the bilayer interior in contrast to surface activity is unclear. To gain insight into this issue, the 31 P NMR resonance from DMPC and DMPC-cholesterol unilamellar vesicles have been split by the slowly penetrating paramagnetic metal ion Pr+ 3. The extent to which this perturbation is attenuated by transdermal <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers</b> has been investigated as a function of Pr+ 3 exposure time and iminosulfurane concentration. The effect of these iminosulfuranes on bilayer integrity is also being explored by monitoring the induced release of carboxyfluorescein from DMPC and DMPC- cholesterol unilamellar vesicles...|$|R

Carboxy polymethylene was used to develop topical hydrogel formulations of curcumin with different concentrations of <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers.</b> Rheological properties, drug content, skin irritation, stability and in-vitro permeation studies were conducted. Permeation experiments were performed on silicon membrane and excised abdominal rabbit skin using Franz Diffusion Cell. All the prepared hydrogel formulations containing Curcumin showed good consistency, homogeneity, spreadability and has wider prospect for topical preparation. The formulation containing Curcumin (2 % w/w gel) and olive oil (2 % w/w, as enhancer) {{was found to have}} good permeation of the drug across artificial skin as well as rabbit skin. The anti-inflammatory activity of 2 % w/w Curcumin hydrogel in the rat hind paw edema model revealed that the drug was delivered to the inflammation site at a controlled rate over a desired period of about 3 h, using carboxy polymethylene as gel forming polymer and olive oil and tween 80 as <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractSkin is {{attractive}} for drug therapy {{because it offers}} an easily accessible route without first-pass metabolism. Transdermal drug delivery is also associated with high patient compliance and through the site of application, the drug delivery can be locally directed. However, to succeed with transdermal drug delivery it is often required to overcome the low permeability of the upper layer of the skin, the stratum corneum (SC). One common strategy is to employ so-called <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers</b> that supposedly act to increase the drug passage across SC. Still, {{there is a lack}} of understanding of the molecular effects of so-called <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers</b> on the skin barrier membrane, the SC. In this study, we provide a molecular characterization of how different classes of compounds, suggested as <b>penetration</b> <b>enhancers,</b> influence lipid and protein components in SC. The compounds investigated include monoterpenes, fatty acids, osmolytes, surfactant, and Azone. We employ natural abundance 13 C polarization transfer solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on intact porcine SC. With this method it is possible to detect small changes in the mobility of the minor fluid lipid and protein SC components, and simultaneously obtain information on the major fraction of solid SC components. The balance between fluid and solid components in the SC is essential to determine macroscopic material properties of the SC, including barrier and mechanical properties. We study SC at different hydration levels corresponding to SC in ambient air and under occlusion. The NMR studies are complemented with diffusion cell experiments that provide quantitative data on skin permeability when treated with different compounds. By correlating the effects on SC molecular components and SC barrier function, we aim at deepened understanding of diffusional transport in SC, and how this can be controlled, which can be utilized for optimal design of transdermal drug delivery formulations...|$|R
