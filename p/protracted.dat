5|$|Symptoms {{may also}} occur during a gradual dosage reduction, but are {{typically}} less severe and may persist {{as part of}} a <b>protracted</b> withdrawal syndrome for months after cessation of benzodiazepines. Approximately 10% of patients experience a notable <b>protracted</b> withdrawal syndrome, which can persist for many months or in some cases a year or longer. <b>Protracted</b> symptoms tend to resemble those seen during the first couple of months of withdrawal but usually are of a sub-acute level of severity. Such symptoms do gradually lessen over time, eventually disappearing altogether.|$|E

Following an online argument in July 2013, Fish publicly announced his exit from game development, citing long-term mistreatment by the industry.|$|E
5|$|Hail to the Thief was {{produced}} by longtime Radiohead collaborator Nigel Godrich in Los Angeles. To avoid the <b>protracted</b> recording sessions of previous albums, Radiohead recorded Hail to the Thief quickly and focused on recording live takes rather than overdubs.

5|$|Nintendo {{announced}} {{a sequel to}} EarthBound for the Nintendo 64 in 1996: Mother 3 (EarthBound 64 in North America). It was scheduled for release on the 64DD, a Nintendo 64 expansion peripheral that used a magneto-optical drive, but struggled to find a firm release date as its <b>protracted</b> development entered development hell. It was later canceled altogether in 2000 when the 64DD flopped.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 1914, the First World War began; On 4 August, Germany invaded Belgium and the United Kingdom {{entered the}} war to uphold the Treaty of London (1839). Britain faced a {{continental}} war it {{was not prepared to}} fight; the Expeditionary Force was dispatched but the country lacked the forces required for the <b>protracted</b> war envisioned by the military leadership.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protracted</b> {{negotiations}} over water rights with {{the owners of}} Saltford Brass Mill and around 30 other mills on the river between Bath and Bristol, delayed construction until 1809; the wheel was installed in March 1810. Further delays relating to obtaining specific items of machinery meant that the pumping station did not open until early 1813, and until then boats were prohibited from using Bath Locks during periods of low rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{succession}} to the estates {{did not go}} undisputed, however. A <b>protracted</b> {{battle over}} parts of the inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp's first marriage. The dispute centred on land, not on the Warwick title, as Henry's half-sisters {{were excluded from the}} succession.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{contains}} {{chemical substances}} {{which can be}} absorbed through the skin, or inhaled. When handling shoe polish, one should ideally wear gloves, and stay in a well-ventilated area. Shoe polish should be kept {{out of reach of}} children and animals.

5|$|The Battle of Plaman Mapu (27 April 1965) {{was one of}} {{the largest}} battles of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, a <b>protracted</b> and {{undeclared}} war between Indonesia and a Commonwealth of Nations (including Britain) supporting {{the creation of a new}} Malaysian state. The battle occurred as a result of an Indonesian effort to storm a British hilltop base at Plaman Mapu, on the border between the Malaysian state of Sarawak and Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The Percy estates were {{primarily}} {{located in the}} northern counties of Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Cumberland. Even though the title was restored in 1416, and the Percy estates were officially regranted, this did not mean the immediate return of all the family possessions. <b>Protracted</b> legal battles followed, particularly with John, Duke of Bedford. Even {{at the time of}} his death, Northumberland had not recovered all the estates once held by his grandfather.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} also under latent danger of {{attack by the}} Venetians.

5|$|The {{election}} of Matthias as king {{was the only}} way of avoiding a <b>protracted</b> civil war. Ladislaus Garai was the first baron to yield. At a meeting with Matthias's mother and uncle, he promised that he and his allies would promote Matthias's election, and Michael Szilágyi promised that his nephew would never seek vengeance for Ladislaus Hunyadi's execution. They also agreed that Matthias would marry the Palatine's daughter Annahis executed brother's bride.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Permian saw a major {{turnover}} in fauna during the Permian–Triassic extinction event: probably the most severe mass extinction event of the phanerozoic.

5|$|Yongle {{also used}} woodblock {{printing}} to spread Chinese culture, {{and used the}} military (especially cavalry) to expand China's borders. This included the brief occupation of Vietnam, from the initial invasion in 1406 until the Ming withdrawal in 1427 {{as a result of}} <b>protracted</b> guerrilla warfare led by the subsequent founder of the Vietnamese Lê dynasty.|$|E
5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} {{the most urgent}} needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had adopted the German Type UB II design for {{what became known as}} the Austro-Hungarian U-27 class in mid 1915, and had six of that class being built under license in Austria-Hungary by late 1916. In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After <b>protracted</b> negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Although Charles Holden had {{gradually}} reduced his workload, he {{was still}} continuing {{to go into the}} office three days per week during the early 1950s.

In the last decade of his life, Holden was himself physically weaker and was looked after by his niece Minnie Green.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} source of income was {{the prospect of a}} Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James <b>protracted</b> the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E
5|$|At the war's outset, FRELIMO {{had little}} {{hope for a}} {{conventional}} military victory, with a mere 7000 combatants against a far larger Portuguese force. Their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency, in order to force a negotiated independence from Lisbon. Portugal fought {{its own version of}} <b>protracted</b> warfare, and a large military force was sent by the Portuguese government to quell the unrest, with troop numbers rising from 8,000 to 24,000 between 1964 and 1967. The number of local soldiers recruited for the Portuguese cause rose to 23,000 in the same period. 860 Special Forces operatives were also being trained in Commando Instruction Centres by 1969.|$|E
5|$|At this time, and {{following}} the disastrous Battle of Acheloos in 917, the Byzantines were mostly occupied in the Balkans in a <b>protracted</b> conflict against Bulgaria. Hence, Kourkouas's first task as Domestic of the East was {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Bardas Boilas, the governor (strategos) of Chaldia, a strategically important area on the Empire's northeastern Anatolian frontier. This was quickly achieved and his brother, Theophilos Kourkouas, replaced Boilas as governor of Chaldia. As commander of this northernmost sector of the eastern frontier, Theophilos proved a competent soldier and gave valuable assistance to his brother's campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a <b>protracted</b> development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E
5|$|Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's gold {{reserves}} shortly before gold entered a <b>protracted</b> bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom. The official reason for selling the {{gold reserves}} was {{to reduce the}} portfolio risk of the UK's reserves by diversifying away from gold. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5billion. By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised.|$|E
