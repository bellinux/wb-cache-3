40|$|We are {{concerned}} that the State Board’s decision on this General Permit for Phase II Small MS 4 s may set a precedent that would adversely affect our member agency permittees. More specifically, the third paragraph of Section XI of the Fact Sheet contains un-necessary and potentially misleading language that is inaccurate and inconsistent with prior State Water Board policy concerning compliance with water quality standards and how and over what time period that compliance is to be achieved. This language has never before appeared with respect to other State Water Board-issued MS 4 permits, including the current draft Caltrans permit and its fact sheet, and should therefore be deleted in its entirety. The Ninth Circuit held in Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles (2011) 673 F. 3 d 880 that engagement in the iterative process does not provide a safe harbor from liability for violations of <b>permit</b> <b>terms</b> prohibiting exceedances of water quality standards.

In practice the Commission gave very few official exemptions and a new system for dealing with them is currently under review. Secondly, the Commission agreed to exempt 'Agreements of minor importance' (except those fixing sale prices) from Article 101. This exemption applies to small companies, together holding no more than 10% of the relevant market. In this situation as with Article 102 (see below), market definition is a crucial, but often highly difficult, matter to resolve.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the T-Ruby language for specifying VLSI circuits {{in terms of}} relational abstractions of their behaviour. The language {{is based on a}} typed lambda calculus with a type system closely related to that of Edinburgh LF. Terms in the language may have simple, non-parameterised types or types which are constructed from other types, possibly together with terms. The dependent types which can be constructed in this way are useful for describing parameterised regular structures which commonly appear in VLSI circuits. The language forms the basis for a tool which <b>permits</b> <b>term</b> rewriting in a user-directed transformational style according to a set of proved term equivalences. Terms which describe causal relations may then be translated into a VLSI specification in a standard VLSI description language. The rewriting process is illustrated by the derivation of a relation describing a circuit for 2 -dimensional convolution. 1 Introduction Ruby [3] is a language intended for specif [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{large-scale}} magnetic {{field in the}} universe {{is one of the}} greatest mysteries in modern cosmology. We present a new mechanism for generation of large-scale magnetic field, based on the power-counting renormalizable theory of gravitation recently proposed by Horava. Contrary to the usual case in general relativity, the U(1) gauge symmetry of a Maxwell action in this theory <b>permits</b> <b>terms</b> breaking conformal invariance in the ultraviolet. Moreover, for high frequency modes, the anisotropic scaling intrinsic to the theory inevitably makes the sound horizon far outside the Hubble horizon. Consequently, non-inflationary cosmic expansion in the early universe naturally generates super-horizon quantum fluctuations of the magnetic field. Specializing our consideration to the case with the dynamical critical exponent $z= 3 $, we show an explicit set of parameters for which (i) the amplitude of generated magnetic field is large enough as a seed for the dynamo mechanism; (ii) backreaction to the cosmic expansion is small enough; and (iii) the high-energy dispersion relation is consistent with the most recent observational limits from MAGIC and FERMI.

50|$|The {{population}} {{profile of}} the country change dramatically after the relaxation of immigration policy, with a huge {{increase in the number}} of transient migrant workers. Official figures show that the number of foreigners on short-term <b>permits</b> (<b>termed</b> 'non-residents') has grown from 30,900 in 1970 to 797,900 in 2005, which translate roughly to a 24-fold increase in 35 years, or from 1% of the population in 1970 to 18.3% in 2005. Despite this huge increase, no further breakdown is given by Singstat. By 2010, the population of non-residents had increased to 25.7%. It was estimated in the mid-2010s that around 40% of Singapore's population were of foreign origin (permanent residents plus non-residents such as foreign students and workers including dependents). While the Singapore Department of Statistics reports overall population figures for Singapore (4.48 million in 2006), as a matter of policy, it only provides more detailed demographic breakdown analysis for the approximately 80% of the population (in 2006) who are Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents (collectively termed 'residents'). Of this group of about 3.6 million people in 2006, Chinese form 75.2%, Malays form 13.6%, Indians form 8.8%, while Eurasians and other groups form 2.4%. No breakdown by ethnicity is released for the non-resident population.|$|R
