40|$|Under {{controlled}} {{conditions the}} effects of various "sympatholytic " agents on the cardiovascular responses to epinephrine and norepinephrine were compared in man. The dosages of the sympath-olytic drugs administered approximated those usually employed clinically. Such basic data are given for the following agents: Dibenamine, the imidazoline derivatives [Priscoline and Regitine (C- 7337) ], the dihydrogenated alkaloids of ergot (D. H. K. and C. C. K.), L-hydrazinophthalazine (C- 5968), tetraetbylammonium, and hexamethonium (C 6). IN RECENT years a variety of agents have been introduced which inhibit, the motor activities of the sympathetic nervous sys-tem. Determination of the mode of action of such drugs has not been clarified completely especially in man. According to Nickerson' "adrenergic blockade " refers only to compounds which specifically inhibit the responses of ef-fector cells to both epinephrine and sympa-thetic nervous impulses. Thus, adrenergic blocking agents such as Dibenamine should be differentiated from drugs which inhibit transmission through the sympathetic nervous system either in the ganglia, such as tet-raethylammonium 2 or the central nervous sys-tem, such as <b>pentaquine,</b> 3 but do not block the pressor effects of epinephrine. The present investigation was designed to determine under controlled conditions the ef-fects of the various "sympatholytic " drugs on the pressor responses to an excess of circulating epinephrine in man. In addition, it seemed of interest to test the effectiveness of such drugs in inhibiting the hypertension associated wit...|$|E
40|$|The binding of four 8 -aminoquinoline antimalarials (primaquine, <b>pentaquine,</b> pamaquine, and pla. smocid) {{to native}} and {{denatured}} calf thymus DNA {{has been studied}} by equilibrium dialysis and direct spectrophotometry. The binding of the 8 -aminoquinolines to DNA is (a) accompanied by a decrease in absorbance of the ligand, (b) decreased {{by an increase in}} ionic strength, (c) decreased by addition of Mg 2 + {{to a greater extent than}} would be expected from ionic strength effects alone, and (d) decreased under some conditions by the presence of 4 ii urea. In 0. 01 ii potassium phosphate (pH 6), the total binding of the 8 -aminoquinolines to various DNA preparations at DNA nucleotide to aminoquinoline ratios of 6 or greater occurs in the following order: native DNA = denatured DNA> native DNA in 4 M urea> denatured DNA in 4 M urea. At low ionic strengths and pH 6, the binding of the singly protonated 8 -aminoquinolines is less than, but comparable to, the binding of chloro-quine, a divalent cation at the same pH. At a DNA nucleotide to aminoquinoline ratio of 10 and an ionic strength of 0. 012 (pH 6), the percentages of the aminoquinolines bound to native T) NA decrease in the following order: chloroquine> pentaquine> plasmocid> priniaquine> pamaquine. At an ionic strength of 0. 15 or greater, the binding of pentaquin...|$|E
40|$|In man, C 6, a new ganglionic {{blocking}} agent (50 mg. intravenously) produced {{inhibition of}} the Valsalva, tiltback and cold pressor vasopressor responses. Marked increases in digital blood flow and skin temperature with inhibition of digital reflexes to "noxious " stimuli were consistently ob-served (room temperature 70 F.). The increase in skin temperature was greater and more lasting than following Priscoline or tetraethylammonium chloride. Except for severe postural hypoten-sion, side effects were minimal. Clinically the drug {{may be useful}} in the evaluation of sympathetic vasoconstriction in peripheral vascular disease {{as well as in the}} treatment of acute neurogenic vasospasm. T HE SUBSTANCES which inhibit trans-mission of sympathetic vasoconstrictor impulses may be divided into three main categories: (1) central blocking agents which interfere with sympathetic vasoconstrictor re-flexes (cardioaortic, carotid sinus) through a central nervous system site of action, such as plasmochin ' <b>pentaquine</b> 2 and the central block-ing component of the DH alkaloids of ergot 3; (2) adrenergic blocking agents which interrupt sympathetic nerve impulses peripherally and which also block or reverse the effects of in-jected epinephrine or norepinephrine, such as Dibenamine 4 and Priscoline 5; and (3) ganglionic blocking agents of which tetraethylammonium chloride (Etamon) is the best known example. The blocking agents inhibit transmission through all autonomic ganglia including the parasympathetic as well as the sympathetic. ' In addition, they enhance rather than block the pressor effects of epinephrine and norepineph-rine in both man 7 and animals. ...|$|E
40|$|The causal {{prophylactic}} {{activity of}} several reference and experimental antimalarial compounds was assessed in sporozoite-induced infections of NMRI mice with Plasmodium berghei yoelii (strain 17 X). The animals were inoculated with 10 000 sporozoites per mouse and treated once 2 - 4 hours later. The test system {{has proved to}} be very suitable in experiments involving more than 3 000 mice. The infection rate in 448 untreated controls was 97. 3 %. Lowering the sporozoite content of the inoculum to 1 000 or 100 sporozoites markedly reduced the rate (65. 1 % and 32. 7 %). In experiments with primaquine the causal prophylactic activity was also influenced by the time of drug administration before or after sporozoite inoculation. No causal prophylactic effect was demonstrable with quinine, chloroquine, amodiaquine, amopyroquine, RC- 12, or B 505. Primaquine was active, but pamaquine and <b>pentaquine</b> were only sporadically active. The pre-erythrocytic stages of P. b. yoelii were only slightly sensitive to dapsone, sulfadiazine, and sulformethoxine; they were 10 - 100 times more susceptible to proguanil, cycloguanil, and pyrimethamine. The experimental 6 -aminoquinolines NI 147 / 36, NI 187 / 82, and BA 138 / 111 and the 7 -chlorolincomycin derivative U 24729 were also studied. Experiments in which curative activity against blood-induced infections of P. b. yoelii was evaluated showed that the causal prophylactics act more specifically against the pre-erythrocytic than against the erythrocytic forms. This specificity was most pronounced among the DHFR-inhibitors, whose outstanding activity may be {{explained by the fact that}} the rate of multiplication of the pre-erythrocytic forms of P. b. yoelii is greater than that of other plasmodia used hitherto; it is also greater than the rate shown by the malaria parasites of man and that of the erythrocytic forms of P. b. yoelii itself. We believe that this feature will render P. b. yoelii very useful for determination of the causal prophylactic activity of new compounds, but it may also overrate the potency of drugs that interfere with nucleic acid biosynthesis...|$|E
