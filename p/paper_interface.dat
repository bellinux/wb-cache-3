40|$|Gas {{diffusion}} electrodes (GDEs) {{containing a}} graded distribution of Nafion were prepared and characterized, and their performance as fuel cell cathodes compared to GDEs possessing a uniform distribution of Nafion. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and porosimetry {{are used to}} characterize the variations in electrochemical properties, ionic conductivity, and microstructures. The cathodic performance was improved over uniform electrodes at intermediate {{and high levels of}} polarization when the Nafion content in the GDE was higher toward the catalyst layer/membrane interface and lower toward the catalyst layer/carbon <b>paper</b> <b>interface</b> since this maximizes proton transport in the GDE in the region of greatest ion flux and maximizes porosity in the region of greatest gaseous flux, respectively. Fuel cell performance is much poorer when the gradient of Nafion content is reversed, i. e., highest at the catalyst layer/carbon <b>paper</b> <b>interface</b> since this distribution disfavors proton and gas transport in the regions where they need to be maximized.

Traditional physical handouts and transparencies are giving way to new digital slides and PCs, but the fully digital systems still lag behind the physical artifacts in many aspects such as readability and tangibility.

This paper reports on an exploratory experiment studying {{the use of the}} system in a real-world scenario.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{quantify}} the uncertainty of complex engineering structures subject to inherent randomness in loading, material properties, and geometric parameters is becoming increasingly important {{in the design and}} analysis of structures. Probabilistic finite element analysis provides a means {{to quantify the}} reliability of complex systems in such areas as aerospace and automotive structures. However, for wide acceptance, probabilistic methods must be interfaced with widely used commercial finite element solvers such as ABAQUS, ANSYS, and NASTRAN. In addition, the finite element results are generally post-processed to evaluate a measure of useful life with tools that can compute quantities such as fatigue life. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>interfacing</b> and performance issues involved in coupling probabilistic methods, commercial finite element solvers and post finite element solvers are discussed. An example problem consisting of an integration of the NESSUS probabilistic analysis software, the ABAQUS finite element solver and fatigue life assessment is used to demonstrate concepts. 1...|$|R
