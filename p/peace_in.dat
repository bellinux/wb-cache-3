40|$|This NAI Discussion Paper {{critically}} {{explores the}} concepts, norms {{and practices of}} reconstruction and <b>peace</b> building <b>in</b> post-conflict West Africa, drawing largely {{on the case of}} Liberia and Sierra Leone. It provides an up-to-date analysis and critique {{of the impact of the}} UN-led praxis and practice of <b>peace</b> building <b>in</b> the post-conflict states in the region. The material in this study covers the context of post-conflict reconstruction and <b>peace</b> building <b>in</b> West Africa; the evolution and analysis of the global peace building regime; the architecture of <b>peace</b> building <b>in</b> West Africa; the ‘un-making’ of <b>peace</b> building <b>in</b> Sierra Leone. It also interrogates the basic assumtions that underpin international <b>peace</b> building <b>in</b> Africa, noting that at best, it is designed to promote stability and security rather than a deeper and more sustainable popular and socially rooted peace.

However, Sigtrygg never forgot the insult of the Ulaid, and in 1002 he had his revenge when his soldiers served in Brian's campaign against the Ulaid and ravaged their lands.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Murrays' second mill, Decker Mill, {{had begun}} by 1801 {{to the east}} of Old Mill. It was the same height as Old Mill and doubled the size of the complex.

During its construction, the steam engine was replaced a more powerful 40hp Boulton and Watt engine.|$|E
5|$|Death {{has always}} been a {{critical}} moment for those bereaved, and consequently death is surrounded by taboo-like rules.

40|$|In {{this project}} {{we examine the}} role of history <b>in</b> <b>peace</b> {{education}} <b>in</b> the Israeli-Palestinian context {{through the lens of}} the German historian Reinhart Koselleck. We claim that history is a non-redundant part of <b>peace</b> education <b>in</b> intractable regions, and that the contemporary interpretation of Koselleck gives us the opportunity to shed new light on history as <b>peace</b> education <b>in</b> the Israeli-Palestinian context. We present two positions which exemplifies history as peace education, namely the two ‘new historians’ Benny Morris and Ilan Pappe. We analyse the foundation of Morris and Pappe, and criticise them through a combination of the Koselleckian perspective and the critical tradition of the Israeli philosopher Ilan Gur-Ze’ev. Lastly we discuss how the Lens of Koselleck argues for a re-evaluation of history <b>in</b> <b>peace</b> education <b>in</b> contemporary Israel-Palestine...|$|R
