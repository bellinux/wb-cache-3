The vaulted ceilings in the <b>pavilion</b> feature paintings in a European-influenced style of angels which symbolize the virtuosity of King Solomon, who is regarded as the ideal ruler in the Quran, and a ruler with whom Jahangir identified. Angels directing djinns are also painted on tiles in the ceiling, which also reference King Solomon. Kala Burj was used as a summer <b>pavilion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jay Pritzker <b>Pavilion</b> {{competes with}} Ravinia Park as a Chicago area outdoor music venue.

Although the Music Festival shares <b>pavilion</b> space with several other program series and annual performances, its concerts most Wednesday, Friday and Saturday evenings throughout {{the heart of the}} summer are the core of the pavilion's offerings. Travel guide Frommer's lists the park, <b>pavilion,</b> and these free concerts as some of the best free things to do in Chicago.

50|$|During the Sui (581 - 618) and Tang (618 - 907) dynasties wealthy {{officials}} and scholars incorporated <b>pavilions</b> into their personal gardens. During this period {{the function of}} <b>pavilions</b> shifted from the practical to the aesthetic. <b>Pavilions</b> provided {{a place to sit}} and enjoy the scenery, and they also became a part of the scenery itself, being attractive structures. Brush-and-ink landscape scrolls of the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279) show the isolated <b>pavilions</b> of scholar hermits in mountainous regions. Under the impetus of scholarly tastes for the simplicity of a rustic life, while previously <b>pavilions</b> were constructed from stone, other materials such as bamboo, grass and wood came into use.|$|R

5|$|The first Saltair <b>pavilion</b> was {{destroyed}} by fire on April 22, 1925. A new <b>pavilion</b> was built and the resort was expanded at the same location by new investors, but after years of various challenges, it was eventually destroyed by an arsonist in 1970.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pavilion</b> did {{not prove}} to be durable enough for the {{interactive}} environment of Millennium Park. Kamin feels that the <b>Pavilion</b> was designed more for veneration like indoor museum works of art and outdoor sculpture on pedestals. However, skateboarders, avid fireworks spectators and youthful climbers {{have been part of}} the multiple causation of the decline of the <b>pavilion</b> that led to its closure during the week of August 10–14.|$|E
5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} his {{design for a}} freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a <b>pavilion</b> that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his <b>pavilion,</b> as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E

5000|$|When the Britt Brown Arena closed, {{there was}} much public outcry to not close the <b>pavilions</b> at the Kansas Coliseum. Members of the public who used the <b>pavilions</b> {{frequently}} argued that the INTRUST Bank Arena and neighboring show places are not equipped to host [...] "dirt" [...] events, such as equestrian and livestock shows. On June 30, 2010, the Board of Sedgwick County Commissioners voted to keep the <b>pavilions</b> open through at least 2016 and rename them the Kansas <b>Pavilions.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although it {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for Grant Park's outdoor concert facilities, larger annual events such as the Chicago Blues and Chicago Jazz Festivals and Taste of Chicago are too large for Jay Pritzker <b>Pavilion</b> and continue to be held in and around Petrillo Music Shell. The <b>pavilion</b> has hosted smaller festivals, such as the Chicago Gospel Music Festival, since 2005. Public opinion has been in favor of moving some of the smaller Blues and Jazz festival events to the <b>pavilion,</b> with its better, more modern acoustics. By 2009, as the city grappled with a budget deficit, it considered realigning parts of the larger festivals and made definite plans to move some of the smaller ones to the more modern venue.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the artists}} who {{performed}} with the festival at the <b>pavilion</b> in the 2000s decade are sopranos Karina Gauvin and Erin Wall, tenor Vittorio Grigolo, pianist Stephen Hough, violinists Rachel Barton Pine, James Ehnes, Roby Lakatos, Christian Tetzlaff, and Pinchas Zukerman, and vocalists Otis Clay, Mariza, and Maria del Mar Bonet. All rehearsals at the <b>pavilion</b> {{are open to the}} public and well-attended. The festival is represented by a staff of trained guides, called docents, that field questions and provide educational talks during the rehearsals.|$|E
