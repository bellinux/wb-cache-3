Based on CFD and heat transfer theory, the numerical model of the nozzle in the <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> is developed, and the coupled simulation of the flow fluid and heat transfer is carried out with the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) method. The distributions of the current density, velocity and temperature in the <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>torch,</b> and the torch’s pressure are demonstrated. The present study provides a new means of research in this filed, which could be helpful {{in the future of}} plasma cutting and welding torches...|$|E

First is concerning to the tungsten electrodes for the plasma furnace and welding torches. The second one is the electrodes for air <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>torch.</b> Tungsten electrodes activated with a single and combined additives of rare earth metal oxides, such as La 2 O 3, Y 2 O 3 and CeO 2, are produced and pared with pure and thoriated tungsten electrode conventionally used, {{from the point of view}} of electrode consumption and deformation due to heavy loading, behavior of oxide during arc burning, etc. The results indicated excellent durability and properties of the newly developed electrodes than that of the conventional one. Concerning to the cathode materials for air <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>torch,</b> the consumptions of Re-Y 2 O 3 and Ru-Y 2 O 3 electrodes were compared with those of Hf and Zr electrodes which have been widely used.

40|$|The {{design and}} use of {{equipment}} to perform work in radioactive environments is uniquely challenging. Some tasks require that the equipment be operated by a person wearing a plastic suit or full face respirator and donning several pairs of rubber gloves. Other applications may require that the equipment be remotely controlled. Other important, design considerations include material compatibility, mixed waste issues, tolerance to ionizing radiation, size constraints and weight capacities. As always, there is the ``We need it ASAP`` design criteria. This paper describes four applications where different types of metal cutting technologies were used to successfully perform tasks in radioactive environments. The technologies include a <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>torch,</b> a grinder with an abrasive disk, a hydraulic shear, and a high pressure abrasive water jet cutter...|$|E

In this thesis, {{a study of}} numerical modeling technique is performed for various <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>torches.</b> The <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> process model uses a finite volume method based on the SIMPLEC algorithm along with the solver “FAST- 2 D (Flow Analysis Simulation Tool- 2 D). ” The source code available is a general code and does not include any finite volume grid generator.

This {{modified version of the}} grid generator offers users a great flexibility in grid and geometry choice, and offers the advantage of easy variations in boundary conditions. The work presented also includes a detailed study of the effect of the radiation model and the cathode current density boundary condition on the distribution of the plasma field quantities.

40|$|Results of a {{preliminary}} experimental study {{to investigate the}} feasibility of reformation of hydrocar-bon fuels into hydrogen and carbon by high-power, electric arc pyrolysis are presented. The goal is to obtain the high energy density of gaseous hydrogen fuel for combustion while still achieving the volumetric efficiency of much denser hydrocarbon fuels. A 1. 6 MW arc heater was modified to run on gaseous hydrocarbons, and a diagnostic chamber was developed to provide quantitative meas-urements of the products of pyrolysis. An electrical fault in the 1. 6 MW power supply occurred early in the test program, thus the experimental data were obtained by using a commercial <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> that was modified to run on methane. Preliminary results showed significant carbon deposi-tion on the cold trap and identification of gaseous hydrogen via emission spectroscopy...|$|E
30|$|Cantoro et al. [108] {{also used}} windowed {{standard}} deviation and the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) approach {{to map the}} variance intensity of the turbulence in each region close to the plasma jet. They used a 450  W xenon arc lamp and a z-type schlieren setup to analyze a 25 A cutting torch. Prevosto et al. [27] proposed a technique based on the reconstruction by Abel inversion of refractive index, arc temperature and ionized-species density profiles. Their reconstruction method requires knowledge of the pressure {{in the region of}} investigation; so they focused at 3.5  mm below the nozzle on the torch axis, far beyond the shock front of a typical <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>torch,</b> and a position where atmospheric pressure could be assumed. They investigated a 30 A cutting torch on a rotating anode by using a z-type schlieren system with a vertical knife edge and a 20  mW continuous laser source (main wavelength 632.8  nm) with a bandwidth filter to block the arc light. The same authors [109] improved their technique by using an additional laser source (main wavelength 514  nm), another bandwidth filter and a beam-splitter to allow the use of both laser sources. As the refractive index of the electrons is strongly dependent on the light wavelength of the probe beam, using two different light sources and modified two-temperature Saha equations the authors were able to separately evaluate the electron and the heavy particle temperatures.|$|E

50|$|After {{the members}} to be {{demolished}} are removed by crane {{they must be}} fragmented into pieces small enough to decontaminate. It is expected that the primary contamination of most demolished elements will be loose surface contamination (mostly dust) and can largely be removed. Decontamination will take place using vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters, grit blasting (for steel elements), and scarifying (for concrete elements). Once decontaminated to the maximum extent practical, pieces will be further fragmented for eventual disposal. Fragmentation tools include <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> <b>torches,</b> diamond circular <b>cutting</b> wheels, and diamond wire cutting. The tools selected for the demolition process were selected upon {{the basis of a}} number of factors, including minimization of individual and collective radiation exposure, the amount of secondary waste generated, the feasibility of remote operation, the cutting efficiency, fire safety, capital cost and operating costs.|$|R
40|$|Evaporation of hafnium cathode in a <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> arc <b>torch</b> was {{investigated}} numerically and experimentally {{to assess the}} effects of cathode diameter and operating parameters such as gas pressure, gas flow rate and arc current. A numerical model was developed for arc plasma with consideration of hafnium cathode evaporation. Using this model, the surface cathode temperature {{and the amount of}} cathode mass loss caused by evaporation were predicted for different operating parameters. Simulated results show that the cathode surface temperature decreases at the hafnium cathode centre with increasing gas flow rate and cathode diameter. However, an increase in gas pressure elevates the surface cathode temperature in the radial range of 0. 35 mm. The total amount of mass loss of hafnium cathode evaporation was predicted to be enhanced with increasing gas flow rate, gas pressure and cathode diameter as well. Comparison of the calculated results with experimentally obtained results shows good agreement in terms of the average surface cathode temperature, with variation in gas pressure and cathode diameter. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cutting {{of metal}} {{structures}} {{is a regular}} need in decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of contaminated Department of Energy facilities. <b>Plasma</b> <b>torch</b> <b>cutting</b> is efficient, {{but there are many}} cases and situations where it is not appropriate. Sometimes the fire hazard cannot be tolerated; sometimes it is more of a contaminant dispersal issue. Circular saws, band saws, and reciprocating saws are often the necessary tool of choice. Sawing is a complex action that is difficult to execute with remote manipulation without extensive task-specific fixturing of the tool to minimize blade chatter and binding. Extensive fixturing leads to the requirement for multiple tools for each minor variation of the task. This drives up the cost of remote tooling for a given D&D large-scale task, generates clutter and tool storage issues, impacts tool reliability due to complexity, and increases the required spare parts. This paper presents an investigation of the saw tool chatter issues, ways to detect chatter for the control system, and compensation methods that lead to a new approach to tooling use with remote manipulation–smart tooling. I. BACKGROUND It is typically difficult to saw with servomanipulators without extensive fixturing. The saw blade must remain orthogonal to the work piece cut in at least two axes, and the feed rate must be appropriate for the material and th...|$|R
