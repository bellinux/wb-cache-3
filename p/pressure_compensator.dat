The average shower uses 15.8 gallons (59.7 liters) and lasts for 7.7 minutes at average flow rate of 2.1 gallons per minute (gpm) (7.9 liters per minute). On average, in a household of average size (2.65 persons) 12.4 showers are taken each week. For comparison, a navy shower lasts only 2 minutes and can use less than 3 gallons (11.4 liters) of water. The most water-frugal approach {{is used by the}} crew of the International Space Station (ISS) who use less than 1 gallon (4 liters) to bathe. For showerheads, the standard for maximum flow rate continues to be 2.5 gallons per minute (gpm) (9.4 liters per minute (lpm)) as set by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. However, manufacturers now offer ultra-efficiency showerheads with maximum flow rate below 2.0 gpm (7.6 lpm). Examples include a showerhead with flow rate of 1.75 gpm (6.61 lpm) at high water pressure and 1.45 gpm (5.48 lpm) at low pressure, or a showerhead with three pressure compensated flow rates (by non-removable <b>pressure</b> <b>compensator)</b> with options of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 gpm (1.9, 3.8, 5.7 lpm). A widespread use of more efficient showerheads (with flow rates of 1.6 gpm) would reduce average water use for showering by 2 gphd (7.6 lphd)(or by 8 percent).|$|E

The research is focused on improving the reliability of the <b>pressure</b> <b>compensator</b> that is an important equipment of the primary circuit. In order to simulate such a situation, the stand has been developed to simulate the design of the pressurizer of the PWR- 440 reactor, in particular an elliptical shape of the upper lid which has a steam outlet pipe {{at the top of the}} construction that creates conditions for occurrence of such water hammers. For the experiments, an installation has been created that makes it possible to measure and record the water hammering that occur when the tanks are filled. Measurement of the amplitude of the water hammering was carried out by a specially developed piezoelectric sensor, and the registration – by a light-beam oscilloscope. The technique of carrying out the experiment is described and the results of an experimental study of the water hammers arising when the vessels are completely filled are presented. Quantitative data were obtained on the amplitudes of the hydraulic impacts depending on the rate of filling of the vessel and the diameter of the outlet, the maximum pressure of the hydraulic shock was 7 – 9 atm. Comparison of calculated and experimental data has been performed. The allowable discrepancy is explained by the calculated value of the system stiffness coefficient, which did not take into account the presence of welded seams in the tank that imparts the system with additional rigidity. The calculated relationships are obtained, that make it possible to estimate the amplitudes of the water hammers through the acceleration of the water level in front of the outlet from a vessel with an elliptical bottom. The possibility of a water hammer in the <b>pressure</b> <b>compensator</b> is demonstrated by experiment and by theoretical calculations.

The pressure of particular sections can be increased by means of a novel hydraulic circuit. Therefore, a recovery unit is connected in series with a hydraulic accumulator via a special valve in the reflux of the actuators.

In the new circuit, each actuator section is automatically connected either to the tank or to a hydraulic accumulator in dependence of its individual and the systems load situation via an additional valve.

In this research, three separate but related investigations were carried out by the author to improve the precision and speed of positioning the hydraulic robot and to reduce its cost. The first investigation was the determination of the kinematics of a new positioning mechanism which has a tripod arrangement of hydraulic cylinders to improve the positioning stiffness of the robot manipulator. The second investigation was {{the development and implementation of}} an optimal tracking control algorithm to improve the precision of the manipulator tracking. The third investigation was the design of a tracking control hydraulic system using a low cost stepping motor driven proportional valve incorporating a <b>pressure</b> <b>compensator</b> to stabilize the flow gain of the valve and automatically compensate for the load disturbances. The design considerations, theoretical analysis, (including the derivation and solution of the inverse kinematics problem) and experimental testing which were related to these three investigations are presented in this thesis. A kinematics model of the drilling robot manipulator was first established by deriving the homogeneous transformation matrices for describing the relationship between the links of the robot manipulator and its work space. A combination of analytical and numerical methods were then used to solve the inverse kinematics problem of the drilling robot manipulator. A three dimensional simulation was then developed to verify the validity of the solution of the inverse kinematics problem. To implement an optimal tracking control algorithm, the dynamics of an experimental hydraulic robot were analyzed and a multiple input fifth order discrete state space model was established for the pitch control hydraulic system of the robot. An optimal tracking control algorithm was then derived and experimentally implemented to improve the tracking precision and positioning speed of the pitch control system of the hydraulic robot. The design of the controller was based on the dynamic model of the hydraulic robot and the optimal tracking control algorithm. A Kalman filter was designed for observing the state variables of the system. System identification was carried out using a triangle pulse input method that was developed to estimate the parameters of the tracking control system. This method was faster and caused less disturbance to the positioning mechanism than the sine wave and the random signal methods. It also had the advantage of being able to estimate the parameters of the system for both directions of motion of the actuator. A hydraulic circuit, which used a stepping motor driven valve incorporating a <b>pressure</b> <b>compensator</b> to stabilize the flow gain of the valve and which automatically compensated for the load disturbances, was designed and tested in the pitch optimal tracking control system.

40|$|An {{innovative}} and unique working concept for variable delivery external gear machines (VD-EGMs) {{is presented in}} this study. The proposed design not only encompasses all the well-known and important advantages of traditional external gear machines but also introduces a feature for varying the displacement (flow delivered per unit revolution). The novel principle of achieving variable displacement in EGMs {{is based on the}} variable timing of the connections of the displacement chambers/tooth space volumes (TSVs) with the inlet/outlet ports. The timing variation is obtained by the addition of a simple element (called a “slider”) within the lateral bushings. The position of the slider determines the amount of flow displaced per unit revolution. Starting from the geometry of the design and the proposed concept, analytical expressions for predicting displacement variation, flow rate and input shaft torque were derived. With this working principle, the range of variation of the displacement can be significantly increased by modifying the gear profiles. Therefore, in this work, novel gears with asymmetric teeth profile are designed {{with the help of a}} novel tool developed particularly for this process. However, due to the inherent nature of the displacing action of the EGM due to the meshing of the gears, it is not possible to achieve a full flow variation from 0 %- 100 %. Therefore, to maximize the range of flow variation while considering all the other important performance features of the machine to be maintained at an optimum, a multi-objective genetic algorithm based optimization method is used to identify the optimal design of gears and grooves in the lateral bushings. The performance of the design configurations were analyzed in detail by using HYGESIM (HYdraulic GEar machines SIMulator) Simulation tool. An optimal design of the machine was identified which was capable of maximizing the reduction (100 %– 68 %) in flow variation, thereby providing lower delivery flow at the expense of reduced torque (hence reduced input power). The validity of the proposed novel VD-EGM was demonstrated using a proof of concept test performed using the prototypes of the optimal design. The simulated results provided by HYGESim were validated with those obtained from the measured data thereby accomplishing a very good agreement between the experimental data and the model predictions. The successful proof of concept test results, lead to the design of two flow control actuation systems which represent a manual system and an automatic pressure compensated system. The performances of the prototypes were analyzed using a steady state test rig. Experimental results show that the flow rate and input shaft torque reduces proportionally with displacement in the case of the manual flow control system. The measured volumetric efficiencies at lower levels of displacement were found to be lesser than those at maximum displacement, which are in line with the performance of typical other VD units in the market. The flow control actuation system based on <b>pressure</b> <b>compensator</b> principle was designed to reduce the flow automatically depending on the pressure at the outlet. Experimental performance of the VD-EGM with pressure compensated actuation system show that the delivered flow reduces automatically after the preset pressure is reached. The input shaft torque was also seen to reduce proportionally with the corresponding displacement. The experimental results show positive potentials in the working concept of the VD-EGM, which would lead to a new direction in designing cost effective VD units that can be used in place of fixed displacement units to provide the additional flow on demand functionality; thereby significantly increasing the overall energy efficiency of the hydraulic system in which the VD-EGM is used. ...|$|E
40|$|A knuckle boom crane is {{characterized}} by being a versatile machine that during operation experiences large load variations caused by the changes in position and payload. Common uses are as a mobile loader crane mounted on trucks and in offshore applications. Since their introduction the use of counterbalance valves (CBV) have been the de facto standard on load-carrying hydraulically actuated applications like the knuckle boom crane. It offers a simple and practical solution {{to one of the}} issues of mobile cranes: Controlling the load safely when lowering. By law (e. g. European Standard) the hydraulic circuit of load-carrying applications is required to contain a load holding protection device. The classical way of actuating such a crane is to use a circuit containing a <b>pressure</b> <b>compensator</b> valve and a directional control valve (DCV) in series with a CBV. This circuit {{is referred to as the}} base circuit. It is well known that this combination of valve components tends to introduce instability in the base circuit. This is mainly a problem when the controlled actuator is subjected to a negative load, because this will require the CBV to throttle the return ﬂow. The instability presents itself as pressure oscillations in the hydraulic circuit which cause the mechanical structure to oscillate. The consequence of the oscillations is a decreased accuracy of the boom motion which create a safety risk, reduces productivity and introduces an undesirable extra fatigue load. The objective of this project was to investigate the oscillations created in the hydraulic circuit of knuckle boom cranes and reduce their severity. The effort has mainly been split in two: First, was looked into existing solutions with the focus on the ones not requiring control systems to function. This was done with reliability and robustness in mind. The investigation identiﬁed the pressure control valve (PCV) as the best commercially available solution. The use of a PCV to control the inlet ﬂow in crane applications was rather uncharted territory. The valve, a DCV with a pressure control spool manufactured by Danfoss, has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. A linear stability analysis has been performed with the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. This analysis of the valve used together with a hydraulically actuated experimental setup indicates that the combination is stable in all situations. The use of the pressure control spool in the DCV is a simple and robust solution to the stability problem of the base circuit. Not related to the PCV’s ability to reduce the oscillations the use of it in knuckle boom cranes, however, comes with certain drawbacks. The drawbacks include a load dependent dead band and a load dependent inlet ﬂow. In order to achieve similar behavior as the normal pressure compensated DCV a closed loop control system is required. These issues are addressed in this project, where control schemes are proposed to handle them. In the second part the perspective of the search was broadened to include solutions using control systems. This has lead to the development of a novel, patent pending, concept that signiﬁcantly reduces the oscillations of the base circuit. It introduces a secondary circuit where a low-pass ﬁltered value of the load pressure is generated and fed back to the compensator of the ﬂow supply valve. The work has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement of stability obtained for a system with the novel concept implemented both theoretically and experimentally. The stability has been investigated both using a linear and a nonlinear model of a hydraulically actuated experimental setup. The presented novel concept circuit has the same steady state characteristics as the base circuit but without the corresponding oscillatory nature. Because the main spool of the DCV is not used for stabilising the system, the novel concept can be combined with any feedback control strategy. In this project, the novel concept is presented with linear actuators only. However,its use covers circuits with rotational actuators and CBV’s as well. The base circuit is used as a reference for comparison. Therefore, the stability of the base circuit is also investigated with a linear model...|$|E

The first part is called “Modeling and Analysis of an Excavator System’ and {{the title of the}} second part is “Modeling and Analysis of Tractor Rear Hitch Controls. ” The topics discussed in this thesis include modeling of an excavator sytem and the modeling of an agricultural tractor’s rear hitch controls. The objectives of this thesis have been to develop a fast simulation model to replicate the functioning of an excavators system and the analysis of a tractor rear hitch controls. Both topics are of substantial importance in today’s industrial research scenario. With a large demand being placed on more intelligent development of construction and agricultural equipment to meet the changing needs of the worlds economy, this thesis offers its contribution in the meeting of these requirements.

From the viewpoint of designing and tuning an efficient control system, an excavator is a very complex nonlinear plant. To design and tune such a complex control system an extremely good nonlinear model of the plant is necessary. The problem of modeling an excavator is considered in this document; a nonlinear mathematical model of an excavator has been developed using the AMESim® modeling environment to replicate actual operating conditions. The excavator model is described by detailed models of the main pump, mobile valve block, actuators and a completely developed kinematic model. The objective of this research is to develop a complete simulation model of an excavator with the capability of reproducing the actual characteristics of the system. This part presents the developed model of a complete excavator system with detailed verification of individual components and preliminary results of a complete excavator system. PART 2 This part of the thesis describes the work carried out towards mathematical modeling and analysis of a tractor rear hitch control valve (HCV). The HCV operates in two modes namely lifting and lowering. The lifting circuit incorporates a pressure compensated flow control valve, while the lowering circuit is gravity assisted. The HCV is a load-sensing system; load-sensing systems and pressure compensated valves are classified as feedback systems. Systems with feedback offer scope for tuning and towards this objective the <b>pressure</b> <b>compensator</b> has been linearised and its characteristics analyzed. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a complete mathematical model of the HCV. This would help to better understand its functionality and to quantify the energy losses across its components...|$|E
