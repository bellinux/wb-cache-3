25|$|Pantheism {{holds that}} God is the {{universe}} and the universe is God, whereas Panentheism holds that God contains, but is not identical to, the Universe.

25|$|She and McClellan {{turned their}} private video short into a feature-length documentary, Ben's Vortex, {{released}} in 2012. It considers all the theories regarding its subject's disappearance: an accident as originally believed, a murder or coverup {{of the accident}} as the McDaniels have sometimes alleged, {{and the possibility of}} a staged disappearance to allow Ben to escape his problems. In support of the latter, which McClellan has stated he believes, the film <b>paints</b> <b>a</b> more negative picture of the McDaniels' lives prior to Ben's disappearance, suggesting that Paul McDaniel's death may not have been a stroke but rather a prescription drug overdose and that Ben, too, was addicted to the same drugs.|$|E
25|$|Most {{researchers}} found {{that there is a}} close linkage between geographic features and telecommunication application; this linkage shows that geographic accessibility relates significantly to telecommunication access. Generally, the geographic feature of each region from East to Central to West is marked by plain, hill and mountain respectively. The second factors are demographic indicators; the population density of these regions appears inversely opposite their geographical elevation: the Eastern region has the highest population density, followed by the Central region, while the West, the most geographically elevated, has the lowest population density. The third factor is the level of economic development in these regions, which <b>paints</b> <b>a</b> similar picture: the level of economic development is closely related to Internet access.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} work that Jonson wrote about Boulstred was his “Epitaph on Cecilia Bulstrode,” written in {{response}} to her death. This poem <b>paints</b> <b>a</b> very different picture of Boulstred than that of his epigram. In fact, it seems to retract each of the charges made in the first point by point. Jonson calls her a virgin, teacher to Pallas and Cynthia, conscientious, and good, vastly different from his epigram. The reason behind Jonson’s supposed change of heart is unknown. The likely reason is {{that he wanted to}} gain the favor of Lucy Russell, which he had been attempting to do for years. However, another explanation could be that he experienced true regret for his slanderous words after hearing of her painful death.|$|E
