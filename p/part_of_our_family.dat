2500|$|Several former {{cast members}} {{returned}} for the finale. Desmond Harrington reprised {{his role as}} Chuck's uncle, Jack Bass. News of Connor Paolo and Taylor Momsen's returns surfaced on October 16, 2012 when Kelly Rutherford posted on Instagram a picture of them on set. Katie Cassidy, Ella Rae Peck, Jessica Szohr, and Willa Holland also returned for small appearances. Long-time narrator Kristen Bell appeared in the episode as herself reading her lines alongside Rachel Bilson. On Bell's cameo Savage told: [...] "It was really funny and very, very special to be shooting with her. She's an intimate <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>family</b> but yet we never get to see her. To {{be able to make}} her a part of our storytelling just felt like the perfect way to crown her work with us over the years." [...] She added: [...] "If you’re going to have those two ladies together in a scene then we wanted to have fun and play to their strengths. So Josh Schwartz and I came up with the whole idea... To be able to have Kristen onscreen for the finale was great. And to have Rachel do it with her was just the icing on the cake." [...] The episode also included cameo-appearances by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Lisa Loeb. Loeb, who had previously appeared in the show during the first season, ended up as Rufus' final partner. The writers made this choice so {{that he would not be}} alone but with someone from [...] "his world", another musician.|$|E

'Well,' said Captain Charteris, {{apparently}} {{so little}} aided by his thoughts as to see {{no hope of}} overcoming his perplexity without expressing it, 'the truth is that, though I had not meant to say anything of it, for I think relations should come first, I believe poor Sandbrook would have preferred it.' And while her colour deepened, and she locked her trembling fingers together to keep them still, he went on. 'Yes! you can't think how often I called myself a dozen fools for having parted him from his children! Never held up his head again! I could get him to take interest in nothing--every child he saw he was only comparing to one or other of them. After the year turned, and he talked of coming home, he was more cheerful; but strangely enough, for those last days at Hyeres, though he seemed better, his spirits sank unaccountably, and he would talk more of the poor little thing that he lost than of these! Then he had a letter from you which set him sighing, and wishing they could always have such care! Altogether, I thought to divert him by taking him on that expedition, but-- Well, I've been provoked with him many a time, {{but there was more}} of the real thing in him than in the rest of us, and I feel as if the best <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>family</b> were gone.' ...|$|E

Communication {{has always been an}} essential <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lives, education, <b>family</b> relations, business, government and other organizational activities. As telecommunication technology has advanced, so has the need for the interception of telecommunications and access by law enforcement authorities. In addition, lawful interception and the way it is performed have {{played an important role in}} the effectiveness of the monitoring of communications. Telecommunications interception and access law should also place a great deal of importance on the privacy of the individual as well as the needs of national security, crime investigation, counter terrorism efforts and economic growth. This paper looks at the applicability of regulations aimed at controlling telecommunications interception and access law in Arab countries. The Australian telecommunications interception and access law is taken as a relevant template that can be examined in light of Arab countries needs and requirements. Various issues unique to Arab countries need to be examined prior to adopting the Australian framework wholesale...|$|R

60|$|The {{transformation}} {{through which}} the external relations of England passed {{at the end of}} the seventeenth century is symbolized by two very separate and definite steps; the first the accession of a Dutch king and the second the accession of a German king. In the first were present all the features that can partially make an unnatural thing natural. In the second we have the condition in which even those effecting it can hardly call it natural, but only call it necessary. William of Orange was like a gun dragged into the breach of a wall; a foreign gun indeed, and one fired in a quarrel more foreign than English, but still a quarrel in which the English, and especially the English aristocrats, could play a great <b>part.</b> George <b>of</b> Hanover was simply something stuffed into a hole in the wall by English aristocrats, who practically admitted that they were simply stopping it with rubbish. In many ways William, cynical as he was, carried on the legend of the greater and grimmer Puritanism. He was in private conviction a Calvinist; and nobody knew or cared what George was except that he was not a Catholic. He was at home the partly republican magistrate of what had once been a purely republican experiment, and among the cleaner if colder ideals of the seventeenth century. George was when he was at home pretty much what the King of the Cannibal Islands was when he was at home--a savage personal ruler scarcely logical enough to be called a despot. William was a man of acute if narrow intelligence; George was a man of no intelligence. Above all, touching the immediate effect produced, William was married to a Stuart, and ascended the throne hand-in-hand with a Stuart; he was a familiar figure, and already a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> royal <b>family.</b> With George there entered England something that had scarcely been seen there before; something hardly mentioned in mediæval or Renascence writing, except as one mentions a Hottentot--the barbarian from beyond the Rhine.|$|R
40|$|Since the 1990 ’s, the Internet {{has played}} a central role in our daily lives. The Internet is an {{integral}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> personal, business, <b>family,</b> research, entertainment, academic and social life. However, there are social implications in using the Internet that are dependent on categories such as gender, age, ethnicity and cultural attributes. This social aspect can play a detrimental role in the expression of human anxiety on the Internet. An anxiety is a complex phenomenon that requires further elaboration. Thus, the aim of this thesis is to investigate human anxiety, or specifically, whether Internet anxiety can be conceptualized and measured. This thesis utilizes literature, qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, and a triangulation validation approach to conceptualize and measure the Internet anxiety phenomenon. In particular, the aim is to explore anxiety levels of Internet participants to develop and validate an Internet anxiety scale based on earlier research on Internet anxiety. The results of the dissertation present a two phase study. In Phase I, a smaller set of studies were conducted with a limited sample size. In Phase II, the research topic was investigated using 385 participants. Based on a number of studies or experiments, the state-of-the-art discovered in this thesis is creation, design, and validation of two scales, the Self-Assessment Scale (SAS) and a Modified Internet Anxiety Scale (MIAS) for measuring users’ anxieties on the Internet. The result of this dissertation is a conceptualization and measurement of various types of Internet anxiety and measurement of affective feelings of users on the Internet. As a proof-of-concept of measuring Internet anxiety, this thesis describes the author’s implementation of three sets of tools: MyAnxiety, introducing Internet anxieties types; Intelligentia, for collecting Internet anxieties types; and MyIAControl tool, implemented as a browser plug-in, for measuring affective feelings of users on the Internet. Conclusions drawn from the results show that these empirically validated scales and tools might be useful for researchers and practitioners in understanding and measuring the Internet anxiety phenomenon further...|$|R

These deliberately preceded Governor John Hindmarsh on the Buffalo to enable preparations including the printing of the proclamation in advance of his formal arrival on 28 December. Thomas's wife Mary (1787-1875) published The Diary of Mary Thomas, in which she described the journey on the Africaine and the early years in South Australia.
