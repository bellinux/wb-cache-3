5000|$|On 8 April 2014, the Air Force held an {{industry}} day for companies interested in competing for JSTARS Recap; attendees included Boeing, Bombardier Aerospace, and Gulfstream Aerospace. Air Force <b>procurement</b> <b>documents</b> {{call for a}} replacement for the Boeing 707-based E-8C as a [...] "business jet class" [...] airframe that is [...] "significantly smaller and more efficient." [...] Current pre-decisional requirements are for an aircraft with a 10-13 person crew with a 3.96 - 6.1 m radar array. Though smaller than the crew and radar size of the E-8C, it could be challenging to meet those demands in a typical business jet and could require a relatively large platform. The staffing and sensor requirements are comparable to the cancelled Northrop Grumman E-10 MC2A, which was originally planned as the E-8's replacement. The Air Force plans to award a contract {{at the end of}} FY 2016, a relatively quick pace partly to avoid budget redistributions to other programs. Replacing the E-8C avoids nearly $11 billion in operations and sustainment costs needed to keep the fleet relevant and airworthy. The aircraft is to fly at 38,000 ft for eight hours. Program managers are interested in integrating an FAA-certified flight deck, aerial refueling capability, and potentially full motion video and the joint range extension applications protocol to transmit data to joint agencies at further distances. Another potential feature could be beyond-line-of-sight communications with unmanned aerial vehicles like the RQ-4 Global Hawk.|$|E

The new Act on Public Procurement became effective in October 1, 2016. As a result of such a short period of its effectiveness its subject matter has not been comprehensively elaborated yet and vice versa it provides a very wide scope for discussions and expert opinions. The aim of my thesis was mainly to summarize the legislation of <b>procurement</b> <b>documents</b> and evaluation of tenders and to assess the impact of the new legislation in practice, both from the position of the contracting authority and the supplier, including the applicability of the existing case law on relevant legal issues. For purposes of my thesis I used the available sources and literature.

30|$|What other effects did the consultant’s report have? A {{civil servant}} at the {{regional}} cooperation body argued that the consultant’s report was crucial to {{the outcome of the}} <b>procurement</b> <b>document.</b> He stated that “The PTA bought everything in the report” [47]. In addition, the PTA president thought the consultant’s report was relevant, not in a way that changed the <b>procurement</b> <b>document,</b> but rather as it ensured that the process was on the right track. A local politician thought that the consultant’s report was an addition to the procurement report. He believed that the consultant’s report was more research based, which was also important to consider when conducting a procurement. Regarding the timing of the completion of the consultant’s report, the informant believed it was right: “We had time to reflect on the report when it wasn’t too old – we can’t use old data in these kinds of processes” [42]. One consequence of the consultant’s report, besides allowing the regional cooperation body to influence the procurement process, was that other actors (including the PTA) also used the report as a resource to gather political support for their decisions. Not only did the actor mobilizing power resources in the initial stage benefit from this resource mobilization, but other actors could also use the resources to their own benefit.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a survey show that {{both public and private}} {{building}} clients in Sweden, to varying extents, include environmental requirements in their <b>procurement</b> <b>documents.</b> The requirements identified have been classified into six categories primarily related to building and demolition waste, building material, contractors' environmental work, ecological aspects, construction work and other. One conclusion is that requirements regarding the separation of waste and a contractor's environmental policy are considered important, since they are stipulated in the majority of projects. Another finding is that requirements related to operation and especially to energy use are not considered sufficiently. Structured interviews were conducted with three of the clients who at that time of the survey had developed the most complete <b>procurement</b> <b>documents</b> with regard to environmental requirements. The aim of the interviews was to investigate how the stipulation of requirements, the evaluation of environmental aspects and the verification of environmental requirements were carried out. The conclusion drawn is that Swedish clients find the stipulation of requirements relatively uncomplicated, but find the evaluation of environmental impact, mainly related to selection of materials, problematic due to inadequate evaluation models.

40|$|Public {{procurement}} laws {{outline the}} rules and procedures used by public agencies to select design-build teams {{to work on their}} projects. However {{it is up to the}} individual project selection committees to develop the specific criterion used to select the best design-build team for their project. Design-build teams assemble their qualification and proposal packages using the criteria listed in the <b>procurement</b> <b>documents</b> to put their team in the best position to be awarded the contract. If the submittal requirements or selection criteria are vague and not well stated committee members may have to interpret the information supplied by the proposers. This interpretation could be clouded with personal bias contaminating the integrity of the selection process. If a more comprehensive list of selection criteria and supporting submittal requirements were available to selection committees, then the <b>procurement</b> <b>documents</b> could be drafted to better ensure that the packets submitted from each proposer will contain the necessary information to facilitate the evaluation of each of the criteria. This paper examined the submittal requirements and corresponding selection criteria from various types of public school design-build projects.

40|$|The aim of {{this book}} is to make {{recommendations}} concerning the improvement of public procurement law in Indonesia. The author identifies five fundamental problems commonly arising in the pre-contractual phase in Indonesia: the <b>procurement</b> <b>document</b> may be prepared {{in a way that}} favours certain bidders, but it is questionable whether legal procedure to review the <b>procurement</b> <b>document</b> is available; corruption may occur within procuring entities which may, in turn, lead to distrust towards the entities regarding its impartiality in relation to the handling of the administrative appeal; the reasons for awarding the contract may not be transparent; the procedures for seeking redress are erratic; finally, the availability of remedies is uncertain. The author adopts two methods for the pursuit of his research. First, three principles of good governance are discussed (equality, transparency and accountability), and five principles of good public procurement are identified. These five principles are outlined as: equal opportunity, equal treatment, transparency including its limitations to protect commercially sensitive information, clarity about the forum for redress, and the availability of effective remedies. Second, a comparative methodology is undertaken, examining the law relating to public procurement procedures in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. From these approaches, the author draws out recommendations for the legislature, the administration and the judiciary in Indonesia. Although this book concentrates on the case of Indonesia, ideas brought forth in the discussion may be applicable and useful to other countries sharing similar issues...|$|R

40|$|The {{design-build}} (DB) {{project delivery}} system (PDS) {{has been widely}} applied and studied in the construction industry. Its advantages include shortened project duration, lowered risk to the owner, improved project performance, and possibly reduced cost. Researchers have also studied the factors related to the improved performance in DB projects, especially in the building and transportation industries. Compared to the building and highway industries, the application of DB in water/wastewater (WW) projects has been rarely studied before. One of the potential factors that may influence project performance is procurement duration (PD). By focusing on DB applied to WW projects, this study explored the relationship between PD (from Request for Proposal issue date to proposal due date) and project success. The project success criteria was defined as cost and schedule growth, which were objective measurements and thus provided more convincing data analysis. Project data was collected through an on-line questionnaire given to owners and design-builders who had experience in DB WW projects. The data was used to analyze how PD impacts project performance in terms of cost and schedule growth. The relationships between PD and performance in DB WW projects were compared to DB transportation projects. Both similarities and differences were found. To explore the reasons of these similarities and differences, content analysis was conducted to compare the DB WW and transportation <b>procurement</b> <b>documents.</b> Variables were defined and analyzed based on their frequency of use within <b>procurement</b> <b>documents.</b> Hypotheses were given based on {{the similarities and differences}} found between DB WW and transportation projects’ procurement items as to which might influence the project success.

This report was then to be printed {{on behalf of the}} regional cooperation body and sent to all municipalities and the county council. The consulting firm made four alternative suggestions regarding the new traffic routing system, but was also required to analyse the alternative that the PTA had proposed in the <b>procurement</b> <b>document</b> (this was a fifth alternative [43]).

40|$|Joint bidding is the {{practice}} {{of two or more}} independent suppliers submitting a single bid, a widespread practice in private and public procurement. This practice may generate efficiencies through synergies and information sharing, but may also be abused {{to reduce the number of}} competitors or-even worse-to facilitate or enforce collusion among them; therefore, it is often regulated. In this paper, we first present results from a survey on the regulation of joint bidding in European public <b>procurement,</b> <b>documenting</b> how the existence and the type of regulation differ across countries, and that-where present-regulation is often related to the ability of an individual firm to be admitted as a solo bidder. Borrowing from the theories of joint bidding in auctions and of horizontal mergers and joint ventures in oligopoly, we then review the basic economics of bidding consortia and the effects that these can have in terms of bidding competition, coordination among firms, risk management, exploitation of other synergies, and entry. Finally, we assess the relative degrees of restrictiveness of several practical criteria that could be used to create consistent regulatory requirements for bidding consortia in public procurement. The only strong conclusion that we can draw is that there is an urgent need for further theoretical and empirical or experimental research on this very important issue for public procurement.
