5|$|The telenovela {{features}} Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro, {{who both}} {{appeared in the}} successful telenovela Muñeca Brava, as lead actors. The {{relationship between the two}} was more than professional; Facundo Arana had spontaneously been offered a guest appearance on the Russian series A ritmo de tango starring Oreiro. Both actors agreed to appear in You Are the One on the condition that they worked together. As a result, the program design was decided only after both were confirmed in the leading roles. Oreiro delayed filming proposals in Israel, Spain, and Uruguay, and the recording of her fourth music album to join the project. As in Muñeca Brava, the narrative of You Are the One revolves around a wealthy suitor and a <b>poor</b> <b>woman,</b> but unlike the former program it does not concentrate all the characters on a single narrative context. You Are the One organizes two contexts for both the rich and the poor, each one with its own characteristic locations and supporting characters.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> and {{the poverty}} relief system in New York's "Burned-Over District," the region comprising the Erie Canal corridor, {{during the period}} 1821 - 1861. The study offers {{a response to the}} historiography of middle-class formation in the region, which has largely omitted discussion of the working class and particularly the poor. While charitable work was critical in middle-class women's activities, <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> themselves are shadowy figures in the historiography. The following dissertation attempts to elucidate who <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> in the region were and why and how they used the poverty relief system. The study also uses gender as a framework of analysis in examining the middle-class discourse about poverty, the poor and especially <b>poor</b> <b>women.</b> In this discourse, able-bodied married and widowed women appeared as relatively deserving of assistance or as "worthy" poor for much of the period while single mothers and childless single women appeared as "unworthy.

40|$|Feminism {{has long}} been {{concerned}} with privacy. Second-wave feminists assailed the divide {{between the public and}} the private spheres that trapped women in the home, excluded them from the workforce, and subjected them to domestic abuse. Second-wave feminists also argued in favor of a sphere of privacy that would allow women to make reproductive choices without state interference. These were powerful critiques of existing power structures, but they tended to overlook the experiences of <b>poor</b> <b>women.</b> As a condition of receiving welfare benefits, <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> have been subjected to drug tests, and they continue to face unannounced home inspections by government officials, fingerprinting, and restrictions on their reproductive choices. These formal welfare requirements overlay routinized surveillance of <b>poor</b> <b>women,</b> who must comply with extreme verification requirements to establish eligibility, travel to scattered offices to procure needed approvals, reappear in person at welfare offices at regular intervals to prove their ongoing eligibility, and answer intrusive questions about their child rearing and intimate relationships. Thus, while many Americans are uneasy about their privacy in a time of technological transformation, the harms <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> face from privacy deprivations go far beyond unease. This essay describes the privacy invasions experienced by welfare mothers and how the law has shaped their rights to privacy. It then explores how second-wave feminism considered privacy as experienced by <b>poor</b> <b>women,</b> and it analyzes whether third-wave feminism is up to the task of better securing privacy rights for <b>poor</b> <b>women.</b> The conclusion suggests a feminist advocacy strategy that would include the voices of <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> within a new conception of privacy...|$|R

500|$|Rumors that Isabeau and Orléans were lovers {{began to}} circulate, a {{relationship}} that was considered incestuous. Whether the two were intimate has been questioned by contemporary historians, including Gibbons who believes the rumor may have been planted as propaganda against Isabeau as retaliation against tax increases she and Orléans ordered in 1405. An Augustinian friar, Jacques Legrand, preached a long sermon to the court denouncing excess and depravity, in particular mentioning Isabeau and her fashions—with exposed necks, shoulders and décolletage. The monk presented his sermon as allegory {{so as not to}} offend Isabeau overtly, but he cast her and her ladies-in-waiting as [...] "furious, vengeful characters". He said to Isabeau, [...] "If you don't believe me, go out into the city disguised as a <b>poor</b> <b>woman,</b> and you will hear what everyone is saying." [...] Thus he accused Isabeau as having lost touch with the commoners and the court with its subjects. At about the same time a satirical political pamphlet, Songe Veritable, now considered by historians to be pro-Burgundian propaganda, was released and widely distributed in Paris. The pamphlet hinted at the Queen's relations with Orléans.|$|E

In 1820 Birch became {{disturbed by the}} family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, {{they were at the}} point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent. So he decided to auction the fossils he had purchased from them on their behalf. He wrote to the palaeontologist Gideon Mantell on 5 March that year to say that the sale was [...] "for the benefit of the <b>poor</b> <b>woman</b> and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost all the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what I am about to part with, yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied." [...] The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised £400 (worth the equivalent of over £26,000 in 2010). How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.|$|E

Her character, Becky Sharp, is a <b>poor</b> <b>woman</b> with a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was carefully costumed to conceal that during the filming {{she was pregnant with}} her second child. This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work as Witherspoon believed the gestation had in fact helped her portrayal of Sharp's character: [...] "I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom—it gave me much more to play with", she said. The film and Witherspoon's portrayal of Sharp received mixed reviews, as The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Nair's cast is splendid. Witherspoon does justice to the juicy role by giving the part more buoyancy than naughtiness." [...] At the same time, The Charlotte Observer called her work [...] "an excellent performance that's soft around the edges" [...] and the Los Angeles Times concluded that Becky is [...] "a role Reese Witherspoon was born to play". However, LA Weekly wrote [...] " [...] ends up conveying so little of what’s at once appalling and perversely attractive about the would-be mistress of Vanity Fair" [...] and states that it may have to do with Witherspoon's vanity, [...] "with an Oscar-less young star’s need to be loved more than anyone could conceivably love the “real” Becky Sharp.".

This paper focuses on bringing back the importance of investing in the education of <b>poor</b> <b>women,</b> particularly the postsecondary education of <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> with children, to the forefront of the welfare debate. In this paper we review federal and state level welfare policies toward postsecondary education of <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> with children.

We propose that welfare policies should encourage women 2 ̆ 7 s college education by providing support services and by stopping the five-years clock for those attending college. In addition, programs such as Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) and AmeriCorps should be expanded to increase postsecondary education opportunities for <b>poor</b> <b>women...</b>|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, health {{interventions}} {{implemented in}} Pakistan {{have been designed}} to increase the supply of maternal health services, but have not focused on reaching the <b>poorest</b> <b>women</b> or on providing high-quality services.

This study uses data from the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2006 – 07 to develop a profile of the <b>poorest</b> <b>women</b> in Pakistan in order to understand demand-side barriers to accessing maternal health care. The study shows stark differences in human capital, material and demographic resources between the <b>poorest</b> <b>women</b> and other women.

The findings from several pilot projects in Pakistan suggest that the <b>poorest</b> <b>women</b> can be reached at disproportionately higher rates than non-poor women through targeted, community-based, interventions. There is little demonstrable evidence, however, that high-quality care has been provided through these interventions. Evidence-based approaches, which have the potential to overcome financial and sociocultural barriers to service utilization, should be scaled up as soon as possible. However, measures should be taken to ensure that the quality of care provided through these interventions is adequate and able to lead to significant reductions in mortality...|$|R

The first, the Rise to Respectability, he observes, {{is evident in}} both his early and his late books, notably Ragged Dick, whose impoverished young hero declares, [...] "I mean to turn over a new leaf, and try to grow up 'spectable." [...] His virtuous life wins him not riches but, more realistically, a comfortable clerical position and salary. The second major theme is Character Strengthened Through Adversity. In Strong and Steady and Shifting for Himself, for example, the affluent heroes are reduced to poverty and forced {{to meet the demands}} of their new circumstances. Alger occasionally cited the young Abe Lincoln as a representative of this theme for his readers. The third theme is Beauty versus Money, which became central to Alger's adult fiction. Characters fall in love and marry on the basis of their character, talents, or intellect rather than the size of their bank accounts. In The Train Boy, for example, a wealthy heiress chooses to marry a talented but struggling artist, and in The Erie Train Boy a <b>poor</b> <b>woman</b> wins her true love despite the machinations of a rich, depraved suitor.

They were enacted under the guise that they will stop the cycle of poverty. In reality, they drive women and families deeper into it. First, in the background section, this paper gives an overview {{of the history of the}} “welfare queen” myth and the dramatic changes in the U. S. welfare system. In the analysis section, part one covers the family cap rule, which punishes <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> who have children if they are already on welfare.
