40|$|The {{widespread}} use of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) poses a great threat to human health and has made the detection of OP residues in food an important task, especially {{in view of the}} fact that easy and rapid detection methods are needed. Because OPs have inhibitory effects on the activity of α-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) in plants, in this work we evaluated the possibility of detecting OPs in vegetables with ANAE extracted from commercial flour.

However the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates in phoxim-exposed B. mori can be improved by Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs). In this study, we explored whether TiO 2 NPs treatment can reduce the phoxim-induced brain damage of the 5 th larval instar of B. mori. We observed that TiO 2 NPs pretreatments significantly reduced the mortality of phoxim-exposed larva and relieved severe brain damage and oxidative stress under <b>phoxim</b> exposure in the brain. The treatments also relieved the phoxim-induced increases in the contents of acetylcholine (Ach), glutamate (Glu) and nitric oxide (NO) and the phoxim-induced decreases in the contents of norepinephrine (NE), Dopamine (DA), and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), and reduced the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Na+/K+-ATPase, Ca 2 +-ATPase, and Ca 2 +/Mg 2 +-ATPase activities and the activation of total nitric oxide synthase (TNOS) in the brain. Furthermore, digital gene expression profile (DGE) analysis and real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed that TiO 2 NPs pretreatment inhibited the up-regulated expression of ace 1, cytochrome c, caspase- 9, caspase- 3, Bm 109 and down-regulated expression of BmIap caused by phoxim; these genes are involved in nerve conduction, oxidative stress and apoptosis. TiO 2 NPs pretreatment also inhibited the down-regulated expression of H+ transporting ATP synthase and vacuolar ATP synthase under <b>phoxim</b> exposure, which are involved in ion transport and energy metabolism.

30|$|Apart from sensing food pollutants, {{the concept}} of food safety also {{includes}} pesticide detection. In general, organophosphorus compounds (OPs) are the most broadly used pesticides in modern agriculture. However, they pose a serious health hazard and may cause death if consumed above the safety limit. Hou et al. [243] developed l-tyrosine methyl ester-functionalized CDs {{for the detection of}} methyl parathion, which is included in the OP family. In the presence of tyrosinase and oxygen, the tyrosine methyl ester was transformed into quinone complexes, thereby quenching the CD fluorescence. However, the presence of methyl parathion reduces the activity rate of tyrosinase and slows down the quenching process. Therefore, the fluorescence intensity can be measured as the concentration of available methyl parathion. Despite its extremely broad detection range, 10  nM to 0.1  mM, and low LOD of 48  pM, the study also confirmed 30 -day stability (kept at 4  °C), good reproducibility from different batches of the l-tyrosine methyl ester-functionalized CD-based sensor, and its usability for methyl parathion detection in contaminated food samples such as cabbage, milk, and fruit juice. Another class of OPs, namely dichlorvos, is also of research interest for the same research group [244]. The underlying detection scheme is very similar to that in their previous study, except that the fluorescence is quenched by FRET through the energy acceptor 5 -thio- 2 -nitrobenzoic acid anion (TNB−) with quaternized CDs as the energy donor. The presence of dichlorvos inhibits the reaction, further restoring the fluorescence of the CDs, and the concentration can be determined accordingly. Under optimal conditions, a linear detection range of dichlorvos of 50  pM to 0.1 μM with an LOD of 19  pM was achieved. A more recent study was reported by Zheng et al. [245] pertaining to <b>phoxim</b> detection using CD-functionalized silver nanoparticles. Theoretically, the as-prepared CDs become negatively charged in acidic medium (pH 6.0) due to the abundance of amine and carboxyl functional groups on their surface and cross-linked with the positively charged <b>phoxim</b> via electrostatic bonding, resulting in aggregation of the CDs. A visible color change from yellow to red is observed upon addition of <b>phoxim</b> due to the red-shift of the absorption band, from 400 to 525  nm, induced by the aggregation process. Hence, quantitative measurement of the <b>phoxim</b> concentration can be realized through the calculated absorbance ratio, A 525 nm/A 400 nm, in the detection range of 0.1 – 100 μM. In addition, the calculated LOD was found to be 0.04 μM, much lower than the maximum permissible <b>phoxim</b> concentration in food samples in China.|$|E

A nursery trial {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of mycorrhizal inoculation on the biomass yield of wild cardoon seedlings {{and the effect of}} the pesticides fosetyl-Al, folpet and propamocarb, as fungicides, and isofenphos, <b>phoxim</b> and oxamyl, as insecticides, on cardoon plant growth and the mycorrhization. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi inocula were: commercial inoculum with Glomus mosseae spores, and an inoculum of a Glomus sp. strain (AMF-i) isolated locally. Mycorrhizal inoculation with either inoculum increased cardoon shoot biomass compared to non-inoculated control plants. The pesticide applications had a neutral or positive effect on cardoon seedling growth. However, the AM fungi colonisation did not decrease except for plants colonised by G. mosseae and treated with the insecticides isofenphos and oxamyl. Thus, the mycorrhiza can survive to pesticide concentrations employed in commercial nursery, and enhance cardoon plant productivity. vo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOrganophosphorus {{insecticides}} {{have been}} widely used, which are highly poisonous and cause serious concerns over food safety and environmental pollution. A bacterial strain being capable of degrading O,O-dialkyl phosphorothioate and O,O-dialkyl phosphate insecticides, designated as G 1, was isolated from sludge collected at the drain outlet of a chlorpyrifos manufacture plant. Physiological and biochemical characteristics and 16 S rDNA gene sequence analysis suggested that strain G 1 belongs to the genus Stenotrophomonas. At an initial concentration of 50 mg/L, strain G 1 degraded 100 % of methyl parathion, methyl paraoxon, diazinon, and <b>phoxim,</b> 95 % of parathion, 63 % of chlorpyrifos, 38 % of profenofos, and 34 % of triazophos in 24 h. Orthogonal experiments showed that the optimum conditions were an inoculum volume of 20 % (v/v), a substrate concentration of 50 mg/L, and an incubation temperature in 40 °C. p-Nitrophenol was detected as the metabolite of methyl parathion, for which intracellular methyl parathion hydrolase was responsible. Strain G 1 can efficiently degrade eight organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) and is a very excellent candidate for applications in OP pollution remediation...|$|E
40|$|Combining {{environmentally}} friendly insecticides with entomopathogenic nematodes may constitute an effective alternative to conventional chemical control of many insect pests. The {{objective of this}} laboratory study was to evaluate the effects of selected insecticides which are commonly used for pest control in vegetables in China on osmotically treated and untreated infective juveniles of Steinernema carpocapsae strain All. The insecticides azadirachtin, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, fipronil, imidacloprid, malathion, thiamethoxam and chlorantraniliprole-thiamethoxam had no adverse effects on nematode survival and infectivity. In contrast, bisultap, emamectin benzoate, <b>phoxim</b> and rotenone proved harmful to S. carpocapsae All mainly by reducing infectivity of the infective juveniles to larvae of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella. Osmotic induction is a promising way to induce entomopathogenic nematodes into partial anhydrobiosis and thus increase environmental stress tolerance of the nematodes {{as well as their}} shelf life after production. The present results showed that osmotic treatment did not adversely affect fitness of the nematode in terms of its susceptibility to insecticides and even increased its tolerance to chlorpyrifos and rotenone. The results of this laboratory study indicate that several of the tested insecticides can be safely combined with S. carpocapsae All within an integrated pest management approach...|$|E
40|$|An efficient, rapid, and {{selective}} method for sample pretreatment, namely, molecularly imprinted matrix solid-phase dispersion (MI-MSPD) coupled with gas chromatography (GC), {{was developed for}} the rapid isolation of four phosphorothioate organophosphorus pesticides (tolclofos-methyl, <b>phoxim,</b> chlorpyrifos, and parathion-methyl) from carrot and yacon samples. New molecularly imprinted polymer nanomicrospheres were synthesized by using typical structural analogue tolclofos-methyl as a dummy template via surface grafting polymerization on nanosilica. Then, these four pesticides in carrot and yacon were extracted and adsorbed using the imprinted nanomicrospheres and further determined by gas chromatography. Under the optimized conditions, a good linearity of four pesticides was obtained {{in a range of}} 0. 05 – 17. 0 [*]ng·g− 1 with R varying from 0. 9971 to 0. 9996, and the detection limit of the method was 0. 012 ~ 0. 026 [*]ng·g− 1 in carrot and yacon samples. The recovery rates at two spiked levels were in the range of 85. 4 – 105. 6 % with RSD ≤ 9. 6 %.

40|$|Larvae of the {{silkworm}} (Bombyx mod L.) may {{be exposed}} to pesticide residues on the leaves of their food plant, the mulberry tree (Morus spp.), {{which can lead to}} adverse effects on silk production. A new acute dietary toxicity test method was evaluated as the basis for pesticide risk assessment. A series of 57 tests were carried out with six insecticides and six different silkworm strains. LC 50 ranges were, in increasing order: cypermethrin 0. 016 - 0. 069 mg kg(- 1) fresh mulberry leaf; imidacloprid 0. 13 - 0. 29 mg kg(- 1); monosultap 0. 19 - 0. 37 mg kg(- 1); <b>phoxim</b> 0. 42 - 0. 48 mg kg(- 1); dichlorvos 5. 6 - 6. 9 mg kg(- 1) and dimethoate 10. 2 - 24. 7 mg kg(- 1). The Qiu Feng x Bai Yu and the Chun Lei x Zhen Zhu strains were overall most sensitive to the tested insecticides. Control mortality in the test system always remained below 5 %, and precision of the LC 50 estimates was high. The coefficient of variation of LC 50 values among tests was consistently less than 20 %. The acute dietary toxicity test was found to be highly reproducible and robust.

40|$|The Water Framework Directive 60 / 2000 /EG (WFD) {{requires}} Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for polluting substances. Member States {{have to set}} {{objectives for}} individual surface water bodies (Article 4 WFD). The transitional period for Directive 2006 / 11 /EC ended in 2013. Therefore, revision, adoption {{and implementation of the}} EQS for the substances on the "Indicative list of main pollutants" (see Annex VIII WFD) is needed to assess the status of the surface waters. In this context, the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) initiated a project to update the environmental quality standards (EQS) for 10 pollutants (pollutants specific for river basin according to Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (OGewV)) and to compile suggestions for environmental quality standards for 20 new chemicals. The searched data were documented data sheets according to the "Guidance Document No. 27 : Technical Guidance for Deriving Environmental Quality Standards" (EC, 2011). The derivation of EQS for the matrices to be considered was performed in accordance with the rules as laid down in the "Guidance Document No. 27 ". Within this project EQS proposals were derived for the following 30 substances: 2. 4 -D, arsenic, bezafibrate, carbamazepin, carbendazim, chloroacetic acid, chromium, dibutyltin, dimethoate, dimoxystrobin, epichlorhydrin, erythromycin, flufenacet, flurtamone, imidacloprid, copper, metoprolol, monobutyltin cation, monolinuron, nicosulfuron, omethoate, triphenyl phosphate, <b>phoxim,</b> roxithromycin, sulcotrione, sulfamethoxazole, tetrabutyltin, triclosan, uranium, zinc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract	The {{present in}} vitro study shows the {{efficacy}} of two antimite products (ByeMite® = <b>phoxim,</b> Mite-Stop® = neem seed extract) against all developing stages of the important red chicken mite Dermanyssus gallinae (obtained at two farms in France and Germany). While permanent contact with the active compound led to an efficacy of 100 % {{in the case of}} Mite-Stop® on mites in both farms, there was only a 96. 2 % killing effect of ByeMite® on the mites of the French farm. Even short contacts of only 4 s killed 100 % of mites in the case of Mite-Stop® at the French farm and only 84. 5 % in the German farm. ByeMite®, on the other hand, killed only 27. 8 % (Germany) and 30 % (France) when mites got the chance to escape from the treated grounds to untreated ones. When using only the half doses of both products, Mite-Stop® still reached, after permanent contact, 100 % activity on the German farm and 98. 2 % in France, while ByeMite® killed 93. 8 % (Germany) and 90. 6 % (France). Short contact to half doses of course reduced the activity of both products (Mite- Stop®= 59. 3 % in France, 22. 1 % in Germany; ByeMite®= 28. 8 % in France, 18. 8 % in Germany). With respect to the fumigant activity of the products, the strains of D. gallinae reacted differently.
