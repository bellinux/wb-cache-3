Some are based upon text input fields and are intended to input and validate specific common data. These include email to enter email addresses, tel for telephone numbers, number for numeric values. There are additional attributes to specify required fields, fields that should have keyboard focus when the web page containing the form is loaded, and <b>placeholder</b> <b>text</b> that is displayed within the field but is not user input (such as the 'Search' text displayed in many search input fields before a search term is entered.) These tasks used to be handled with JavaScript, but had become so common that support for them {{was added to the}} standard. The date input type displays a calendar from which the user can select a date or date range. And the color input type can be represented as an input text simply checking the value entered is a correct hexadecimal representation of a color, according to the specification,color – color-well control | publisher=W3C | work=w3.org | accessdate=2014-10-31}} or a color picker widget (the latter being the solution used in most browsers which support this attribute).|$|E
500|$|Mr. Mackey's line, [...] "drugs are bad, m'kay?", {{has entered}} popular culture. The Eminem song, [...] "The Kids" [...] (which is {{featured}} on the B-side of the single [...] "The Way I Am" [...] and the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP), is thematically about drug use, and makes numerous references to South Park and impressions of the show's characters, including an impression of Mr. Mackey's voice and the repetition of his line. The song [...] "Hip Hop Quotables" [...] by Ludacris, from his album Chicken-n-Beer, also contains the line. In 2008, the line was referenced in the dissenting opinion of a judge, {{in a case of}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Also, in a 2010 marijuana-related court case at the Maryland Court of Appeals, Judge Clayton Greene, Jr. referenced the episode in his dissenting opinion, calling Mr. Mackey's words [...] "immortal". In 2011, during a judiciary committee hearing about a marijuana-related bill in Denver, Colorado, a representative showed off a potential packaging for edible marijuana products. According to a group called the Cannabis Therapy Institute, the label on the package, which bore the <b>placeholder</b> <b>text,</b> [...] "Legal and governmentally approved statement describing that pot is bad, M-ok", was a reference to the South Park episode.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common <b>placeholder</b> <b>texts</b> is lorem ipsum. A similar text of this type is the pangram The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, which is often used in fill-in text and to {{demonstrate}} and compare typefaces because it contains all 26 letters of the Latin alphabet.|$|R
30|$|The <b>text</b> <b>placeholders</b> are {{sequentially}} {{linked in}} each page template {{and across the}} pages. When the document contains a single sequence of content, a simple heuristic is to consider each headline occurring in the sequence {{as the beginning of}} a new “article”. Thus, every <b>text</b> <b>placeholder</b> is connected sequentially (as given by the input order) until a new headline appears. Then a new flow begins and the process is repeated. If the content is already split into several sequences, another approach is to simply associate every <b>text</b> <b>placeholder</b> to each sequence.|$|R
30|$|After the flows are created, the {{font size}} for each flow is {{adjusted}} across <b>text</b> <b>placeholders</b> belonging to this flow, therefore completely filling up every <b>text</b> <b>placeholder.</b> Since this adjustment is performed {{for a whole}} series of placeholders, the font size is changed only very slightly, and is uniform across the whole flow.|$|R

5000|$|Li Europan lingues is a {{quotation}} in Occidental, an international auxiliary language devised by Edgar von Wahl in 1922. It {{is used in}} some HTML templates as a fill-in or <b>placeholder</b> <b>text.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... <b>placeholder</b> in the <b>text</b> {{for another}} {{unspecified}} object, {{for example in}} a compound document.|$|R
30|$|It is also {{possible}} to avoid text flows at all, by adjusting each <b>text</b> <b>placeholder</b> separately. However, if text densities change too much between adjacent placeholders, the font sizes will be visibly different, creating an unpleasant effect.|$|R
30|$|The {{selection}} of templates must be globally optimal {{according to some}} quality measure. For instance, all <b>text</b> <b>placeholders</b> must have a similar text density and the wasted space around pictures (due to differences in aspect ratio between pictures and placeholders) must be minimized.|$|R
5000|$|Carin Mui (...) {{submitted}} the winning entry, which translates to [...] "In the past we traveled across the Pacific to mine for gold; Now, we break through earth {{to form a}} silver dragon."

5000|$|Other: Extensions {{also exist}} for frivolous, humorous or satirical purposes. Some allude to {{historical}} {{features of the}} Firefox browser, for example restoring the [...] "delicious delicacies" [...] <b>placeholder</b> <b>text</b> removed in Firefox 0.9, or generating random browser names to allude to the Firefox name changes.|$|E
50|$|In {{publishing}} and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a filler text or greeking {{commonly used to}} demonstrate the textual elements of a graphic document or visual presentation. Replacing meaningful content with <b>placeholder</b> <b>text</b> allows designers to design {{the form of the}} content before the content itself has been produced.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} algorithm {{receives a}} content sequence and produces an optimal sequence of template selections matching the content. After producing the optimal content mapping and pagination, Adobe’s InDesign® software {{is used as}} a rendering engine. An extension to InDesign imports the layouts and performs typographic corrections such as text fitting on templates’ <b>text</b> <b>placeholders.</b>|$|R
50|$|A mockup of a layout {{might be}} created to get early feedback, usually {{before all the}} content is {{actually}} ready. Whether for paper or electronic media, {{the first draft of}} a layout might be simply a rough paper and pencil sketch. A comprehensive layout for a new magazine might show <b>placeholders</b> for <b>text</b> and images, but demonstrate placement, typographic style, and other idioms intended to set the pattern for actual issues, or a particular unfinished issue. A website wireframe is a low-cost way to show layout without doing all the work of creating the final HTML and CSS, and without writing the copy or creating any images.|$|R

50|$|Filler text (also <b>placeholder</b> <b>text</b> or dummy text) is {{text that}} shares some {{characteristics}} of a real written text, but is random or otherwise generated. It {{may be used to}} display a sample of fonts, generate text for testing, or to spoof an e-mail spam filter. The process of using filler text is sometimes called greeking, although the text itself may be nonsense, or largely Latin, as in Lorem ipsum.|$|E

50|$|De finibus bonorum et malorum ("On {{the ends}} of good and evil") is a {{philosophical}} work by the Roman orator, politician and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero. It consists of five books, in which Cicero explains the philosophical views of Epicureanism, Stoicism, and the Platonism of Antiochus of Ascalon. The book {{was developed in the}} summer of the year 45 BC within about one and a half months. Together with the Tusculanae Quaestiones written shortly afterwards, De finibus is the most extensive philosophical work of Cicero. It is dedicated to Marcus Junius Brutus. Lorem ipsum, the common <b>placeholder</b> <b>text</b> used in graphic design work, is derived from parts of the first book's discourse on hedonism.|$|E
30|$|The {{contribution}} {{presented in}} this work {{is the core of}} a larger workflow, of which we presented only a simplified model, leaving room for several possible improvements. For example, {{it is not possible to}} toggle on or off optional element placeholders or convert between elements (placing a picture on a <b>text</b> <b>placeholder</b> if necessary, for example). Moreover, the template selection method searches for multiple combinations of picture placement on a page, which can be costly for the generation of picture-driven documents such as photo albums, and could be disallowed for a faster algorithm. Images could also have scaling constraints added to the scoring function from (3) (Sect.  5.2). For example, busy pictures would only be considered for placement in larger containers. This would result in a more efficient method with better results as well.|$|R
5000|$|From the {{beginning}} of Glass and Wilson's collaboration, they insisted on portraying the icon purely as a historical figure, {{in the absence of}} a storyline attached to his image. While they did incorporate symbols from Einstein's life within the opera's scenery, characters, and music, they intentionally chose not to give the opera a specific plot. This is in accord with Wilson's formalist approach, which he asserts creates more truth on stage than naturalist theater. Wilson structured Einstein on the Beach as a repeating sequence of three different kinds of space. Between major acts are shorter entr'actes known as [...] "knee plays," [...] a signature technique that Wilson has applied throughout his oeuvre. Propelling idea of [...] "non-plot" [...] within Einstein on the Beach, its libretto employs solfège syllables, numbers, and short sections of poetry. In an interview, Glass comments that he originally intended for his audience to construct personal connections with Einstein as a character and with the music that he assigns to the icon. For example, the music within the first of the opera's [...] "Knee Plays" [...] features repeated numbers accompanied by an electric organ. Glass states that these numbers and solfège syllables were used as <b>placeholders</b> for <b>texts</b> by the singers to memorize their parts, and were kept instead of replacing them with texts. This numerical repetition, however, offers an interpretation as a reference to the mathematical and scientific breakthroughs made by Einstein himself. Of further reference to the icon's image, everything on the originally staged set of Einstein on the Beach, from costumes to lighting, depicts specific aspects that refer to Einstein's life.|$|R
