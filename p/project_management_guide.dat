This model also aims to develop a virtual community of doctoral students, who can manage their own projects online with other community members who have the same interest. In order to develop that model, a checklist of community-based project management process has been developed {{in the light of}} the literature review and the needs of stakeholders (doctoral students and researchers). Within this model, community-based project management includes three main elements: community, project and management. In relation to project, there are two main sub elements. First is projectbased learning (PBL), which is based on constructivist perspective of learning that make students construct their knowledge when they work together to accomplish specific goals. Second is the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK), which is a <b>project</b> <b>management</b> <b>guide,</b> and an internationally recognized standard [PMBOK Guide, 2004], that provides the fundamentals of project management as they apply to a wide range of projects, including construction, software, engineering, automotive, so the study deploy this approach to scaffold based project management learning model. In the terms of the community element, this study adopted the community of inquiry model, which defines a good e-learning environment through three major aspects: cognitive presence, social presence and teaching presence. The last element which is addressed in this study called knowledge management. After identifying these elements, this study investigates a range of tools in the light of this model.

For the most part, these inconsistencies are due to a not close enough coordination and sometimes a lack of communication. As a result, there is a great need for international companies to understand the standards or guides from both domains to better integrate them and enhance their chances of success. Although numerous Systems Engineering and <b>Project</b> <b>Management</b> standards or <b>guides</b> have been published to help people get better organized and improve the quality of products or services, a lot of their projects still fail due to the poor integration of both domains.

A practical example of the implications is provided via analysis of the use of probability–impact (PI) matrices and associated PI indices (risk indices or scores).

Second, it was proceeded to select five process groups of project life cycle. Then, for each group, it was identified inputs, outputs and tools. By this way, the <b>project</b> <b>management</b> process was organized simple and systemically, from top to button.
