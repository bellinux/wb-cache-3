30|$|On radiographs, double arches {{appear as}} {{bilateral}} aortic knobs with midline compression of the trachea. Pulmonary overinflation {{can result from}} air trapping. Lateral radiographs show focal tracheal narrowing and anterior bowing. Oesophagography shows bilateral oesophageal indentation on the AP <b>projection</b> <b>and</b> posterior <b>indentation</b> on the lateral projection. On axial CT images, the characteristic appearance of the double arch is the “four-artery sign” (Fig.  2 b), referring to a symmetrical trapezoidal or square appearance of the four arch branch vessels {{at the level of}} the thoracic inlet. Two arches are seen originating from the ascending aorta and extending on either side of the trachea and oesophagus to form a complete ring. The descending thoracic aorta is located on the left.|$|R

40|$|Recently, Composite Sandwich Panel (CSP) {{technology}} considerably {{influenced the}} design and fabrication of high performance structures. Although using CSP increases the reliability of structure, the important concern is to understand the complex deformation and damage evolution process.

A setup of three-point bending <b>and</b> <b>indentation</b> test is prepared using different strain rates of 1 mm/min, 10 mm/min, 100 mm/min and 500 mm/min {{to determine the effects of}} strain rate on flexural <b>and</b> <b>indentation</b> behavior of CSP material.

40|$|Single {{thin coating}} of matt nickel (Nimat), a mirror bright copper (Cubright), a mirror bright nickel (Nibright) and their {{combinations}} were electrochemically deposited on brass substrate with thickness 500 μm. The basic aim was electrodeposition of two-layer Cubright/Nimat and Nibright/Cubright systems, and three-layer Nibright Cubrigh/Nimat system, which {{are among the}} most widely applied protective and decorative systems in light and medium operating conditions of corrosion. The thicknesses of the obtained films varied from 1 μm to 3. 25 μm. They were investigated via nanoindentation experiments, in order to characterize their basic physical and mechanical characteristics, related with their good adhesion and corrosion protective ability, as well as ensuring the integrity of the system “protective coating/substrate” to possible mechanical, dynamic and/or thermal stresses. As a result, load-displacement curves were obtained <b>and</b> <b>indentation</b> hardness <b>and</b> <b>indentation</b> modulus were calculated using the Oliver & Pharr approximation method. The dependence of the <b>indentation</b> modulus <b>and</b> the <b>indentation</b> hardness on the depth of the <b>indentation,</b> surface morphology <b>and</b> structure of the obtained coatings, their texture and surface roughness were investigated too.

40|$|International audienceUsing {{luminescence}} confocal microscopy under 325 nm laser excitation, {{we explore}} {{the populations of}} defects existing in or at the vicinity of macroscopic surface flaws in fused silica.
