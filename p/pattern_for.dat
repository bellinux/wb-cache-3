5|$|Craigiehall was {{designed}} by Sir William Bruce, with input from James Smith, and completed in 1699 for the Earl of Annandale, who had recently acquired the Craigie estate through marriage. It is a good surviving example of one of Bruce's smaller houses, and set a <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> such villas in the Edinburgh area for the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Johann Georg Otto Schick {{designed}} {{a series of}} patterns such as Platanenmuster (plane tree pattern) and erbsenmuster (pea-dot <b>pattern)</b> <b>for</b> the Waffen-SS, combining micro- and macro-patterns in one scheme.|$|E
5|$|For {{the series}} of Bond novels, Fleming {{realised}} that without threatening villains Bond seemed less heroic: this tradition of strong literary villain was brought across to the screen in the Eon series. The third Bond film, Goldfinger, set a <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> having a main villain with a loyal and dangerous henchman, a model which was followed in subsequent films.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Security {{patterns}} {{capture the}} experiences of experts, allowing novices to rely on expert knowledge and solve security problems in a more systematic and structured way. So far, literature provides many examples of security <b>patterns</b> <b>for</b> object-oriented systems, but no attempt {{has been made to}} document security <b>patterns</b> <b>for</b> multiagent systems. In this paper we present a set of <b>patterns</b> <b>for</b> secure agent systems that, currently, consists of four patterns. ...|$|R
5|$|Fractal-like {{patterns}} {{work because}} the human visual system efficiently discriminates images which have different fractal dimension or other second-order statistics like Fourier spatial amplitude spectra; objects simply appear to pop {{out from the}} background. Timothy O'Neill helped the Marine Corps to develop first a digital <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> vehicles, then fabric for uniforms, which had two colour schemes, one designed for woodland, one for desert.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of a coloration or <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> effective camouflage in winter, often {{combined with}} a different summer camouflage. Summer patterns are typically disruptively patterned combinations of shades of browns and greys, up to black, while winter patterns are dominated by white to match snowy landscapes.|$|E
5|$|Bruce led the Australian {{delegation}} to the 1932 Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa. He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed to a limited form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an achievement for which Bruce received much praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements would set the <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the European Common Market in 1973.|$|E

5|$|By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had {{disturbed}} traditional {{society and}} created a class of labourers who struggled to support their families in rural areas. This led to an unrest known as the Swing riots which swept across southern England, consequently reaching Selborne and Liphook in September 1830. The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> nearby Steep Marsh and Stroud, which still exists today. There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880; conduits and sluices were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding of hay meadows. In Steep, hops were grown for use in local breweries, watercress produced for commercial use, and a condensed milk factory was in operation in Steep Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as western red cedar and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, bittersweet, and wild grape, which is the <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{wings are}} {{fundamental}} in identifying and classifying species {{as there is}} no other set of structures in studying insects more significant. Each order and insect family has distinctive wing shapes and features. In many cases, even species may be distinguished from each other by differences of color and <b>pattern.</b> <b>For</b> example, just by position one can identify species, albeit to a much lesser extent. Though most insects fold their wings when at rest, dragonflies and some damselflies rest with their wings spread out horizontally, while groups such as the caddisflies, stoneflies, alderflies, and lacewings hold their wings sloped roof-like over their backs. A few moths wrap their wings around their bodies, while many flies and most butterflies close their wings together straight upward over the back.|$|E
50|$|Memory {{patterns}} are already patterned by quadruple <b>patterning</b> <b>for</b> NAND and crossed quadruple/double <b>patterning</b> <b>for</b> DRAM. These <b>patterning</b> techniques are self-aligned {{and do not}} require custom cutting or trim masks. For 2x-nm DRAM and flash, double patterning techniques should be sufficient.|$|R

A head-mounted display unit with eye-tracking capability shows a moving object in a predictive <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> {{the person to}} follow with their eyes. People without brain injury {{will be able to}} track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory while it is hypothesized that those with mild traumatic brain injury cannot.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} stories were {{completed}} in one issue, but multi-part stories began to appear {{by the middle of}} the series' first year of publication, and there were hints of the ongoing storylines that would later characterize the series. In May 1983, issue #11 introduced many new characters, including most of the 1983 action figure line and the villain Destro, who would become a frequently recurring character. Many subsequent storylines involved the machinations and power struggles between him, Cobra Commander, and the Baroness. Issue #11 established a <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> the series in which every so often Marvel would publish an issue introducing a group of characters and vehicles that represented the new year's toy offerings.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E

5|$|Sales fell to {{just under}} 14,000 by issue 12, and {{continued}} to fall during the series' second year until the 24th issue sold just over 9,000 copies. In December 2015, the 35th issue sold an estimated 6,500 copies. According to Dave Carter, a writer for Comics Beat, this is a typical sales <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> a modern comic. The series concluded with issue 47 in February 2017, which had estimated sales of about 6,300. Because {{of the decline in}} Revivals sales, Seeley expressed skepticism about doing another project of similar length in the future.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{also saw}} the birth of aerial warfare, {{and with it the}} need not only to conceal {{positions}} and vehicles from being spotted from the air, but also the need to camouflage the aircraft themselves. In 1917, Germany started using a lozenge camouflage covering Central Powers aircraft, possibly the earliest printed camouflage. A similarly disruptive splinter pattern in earth tones, Buntfarbenanstrich 1918, was introduced for tanks in 1918, and was also used on the Stahlhelm (steel helmet), becoming the first use of a standardized camouflage <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The ao dai {{is now a}} {{standard}} for weddings, for celebrating Tết and for other formal occasions. It's the required uniform for female teachers (mostly {{from high school to}} below) and female students in common high schools in the South; there is no requirement for color or <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> teachers while students use plain white with some small patterns like flowers for school uniform. Companies often require their female staff to wear uniforms that include the ao dai, so flight attendants, receptionists, bank female staff, restaurant staff, and hotel workers in Vietnam may be seen wearing it.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern that}} the line-ending words follow is often {{explained}} if the numbers 1 to 6 {{are allowed to}} stand for the end-words of the first stanza. Each successive stanza takes its pattern based upon a bottom-up pairing of {{the lines of the}} preceding stanza (i.e., last and first, then second-from-last and second, then third-from-last and third). Given that the <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> the first stanza is 123456, this produces 615243 in the second stanza.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
5|$|This set the <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> the six-year {{conflict}} between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to starve it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their diplomatic efforts, the Venetians tried {{to put pressure on}} the Sultan, by stirring up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman Crusade, and sending their fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their own on Venetian possessions in the Aegean.|$|E
