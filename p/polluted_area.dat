40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} to determine lipids changes in needles of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations growning on polluted stands near a phosphate fertilizer factory in Luboń, and copper smelter in Głogów {{and in a}} control area in Kórnik. Needles from <b>polluted</b> <b>areas</b> had a lower content of total phospholipids than samples from the unpolluted site. Greater changes were detected in membranes of needles collected in October and January. In comparison with the control total phospholipid in needles of populations from <b>polluted</b> <b>areas</b> were 14 to 33 % lower. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglicerol (PG) were the dominant phospholipids. The analysis of fatty acids in phospholipid fraction showed a decrease of linoleic acid (18 : 2) and linolenic acid (18 : 3) contents. The level of polyunsaturated fatty acids in needles of three populations from <b>polluted</b> <b>areas</b> was up to 40 % lower {{as compared with the}} control. Moreover, phospholipids and their fatty acids showed seasonal fluctuations. The contents of PC, PG and PE increased in autumn and in winter, during the process of cold acclimation. In July, current-year needles did not show significant differences in membrane lipid composition between the <b>polluted</b> <b>areas</b> of Scots pine populations. The results suggest that the lipid changes of needles could be associated with disturbances in phohospholipid metabolism, caused by environmental pollution...|$|R
