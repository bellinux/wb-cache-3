50|$|<b>Pazinaclone</b> {{produces}} its sedative and anxiolytic effects {{by acting}} as a partial agonist at GABAA benzodiazepine receptors, although <b>pazinaclone</b> is more subtype-selective than most benzodiazepines.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pazinaclone</b> (DN-2327) is a {{sedative}} and anxiolytic {{drug in the}} cyclopyrrolone {{family of}} drugs. Some other cyclopyrrolone drugs include zopiclone and eszopiclone.|$|E
50|$|The {{carboxylic}} acid is then treated with diethyl cyanophosphonate to convert that to an activated acid cyanide; reaction with 1,4-dioxa-8-azaspiro4.5decane results in {{formation of the}} corresponding amide, <b>pazinaclone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pazinaclone</b> has a {{very similar}} {{pharmacological}} profile to the benzodiazepines including sedative and anxiolytic properties, but with less amnestic effects, and at low doses it is a relatively selective anxiolytic, with sedative effects only appearing at higher doses.|$|E
50|$|Pagoclone and <b>pazinaclone</b> {{are both}} isoindoloneReaction of 2-Amino-7-chloro-1,8-naphthyridine with phthalic {{anhydride}} {{leads to the}} corresponding phthalimide. Selective reduction {{of one of the}} imide carbonyl groups give the corresponding alcohol. Reaction with the carbanion from Ethyl 5-methyl-3-oxohexanoate leads to the product from the displacement of the hydroxyl group; 'this too may proceed via the acrylate obtained from aldol reaction of the ring opened imidal'.|$|E
50|$|Isoindoline is a heterocyclic organic {{compound}} with the molecular formula C8H9N. The parent compound has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen-containing ring. The compound's structure is similar to indoline except that the nitrogen atom is in the 2 position instead of the 1 position of the five-membered ring. Isoindoline itself is not commonly encountered, but several derivatives are found in nature and some synthetic derivatives are commercially valuable drugs, e.g. <b>pazinaclone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traditional benzodiazepines are {{associated}} with side effects such as drowsiness, physical dependence and abuse potential. It was hoped that bretazenil and other partial agonists would be an improvement on traditional benzodiazepines which are full agonists due to preclinical evidence that their side effect profile was {{less than that of}} full agonist benzodiazepines. For a variety of reasons however, bretazenil and other partial agonists such as <b>pazinaclone</b> and abecarnil were not clinically successful. However, research continues into other compounds with partial agonist and compounds which are selective for certain GABAA benzodiazepine receptor subtypes.|$|E
40|$|The {{stereoselective}} pharmacokinetics {{of the new}} nonbenzodiaze-pine anxiolytic compound <b>pazinaclone</b> (DN- 2327) {{were studied}} in four beagle dogs after oral (2. 5 mg/kg) and intravenous (0. 5 mg/kg) administration of racemate in a two-way, crossover study design. Racemic <b>pazinaclone</b> was highly cleared after intravenous adminis-tration at 2. 09 Â± 0. 78 I hr 1 kg 1. The total clearance and volumes of distribution (Va, V, and V) of (S) -pazinaclone were significantly {{lower than those of}} the antipode. The differences in disposition were consistent with stereoselectivity in protein binding, where the un-bound fraction of (R) -pszinaclone was almost 5 -fold greater than that of the (S) -enantlomer. Lower clearance and distribution for (S) -pazinaclone resulted in comparable elimination half-lives for the two enantlomers. As projected from the intravenous results, the first-pass metabolism of (S) - and (R) -pazlnaclone on oral administration of racemic <b>pazinaclone</b> was very extensive and stereoselective, wit...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of isoindoline skeletons such as staurosporine, indoprofen, and <b>pazinaclone</b> have been {{reported}} to possess biological activities [1 - 5]. Synthesis and study of the biological activity of isoindoline derivatives are under investigation. To a stirred solution of o-phthalicaldehyde (1) (0. 5 g, 3. 73 mmol) in dichloromethane (20 ml) a solution of amine 2 (0. 73 g, 7. 44 mmol) in dichloromethane (20 ml) was added. The reaction mixture was heated under reflux for the 3 h, the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. The solvent was reduced and left, pale yellow cubic crystals start to form which were filtered off to give the isoindole derivative 4 as colorless cubic crystals (0. 75 g, 68 %) ...|$|E
