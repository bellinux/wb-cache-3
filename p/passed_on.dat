40|$|ABSTRACT This study aims to {{determine}} the effect of the direct teaching methods and learning methods on the ability of <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> volleyball in elementary school student SD Inpres No. 33 Sumpang Binangae Barru. The experiment was conducted in SD Inpres No. 33 Sumpang Binangae Barru This research includes experimental research, using the randomized pretest and posttest design. As the independent variable is the method of direct learning and cooperative learning methods jigsaw, then the dependent variable is the ability of <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> volleyball. Samples of 60 people divided into three (3) groups with matching technique Ordinal Pairing. Data were collected by using a test <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> volleyball. Data analysis technique used is the t-test at significance level α = 0. 05. The results showed that: 1) direct instructional methods {{have a significant impact on}} the ability of <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> volleyball (t 4, 067 > table tο = 0. 05 = 2, 093). 2) Method of cooperative learning jigsaw significant impact on the ability of <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> volleyball (to = 6. 989 > t Table 0. 05 = 2. 093). 3) Methods of cooperative learning jigsaw give a significant difference in the ability of <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> volleyball (to = 9. 845 > t Table 0. 05 = 2. 042). Jigsaw cooperative learning methods (Mean = 11. 8 and Sd = 1. 6416) more effective use in the learning ability of <b>passing</b> <b>on</b> volleyball as compared to direct learning methods (Mean = 10. 40 and sd = 2. 2337).
