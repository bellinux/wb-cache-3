This reaction is used to produce 6 -aminopenicillanic acid (6 -APA), an intermediate in the synthesis of semisynthetic antibiotics. This work aims to compare catalytic properties of different <b>penicillin</b> G <b>acylase</b> (PGA) derivatives obtained by multipoint immobilization of the enzyme on macroporous silica. Enzyme amino groups react with different aldehyde groups produced in the support using either glutaraldehyde or glyoxyl activation. In the former method, silica reacts with γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (γ-APTS) and glutaraldehyde; in the latter, a reaction with glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) is followed by acid hydrolysis and oxidation using sodium periodate. This work determines the influence of degree of activation, using glutaraldehyde, on immobilization parameters. PGA was immobilized on these two different supports. Maximum enzyme load, immobilized enzyme activity (derivative activity), rate of immobilization and thermal stability were checked for both cases. For glutaraldehyde activation, the results showed that 0. 5 % of the γ-APTS is sufficient for all the hydroxy...|$|R
40|$|The pac gene, {{encoding}} the <b>penicillin</b> G <b>acylase</b> from Escherichia coli W, {{is regulated}} by the PaaX repressor of the phenylacetate catabolic pathway. pac expression depends on the synthesis of phenylacetyl-coenzyme A. PaaX and the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) bind in vitro to the Ppac promoter region. A palindromic sequence proposed as the PaaX operator is located upstream of the − 35 box overlapping a CRP binding site, an unusual position that suggests a novel regulatory mechanism...|$|R
