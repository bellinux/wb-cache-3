The attorney for the estate alleges that, even if Duckett did kill her own son, Grace's aggressive questioning traumatized Duckett so much that she committed suicide.

The appeal was based on SBC's <b>pending</b> <b>litigation</b> versus the Eastern District of Kentucky to have the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools reinstate its accreditation. However, Judge Richard I. Slippen rejected SBC's request, and thus the possibility of continued federal financial assistance was dead.|$|E

25|$|An issue {{likely to}} come into play will be a {{provision}} in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-134), which places a US$200 million cap on the aggregate of all passengers' damage claims in a railroad accident against a passenger railroad, including punitive damages. Bloomberg News reported that this event would likely be the first legal test of this law, according to a former House rail committee staffer who helped write the law, who predicted that given the number of casualties, the cap is almost certainly going to be an issue in <b>pending</b> <b>litigation.</b> An attorney representing two of the victims agreed, saying payouts could range from $5 million to $10 million per death or serious injury. Metrolink reportedly has insurance coverage totaling $150 million.|$|E

50|$|The federal {{legal system}} in the United States has dealt with {{numerous}} counts of asbestos-related suits, which often included multiple plaintiffs with similar symptoms. In 1999 there were 200,000 related cases pending in the federal court system of the United States. Further, {{it is estimated that}} within the next 40 years, the number of cases may increase to 700,000.

2500|$|As it {{has been}} {{concluded}} that no legitimate investments were made on the investors' behalf {{for at least the}} last 12 years, recovery has proceeded on a [...] "money-in/money out" [...] basis, without regard to the false investment statements provided to investors. These false statements, representing what investors believed they owned, combined to a total balance of approximately $64 billion. In a series of payments now up to a sixth round, victims have recovered $9.16 billion, {{more than half of the}} $17.5 billion reportedly invested. An additional $320 million is expected to be forthcoming after the resolution of further <b>pending</b> <b>litigation,</b> and an additional $4 billion recovered from forfeiture actions has yet to have been distributed.

2500|$|An {{organization}} called the Alliance for The Defence of Canadian Sovereignty is challenging a Canadian law that implements FATCA. The organization claims that the Canadian law violates the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms, particularly the provisions related to {{discrimination on the basis}} of citizenship or national origin. This is not technically a direct opposition to FATCA — as the United States Congress has no legislative authority over Canada — but is instead an opposition to the parallel Canadian federal legislation. On August 11, 2014, in an action supported by the Alliance for the Defence of Canadian Sovereignty, two Canadian citizens filed suit in the Federal Court of Canada challenging the constitutionality of the Canadian law that implements FATCA in Canada. Both of the citizens were born in the United States, with at least one Canadian parent, but they returned to Canada in childhood and have had no residential ties to the United States since that time. They state that this would result in them having U.S. indicia, and therefore being discriminated against by Canadian banks. [...] On August 12, 2014, Canadian government spokesman Jack Aubry defended the constitutionality of the legislation, but otherwise declined to comment on the <b>pending</b> <b>litigation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Under present U.S. patent law, {{a method}} claim of a patent is infringed {{only when a}} single actor {{performs}} {{each step of the}} claim. Similarly, induced infringement of a method claim has the same requirement. System claims raise more complicated issues. One can make the system only by placing each element into combination with the others, but it is possible to be liable for using a system invention merely by commercially exploiting the system. Therefore, when both the relevant equipment manufacturer and content provider utilize aspects of the invention in a method claim, whether infringement liability attaches to them may depend on both how the relevant claim is written and how licenses or sales are structured. This is illustrated in <b>pending</b> smartphone <b>litigation,</b> in which structure dictated the legal outcome.|$|R

5000|$|Despite all his {{contributions}} to medical science, and despite the awards won {{in conjunction with the}} other eventual winners, Oldendorf was not awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with his colleagues Godfrey Hounsfield and Allan Cormack in 1979. This was in concordance with the Nobel committee's tradition of denying the prize to researchers in applied research (who have M.D. degrees) in favor of researchers in the basic sciences (who have Ph.D. degrees). Rosalyn Yalow, a Nobel laureate herself, nominated Oldendorf for the prize and was reportedly upset that he did not get it. In the January 1980 issue of the journal Science (vol. 207, page 31), William J. Broad wrote an article titled [...] "The Riddle of the Nobel Debate" [...] in which he posited that politics in Stockholm forced the removal of Dr. Oldendorf's name during the nomination process.
