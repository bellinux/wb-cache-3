40|$|The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) {{contains}} many active and inactive <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups.</b> The {{defining characteristic of}} the <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> contained in the GTD is smallness.

This paper presents an analysis of the size distribution of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> and the implications of this size distribution for the technological conditions under which the output of terrorism may be increased. With net internal and external diseconomies to larger-scale production of terrorism, we should observe relatively small <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> and little or no tendency for the number and size of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> in the ‘terrorism industry’ to increase. These facts do characterise the empirically observed size distribution of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups,</b> and imply that the technological conditions under which the output of terrorism may be increased are characterised by internal and external diseconomies to larger-scale production of terrorism. ...|$|R
40|$|Terrorism is {{an extreme}} form of {{political}} violence, that is inherently abhorrent in nature. Yet, it continues to attain enough support to continue and survive. The recent proliferation of Islamic State and its ever increasing domestic and international civilian support base urges immediate attention to this question. While most research holds that provision of public goods by <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> is the primary cause for high levels of civilian support, I argue that, <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> {{are more interested in}} resource extraction rather than resource provision. Additionally, these studies pay scant attention to existing resource structure, especially territorial and political control to explain terrorist-civilian interaction. This paper emphasizes the bi-directional nature of this interaction – a. perception of civilians by the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> and b. <b>terrorist</b> <b>group’s</b> perception of the civilians. To analyze levels of civilian support for terrorism, I compare fifteen <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> using qualitative comparative analysis and show how territory, political competition, ethnicity, target selection and organizational structure combine to explain conditions that lead <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> to include or exclude civilian population for support. Based on the variance in support networks of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups,</b> counter-terrorism policies should also differ. High civilian support indicates the need to use non-military methods to decrease the appeal of <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups.</b> However, <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> with more diffused and multiple support structures need more collaborative and coercive measures to intercept all the possible links to the main group...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe potential for {{conflict between the}} United States and <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> is {{higher than in the}} recent past. This thesis attempts to understand the underlying causes for {{the rise and fall of}} <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> by developing a theory that explains the evolution of their life cycles. This thesis argues that once organizational issues take priority over instrumental ones terrorism becomes self-defeating and survival threatening for the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group.</b> Since this priority shift occurs as a natural consequence of their internal dynamics. the seeds of a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group's</b> destruction exist within the group itself. Factors external to the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group.</b> however, can suppress the germination of those seeds and allow the group to survive. The dynamic interaction of these internal and external influences shapes a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group's</b> life cycle. Understanding the nature of this process is important for the design of counterterrorist policy. U. S. Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis {{focuses on the}} nexus between a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group's</b> narrative and the group's success or failure in achieving its strategic goals. This work theorizes that the interaction of competing narratives exerts a systematic impact {{on the ability of}} the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> to achieve its strategic goals through the influence that the narratives have over a group's members, the group's adversary, and the affected population. Although a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> with a good narrative can be defeated, a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> with a weak narrative is much less likely to win. Consequently, in order for a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> to improve its chances of prevailing, it needs a strong narrative. While issues like material shortfalls, the repressiveness of state security services, and changing demographics could contribute to the demise of a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group,</b> these factors also serve to demonstrate how difficult it is for a <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> with a weak narrative to generate enough support to overcome these deficits. Since narratives are not fixed, each side may choose to change their narrative in order to accurately address changing circumstances. Changes could follow shifts in policy, appointment of new leadership, and even changes of fortune. US Army (USA) authors...|$|R
40|$|Although long established, media {{oriented}} terrorist {{events have}} not been conceptualized or measured in a coherent manner. To forward the empirical study of media oriented terrorism, a measure {{that can be applied}} to terrorist events or to <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> was developed and employed to compare terrorist activity for twenty <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> and two hundred terrorist events. The media orientation measure taps into five factors of media orientation and successfully differentiates high from low media orientated events and active and inactive media oriented <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups.</b> The single most important factor regarding any group's individual media orientation level was their base of operation. <b>Terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> that were engaged in regional struggles were found to be less media oriented. Despite the news value of death and injury, the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> with the highest fatality and injury averages ranked ninth in its media orientation score indicating that death and injury was not a necessary indicator of media orientation. Scores further suggest that media savvy well-known <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> did not pursue media oriented activity as a constant strategy. ...|$|R

40|$|Why do some <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> last {{much longer}} than others? This {{dissertation}} is among {{a small but growing}} number of studies to apply social networks analysis to the study of terrorism, and addresses an outcome of interest that is important but under analyzed. <b>Terrorist</b> <b>group</b> survival is puzzling because it is not explained by the conditions that encourage terrorism generally. Much of the literature has focused on terrorist attacks as an outcome of interest, ignoring the group context in which most incidents occur. Organizational and social network research suggests that group dynamics have important effects on outcomes, but connections between these studies and terrorism are underdeveloped. The dissertation presents an organizational-network model of <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> survival. Organizational aspects are the base of the model, but network attributes are a greater innovation, as this research offers the first explanation of <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> longevity to incorporate network attributes. The argument suggests the importance of direct ties between <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> – cooperative and adversarial. It also argues for a role of interorganizational relations more broadly, in terms of indirect competition and eigenvector centrality. Finally, I incorporate the state into the explanation, emphasizing how state attributes condition intergroup relations.

40|$|Terrorism, {{like other}} forms of {{political}} violence, has an organizational context. Few studies, however, have considered the influence of organizational life upon the outward behavior of the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group.</b> This thesis explores the possibility that terrorism, {{in addition to its}} political context, reflects the internal dynamics of the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group.</b> Assuming that action is what binds the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> together, the use of violence may oftentimes be dictated more by the need to satisfy the internal goal of group survival than to directly further the group's external political agenda. Focusing upon internal cohesion as the critical mediating variable for group survival, this paper examines how the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group's</b> efforts to maintain itself drives violent behavior that transcends political considerations and operational prudence. When external and internal requirements become contradictory, the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> faces a dilemma. Caught in a vicious cycle of reacting to strategic failure with more violent action in order to maintain itself, the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> generates a negative dynamic of violence that not only undermines its chances of achieving stated long-term goals but also accelerates its decline.
