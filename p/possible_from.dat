The freeway continues east through Santee, with interchanges at Fanita Drive, Cuyamaca Street, and Magnolia Avenue, before it comes to an end at SR67.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aquilonia adapts {{readily to}} {{cultivation}} in humid or temperate climates, but is rarely cultivated. A fast-growing plant, it can grow in acidic soils from pH 3.5 to 6.5. Propagation is generally by seed, and plants flower at {{four to six}} years of age. Vegetative propagation is <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> semi-hardened cuttings of pencil thickness. The flower spikes attract birds to the garden. It can also be grown in a pot, with its branches heavily pruned to keep foliage dense.|$|E
5|$|Grit {{is often}} mixed with hydrous sodium {{ferrocyanide}} as an anticaking agent which, while harmless {{in its natural}} form, can undergo photodissociation in strong sunlight to produce the extremely toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide. Although sunlight is generally not intense enough to cause this in polar and temperate regions, salt deposits must kept as far as <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> waterways to avert the possibility of cyanide-tainted runoff water entering fisheries or farms.|$|E

5|$|In 1832, {{the state}} began {{construction}} on the Wabash and Erie Canal. The canal was started at Lake Erie, passed through Fort Wayne, and connected to the Wabash River. This new canal made water transport <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> New Orleans to Lake Erie on an internal route rather than sailing around {{the whole of the}} Eastern United States and entering through Canada. Other canal projects were started, but all were abandoned before completion due to the state's foundering credit after the devaluation of the bonds.|$|E

5|$|A Historical Overview Committee of sportswriters {{appointed}} by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a ballot of 10 managers and umpires. The managers/umpires list was then submitted to a panel composed of Hall of Fame members, executives and veteran media members for a final vote. A separate ballot of 10 executives was developed by a panel including executives, players and writers, which was the same committee which finally voted in that area. The final ballots were released in November 2009. Each panel member was allowed to vote for up to four individuals on each ballot, and each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either panel was elected; therefore, a maximum of five inductions were <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> each ballot. Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Indianapolis on December 6, 2009, with the results announced the next day; {{as was the case}} with the 2008 class of inductees, the Committee met to discuss the candidates, although the previous three elections had been conducted by mail.|$|E
5|$|An eagle’s {{appearance}} in the sky when thunderclouds threatened was greeted with joy and hope by people who trusted {{in their power to}} defeat an ala; after defeating the ala, the eagle led the clouds away from the fields. An explanation for this, recorded in eastern Serbia, is that the eagles which nest in the vicinity of a village want thunderstorms and hail as far as <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> their nestlings, so coincidentally protect the village’s fields as well. The role of eagles, however, was controversial, because in the same region there was a belief that an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala, leading the clouds toward the crops, rather than driving them away.|$|E

5|$|Baldur's Gate II, {{taking place}} {{south of the}} events of Baldur's Gate, is set in the country of Amn, mainly in and around the city of Athkatla. The game opens shortly after the events of Baldur's Gate and {{continues}} the story of the protagonist, Gorion's Ward, whose unique heritage has now gained them the attention of the mage Jon Irenicus. The game's plot revolves around the machinations of Irenicus and the protagonist's encounters with him. The game's development began in January 1999. BioWare set out to improve upon the first Baldur's Gate in every way <b>possible.</b> <b>From</b> a list of constructive criticism (compiled from the suggestions of fans, reviews, and internal suggestions) a list of features {{to be added to the}} game was distilled: some of these were 800 x 600 resolution, 3D support, and character kits. In Baldur's Gate, the game's engine and content were being developed at the same time; whereas in Baldur's Gate II, the engine was running from the start.|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{was born}} in Maryland, but little else is known about his life prior to 1813, {{when he arrived in}} East Florida, a {{province}} of Spanish Florida, as part of a military expedition. He established himself as a farmer {{in the northern part of}} the province before moving south, where he traded with local Indians and continued to farm. During the period in which the region was transferred from Spanish to U.S. governance, he sided with natives in a land dispute against a merchant who had received a large grant from the King of Spain and was evicting the Indians from their lands. Unhappy with the actions of the Spanish, he moved to the New River area in 1826 to get as far as <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> the Spanish influence.|$|E
5|$|For {{symbolic}} memorials, numerous {{designs were}} <b>possible,</b> <b>from</b> simple monuments through to {{much more complex}} pieces of sculpture. Obelisks had been a popular memorial form in the 19th century and remained so in the inter-war years, including in Britain, France, Australia and Romania. One factor in this popularity was that obelisks were relatively cheap to build, while they also fitted well with the existing civic architecture in many towns. Memorial plaques were another popular memorial style around the world. Soldiers, either individually or in groups, were a popular sculptural feature in most countries, portrayed in various stances; typically these were allegorical, although in France {{the style of the}} soldier could also carry political meaning and reflect local political sympathies. Although the trend pre-dated the First World War, very few Western war memorials portrayed heroic commanding officers, as had been popular earlier in the 19th century; if soldiers were depicted, they were invariably ordinary soldiers, usually infantrymen. After the unveiling of the Cenotaph in London, it became a popular design in many other locations in Britain and Australia too.|$|E
