5000|$|When pipe snaps or {{a part of}} the bit breaks off, {{the crew}} has to recover all of the {{separated}} items from the wellbore. Recovering snapped pipe usually involves placing a specialized tool (an [...] "overshot") with grips set inside of it over the broken pipe in an attempt to capture it. The grip works {{in a manner similar to}} Chinese fingercuffs. Sometimes the jagged top of the fish must be milled back to a round outside shape before the overshot can slip over it. The overshot contains a <b>packoff</b> device to make a pressure seal so circulation can be reestablished through the bit to facilitate recovery of the fish. For a broken bit, a magnet is commonly used to remove all of the broken parts.|$|E

They include drilling of highly inclined long wells in depleted reservoirs within narrow geo-pressure margins. In addition, drilling in unstable formations can cause serious problems which can increase non-productive time. In order to solve these problems {{there is a need}} to develop an automated mud-pump management system with purpose to minimize the possibility of formation fracturing during start-up of the mud pump or fluid circulation. Thixotropic drilling fluids enhance a hole cleaning in a wellbore during connections, avoiding cutting settings and <b>packoffs.</b> On the other hand, they bring challenges when starting the mud pump. Pressure peaks are typically seen when starting the pump manually after a connection. The theoretical results found in this thesis where pressure peaks are significantly reduced during pump start-ups, indicate that automations of pump start-up should be implemented in real rig operation at the field in the near future...|$|R
