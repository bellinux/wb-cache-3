In the crash, a United States Air Force North American F-100 Super Sabre {{on a flight}} from nearby Kadena Air Base suffered an engine fire and crashed into Miyamori Elementary School and surrounding houses. Eleven students and six other <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> were killed, and 210 were injured, including 156 students at the school. The F-100 crash contributed to ill will among the Okinawan population towards the U.S. occupation authorities, and strengthened calls for the island {{to be returned to}} the control of the Japanese government.|$|E

The firefighters, who had earlier deluge-hosed the MOVE members in a {{failed attempt to}} evict them from the building, stood by as the fire caused by the bomb engulfed the first house and spread to others, having been given orders to let the fire burn. Despite the earlier drenching of the building by firefighters, officials said they feared that MOVE would shoot at the firefighters. Eleven people (John Africa, five other adults, and five children aged 7 to 13) died in the resulting fire, and more than 250 <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> were left homeless.

500|$|S {{director}} J. T. Petty {{originally intended}} {{the film to}} focus on a man who lived near his childhood home; the man often spied on, and filmed, his neighbors. The footage led to an indictment towards [...] "the peeper", who recorded 191 videotapes of Petty's childhood neighborhood. The indictment implied the footage should be viewed in court, but the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> opposed this owing to privacy concerns. Petty said of the 191 videotapes, [...] "I admired the peeping tom; he had made movies that were frightening and titillating and real." [...] The idea of using a camera to record his neighbor's house for hours fascinated him so much that he decided to direct a film about it. Although he had already secured funding, Petty was left without a subject since [...] "the peeper" [...] {{wanted nothing to do with}} the film. Petty decided to focus on three directors, who did not direct films aimed at the general public; they directed simulated snuff films, involving murder and sexual assault. Petty found the directors— Zebub, Vogel, and Marcisak, Petty's friend who played the fictional director Rost— at the Chiller Convention, an underground horror event.|$|E
2500|$|Johnston {{lived alone}} and {{had lived in}} that house for about 17 years.

2500|$|Some sources {{suggest that}} the {{original}} name for the alliance, [...] "Cribs", was a name narrowed down {{from a list of}} many options, and chosen unanimously from three final choices, which included the Black Overlords, and the Assassins. Cribs was chosen to reflect the young age {{of the majority of the}} gang members. The name [...] "Cribs" [...] evolved into the name [...] "Crips" [...] when gang members began carrying around canes to display their [...] "pimp" [...] status. <b>People</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> then began calling them cripples, or [...] "Crips" [...] for short. A Los Angeles Sentinel article in February 1972 referred to some members as [...] "Crips" [...] (for cripples). [...] Another source suggests [...] "Crips" [...] may have evolved from [...] "Cripplers", a 1970s street gang in Watts of which Raymond Washington was a member. The name had no political, organizational, cryptic, or acronymic meaning, though some have suggested it stands for [...] "Common Revolution In Progress", a backronym. According to the film Bastards of the Party directed by a member of the Bloods, the name represented [...] "Community Revolutionary Interparty Service" [...] or [...] "Community Reform Interparty Service". Williams, in his memoir, further refuted claims that the group was a spin-off of the Black Panther Party or formed for a community agenda, the name [...] "depicted a fighting alliance against street gangs—nothing more, nothing less." [...] Washington, who attended Fremont High School, was the leader of the East Side Crips, and Williams, who attended Washington High School, led the West Side Crips.|$|E

While Britten and Vega interview <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> about Mackenzie's death, Britten finally finds a homeless man (Jeris Lee Poindexter) who recognizes MacKenzie's photo and talks to him.

Hearing that Taylor was watching Sunday Night Football, Britten asks what in particular the commentators said at that time. Taylor describes the commentary in detail; Britten and Bird check the broadcast, and confirm that he was telling the truth. Police tech Nat (Jay Seals) confirms that someone hacked the clinic computer system and deleted a number of patient records. The IP address belongs to Laura Harvison, one of the clinic clients.

His brothers joked about his queer ways, but in his sisters he found firm friends and tender comforters for all his woes. So he struggled along, working on the farm in summer and in a clock shop during the winter, with such brief spells of schooling as he could get between whiles, improving even these poor opportunities so well that he was letter-writer for all the young <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood.</b>|$|E

By the aspect and demeanor of these persons it was easy to judge that the feelings of the community had undergone a very favorable change in reference to the celestial pilgrimage.

Instead of a lonely and ragged man with a huge burden on his back, plodding along sorrowfully on foot while the whole city hooted after him, here were parties of the first gentry and most respectable <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> setting forth towards the Celestial City as cheerfully as if the pilgrimage were merely a summer tour. Among the gentlemen were characters of deserved eminence--magistrates, politicians, and men of wealth, by whose example religion could not but be greatly recommended to their meaner brethren. In the ladies' apartment, too, I rejoiced to distinguish some of those flowers of fashionable society who are so well fitted to adorn the most elevated circles of the Celestial City. There was much pleasant conversation about the news of the day, topics of business and politics, or the lighter matters of amusement; while religion, though indubitably the main thing at heart, was thrown tastefully into the background. Even an infidel would have heard little or nothing to shock his sensibility.|$|E
60|$|There {{were very}} few <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of Thorbury who were older than Miss Panney, and very few of any age who were as alert in both mind and body. She {{had been born in}} this region; had left it in her youth, and had {{returned}} about thirty years ago, when she had taken up her abode with the Wittons, who at that time were a newly married couple. They were now middle-aged people, but Miss Panney still lived with them, and seemed to be much the very same old lady as she was when she arrived. She was a woman who kept a good deal to herself, having many resources for her active mind. With many people who were not acquainted with her socially but knew all about her, she had the reputation of being wicked. The principal reason for this belief was the well-known fact that she always took her breakfast in bed. This was considered to be a French habit, and the French were looked upon as infidels. Moreover, she never went to church, and when questioned upon this subject, had been known to answer that she could not listen with patience to a sermon, for she had never heard one without thinking that she could preach on that subject a great deal better than the man in the pulpit.|$|E
