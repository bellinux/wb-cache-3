5|$|Classic Entertainments {{acquired}} the overseas distribution {{rights of the}} film in late February 2015, for an amount of 81 million, which was the highest <b>price</b> <b>that</b> any Telugu film had commanded in the overseas market until then. By {{the second week of}} June 2015, distribution rights for most of the regions were sold out while negotiations for a few were ongoing.

The rating was then used to {{determine}} the price and the percentage of the <b>price</b> <b>that</b> growers get. The Grand Cru rated vineyards received 100 percent rating which entitled the grower to 100% of the price. Premier Crus were vineyards with 90–99% ratings while Deuxième Crus received 80–89% ratings.|$|E
5|$|Rwandans {{have been}} growing coffee since colonial times, but until 1999 the product was classed below Grade C, making it unsalable on the global markets.

40|$|Two key {{questions}} are {{addressed in this}} article. (i) Have Malawi's tobacco-policy reforms led to improvements in the absolute <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> smallholders get? (ii) How do the <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> smallholders receive compare with what the rich estate owners get? Empirical {{results indicate that the}} reforms have led to some improvements in both absolute and relative <b>prices</b> <b>that</b> smallholder farmers receive. Major positive changes in the tobacco price-structure have occurred after removing monopsony and liberalising the market. However, farmers, especially smallholders, are still faced with high transaction and logistics costs that need to be addressed...|$|R

5|$|He {{sold the}} {{building}} at a low <b>price</b> <b>that</b> year, to Charles Carpy, who deeded the property to the California Wine Association. The association continued using the Greystone Cellars wine label. A year later, the Bisceglia brothers of San Jose purchased Greystone where they produced sacramental wine under the same label until 1930, and again beginning in October 1933. The Carpy family maintained part of the land, including a Victorian house nicknamed Albert's Villa south of the winery. The house burned down around 1929 and was replaced with a Spanish-style house that is now owned by the school.|$|E
5|$|The 8-track {{tapes of}} the three shows were {{carefully}} put in storage by Warner Bros. Japan for future use. For the album's 21st anniversary in 1993, Deep Purple author and archivist Simon Robinson decided to enquire via the band's management if the tapes could be located. He discovered the entire show had been recorded well, including all the encores. In July, Robinson and Darron Goodwin remixed the tapes at Abbey Road Studios for an expanded edition, that was then mastered by Peter Mew in September. To compromise between including {{as much of the}} shows as possible and setting a realistic <b>price</b> <b>that</b> most fans would accept, they decided to release a 3-CD box set, titled Live in Japan. This included all {{of the three}} main shows except for two tracks already available on the original album. In their place were two previously unreleased encores.|$|E
5|$|The Steam store also enables {{users to}} redeem store product keys to add {{software}} from their library. The keys are sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle (in which {{a portion of}} the sale is given back to the publisher or distributor), distributed as part of a physical release to redeem the game, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowd funding rewards. A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other third-party sites at a higher price, generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these third-party sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the third-party they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a minimum <b>price</b> <b>that</b> must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the grey market.|$|E
