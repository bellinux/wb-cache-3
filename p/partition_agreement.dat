40|$|This study {{attempts}} to delineate {{the boundaries of}} the spheres of interest in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia established under the Russo-Japanese accords of 1907 and 1912. Although the agreements are well known, there have been few efforts to reconstruct these spheres cartographically. Two existing maps offer contradictory interpretations. These <b>partition</b> <b>agreements</b> had a major impact on diplomacy, railway policy, and strategic planning during the decade they held force between 1907 and 1916, and the precise location of the Russo-Japanese sphere boundaries in this contested region was a matter of no small consequence. The author proposes a revised boundary map based on an examination of textual and cartographic sources, including maps produced by the army command of the Kwantung government-general. At the same time, the author seeks to highlight the potential value of cartographic analysis as a mode of historical inquiry into the record of Japanese imperialism. Cartography was an indispensable tool for modern empire builders in bringing a measurable territoriality to their realms and making their lands and subjects politically legible. The mapping entailed in these boundary agreements was important not only in bilateral diplomacy, but also in enhancing the legibility of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia to Japanese imperialists themselves...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} jointly training structured mod-els for extraction from multiple web sources whose records enjoy partial content overlap. This has important applica-tions in open-domain extraction, e. g. a user materializing a table of interest from multiple relevant unstructured sources; or a site like Freebase augmenting an incomplete relation by extracting more rows from web sources. Such applications require extraction over arbitrary domains, so one cannot use a pre-trained extractor or demand a huge labeled dataset. We propose to overcome this lack of supervision by using content overlap across the related web sources. Existing methods of exploiting overlap have been developed under settings that do not generalize easily to the scale and diver-sity of overlap seen on Web sources. We present an agreement-based learning framework that jointly trains the models by biasing them {{to agree on the}} agreement regions, i. e. shared text segments. We present alternatives within our framework to trade-off tractability, robustness to noise, and extent of agreement enforced; and propose a scheme of <b>partitioning</b> <b>agreement</b> regions that leads to efficient training while maximizing overall accuracy. Further, we present a principled scheme to discover low-noise agreement regions in unlabeled data across multiple sources.

40|$|Bioavailable and bioaccessible {{fractions}} of sediment-associated contaminants are considered as better dose metrics for sediment-quality assessment than total concentrations. The authors applied exhaustive solvent extraction and nondepletive equilibrium sampling techniques to sediment samples collected along the Brisbane River in South East Queensland, Australia, {{which range from}} pristine environments to urban and industry-impacted areas. The wide range of chemicals expected prevents comprehensive chemical analysis, but a battery of cell-based bioassays sheds light on mixture effects of chemicals in relation to various modes of toxic action. Toxic effects were expressed as bioanalytical equivalent concentrations (BEQs) normalized to the organic carbon content of each sediment sample. Bioanalytical equivalent concentrations from exhaustive extraction agreed fairly well with values estimated from polydimethylsiloxane passive sampling extracts via the constant organic carbon to polydimethylsiloxane <b>partition</b> coefficient. <b>Agreement</b> was best for bioassays indicative of photosynthesis inhibition and oxidative stress response and discrepancy within a factor of 3 for the induction of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. For nonspecific cytotoxicity, BEQ from exhaustive extraction were 1 order of magnitude higher than values from equilibrium sampling, possibly because of coextraction of bioactive natural organic matter that led to an overestimation of toxicity in the exhaustive extracts, which suggests that passive sampling is better suited in combination with bioanalytical assessment than exhaustive extraction...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} constNJ (constrained neighbor-joining), an algorithm for phy-logenetic {{reconstruction of}} sets of trees with constrained pairwise rooted subtree-prune-regraft (rSPR) distance. We {{are motivated by}} the problem of constructing sets of trees that must fit into a recombination, hybridization, or similar network. Rather than first finding a set of trees that are optimal according to a phylogenetic criterion (e. g., likelihood or par-simony) and then attempting to fit them into a network, constNJ estimates the trees while enforcing specified rSPR distance constraints. The primary input for constNJ {{is a collection of}} distance matrices derived from sequence blocks which are assumed to have evolved in a tree-like manner, such as blocks of an alignment which do not contain any recombination breakpoints. The other input is a set of rSPR constraint inequalities for any set of pairs of trees. constNJ is consistent and a strict generalization of the neighbor-joining algorithm; it uses the new notion of maximum <b>agreement</b> <b>partitions</b> (MAPs) to assure that the resulting trees satisfy the given rSPR distance constraints.

50|$|Unearthed in Frei-Laubersheim in 1872 was the Frei-Laubersheim fibula, a Frankish {{artefact}} {{bearing a}} partially legible runic inscription. It {{is believed to}} date from about the 6th century AD, and it represents proof that the Frei-Laubersheim area was settled in those days. In 767/768 and 771 - some two centuries later - Frei-Laubersheim had its first documentary mentions as Liubherisheim in two donation documents that bestowed holdings upon Lorsch Abbey, and are therefore found in the Lorsch codex. Transferred to the Abbey by these acts were, among other things, vineyards within what are now Frei-Laubersheim’s limits. Frei-Laubersheim can thus look back on a history well over 1,200 years long, {{as well as a}} winegrowing tradition of that same length. During the Middle Ages, many monasteries had holdings in the village at their disposal. Among these very early on, besides Lorsch, was Prüm Abbey in the Eifel, which in an 823 exchange agreement acquired, besides holdings in Grolsheim, Horrweiler and Stein-Bockenheim, also property within Frei-Laubersheim’s limits. It is assumed that the village then belonged to the Altenbamberg region of the Bishopric of Verdun. Unmistakably, Tholey Abbey’s holdings leant on Verdun’s. Tholey was the village’s most influential monastery. Besides collation rights (the right to assign priests), which were part of the general use of the ecclesiastical estate and other kinds of income, the abbot collected all the produce and wine tithes. The monastery further owned an estate whose building complex is still preserved today and is mainly found within the Görtz property. The holders of power within the village throughout the Middle Ages and beyond were the Counts of Sponheim and their heirs (who were various and often changed after the Sponheims died out). Besides these lords, other nobles also held other rights in Frei-Laubersheim, mostly relating to smaller landholds. According to the official description of the Amt of Kreuznach from the former “Further” County of Sponheim, in 1601, Frei-Laubersheim was a big village with 92 households or hearths. This would yield a population figure of some 400 souls. In 1672, the village only had a few more than 200 inhabitants, proof of how sorely it had suffered in the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). When broad swathes of the Palatinate and the Rhineland were laid waste in the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), Frei-Laubersheim, too, was affected. The number of Reformed families sank from 60 to 37. Well-to-do townsmen’s houses, the church and the rectory lay in ruins. Beginning in 1707, Frei-Laubersheim belonged wholly to Electoral Palatinate {{as a result of a}} <b>partition</b> <b>agreement.</b> It was assigned to the Oberamt of Kreuznach. In the late 18th century, the village had 115 families with 464 souls, along with two churches and two schoolhouses alongside the 115 private houses. The municipal area was made up of 1,123 Morgen of cropland, 9 Morgen of vineyards, 75 Morgen of meadows and 745 Morgen of woods. After the French had overrun and occupied the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank in 1794, the region belonged from 1798 to the French First Republic, and more locally to the newly created Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German) and the Canton of Wöllstein. Frei-Laubersheim was also the seat of a mairie (“mayoralty”) as of 1800, to which Volxheim also belonged. As they did throughout Rhenish Hesse in the time of French Revolutionary rule, liberty poles, tricolour cockades and red Phrygian caps held their place in Frei-Laubersheim’s everyday life. The simple peasants now became citizens, the clergyman a “folk teacher” and the church a “gathering house”. Thus was the situation after the French Revolutionary troops’ arrival in 1797 described by Pastor Fritsch, who worked as the Evangelical clergyman in Frei-Laubersheim from 1899 to 1934. In 1813 and 1814, part of the beaten Napoleonic army came through Frei-Laubersheim on its retreat, bringing with them Lazarettfieber (literally “field hospital fever” - this was a general term for any of a number of sicknesses, including gangrene, pyaemia, shingles and typhus), and this claimed 57 lives. A few months later, a new misfortune befell the village when 60,000 Russian troops on their way to the Battle of Waterloo marched through the village’s streets. Such a great number of them could not have been billeted very easily, or comfortably. Under the terms of the Congress of Vienna, the land now known as Rhenish Hesse (or Rheinhessen in German, even though it is nowadays no longer in Hesse) was assigned to the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Quite possibly, in connection with the Revolutions of 1848, things such as freedom, constitution and parliament were already being hotly debated, but at the same time, one of the leading minds of the Freischärler ("irregulars") movement was living with the Frei-Laubersheim Evangelical clergyman, Pastor Matty. Details, however, are unknown. On the other hand, much is known about Frei-Laubersheim’s population development in the earlier half of the 19th century. There were 590 citizens in the village in 1815, at the time when the Napoleonic Wars ended. By 1854, this had risen to 771. The century’s last decades brought quiet times, and clubs began to form in the village, as they did elsewhere in the land. Frei-Laubersheim’s oldest is the singing club, founded in 1882. A volunteer fire brigade followed in 1886 and a gymnastic and sport club in 1900. A particularly important event in the village’s history was the opening of the railway from Sprendlingen to Fürfeld in 1898. Frei-Laubersheim got its own station on the line. The Bawettche, as the line was known locally, ran until 1954, at least for passengers. Goods service continued for a while, but in the end, the tracks were torn up in 1960. In 1880, the schoolhouse that still stands today was built. In 1917 came electric light, from neighbouring Bad Kreuznach. Only in 1954 was the watermain built. Until then, people in Frei-Laubersheim fetched water from one of the many household wells.|$|E

The hierarchical structure of the proposed key <b>agreement</b> <b>partitions</b> the group members into location-based clusters capable of reducing the cost of communication and key management when member joins or leave networks. Moreover, based on elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography key management, the proposed scheme not only provides effective and efficient dynamic group key reconstructions and secures multicast data transmissions but also fits the robustness of the wireless networks and lowers overhead costs of security management. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the University of Sheffield Conifer Model (USCM), a process-based approach for simulating conifer forest carbon, nitrogen, and water fluxes by up-scaling widely applicable relationships between leaf lifespan and function. The USCM {{is designed to}} predict and analyze the biogeochemistry and biophysics of conifer forests that dominated the ice-free high-latitude regions under the high pCO 2 “greenhouse” world 290 – 50 Myr ago. It will be of use in future research investigating controls on the contrasting distribution of ancient evergreen and deciduous forests between hemispheres, and their differential feedbacks on polar climate through the exchange of energy and materials with the atmosphere. Emphasis is placed on leaf lifespan because this trait can be determined from the anatomical characteristics of fossil conifer woods and influences a range of ecosystem processes. Extensive testing of simulated net primary production and partitioning, leaf area index, evapotranspiration, nitrogen uptake, and land surface energy <b>partitioning</b> showed close <b>agreement</b> with observations from sites across a wide climatic gradient. This indicates the generic utility of our model, and adequate representation of the key processes involved in forest function using only information on leaf lifespan, climate, and soils. ...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{foundation}} of Yugoslavia in 1918, a highly centralized state {{was established in the}} St. Vitus Day Constitution of 1921 in accordance with Serbian nationalist desires to ensure the unity of the Serbs, this caused resentment amongst Croats and other peoples in Yugoslavia. Dalmatian Croat and the principal World War I-era Yugoslavist leader Ante Trumbić denounced the St. Vitus Day Constitution for establishing a Serb hegemony in Yugoslavia contrary to the interests of Croats and other peoples in Yugoslavia. Croatian nationalists opposed the centralized state with moderate nationalists demanding an autonomous Croatia within Yugoslavia. Croatian nationalism became a mass movement in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia through Stjepan Radić's Croatian Peasant Party. The demand by moderate Croatian nationalists for an autonomous Croatia within Yugoslavia was accepted by the Yugoslav government in the Cvetković-Maček Agreement of 1939. The agreement angered Serbian nationalists who opposed the agreement {{on the grounds that it}} weakened the unity of Serbdom in Yugoslavia, asserting its importance to Yugoslavia with the slogan [...] "Strong Serbdom, Strong Yugoslavia". The agreement also angered Bosniaks (then known as Yugoslav Muslims), including the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (JMO) that denounced the <b>agreement's</b> <b>partition</b> of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|R
