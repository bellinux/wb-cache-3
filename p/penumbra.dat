40|$|Detecting object {{boundaries}} {{in the presence}} of cast shadows is a difficult task for machine vision systems. A new edge detector is presented which responds to shadow <b>penumbras</b> and abrupt object edges with distinguishable signals. The detector requires the use of spatially extended light sources and sufficient video resolution to resolve the shadow <b>penumbras</b> of interest. Detection of high frequency noise is suppressed without requiring image-dependent adjustment of signal thresholds. The ability of the edge operator to distinguish shadow <b>penumbras</b> from abrupt object boundaries while suppressing responses to high frequency noise and texture is illustrated with idealized shadow and object edge intensity profiles. Selective detection of object {{boundaries in}} a video scene with a cast shadow has also been demonstrated with this operator...|$|R
5|$|The {{diagrams}} to {{the right}} show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the <b>penumbra,</b> in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the <b>penumbra</b> of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} a game to include stealth gameplay, the {{knowledge}} of the artificial intelligence (AI) must be restricted to make it ignorant to parts of the game world. The AI in stealth games takes into specific consideration the enemies' reactions to the effects of the player's actions, such as turning off the lights, as opposed to merely reacting to the player directly. Enemies typically have a line of sight which the player can avoid by hiding behind objects, staying in the shadows or moving while the enemy is facing another direction. Enemies can also typically detect when the player touches them or moves within a small, fixed distance. Overall, stealth games vary in what player actions the AI will perceive and react to, with more recent games offering a wider range of enemy reactions. Often, the AI's movements are predictable and regular, allowing the player to devise a strategy to overcome his adversaries. Players are often given limited methods of engaging opponents directly in stealth games, either by restricting the player to ineffective or non-lethal weapons, equipping adversaries with far superior equipment and numbers, or providing the player with a limited amount of health that makes most combat scenarios extremely dangerous. Stealth games sometimes overlap with the survival horror genre, in which players are forced to hide from and evade supernatural or occasionally mundane enemies as they attempt to track down the player. Examples of hybrid stealth/horror games include , Outlast, and the <b>Penumbra</b> video game series.|$|E

Though the shadows generated are physically inaccurate, this technique yields <b>penumbrae</b> that are smooth and perceptually convincing. ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{observed}} formation of <b>penumbrae</b> on a pore {{in the active}} region NOAA 10838 using Dunn Solar Telescope at NSO,Sunpot,USA. Simultaneous observations using different instruments (DLSP,UBF,Gband and CaK) provide us with vector magnetic field at photosphere, intensity images and Doppler velocity at different heights from photosphere to chromosphere. Results from our analysis of this particular data-set suggests that <b>penumbrae</b> are formed {{as a result of}} relaxation of magnetic field due to a flare happening at the same time. Images in show the flare (C 2. 9 as per GOES) and vector magnetic fields show a re-orientation and reduction in the global α value (a measure of twist).

40|$|The {{degree of}} realism of the shaded {{image of a}} {{three-dimensional}} scene depends on the successful simulation of shading effects. The shading model has two main ingredients, properties of the surface and properties of the illumination falling on it. Most previous work has concentrated on the former rather than the latter. This paper presents an improved version for generating scenes illuminated by point and linear light sources. The procedure can include intensity distributions for point light sources and output both umbrae and <b>penumbrae</b> for linear light sources, assuming the environment is composed of convex polyhedra. This paper generalizes Crow’s procedure for computing shadows by using shadow volumes to compute the shading of umbrae and <b>penumbrae.</b> Using shadow volumes caused by the end points of the linear source results in an easy determination of the regions of <b>penumbrae</b> and umbrae on the face prior to shading calculation. This paper also discusses a method for displaying illuminance distribution on a shaded image by using colored isolux contours...|$|R

40|$|Phase {{perturbations}} due to inclined surface {{magnetic field}} of active region strength are calculated numerically in quiet Sun and simple sunspot models {{in order to}} estimate and compare the direct and indirect (thermal) effects of the fields on helioseismic waves. It is found that the largest direct effects occur in highly inclined field characteristic of <b>penumbrae,</b> and scale roughly linearly with magnetic field strength. The combined effects of sunspot magnetic and thermal anomalies typically yield negative travel-time perturbations in <b>penumbrae.</b> Travel-time shifts in umbrae depend on details of how the thermal and density structure differs from the quiet Sun. The combined shifts are generally not well approximated by {{the sum of the}} thermal and magnetic effects applied separately, except at low field strengths of around 1 kG or less, or if the thermal shift is small. A useful rule-of-thumb appears to be that travel-time perturbations in umbrae are predominantly thermal, whereas in <b>penumbrae</b> they are mostly magnetic.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the possible gain in tissue sparing in hadrontherapy when a spatial fractionation of the dose is used.

Several centre-to-centre distances, covering a 2 x 2 cm 2 area, have been taken into account. The ratio of the peak-to-valley doses (PVDR) and the <b>penumbrae</b> was used as evaluation parameter, since PVDR {{is considered to be a}} very relevant dosimetric parameter for tissue sparing. Extremely high PVDRs values and very narrow <b>penumbrae</b> were obtained in all depths. This means that this new way of dose delivery might allow the use of higher and potentially curative doses in clinical cases where tissue tolerances are a limit to achieve a curative treatment. The high PVDR obtained and the small <b>penumbrae</b> in comparison with existing radiosurgery techniques, suggest a potential gain in healthy tissue sparing in those new techniques...|$|R

In this paper, we observationally studied the formation of <b>penumbrae</b> in NOAA 10978, where several penumbral formations were observed in G-band images of SOT/Hinode. Thanks to the continuous observation by Hinode, we could morphologically follow the evolution of sunspots and found that there are several paths to the penumbral formation: (1) Active accumulation of magnetic flux, (2) Rapid emergence of magnetic field, and (3) Appearance of twisted or rotating magnetic tubes. In all of these cases, magnetic fields are expected to sustain high inclination at the edges of flux tube concentration longer than the characteristic growth time of downward magnetic pumping.

40|$|Sunspot <b>penumbrae</b> show a fine {{structure}} in continuum intensity that displays considerable dynamics. The magnetic field, in contrast, although also highly structured, has {{appeared to be}} relatively static. Here we report the discovery of inward moving magnetic enhancements in the <b>penumbrae</b> of two regular sunspots based on time series of SOHO/MDI magnetograms. Local enhancements of the LOS component of the magnetic field in the inner part of the penumbral region move inward to the umbra-penumbra boundary with a radial speed of about 0. 3 km s$^{- 1 }$. These local inward-moving enhancements of the LOS component of the magnetic fields appear to be relatively common. They are associated with dark structures and tend to display downflows relatively to the penumbral background. Possible explanations are discussed.

40|$|Sunspots, {{the most}} {{prominent}} manifestation of the solar magnetism, are fascinating research subjects. Especially sunspot <b>penumbrae,</b> with their high structuring, have attracted much attention from which ample observational and theoretical scientific work has originated. Recent observations with improved solar instrumentation have revealed that sunspot <b>penumbrae</b> possess much finer structures than was thought a few decades ago. Thus, we are still {{at the beginning of}} understanding <b>penumbrae</b> with their still enigmatic intensity pattern, their magnetic field structures, and the basic processes which cause the structuring and the Evershed flow (Evershed 1909). This Thesis work is based on two-dimensional high-spatial-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of sunspot <b>penumbrae.</b> They were obtained in April 2002 and May 2003 with the “Göttingen” Fabry-Pérot spectrometer at the Vacuum Tower Telescope at the Observatorio del Teide (Tenerife). Speckle methods were applied for image reconstruction which resulted in a spatial resolution of 0. 5 arcsec in the magnetograms of the <b>penumbrae.</b> Stokes I and V profiles of the Fe II 614. 9 nm line, which exhibits no instrumental Stokes Q/U → V crosstalk, and of the Fe I line pair at 630. 2 nm, have been analysed. From the analysis of intensity maps corresponding to different atmospheric layers it has been found that, on scales larger than 0. 5 arcsec, the intensity pattern of <b>penumbrae</b> stays the same in the continuum and core images of the 630. 15 n m line, which stem from 0 km and 300 km (above τ= 1), respectively. Yet at scales of 0. 5 arcsec and smaller the pattern in the two spectral features it is found to be different. From the comparison of velocity and intensity maps, one can see that in the limb side of sunspots the Evershed flow is carried by dark filaments and on the centre side by bright features and their somewhat weakened tails. This can be explain in terms of the picture in which the velocity of hot rising gas is best seen on the centre side, while on the limb side the horizontal outward and possibly downward flows are seen when the gas has cooled down. Strong line-of-sight components of the magnetic fields are not found in bright filaments but in dark structures, somewhat displaced from the darkest parts. Their positions do not coincide with those of the strongest velocity fields. In general, these results are compatible with the picture of low lying flow channels coincident with the horizontal magnetic field, or possibly emerging and diving down into sub-photospheric layers, like a “sea serpent”. To complete the analysis on the penumbral fine-structure, forward modelling has been performed. The aim has been to synthesise Stokes profiles which account for the asymmetries of the observed profiles. For that purpose, a numerical code was developed from existing ones to solve the one-dimensional radiative transfer problem. The assumed penumbral model contains two atmospheric components coexisting in the same resolution element. It has been possible to rule out “cool upflows” as an appropriate scenario of the penumbral structure. Moreover, synthetic profiles generated from the assumption of hot upflows have lead to the simulation of observed profiles from penumbral grains. This would mean that the grains do indeed carry hot material to the photosphere in up-flows. However, strongly asymmetric profiles are not easily reproducible with the considered model. Some further dynamic phenomena are discussed along these pages, which demonstrate the richness of processes in <b>penumbrae,</b> and reveal unexpected properties...|$|R
