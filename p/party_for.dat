5|$|Fortuyn's {{political}} heritage scattered {{among various}} politicians, {{many of which}} were not successful. These include Marco Pastors, leader of the One NL, and Hilbrand Nawijn, leader of the <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> the Netherlands—none of which managed to win a seat in the 2006 election. More importantly however, the party had been squeezed out by the tougher line on immigration issues by mainstream politicians such as Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk, who largely adopted Fortuyn's policies. By the end of the decade, former LPF supporters had mostly moved to support Geert Wilders and his <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> Freedom (PVV).|$|E

5|$|Raised a Roman Catholic, Wilders {{left the}} church at his coming of age. His travels to Israel and the greater Middle East as a young adult helped form his {{political}} views. Wilders worked as a speechwriter for the conservative-liberal People's <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie – VVD), and later served as parliamentary assistant to party leader Frits Bolkestein from 1990 to 1998. He {{was elected to the}} Utrecht city council in 1997, and one year later to the House of Representatives. Citing irreconcilable differences over the party's position on the accession of Turkey to the European Union, he left the VVD in 2004 to form his own party, the <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> Freedom.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> Freedom's {{political}} platform often overlaps {{those of the}} assassinated Rotterdam politician Pim Fortuyn and his Pim Fortuyn List. After his death, Fortuyn's impact remained, {{as more and more}} politicians sought to gain political mileage by directly confronting topics such as a ban on immigration that were, from a politically correct point of view, considered unmentionable in the Netherlands until Fortuyn came on the scene and upended the Dutch tradition of consensus politics with an anti-immigration stance. Wilders would position himself to inherit Fortuyn's constituency. The <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> Freedom called for a €16billion tax reduction, a far stricter policy toward recreational drug use, investing more in roads and other infrastructure, building nuclear power plants and including animal rights in the Dutch constitution. In the 2006 Dutch parliamentary election, their first parliamentary election, the <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> Freedom won 9 out of the 150 open seats.|$|E
