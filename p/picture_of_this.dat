5|$|Phil England {{writes in}} The Ecologist that the {{strength}} of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Ross Gelbspan’s The Heat is On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E
5|$|Calculus' shark-shaped {{submarine}} was visually {{based on}} a real American submarine; Hergé had seen a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> in a German newspaper. The diving suit worn in the story was also based on clippings that Hergé had accumulated. Similarly, the dockside bar depicted by the cartoonist was {{based on a}}n illustration that he had collected. The shop where Haddock and Tintin buy the diving equipment, including the suit, was inspired from a picture of a bar which was featured in the German magazine, Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. The tribal effigy found on a Caribbean island by Sir Francis Haddock was based on a Bamileke tribal statue from Cameroon that Hergé saw in a museum. The Sirius, which had appeared before in The Shooting Star, was named after the SS Sirius, the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean solely under steam power, but was visually based upon the design of a trawler, the John-O.88. Hergé had sketched this ship in Ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of the trawler from the builders, Jos Boel & Son, and a small-scale model of it from a collector. The undersea wreck of the Unicorn was loosely inspired by images of the wreck of a 17th-century Swedish vessel, the Vasa, which Hergé had collected. The instance in the story in which a shark swallows a large box (that the characters hope contains the treasure) is based on a real account of a shark that swallowed a camera from the American underwater photographer Otis Barton, which Hergé had encountered in a French illustrated magazine.|$|E

Their presence on campus and the academic credit they received for their service was called into question by both students and faculty in the spring of 1970, but Boyd said he could not abolish ROTC.

25|$|Cattle Island {{exists in}} one of the extreme points of Hirakud Reservoir, a natural wonder. It is near Kumarbandh village of Belpahar-Banharpali range which is about 90km from Sambalpur. The island is a {{submerged}} hill, and before the construction of Hirakud Dam it was a developed village. During the resettlement period, villagers left some of their cattle behind; when the dam construction was over, the cattle settled on the hilltop. With the passage of time the nearby area filled up with the reservoir water, turning the hilltop into an island. Being away from mankind, the cattle are now wild, very swift and not easily caught. Living on a hilltop with dense forest, they are larger than tame cattle, almost all of which are white in colour. Nearby residents attempt to capture these animals from time to time, but these hunts are rarely successful. Though descended from tame cattle, these animals provide a contrasting <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> breed of animal returning to life in the wild. If the visit to this island is taken by a boat in the Hirakud reservoir it's an adventurous trip with breathtaking views.|$|E

500|$|In 1809 {{historian}} John Eliot called Wilson affable in speech, but condescending in his deportment. [...] An early mentor of his, Dr. William Ames, wrote, [...] "that if {{he might}} have his option of the best condition this side of heaven, it would be [...] the teacher of a congregational church of which Mr. Wilson was pastor." [...] Plymouth historian Nathaniel Morton called him [...] "eminent for love and zeal" [...] and M'Clure wrote that his unfeigning modesty was excessive. [...] In this vein, M'Clure wrote that Wilson refused to ever sit for a portrait and his response to those who suggested he do so was [...] "What! Such a poor vile creature as I am! [...] Shall my picture be drawn? [...] I say No; it never shall." [...] M'Clure then suggested that the line drawing of Wilson in the Massachusetts Historical Society was made after his death. [...] Cotton Mather, the noted Puritan who was a grandson of both Richard Mather and John Cotton wrote of Wilson, [...] "If the <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> good, and therein great man, were to be exactly given, great zeal, with great love, would be the two principal strokes that, joined with orthodoxy, should make up his portraiture." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the film}} were mostly positive, but there was some {{confusion}} of critics which {{did not know how}} to respond to the film. Some critics took it for a historical film instead of a historical fiction. The New York Dramatic Mirror was one such outlet, which stated that they could not verify the authenticity of the story, but found the picture was excellent and artistic. Ever the one to highlight technical faults, the Mirror highlighted the original paintings error in the use of the flag as well as the film's omission of snow. The Morning Telegraph understood the historical fiction being presented and praised the production though they also highlighted technical issues in the splitting of the troops on the landing and the poor pulling of a prop cannon. The Billboard praised the film's acting and photography, but did not specifically refer to whether the film was fictional when it stated, [...] "An incident from history at the period of the Revolution is the makeup of this picture." [...] Some of the highest praise was given by the reviewer of The Moving Picture World which stated, [...] "The story is so well told that the audience is held almost spellbound in places as the reel moves through the changing scenes. It is admirably done, staging, acting and photography combining to make an exceptionally attractive <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> patriotic subject." ...|$|E

They found the sequence in the cliff below St. Helens, then just to the east at Siccar Point found what Hutton called [...] "a beautiful <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> junction washed bare by the sea". Playfair later commented about the experience, [...] "the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time".

2500|$|An amateur fossil {{collector}} {{working for}} Cope, David Baldwin, {{had found the}} first remains of the dinosaur in 1881 in the Chinle Formation in northwestern New Mexico.

Two years later, Cope corrected his classification after realizing differences in the vertebrae, and named Coelophysis, with C. bauri as the type species, which was named for Baur, another fossil collector who supplied Cope. However, these first finds were too poorly preserved to give a complete <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new dinosaur.

2500|$|Named in 1887, {{the type}} species of Coelophysis was {{originally}} named {{as a species}} of Coelurus. Edward Drinker Cope first named Coelophysis in 1889 to name a new genus, outside of Coelurus and Tanystrophaeus to which C. bauri was previously classified in for C. bauri, C. willistoni and C. longicollis. An amateur fossil collector working for Cope, David Baldwin, had found the first remains of the dinosaur in 1881 in the Chinle Formation in northwestern New Mexico. Early in 1887 Cope referred the specimens collected to two new species, C. bauri and C. longicollis of the genus Coelurus Marsh 1879. [...] Later in 1887 Cope reassigned the material to a yet another genus, Tanystrophaeus. Two years later, Cope corrected his classification after realizing differences in the vertebrae, and named Coelophysis, with C. bauri as the type species, which was named for Georg Baur, a comparative anatomist whose ideas were similar to Cope's. The name Coelophysis comes from the Greek words κοιλος/koilos (meaning 'hollow') and φυσις/physis (meaning 'form'), thus [...] "hollow form" [...] which is a reference to its hollow vertebrae. However, these first finds were too poorly preserved to give a complete <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new dinosaur.
