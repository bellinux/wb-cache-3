5000|$|In 2009 a new {{lifeboat}} was to {{be placed}} on station which needed major re-development of the offshore boathouse which would involve the building of a completely new boathouse. The Bembridge station launched an appeal to the public with the aim of raising £1 million towards the projected £10 million required for the station and new lifeboat. Demolition of the old station began in May 2009. The old Tyne-class Max Aitken III was retired to the relief fleet and the station was allocated the [...] to cover the station whilst the new station was built. The Peggy & Alex Caird was stationed just outside the harbour at the Point in Bembridge and launched across the beach by a semi-submersible Talus MB-H (T100) fully tracked tractor. The new station was the third purpose-built house and slipway specifically built to facilitate the Tamar-class lifeboat with the first built at Cromer. The architects were Alan Culshaw Architects with Opus and Hoare Lea carrying out the engineering design for the station. The design brief for this station was to achieve a facility which would allow the lifeboat to reach 95% of casualties within 30 minutes of launch, at virtually any point within 50 miles of Bembridge. The 160metre long elevated walkway which would provide access to the offshore station was engineered by Opus. The station facilities on the shore at Lane End were also reconstructed at this time with the work carried out by Stoneham Construction. The work carried out required that parts of the building which dated back to the nineteenth century original boathouse were to be kept. These older sections of the boathouse were carefully protected and preserved whilst the new building was gradually erected all around them. Work carried out included the installing of a modern state-of-the-art deep bored ground source heat pump, and a new <b>piled</b> <b>foundation</b> for the new inshore lifeboat hall. Within the new building, changing rooms for the lifeboat men were installed and a training room was completed on the first floor above, together with an office.

30|$|A {{renewable}} {{energy storage system}} is being proposed through a multi-disciplinary research project. This system utilizes reinforced concrete <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> to store {{renewable energy}} generated from solar panels attached to building structures. The renewable energy {{can be stored in}} the form of compressed air inside the <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> with a hollowed section. The <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> should resist complex combined actions including structural loads, soil effects, and pressures induced from the compressed air, and thus it requires a careful analysis and design considerations to secure a sufficient structural safety. This paper presents analytical investigation results on the structural responses of the energy piles under these combined loadings. The <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> were designed based on the current design practices for various building geometries including the number of stories and column spacing. The magnitude of air pressure was determined from the thermodynamic cycles for the available renewable energy for storage considering building and <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> geometries.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} is {{presented}} for {{the calculation of}} the vibration created in buildings by the operation of underground railways. The method {{is based on the}} sub-modelling approach which is used to couple a model of a building on a <b>piled</b> <b>foundation</b> to another model that calculates the vibration generated in the soil in underground railway tunnels. The method couples a building on a <b>piled</b> <b>foundation</b> to the soil at discrete points by satisfying equilibrium and compatibility requirements at those points. The method results in efficient numerical calculations. A two-dimensional frame made of beam elements is used to model the building and its <b>piled</b> <b>foundation.</b> The elements are formulated using a dynamic stiffness matrix which accounts for Euler–Bernoulli bending and axial behaviour. Vibrations created by a train moving in an underground tunnel are calculated using the well-known pipe-in-pipe (PiP) model. The model calculates the power spectral density (PSD) of the displacement in the soil. The excitation mechanism is the roughness of the rail and the PSD is calculated for a train moving on a floating-slab track in an underground railway tunnel for a stationary process. The current version of PiP accounts for a tunnel embedded in a half-space. The building frame is coupled in this paper at 90 ° to the tunnel’s centreline. The main result of this paper illustrates the significant contribution of the building’s dynamics to the displacement wave field received by the building. The example presented in this paper shows a decrease of more than 20 [*]dB in the displacement PSDs at frequencies larger than 10 Hz when accounting for the change in this wave field...|$|E

40|$|Piled raft {{foundation}} is an economical foundation system where the bearing {{capacity of the}} raft is taken into consideration in supporting the loads from superstructure. The piles in a piled raft system are used to enhance the bearing {{capacity of the raft}} and also to control settlement, especially differential settlement and hence, these piles are commonly known as ‘’settlement reducing piles’'. Therefore, piled raft is a technically competent foundation system and offers significant savings in terms of overall foundation cost as compared to conventional <b>piled</b> <b>foundation.</b> This is because conventional <b>piled</b> <b>foundation</b> usually ignores the contribution of the raft and assumes the loads are supported entirely by the piles.
