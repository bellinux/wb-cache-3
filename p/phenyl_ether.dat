40|$|ABSTRACT: Despite {{the large}} amount of work carried out for the identifica-tion of pyrolytic {{products}} of fire retardant polymers, there is still lack of reliable MS data on halogenated substances. The development of toxic halogenated products mostly occurs during the process of pyrolysis, burning or recycling and they originate from the use of halogenated fire retardants. 1, 2 -Bis(2, 4, 6 -tribromophenoxy) ethane is a common fire retardant used in acrylonitrile– butadiene–styrene terpolymers for computer housing.

The objective {{of this paper is}} to compare the influence of two electron-withdrawing groups (-CN and-NO 2) in the fragmentation of 2 -methoxy- 4 -nitrophenyl benzyl ether and 4 -cyanophenyl benzyl ether once these species are reduced. The stability of the corresponding radical anions depends essentially on those substituents. In our design we have chosen two species that are able to attach the electron but which have each a different capacity to retain it. An experimental study is carried out by EPR spectroscopy to analyze the different electronic nature of the generated radical anions. In addition, electronic structure calculations at the DFT level of theory have been performed to study those radical anions and their fragmentation pathways. The thermodynamics and kinetics of the two fragmentations are discussed and compared in detail. ASENSIO, Xavier, et al.

40|$|Overview. With {{the advent}} of two new techniques, collisionally induced dissociative {{ionization}} and neutralization reionization mass spectrometry, {{it is possible to}} investigate the structure and stability of neutrals as well as ions. Fragmentation mechanisms of alkyl <b>phenyl</b> <b>ethers.</b> The metastable fragmentation mechanisms of alkyl <b>phenyl</b> <b>ethers</b> and methyl pentyl ethers have been thoroughly investigated. It has been shown that the formation of an ion/radical complex is the key step in the metastable loss of olefin from alkyl <b>phenyl</b> <b>ethers</b> and loss of methanol from methyl pentyl ethers. The alkyl moiety in an ion/radical complex between a primary alkyl cation and a phenoxy radical undergoes a rate determining isomerization to a secondary or tertiary alkyl cation at an energy above the dissociation threshold for the resulting complex. A β(H+) is then immediately transferred from the alkyl cation to the phenoxy radical followed by dissociation to products. Assigning structures to isomeric (C 5,H+. ions. The ten (C 5,H+. isomers may be distinguished based on their heats of formation, low ionizing electron energy mass spectra and charge stripping mass spectra. The fragmentation mechanisms for H 2 O loss from 1 -pentanol and HCl loss from 1 -chloropentane were determined the aid of deuterium labelling and identification of the product (C 5,H+. ions. Collision induced ionization efficiencies of fast neutrals. The O 2 collisional ionization efficiencies of CO and CH 2 =CH 2 depend on both the translational and internal energies of the neutral. The ionization efficiencies increased with increasing translational energy from 2000 - 5200 V as expected for ionization by the electron detachment mechanism. The ionization efficiencies decreased with increasing internal energy. The generation of stable BH 3 and BH 4 - in the gas phase. The stability of BH 3, BH 4 and their deuterated counterparts BD 3 and BD 4 - were studied by neutralization reionization mass spectrometry. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Bacteria {{that belong}} to the genus Desulfitobacterium are able to cleave the ether bond of lignin-borne <b>phenyl</b> methyl <b>ethers</b> via O-demethylation of the methoxy moiety. <b>Phenyl</b> methyl <b>ethers</b> occur {{naturally}} in soils and originate from lignin degradation by white rot fungi under aerobic conditions. In order to assess the possible involvement of the anaerobic desulfitobacteria in the network of lignin degradation in soils, {{their participation in the}} O-demethylation of <b>phenyl</b> methyl <b>ethers</b> in the environment was studied. In growth experiments, several Desulfitobacterium spp. were able to O-demethylate the <b>phenyl</b> methyl <b>ethers</b> 4 -hydroxyanisole, syringate, vanillate and isovanillate in the presence of fumarate, nitrate, thiosulfate or Fe(III) as electron acceptor. Only D. metallireducens completely lacked this ability. Up to 18 putative demethylase operons were identified in the genomes of desulfitobacteria. Bacterial enrichment cultures that originated from five different topsoils sampled in the vicinity of Jena (Germany) were used to assess desulfitobacterial O-demethylation in anoxic consortia. Enrichment with syringate and thiosulfate triggered an increase in Desulfitobacterium-specific 16 S rRNA genes in all cultures as confirmed via quantitative PCR. The enrichment was followed by a loss of desulfitobacterial gene copies over time. Community-scale sequencing suggested an outcompetion of desulfitobacteria by acetogens. To allow a better quantification of desulfitobacteria in environmental samples, a new qPCR assay was established that uses the Desulfitobacterium-specific formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) gene as marker. In contrast to the 16 S rRNA gene assay, which detects several gene copies per genome, the new FTHFS assay detects only one gene copy. It is concluded that Desulfitobacterium spp. are involved in the O-demethylation of <b>phenyl</b> methyl <b>ethers</b> in the environment and play an important role within the network of lignin degradation in soils...|$|R

MS/MS experiments, in which parent ions of a single mass are selected and their fragmentation patterns subsequently measured, show that alkene expulsion represents virtually the only decomposition pathway. Two types of MS/MS experiment are reported: mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy (MIKE) spectroscopy of metastable ions and collisionally activated decomposition (CAD) of stable ions. The expulsion of a deuterated alkene from a monodeuterated precursor yields ionized phenol, PhOH(*) () (+) (m/z 94). The expulsion of an undeuterated alkene yields PhOD(*) () (+) (m/z 95). Without exception, the ratios (PhOD(*) () (+) /PhOH(*) () (+)) from precursors in the threo series have values greater than their diastereomers in the erythro series. The ratio of ratios, r = PhOD(*) () (+) /PhOH(*) () (+) for the threo divided by PhOD(*) () (+) /PhOH(*) () (+) for the erythro, has a value of 1. 2 for the 2 -phenoxy- 3 -deuteriobutanes and larger values {{for all of the}} higher homologues up through the monodeuterated phenoxyoctanes (m + n = 4). The highest degree of stereoselectivity, r = 5. 8, is measured for 3 -phenoxy- 4 -deuteriohexane.
