5|$|The 'Land Question', as it {{pertains}} to the history of <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island,</b> Canada, related {{to the question of the}} system of ownership of land on the island. Proprietors, the owners of the land parcels on <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island,</b> favoured a system of renting to tenants, whilst the tenants preferred a system of freehold. In 1767 the British government divided all land in <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island</b> into lots to be owned by 'proprietors' who would collect rent from the settlers, or 'tenants'. Problems soon arose with this scheme, and low numbers of tenants resulted in proprietors collecting little rent, which in turn led to many proprietors defaulting on their quitrents. An attempt at compulsorily acquiring the land by the <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island</b> government from rent defaulters in 1781 resulted in Colonial Office intervention in 1783. In 1786, Governor Walter Patterson, who set in motion the compulsory acquisition, was removed from office.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} years the 52nd received a number of overseas postings. Between 1823 and 1831, the regiment was stationed at, in turn, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island.</b> In early 1842, the 52nd performed garrison duty in Barbados, where British units frequently supplemented the local forces. In 1842, the regiment returned to Canada, and were posted to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island,</b> and Quebec; they left Canada in 1845.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Nova Scotia pledged $10million (2003 CAD) {{in relief}} money after the {{hurricane}} hit, and private contributions were also made quickly after the storm hit. <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island</b> also pledged $200,000 (2003 CAD) immediately {{after the hurricane}} hit, {{and the federal government}} also announced their own package. The Mayor of Toronto at the time, Mel Lastman, also contributed $50,000 (2003 CAD) to replace damaged trees in <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island.</b>|$|E

5|$|Damage {{was also}} {{reported}} in <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island</b> {{as a result}} of the storm, particularly around Charlottetown, where its waterfront sustained heavy wave damage to pleasure craft and sea walls, as well as significant damage to the older urban forest in that city's downtown core. Extensive tree damage was also reported across the island, as well as structural damage to weaker buildings, such as barns and silos. The hurricane left portions of the island without power. The narrow path meant that damage was quite localized; little damage was reported in New Brunswick or western <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island.</b> Voting in the PEI general election on September29 was also disrupted, though more than 80% of voters made it to polling stations.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{gradually}} {{losing its}} tropical characteristics, Gustav brought heavy rain, storm and hurricane-force winds, and storm surges to areas of Atlantic Canada for several days. Strong winds knocked down trees and damaged docks in Nova Scotia, and a wind gust of 75mph (122km/h) was reported on Sable Island. Gusts to over 60mph (100km/h) {{were reported in}} Newfoundland for several days after the center of Gustav {{moved out of the}} area. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 0.3–2.7inches (10–70mm), with a maximum of 4inches (102mm) in Ashdale, Nova Scotia. Several locations set new daily rainfall records. Localized flooding was reported in areas of <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island,</b> and 4,000people in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Charlottetown, <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island</b> were left without power.

5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island,</b> but their {{attempts}} to set in motion the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island</b> joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E
5|$|In Atlantic Canada, Bertha brought strong {{tropical}} storm force winds and heavy rainfall. Two weather stations in Braddeck, Nova Scotia and Hunter's Mountain recorded 7inches (177.8mm) of rainfall. In <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island,</b> the storm produced a wind gust of 71mph (115km/h) and 4.72inches (101.6mm) of rain. A weather station in Port-aux-Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador reported a wind gust of 63mph (102km/h) and 2.51inches (50mm) of rain. The high winds brought by Bertha caused moderate damage to tobacco and corn crops in <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island</b> and damaged a suspension bridge in Nova Scotia. Heavy rainfall from Bertha caused minimal flooding at a golf course. In Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia, six {{people were injured}} when waves from Bertha washed them into the sea. Damage was estimated at $4.427million (1990CAD, $3.912million 1990USD).|$|E
5|$|In the Grand Banks of Canada, {{the threat}} of the {{hurricane}} prompted fishing boats to venture back to port. In the Bay of Fundy, foggy conditions drove an ocean liner aground. Across Nova Scotia, rough seas washed a boat near Dartmouth, a schooner near Halifax, four yachts in Chester, and another three boats in Shelburne ashore. In addition, eleven yachts in Chester sank during the storm. The seas flooded a coastal road and nearby field in Prospect, destroying a garage. In Cow Bay, a man drowned after falling off of a yacht. Rough seas halted ferry service between <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island</b> and Nova Scotia, as well as between <b>Prince</b> <b>Edward</b> <b>Island</b> and New Brunswick; other ferry service across the region were delayed.|$|E
