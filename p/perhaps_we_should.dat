Davidson concludes that, in these examples, [...] "here we have the fierce destructive side of death, with a strong emphasis on its physical horrors, so <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not assume that the gruesome figure of Hel is wholly Snorri's literary invention." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{several months}} the Allies had been {{planning}} an attack upon Brest, the French port in the Bay of Biscay. The French had received intelligence alerting them to the imminent assault, enabling Marshal Vauban to strengthen its defences and reinforce the garrison. Inevitably the attack on 18 June led by Thomas Tollemache ended in disaster; most of his men were killed or captured, and Tollemache himself died of his wounds shortly afterwards. Despite lacking evidence, Marlborough's detractors claimed that {{it was he who}} had alerted the enemy. Macaulay states that in a letter on 3 May 1694 Marlborough betrayed the Allied plans to James, thus ensuring that the landing failed and that Tollemache, a talented rival, was killed or discredited as a direct result. Historians such as John Paget and C. T. Atkinson conclude that he probably did write the letter, but did so only when he knew that it would be received too late for its information to be of any practical use (the plan of the attack on Brest was widely known, and the French had already begun to strengthen their defences in April). To Richard Holmes the evidence linking Marlborough with the Camaret Bay letter (which no longer exists), is slender, concluding, [...] "It is very hard to imagine a man as careful as Marlborough, only recently freed from suspicion of treason, writing a letter which would kill him if it fell into the wrong hands". However, David Chandler surmises that, [...] "the whole episode is so obscure and inconclusive that it is still not possible to make a definite ruling. In sum, <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> award Marlborough the benefit of the doubt".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the musicians}} all {{performing}} free, the promotion has drawn some {{criticism in the}} press. Adam Sherwin wrote in The Independent: [...] "With its message, that the BBC 'owns' the entire musical waterfront and licence-fee payers {{would do well to}} remember that, {{it is the kind of}} propaganda film an autocratic regime sensing that its legitimacy is crumbling might produce." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Alex Petridis observed [...] "There's clearly something a little self-aggrandising about the BBC getting a raft of stars to sing an unambiguous song of undying devotion apparently to the corporation itself. ... <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> forgive them three minutes of self-congratulation, particularly when it’s raising money for charity." [...] The Daily Telegraph, however, reported that the project cost less than the 1997 version of [...] "Perfect Day" [...] which drew much of the same criticism but went on to raise over £2 million for charity.|$|E
2500|$|Renato Castellani won the Grand Prix at the Venice Film Festival for his 1954 film of Romeo and Juliet. His film {{contains}} interpolated scenes {{intended to}} establish the class system and Catholicism of Renaissance Verona, {{and the nature of}} the feud. Some of Castellani's changes have been criticised as ineffective: interpolated dialogue is often banal, and the Prince's appearances are reimagined as formal hearings: undermining the spontaneity of Benvolio's defence of Romeo's behaviour in the duel scene. The major supporting roles are vastly reduced, including that of the nurse; Mercutio becomes (in the words of Daniel Rosenthal) [...] "the tiniest of cameos" [...] and Friar Laurence [...] "an irritating ditherer", although Pauline Kael, who loved the film, called this Friar Laurence [...] "a radiantly silly little man". Castellani's most prominent changes related to Romeo's character, cutting back or removing scenes involving his parents, Benvolio and Mercutio in order to highlight Romeo's isolation, and inserting a parting scene in which Montague coldly pulls his banished son out of Lady Montague's farewell embrace. Another criticism made by film scholar Patricia Tatspaugh is that the realism of the settings, so carefully established throughout the film, [...] "goes seriously off the rails when it come to the Capulets' vault". Castellani uses competing visual images in relation to the central characters: ominous grilles (and their shadows) contrasted with frequent optimistic shots of blue sky. A well-known stage Romeo, John Gielgud, played Castellani's chorus (and would reprise the role in the 1978 BBC Shakespeare version). Laurence Harvey, as Romeo, was already an experienced screen actor, who would shortly take over roles intended for the late James Dean in Walk on the Wild Side and Summer and Smoke. By contrast, Susan Shentall, as Juliet, was a secretarial student who was discovered by the director in a London pub, and was cast for her [...] "pale sweet skin and honey-blonde hair". She failed to rise to the demands of the role, and would marry shortly after the shoot, never returning to screen acting. Other parts were played by inexperienced actors, also: Mercutio was played by an architect, Montague by a gondolier from Venice, and the Prince by a novelist. Critics responded to the film as a piece of cinema (its visuals were especially admired in Italy, where it was filmed) but not as a performance of Shakespeare's play: Robert Hatch in The Nation said [...] "We had come to see a play... <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not complain that we were shown a sumptuous travelogue", and Time's reviewer added that [...] "Castellani's Romeo and Juliet is a fine film poem... Unfortunately it is not Shakespeare's poem!" ...|$|E

40|$|The value {{problem in}} {{epistemology}} is {{to explain why}} knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. Or so it is commonly construed. Various solutions to the quandary have been proposed, but so far none has gained wide acceptance. <b>Perhaps,</b> then, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> abandon the idea that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. This is what we shall argue, but with one important qualification: Knowledge is not generally more valuable than mere true belief. Certain epistemic contexts, however, are ruled by diachronic aspects of the truth goal of believing. In these contexts the properties that turn a true belief into knowledge add extra value to the belief. For example, {{in addition to the}} truth of a belief currently under consideration we are often interested in the subject 2 ̆ 7 s future performances as a reliable epistemic agent. According to the contextualist account of epistemic values we propose, epistemological value monism can be preserved. But the value problem should be reformulated.

40|$|There is a saying, "Clothes maketh the man". Mark Twain's version continues, "Naked {{people have}} little or no {{influence}} on society. " (Twain, online).

Here, I am focussing on the wedding gown and poetry, in particular. <b>Perhaps</b> then <b>we</b> <b>should</b> consider recasting the earlier quote as "Clothes maketh the woman". Andrew Motion wrote a striking poem, ‘In the attic’, about recollecting a person through their stored clothing (1997, p. 43). It emphasises the significance of clothing, particularly that which has been worn on special occasions, as a device to imagine (recreate) the wearer. It, therefore, emphasises the power of association between garment and individual. The clothing has a life beyond the wearer. In the attic Even though we know now your clothes will neve...|$|R

In the war game you cannot play without a stake. You lose and you pay forfeit, and where the game is fair the best player is he who pays with the best grace. The attack was well prepared, well delivered, and only miscarried on account of the excellence of the defence.

40|$|The {{assumption}} {{of a direct}} and positive relationship between engagement of stakeholders and responsibility towards stakeholders within both practitioner and academic literature is a dilemma.

This concurrence could exist, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> believe <b>should</b> exist, but to assume it necessarily does exist is highly problematic. It is problematic not just because it is may be inaccurate but, more importantly, because it may be misleading. I intend to make this case by firstly illustrating that this assumption exists in the literature though it is rarely made explicit. Next I will make a case for why it may not necessarily hold. I will show why it is essential to consider that the relationship between stakeholder engagement and responsibility may be a neutral relationship or, even more importantly, a negative relationship. Finally I will argue that, by erroneously assuming convergence, thus disallowing separation, the writer or practitioner is at risk of, intentionally or unintentionally, deceiving their audience...|$|R
