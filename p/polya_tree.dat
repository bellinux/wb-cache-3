We also show that random graphs from subcritical graph classes admit the CRT as scaling limit, proving (in a strong from) a conjecture by Marc Noy and Michael Drmota, who conjectured a limit for the diameter of these graphs.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} {{of the performance of}} a continuous diagnostic measure is a commonly encountered task in medical research. We develop Bayesian non-parametric models that use Dirichlet process mixtures and mixtures of <b>Polya</b> <b>trees</b> for the analysis of continuous serologic data. The modelling approach differs from traditional approaches to the analysis of receiver operating characteristic curve data in that it incorporates a stochastic ordering constraint for the distributions of serologic values for the infected and non-infected populations. Biologically such a constraint is virtually always feasible because serologic values from infected individuals tend to be higher than those for non-infected individuals. The models proposed provide data-driven inferences for the infected and non-infected population distributions, and for the receiver operating characteristic curve and corresponding area under the curve. We illustrate and compare the predictive performance of the Dirichlet process mixture and mixture of <b>Polya</b> <b>trees</b> approaches by using serologic data for Johne's disease in dairy cattle.

40|$|We {{developed}} a flexible non-parametric Bayesian model for regional disease-prevalence estimation based on cross-sectional {{data that are}} obtained from several subpopulations or clusters such as villages, cities, or herds. The subpopulation prevalences are modeled with a mixture distribution that allows for zero prevalence. The distribution of prevalences among diseased subpopulations is modeled as a mixture of finite <b>Polya</b> <b>trees.</b> Inferences can be obtained for (1) the proportion of diseased subpopulations in a region, (2) the distribution of regional prevalences, (3) the mean and median prevalence in the region, (4) the prevalence of any sampled subpopulation, and (5) predictive distributions of prevalences for regional subpopulations {{not included in the}} study, including the predictive probability of zero prevalence. We focus on prevalence estimation using data from a single diagnostic test, but we also briefly discuss the scenario where two conditionally dependent (or independent) diagnostic tests are used. Simulated data demonstrate the utility of our non-parametric model over parametric analysis.

Such theorems are false for Dirichlet processes. Models are constructed combining partially specified Polya trees with other information like monotonicity or unimodality.

A theorem of Diaconis and Freedman about Dirichlet processes is generalized to Polya trees, allowing Polya trees to be the models for errors in regression problems.

Inference under the model proceeds efficiently using general recipes for conjugate hierarchical models.

40|$|Panagiotou and Stufler (arXiv: 1502. 07180 v 2) {{recently}} proved {{one important}} fact {{on their way}} to establish the scaling limits of random Pólya trees: a uniform random <b>Pólya</b> <b>tree</b> of size n consists of a conditioned critical Galton-Watson tree C_n and many small forests, where with probability tending to one as n tends to infinity, any forest F_n(v), that is attached to a node v in C_n, is maximally of size F_n(v) =O(n). Their proof used the framework of a Boltzmann sampler and deviation inequalities. In this paper, first, we employ a unified framework in analytic combinatorics to prove this fact with additional improvements on the bound of F_n(v), namely F_n(v) =Θ(n). Second, we give a combinatorial interpretation of the rational weights of these forests and the defining substitution process in terms of automorphisms associated to a given <b>Pólya</b> <b>tree.</b> Finally, we derive the limit probability that for a random node v the attached forest F_n(v) is of a given size.

40|$|Bayesian {{hierarchical}} {{models are}} used to share information between related samples and obtain more accurate estimates of sample-level parameters, common structure, and variation between samples. When the parameter of interest is the distribution or density of a continuous variable, a hierarchical model for distributions is required. A number of such models have been described in the literature using extensions of the Dirichlet process and related processes, typically as a distribution on the parameters of a mixing kernel. We propose a new hierarchical model based on the <b>Polya</b> <b>tree,</b> which allows direct modeling of densities and enjoys some computational advantages over the Dirichlet process. The <b>Polya</b> <b>tree</b> also allows more flexible modeling of the variation between samples, providing more informed shrinkage and permitting posterior inference on the dispersion function, which quantifies the variation among sample densities.

Both likelihood functions factorise in precisely the same way as for the quantile pyramid priors. While analytic summaries of posterior distributions are too complicated, updating with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is quite straightforward.
