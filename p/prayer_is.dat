5|$|Practicing Hindus, {{especially}} Hindu wives, {{remember the}} Panchakanya in this daily morning prayer. Their names are extolled and the <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> pratah smaraniya, prescribed to be recited {{in the early}} hours of the morning.|$|E
5|$|After being anointed, {{the monarch}} {{rises from the}} Coronation Chair and kneels down at a faldstool {{placed in front of}} it. The {{archbishop}} then concludes the ceremonies of the anointing by reciting a prayer that is the English translation of the ancient Latin prayer Deus, Dei Filius, recited in the consecration of other Christian sovereigns. Once this <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> finished, the monarch rises and sits again in the Coronation Chair. The Knights of the Garter then bear away the canopy.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's {{greatest}} {{concerns were}} {{the maintenance of}} the royal supremacy and the diffusion of reformed theology and practice. Scholars note that he is best remembered for his contribution to the realms of language and of cultural identity. His prose helped to guide the development of the English language, and the Book of Common <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> a major contribution to English literature that influenced many lives in the Anglophone world. It guided Anglican worship for four hundred years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prayer</b> may <b>be</b> {{expressed}} vocally or mentally. Vocal <b>prayer</b> may <b>be</b> spoken or sung. Mental <b>prayer</b> can <b>be</b> either meditation or contemplation. The basic {{forms of}} <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> praise, petition (supplication), intercession, and thanksgiving.|$|R
5|$|<b>Prayers</b> <b>were</b> offered. Until the English Reformation, the <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> {{addressed}} {{not only}} to God but also to Virgin Mary and the saints.|$|R
50|$|The Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} {{individual}} <b>prayer</b> should <b>be</b> performed {{when one is}} alone, and when free of distractions such as {{early in the morning}} or late at night. Collective <b>prayers,</b> which usually <b>are</b> performed by individuals taking turns in reading <b>prayers,</b> <b>are</b> also encouraged; collective <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> usually performed at the beginning of meetings such as Nineteen Day Feasts, and Bahá'í administrative meetings. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, wrote that <b>prayers</b> may <b>be</b> addressed to God, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, or other messengers from God; he recommended, however, that the <b>prayers</b> <b>be</b> addressed to Bahá'u'lláh.|$|R
5|$|One catechesis of Symeon's, On Faith, {{along with}} a {{composite}} work titled One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts, {{are included in the}} Philokalia, a collection of texts by early Christian mystics. Another text in the Philokalia, titled The Three Methods of <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> also attributed to Symeon—it describes a method of practicing the Jesus Prayer that includes direction on correct posture and breathing while reciting the prayer. It is extremely unlikely that he wrote that text—some scholars attribute it to Nikiphoros the Monk, while others believe it was written by disciples of Symeon.|$|E
5|$|Prayer {{features}} {{prominently in}} services. Services may feature moments where special <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> offered, often with laypersons leading the prayer {{and the rest}} of the congregation audibly participating. During these corporate prayers, some may pray in tongues. While not in every service, the pastor will pray for the sick. This prayer may include the pastor anointing the sick with olive oil and with the assistance of church elders along with pastoral associates laying hands on the one seeking healing.|$|E
5|$|The {{church does}} not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.|$|E
6000|$|... "To prayer--to <b>prayer!</b> God <b>is</b> the one God.--To prayer--to <b>prayer!</b> Mohammed <b>is</b> the Prophet of God.--To prayer--to <b>prayer!</b> Time <b>is</b> {{flying from}} you.--To prayer--to <b>prayer!</b> Judgment <b>is</b> drawing nigh to you." ...|$|R
50|$|Sunnah <b>prayer</b> (صلاة السنة) <b>is</b> an {{optional}} salah {{that can be}} performed by Muslims at almost {{any time of the}} day. These <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> performed in addition to the five daily <b>prayers,</b> which <b>are</b> compulsory for all Muslims. There are a range of <b>prayers</b> available: some <b>are</b> done {{at the same time as}} the compulsory <b>prayers,</b> some <b>are</b> done only at certain times, e.g. late at night, and some are only done for specific occasions such as during a drought. All of these optional <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> originally performed by Muhammad.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} to other fields {{that have been}} scientifically studied, carefully monitored studies of <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> relatively few. The field remains tiny, with about $5 million spent worldwide on such research. If and when more studies of <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> done, the issue of <b>prayer's</b> efficacy may <b>be</b> further clarified.|$|R
5|$|When this <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> finished, {{the choir}} sings an English {{translation}} of the traditional Latin antiphon Confortare: Be strong and of a good courage; keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways. During the singing of this antiphon, all stand in their places, and the monarch remains seated in the Coronation Chair still wearing the crown and holding the sceptres. The recitation of this antiphon {{is followed by a}} rite of benediction consisting of several prayers.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} movement {{believes in}} a moral progression through reincarnation after death: the transmigration {{of the spirit}} in a human body only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation. The reincarnated person has no recollection of the past lives, and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him, at the end, to reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation. The harm caused by disease and by people is seen as a beneficial cure, as the pain can increase one's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one's salvation. The silent <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness. Antoine, who suffered from disease and demonstrated asceticism and dedication throughout his life, is regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation.|$|E
25|$|The Second Eucharistic <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> an {{abridgement}} of the Roman Canon {{with elements}} included from the Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition, {{most notably in}} its proper preface and in the Epiclesis. The Third Eucharistic <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> a new composition, longer than the Second Eucharistic Prayer, and contains Alexandrian, Byzantine, and Maronite elements. Its structure follows the Roman Canon. It {{is based on the}} 4th-century Anaphora of St Basil. The fourth Eucharistic <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> roughly based upon the Anaphora of St Basil, with, among other things, the epiclesis moved before the Institution Narrative.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{a series}} of {{introductory}} <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> said as the start of Shacharit. The main pieces of these <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> Pesukei dezimra, consisting of numerous psalms, hymns, and <b>prayers.</b> Pesukei dezimra <b>is</b> said so that an individual will have praised God before making requests, which might be considered rude.|$|R
5000|$|Bahá'u'lláh, the Báb — {{who told}} of Bahá'u'lláh's coming — and `Abdu'l-Baha wrote {{hundreds}} of prayers; {{many of these}} <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> originally included in letters to individuals. Most of these <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> written in Arabic and Persian, and `Abdu'l-Baha wrote a few in Turkish. [...] In 1900 the first English language <b>prayer</b> book <b>was</b> published under the title Tablets, Communes and Holy Utterances. Since then, {{a large number of}} <b>prayers</b> have <b>been</b> translated into English and many hundreds of languages; by 1983 the short obligatory <b>prayer</b> has <b>been</b> translated into 501 languages.|$|R
40|$|Worship is {{intrinsic}} {{and natural}} for human. One form of worship <b>is</b> <b>prayer</b> {{that each person}} may have a different idea about it. Thus, <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> of three kinds: devoutly, austerely and mystically. Devoutly <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> accompanied with material concerns and austerely <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> accompanied with fear and worry. But, mystically <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> love-oriented and, because of this, they are intrinsically acceptable. In such prayer, the person who prays does not expect his needs are satisfied but, instead, he enjoys the permission of dialogue which {{has been given to}} him by the Beloved. In this article, first of all, the necessity of prayers, invocation of God and degree of <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Then, Gnostic thoughts of SanÃ¢ie like the relationship between prayer and satisfaction, rejection of material requests and the conditions for granting of prayer and the secrets of its not granting are discussed. Finally, it can be concluded that the climax of SanÃ¢ie pleasure and ecstasy can be observed in various stages of his Gnostic prayers...|$|R

25|$|Critics also {{dispute the}} claim that Centering <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> in the {{tradition}} of the Desert Fathers and Carmelite saints, saying that traditional Catholic contemplative <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> not so much a method of prayer as a stage of prayer in which God's action predominates. They cite the Catechism of the Catholic Church as evidence that meditation and contemplation are two different expressions of prayer.|$|E
5000|$|On Good Friday of 1963, {{by mistake}} the old {{text of the}} <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> given to the deacon, who read [...] "perfidis". Pope John XXIII {{interrupted}} the liturgy again, and ordered that the <b>prayer</b> <b>be</b> repeated with the word omitted.|$|R
5000|$|Latter-day Saint <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> {{addressed}} to God the Father and are concluded with [...] "in {{the name of}} Jesus Christ, amen". All prayers of Latter-day Saints, except some of those given {{as part of an}} ordinance ritual, are not repeated from memorized expressions. <b>Prayers</b> may <b>be</b> of any length in duration. Latter-day Saint <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> not given facing in a particular direction and may be offered kneeling, sitting, or standing. Personal <b>prayers</b> may <b>be</b> audible or silent.|$|R

25|$|Obligatory Bahá'í {{prayers are}} prayers which {{are to be}} said daily by Bahá'ís {{according}} to a fixed form decreed by Bahá'u'lláh. Prayers in the Bahá'í Faith are reverent words which are addressed to God, and refers to two distinct concepts: obligatory prayer and devotional prayer (general prayer). The act of <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most}} important Bahá'í laws for individual discipline. Along with fasting, obligatory <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> one of the greatest obligations of a Bahá'í, and the purpose of the obligatory <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> to foster the development of humility and devotion. The obligation of daily obligatory prayer was prescribed by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, in his book of laws, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.|$|E

5000|$|The Fátima <b>Prayers</b> (...) <b>are</b> five Catholic <b>prayers</b> that {{originate}} from the Marian apparitions at Fátima, Portugal, in 1917. The Decade Prayer, {{as the best}} known of these five <b>prayers,</b> <b>is</b> commonly added {{at the end of each}} decade of the Dominican Rosary, one of the most popular devotional practices in Roman Catholicism. Another two other <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> also associated with the visions and may be classed as Fátima Prayers. However, they did not come to existence in Fátima but in Spain many years later. This brings the number of prayers to seven.|$|R
