40|$|Web {{presence}} {{is an important}} intangible asset, especially for the innovative or creative industry. In order to investigate the web presence of Australian game development companies, a list of 80 Australian game development companies' websites was compiled. We developed an automated tool to <b>execute</b> the advanced <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> of the commercial search engine to obtain webometrics indicators for each website in the list. We collected webometrics indicators such as age, size (number of pages), visibility (number of external in-links) and hubness (number of external out-links). Evolution {{of the size of}} the companies' websites over the past 10 years was examined for studying the trend of web presence of the game development companies. The countries and languages of the web pages in-linked to and out-linked from the companies' websites were used to discover the international linkages and exposures of the companies. This study demonstrated a cost-effective method for discovering and monitoring business intelligence and trends of an industry using the Internet...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper has been to {{identify}} which modern <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> user of Smartphones are using, why just these functions are being used, and how they have affected the way users acquire information. Modern <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> in this paper means searches that are not based on text, i. e. ways to search for information by other means than writing something into a search field. To identify this, two studies were conducted, one with a questionnaire being distributed with the help of Google Docs through social networks, and one with four interviews with users of modern <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> for Smartphones. The study showed that even though 76 % of Smartphone users are aware of at least one modern <b>search</b> <b>function,</b> only 29 % uses one on a regular basis. The reason that modern <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> are not more widespread is that they are not sufficiently developed yet, and serious usage is still in the future. Because of this no major impact on search behavior can yet be found...|$|R

First, we examined the list of authors on papers found using the AND <b>search</b> <b>function</b> for the country, excluding the USA, that had {{the greatest number of}} different authors. We did this to compare the proportions of authors that listed their national address as that country on papers found using the AND and NOT <b>search</b> <b>function</b> {{for each of the four}} innate factors individually and for the factors pooled together. Second, we examined the list of authors on papers found using the NOT <b>search</b> <b>function</b> category for the country, excluding the USA, that had the most different authors. We did this to compare the proportions of authors that listed their national address as that country on papers found using the AND and NOT <b>search</b> <b>function</b> for each of the four innate factors individually and for the factors pooled together. Last, we compared the proportions of authors that listed the USA as their national address with those of authors that listed elsewhere as their national addresses found on papers using the AND and NOT <b>search</b> <b>function</b> with those of authors from the countries represented by the most authors found on papers using the AND and NOT <b>search</b> <b>function</b> for each of the four innate factors individually and for the factors pooled together. We performed these comparisons to detect whether {{the patterns of}} publication by authors with USA addresses were similar those of authors that listed their national addresses as elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|Objective – This study {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of the related <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> in Web of Science and Scopus. Web of Science has one related <b>search</b> <b>function</b> (<b>searching</b> by references) whereas Scopus has three related <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> (<b>searching</b> by references, authors, or keywords). Methods – Thirty queries were searched in both Web of Science and Scopus. For each query, the most relevant document was retrieved and its first thirty related documents were assessed for relevancy to the original query. Results for both databases were compared using the median values of precision. For Scopus the three different methods of relevance were compared using median precision values. Results – The median precision value for the related documents retrieved from Web of Science was 0. 63, while the median for those retrieved from Scopus using the related by references function was 0. 62. A Wilcoxon test showed {{no significant difference in the}} two medians. In the comparison of the three related functions in Scopus, the median precision values were 0. 62, 0. 42, and 0. 43 for the related <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> by references, authors, and keywords respectively. A Friedman’s test showed that the median precision value for relatedness by references was significantly higher than the median vales for the other two related functions. In Scopus, {{the effectiveness of}} the related <b>search</b> <b>function</b> using all keywords was not as effective when compared to the effectiveness using select keywords. The median precision value with select keywords was 0. 17. Conclusions – The related <b>search</b> <b>functions</b> by references for both Web of Science and Scopus were moderately effective in retrieving additional relevant documents on a given topic, and there was no significant difference in their performance. When comparing the three methods available in Scopus, the related <b>search</b> <b>function</b> by references was found to be more effective than the system’s related functions by authors and keywords...|$|R
