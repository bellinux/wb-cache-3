40|$|This is a {{practical}} guide to sowing, transplanting and caring for <b>petunias.</b> <b>Petunias</b> are a popular, reliable flowering ornamental plant for use in Nebraska landscapes. This versatile annual {{can be used in}} flower beds, hanging baskets, window boxes and other types of containers. They also can be used as cut flowers. The blossoms of <b>petunias</b> come in many colors with petal edges that are straight or ruffled. Two general classes of <b>petunias</b> are Grandiflora and Multiflora. Grandiflora <b>petunias</b> are characterized by having fewer, but larger, showy flowers. A number of Grandifloras are cascade selections, well suited to growing in hanging baskets, window boxes and other types of planters. Multiflora <b>petunias</b> have a more compact growth habit and have smaller but more numerous blossoms. Multifloras generally withstand wind and hard rains better than the Grandiflora types. Both Grandiflora and Multiflora types may have single flowers, having one set of petals on each flower, or double with multiple sets of petals on each flower...|$|R
50|$|The Mayan and Incas {{believed}} that <b>petunias</b> {{have the power}} to chase away with their odor the underworld monsters and spirits. Their flower-beds were bunched together for magical drinks. According to the narrative, <b>petunias</b> can not thrive in place of strong negative energy.|$|R

5|$|It was {{announced}} on 11 October 2014 that {{in partnership with}} Saban Brands, Cirque du Soleil Media would produce an animated children's (pre-school aged) series called Luna <b>Petunia</b> and the showrunner {{was announced}} as children's TV writer Bradley Zweig. The plot revolves around {{a little girl who}} plays in a dreamland where she learns how to make the impossible possible. It began airing on Netflix in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|The most {{evil and}} {{powerful}} dark wizard in history, Lord Voldemort, murders James and Lily Potter but mysteriously disappears {{after failing to}} kill their infant son, Harry. While the wizarding world celebrates Voldemort's apparent downfall, Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and half-giant Rubeus Hagrid place the one-year-old orphan {{in the care of}} his surly and cold Muggle uncle and aunt, Vernon and <b>Petunia</b> Dursley and their spoiled and bullying son, Dudley.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, biologically active hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were {{isolated}} from tobacco which activated {{the production of}} protease inhibitors {{in a similar way}} to systemin in tomatoes. Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, <b>Petunia</b> and black nightshade. In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and coffee (Coffea canephora). Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved proline or hydroxyproline-rich central domain.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursors}} for systemin and AtPEP1 are both processed to yield one active peptide from the C-terminus of the precursor. It {{has been speculated}} that ProAtPEP1 is processed by CONSTITUTIVE DISEASE RESISTANCE 1, an apoplastic aspartic protease. The precursors to HypSys are processed into more than one active peptide. In tobacco, it is processed into two peptides, in <b>petunia</b> into three, and in sweet potato, possibly into six. At 291 amino acids long, the precursor to HypSys in sweet potato is the longest precursor described. The production of multiple signalling peptides from one precursor is a common feature found in animals.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the six {{previous}} {{novels in}} the series, the titular character Harry Potter {{has struggled with}} the difficulties of adolescence along with being famous as the only wizard to survive the Killing Curse. The curse was cast by the evil Tom Riddle, better known as Lord Voldemort, a powerful evil wizard, who had murdered Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby, in the belief this would frustrate a prophecy that Harry would become his equal. As an orphan, Harry {{was placed in the}} care of his Muggle (non-magical) relatives <b>Petunia</b> Dursley and Vernon Dursley.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the three}} {{previous}} novels in the Harry Potter series, the main character, Harry Potter, {{has struggled with}} the difficulties of growing up, and the added challenge of being a famed wizard: when Harry was a baby, Lord Voldemort, the most powerful Dark wizard in history, killed Harry's parents but mysteriously vanished after unsuccessfully trying to kill Harry, which left a lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. This results in Harry's immediate fame and his being placed {{in the care of}} his abusive muggle, or non-magical, aunt and uncle, Aunt <b>Petunia</b> Dursley and Uncle Vernon Dursley, who have a son named Dudley Dursley.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Lazzell {{was one of}} two West Virginians who {{received}} Federal Art Project grants through the Works Progress Administration. That same year she created a mural for a court room in the Monongalia County Courthouse entitled, Justice. The mural took fourteen weeks to complete. The mural is currently displayed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. She continued experimenting with woodprints and, in 1935, studied with the renowned German abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann in Provincetown. Hofmann's push/pull spatial theory is evident in the asymmetry of her later works. Lazzell's studies of flowers were inspired by her lavish potted gardens, such as Star Phlox (1931). Her 1948 floral print, Red and White <b>Petunia,</b> won first prize at the American Color Print Society exhibition. A collection of her prints are housed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University.|$|E
5|$|On Harry Potter's {{birthday}} in 1992, the Dursley family—Harry's uncle Vernon, aunt <b>Petunia,</b> and cousin Dudley—hold {{a dinner party}} for a potential client of Vernon's drill-manufacturing company. Harry is not invited, but is content to spend the evening quietly in his bedroom, although he is upset that his school friends have not sent cards or presents. However, {{when he goes to}} his room a house-elf named Dobby warns him not to return to Hogwarts and admits to intercepting Harry's post from his friends. Having failed to persuade Harry to voluntarily give up his place at Hogwarts, Dobby then attempts to get him expelled by using magic to smash Petunia's dessert on a dinner party guest and framing it on Harry, who is not allowed to use magic out of school. Uncle Vernon's business deal falls through, but Harry is given a second chance and allowed to return {{at the start of the}} school year.|$|E

5|$|During another {{summer with}} his Aunt <b>Petunia</b> and Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter and Dudley are {{attacked}} by Dementors. After using magic to save Dudley and himself, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, {{but the decision}} is later rescinded. Harry is whisked off {{by a group of}} wizards (including the real Mad-Eye Moody, Professor Lupin, and several new faces, including Nymphadora Tonks, a bubbly young witch who is a Metamorphmagus , and Kingsley Shacklebolt, a senior Auror who believes everyone is equal) to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the former home of his godfather, Sirius Black. The building also serves as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, of which Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Lupin, Mad-Eye, and Sirius are members. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order of the Phoenix is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters. From the members of the Order, Harry and the others learn that Voldemort is seeking an object {{that he did not have}} prior to his first defeat, and assume this object to be a weapon of some sort. Harry learns that the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge, is refusing to acknowledge Voldemort's return because of the trouble that doing so would cause, and has been running a smear campaign against him and Dumbledore.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into <b>petunia</b> plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Petunia,</b> Antirrhinum and in maize the C {{function}} {{is controlled by}} a number of genes that act in the same manner. The genes that are closer homologs of AG in <b>Petunia</b> are pMADS3 and floral-binding protein 6 (FBP6).|$|E

50|$|<b>Petunias</b> can {{tolerate}} relatively harsh conditions and hot climates. They {{need at least}} five hours of sunlight every day. They grow well in low humidity, moist soil. Young plants can be grown from seeds. Watering once a week should be sufficient in most regions. Hanging baskets and other containers need more frequent watering. Maximum growth occurs in late spring. Applying fertilizer monthly or weekly, depending on the variety, will help the plant grow quickly. <b>Petunias</b> can be cultivated in hanging baskets.|$|R

25|$|The GLO/PI {{lines that}} have been {{duplicated}} in <b>Petunia</b> contain P. hybrida GLOBOSA1 (PhGLO1, also called FBP1) and also PhGLO2 (also called PMADS2 or FBP3). For the functional elements equivalent to AP3/DEF in <b>Petunia</b> there is both a gene that possesses a relatively similar sequence, called PhDEF {{and there is also}} an atypical B function gene called PhTM6. Phylogenetic studies have placed the first three within the «euAP3» lineage, while PhTM6 belongs to that of «paleoAP3». It is worth pointing out that, in terms of evolutionary history, the appearance of the euAP3 line seems to be related with the emergence of dicotyledons, as representatives of euAP3-type B function genes are present in dicotyledons while paleoAP3 genes are present in monocotyledons and basal angiosperms, among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of interesting phenotypes in RNA interference studies in <b>Petunia</b> and tomato led, in 1994, {{to the definition}} of a new type of function in the floral development model.
