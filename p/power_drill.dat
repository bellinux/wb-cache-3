25|$|Spoon bits are the {{traditional}} boring tools {{used with a}} brace. They should never be used with a <b>power</b> <b>drill</b> of any kind. Their key advantage over regular brace bits and <b>power</b> <b>drill</b> bits is that {{the angle of the}} hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is {{that they do not have}} a lead screw, so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} on August 22, 2009, that al-Nashiri {{was the subject}} of what is described as a mock execution during his torture by the CIA. A <b>power</b> <b>drill</b> and a handgun were used.|$|E
25|$|These bits are {{available}} both in a version similar to an auger bit or brace bit, designed for low speed, high torque use with a brace or other hand drill (pictured to the right), or {{as a high}} speed, low torque bit meant for a <b>power</b> <b>drill.</b> While {{the shape of the}} cutting edges is different, and one uses screw threads and the other a twist bit for the pilot, the method of adjusting them remains the same.|$|E

25|$|Max flees {{and tries}} to visit Sol, {{only to find out}} from his daughter, Jenny, that he has just died from another stroke. Searching Sol's apartment, Max {{eventually}} finds a piece of paper with the number. Back in his own apartment, Max experiences another headache, but resists the urge to take his painkillers. Driven to the brink of madness, he destroys part of Euclid. Believing that the number and the headaches are linked, Max tries to concentrate on the number through the pain. After passing out, Max has a vision of himself standing in a white void and repeating the digits of the number. The vision ends with Max hugging Devi, who {{turns out to be a}} hallucination. Max stands alone in his trashed apartment. Max burns the paper with the number and blithely performs an impromptu trepanning on himself in the right cerebral hemisphere with a <b>power</b> <b>drill.</b>|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{original}} first-person shooter elements were removed by the third revision of the game, which incorporated a more spy-oriented style of gameplay, with the player [...] "trying to quietly take out enemies and not be seen." [...] Chung commented that he reworked the game several more times to fit his vision: [...] "It kept on just changing and changing and changing until it got into a more story-oriented direction." [...] He stated {{that he did not}} feel comfortable developing Gravity Bone as a first-person shooter game, and kept adding [...] "bits and bits of more and more unconventional" [...] elements as a result. He explained that he [...] "got stuck on this idea of the hero never fires a gun, but he just has a bunch of tools on his belt, like a <b>power</b> <b>drill</b> or a can of pressurized Freon, a screwdriver. I thought that was kind of funny and interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{writer from}} the website E! Online felt {{that in the}} video, Beyoncé [...] "most {{certainly}} comes into her own". Puja Patel of Spin regarded it as [...] "practically a tribute to her curves". An editor for CTV News noted how the singer was seen hovering over a bed in an exorcist style. Kathy Iandoli from Vice remarked the same particular scenes for showing Beyoncé living in a matrix. Billie Cohen from the magazine Condé Nast Traveler noted that [...] "maybe {{one of the most}} memorable image" [...] from the visual album was when the singer was seen falling on a king-size bed in [...] "Rocket". In what she perceived to be the best dance moves on the album, Lindsey Weber of Vulture listed the same scene. Considering it one of the most intimate videos on the entire record, Michael Zelenko from The Fader noted, [...] "In a collection full of erotic videos, 'Rocket,' with its heaving chests, bare thighs, bubble baths, and nails clawing at sheets, manages to stand apart as the steamiest of the bunch." [...] Jody Rosen of The New York Times opined that the video featured mostly slow-motion pictures of [...] "billowing silk sheets and water droplets tumbling onto Beyoncé's bare midriff". Neil McCormik from The Daily Telegraph noted the lack of subtlety during the scenes showing a <b>power</b> <b>drill</b> and Beyoncé [...] "shuddering with pleasure". In another review, he labeled the clip as [...] "very naughty".|$|E

While being interrogated, al-Nashiri was waterboarded, a technique since classified as torture. In 2005 the CIA destroyed the tapes of Nashiri's waterboarding.

40|$|From September 2011 to July 2013 the {{percentage}} of flared associated gas produced in the Bakken shale formation decreased from 36 % to 29 %. Although {{the percentage}} decreased, the volume of associated gas produced has almost tripled to 900 MMcf/D, resulting in the flaring of approximately 266 MMcf/D. The Bakken area {{is one of the}} most produced shale oil and condensate formations in the US. Reported volumes for this formation suggest that the amount of associated gas flared is enough to <b>power</b> <b>drilling</b> and hydraulic fracturing operations. This research shows the technical feasibility of replacing diesel for <b>powering</b> <b>drilling</b> and hydraulic fracturing operations in the Bakken formation with flared associated shale gas. We show that this is a more efficient solution to <b>powering</b> <b>drilling</b> rigs and hydraulic fracturing equipment while also reducing the amount of gas being flared in shale oil and condensate plays producing associated gas. To do this, we investigated the composition and volumes of gas being flared and the average energy requirements for drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing equipment in the Bakken area. The investigation reveals that the amount of associated shale gas being flared is more than enough to supply the energy required for <b>power</b> to the <b>drilling</b> rig and frac spreads. After reviewing power sources that can use natural gas (including turbines, dual-fuel, and dedicated spark ignited engines) and associated gas separation technologies, we are able to make recommendations for the best use of flared associated shale gas. We show that making the switch to natural gas from diesel can result in cost savings for drilling rig and hydraulic fracturing operators. Natural gas costs less than diesel and is more environmentally friendly...|$|R
