50|$|In the United States, a <b>patent</b> <b>ambush</b> {{may involve}} {{the filing of}} a {{continuation}} application with claims targeting a standard or the exploitation of a submarine patent, that is, a patent application which has been filed but {{has not yet been}} made public years after the filing.|$|E
50|$|A <b>patent</b> <b>ambush</b> {{occurs when}} {{a member of a}} standard-setting {{organization}} withholds information, during participation in development and setting a standard, about a patent that the member or the member's company owns, has pending, or intends to file, which is relevant to the standard, and subsequently the company asserts that a patent is infringed by use of the standard as adopted.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the problem of <b>patent</b> <b>ambush</b> in standard setting, where patent owners are sometimes able to capture industry standards {{in order to secure}} monopoly power and windfall profits. Because standardisation generally introduces high switching costs, <b>patent</b> <b>ambush</b> can impose significant costs on downstream manufacturers and consumers and drastically reduce the efficiency gains of standardisation. This article considers how Australian competition law is likely to apply to <b>patent</b> <b>ambush</b> both {{in the development of a}} standard (through misrepresenting the existence of an essential patent) and after a standard is implemented (through refusing to license an essential patented technology either at all or on reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms). This article suggests that non-disclosure of patent interests is unlikely to restrained by Part IV of the Trade Practices Act (TPA), and refusals to license are only likely to be restrained if the refusal involves leveraging or exclusive dealing. By contrast, Standard Setting Organisations (SSOs) which seek to limit this behaviour through private ordering may face considerable scrutiny under the new cartel provisions of the TPA. This article concludes that SSOs may be best advised to implement administrative measures to prevent patent hold-up, such as reviewing which patents are essential for the implementation of a standard, asking patent holders to make their licence conditions public to promote transparency, and establishing forums where patent licensees can complain about licence terms that they consider to be unreasonable or discriminatory. Additionally, the ACCC may play a role in authorising SSO policies that could otherwise breach the new cartel provisions, but which have the practical effect of promoting competition in the standards setting environment. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this article is on {{exploring}} the business competitive consequences of firm patent strategies in the United States de jure technology standard development processes. An analytic framework ("Firm Patent Strategies Matrix") is created which formally identifies a set of firm patent strategies applicable in the de jure technology standard development process. This Firm Patent Strategies Matrix is predicated on two key variables relevant to the standard development process: first, firms are either active participants in standard-setting committees, or they are non-participants, and second, firms are either disclosing appropriate information on potentially relevant patented technology (or patent pending applications on such technology), or they are not disclosing such potentially relevant patented information on technology (or patent pending applications on such technology), in the standard development process. The Firm Patent Strategies Matrix identifies the following four generic strategic choices for a technology-driven firm to choose among concerning the disposition of its patents: (1) Disclosure/Participation, (2) Disclosure/Non-Participation, (3) Non-Disclosure/Participation, and (4) Non-Disclosure/Non-Participation. Public policy issues, relevant to these Firm Patent Strategies, are identified (e. g., RAND licencing terms, <b>patent</b> <b>ambush</b> and submarine patents) and recommended policy solutions are offered (e. g., instituting Ex Ante royalty discussions, vigorous federal antitrust enforcement against <b>patent</b> <b>ambush</b> and the wider use of firm patent liability insurance, respectively).

40|$|Technologies that {{implement}} particular standards securing compatibility and interoperability govern {{our everyday}} lives. Given {{that on the}} one hand technical standards should be accessible to the largest possible extent {{and on the other hand}} intellectual property right (IPR) holders may restrict such access, a number of legal issues arise. This thesis primarily focuses on technical standards governed by standard-setting organizations and consequences of the inclusion of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in such standards for their proprietors from the EU competition law perspective. In this regard, the method adopted in this thesis firstly explores the underlying theoretical notions, then focuses on the current EU competition law position de lege lata and discusses possible adjustments thereof de lege ferenda. In the first chapter, technical standards are discussed along with their economic effects, particularly, compatibility, interoperability and network effects. Second chapter lays down the basic matters of interplay between technical standards, IPRs and EU competition law, namely standard-essential patents (SEPs) and fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) licensing terms. Current EU competition law issues are consequently outlined (<b>patent</b> <b>ambush,</b> hold-up) with emphasis on Commission's [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} FRAND {{commitment in}} standard essential patents (SEP) licensing issues. FRAND {{is an industry}} solution to solve risks {{in the process of}} standardization, which are especially obvious in telecommunication sector due to the huge amount of essential patents. Ever since the appearance of FRAND commitments, there are debates on whether {{there is a need for}} anti-trust law to enforce FRAND commitments or not. The article is inspired by argumentations made by representative legal scholars on both sides and to analyse whether there is such a need or not. The contractual nature of FRAND places relevant disputes to be solved primarily among licensing parties and theoretically both Article 101 and Article 102 do not tacitly require FRAND commitments. However, it is necessary for EU competition law to intervene when the SEP licensing agreements and SEP holdersâ€™ abusive conducts due to the dominance on the relevant market, are anti-competitive enough to restrict, prevent and distort competition. Therefore, through a thorough examination of concrete problematic conditions in patent thicket, <b>patent</b> <b>ambush,</b> patent hold-up, royalty stacking, seeking injunctions, possible consumer harms, transfer issues and a globalized context, the article is able to conclude that there is a need for anti-trust intervention in FRAND-encumbered SEP licensing issues. The article suggests that here is a need for anti-trust intervention does not mean that competition law offer any special treatment to FRAND-encumbered SEP issues. Instead, competition law functions in a usual way, only when conditions for competition rules are satisfied. Competition authorities upon applying competition rules have to strike a balance between fundamental IPRs and the freedom of competition. Therefore, anti-trust law sits in a neutral standpoint and acts as a safeguard for a competitive market. Also, due to the complexity of standardization issues and divergent FRAND arrangements, cases have to be made on a case-by-case basis...|$|E
