40|$|This study investigates whether fine-scale clay drapes {{can cause}} an {{anisotropic}} pumping test response {{at a much}} larger scale. A pumping test was performed in a sandbar deposit consisting of cross-bedded units composed of materials with different grain sizes and hydraulic conductivities. The measured drawdown values in the different observation wells reveal an anisotropic or elliptically-shaped <b>pumping</b> <b>cone.</b> The major axis of the pumping ellipse is parallel with the strike of cm to m-scale clay drapes that are observed in several outcrops. To determine (1) whether this large-scale anisotropy can {{be the result of}} fine-scale clay drapes and (2) whether application of multiple-point geostatistics can improve interpretation of pumping tests, this pumping test is analyzed with a local 3 D groundwater model in which fine-scale sedimentary heterogeneity is modelled using multiple-point geostatistics. To reduce CPU and RAM demand of the multiple-point geostatistical simulation step, edge properties indicating the presence of irregularly-shaped surfaces are directly simulated. Results show that the anisotropic <b>pumping</b> <b>cone</b> {{can be attributed to the}} presence of the clay drapes. Incorporating fine-scale clay drapes results in a better fit between observed and calculated drawdowns. These results thus show that fine-scale clay drapes can cause an anisotropic pumping test response at a much larger scale and that the combined approach of multiple-point geostatistics and cell edge properties is an efficient method for integrating fine-scale features in larger scale models.

40|$|Orbital angular {{momentum}} entanglement {{is one of}} the most intriguing topics in quantum physics. A broad range of research have been dedicated either to unravel its underlying physics or to expand the entanglement dimensions and degrees. In this paper, we present a theoretical study on the orbital {{angular momentum}} entanglement by employing the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to quantum position correlation within the azimuthal region. In this study, we decompose the pump light into a set of <b>pump</b> <b>cone</b> states characterized by their radii. The OAM entanglement can be manipulated by controlling the radius of the <b>pump</b> <b>cone</b> state, the length of the nonlinear crystal and the OAM carried by the pump field,which is followed by a detailed discussion. We expect that our research will bring us a deeper understanding of the OAM entanglement, and will do help to the high-dimensional quantum information tasks based on OAM entanglement.

50|$|As a well is <b>pumped,</b> the <b>cone</b> of {{depression}} will extend out {{and will continue}} to expand in a radial fashion until a point of equilibrium occurs. This usually is when the amount of water released from storage equals the rate of pumping. This also can occur when recharge to the aquifer equals the amount of water being pumped.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{study is}} made of veneer failure by {{cracking}} in all-ceramic crown-like layer structures. Model trilayers consisting of a 1 mm thick external glass layer (veneer) joined to a 0. 5 mm thick inner stiff and hard ceramic support layer (core) by epoxy bonding or by fusion are fabricated for testing. The resulting bilayers are then glued to a thick compliant polycarbonate slab to simulate a dentin base. The specimens are subjected to cyclic contact (occlusal) loading with spherical indenters in an aqueous environment. Video cameras are used to record the fracture evolution in the transparent glass layer in situ during testing. The dominant failure mode is cone cracking in the glass veneer by traditional outer (Hertzian) cone cracks at higher contact loads and by inner (hydraulically <b>pumped)</b> <b>cone</b> cracks at lower loads. Failure is deemed to occur when one of these cracks reaches the veneer/core interface. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the alumina and zirconia core materials are discussed in terms of mechanical properties—strength and toughness, as well as stiffness. Consideration is also given to the roles of interface strength and residual thermal expansion mismatch stresse...|$|R
40|$|The Northeast Groundwater Management Area of Wisconsin, USA {{contains}} two major cones {{of depression in}} a confined sandstone aquifer. Each cone is centered near cities that have used groundwater for over 100 years. Near one of these cities (Green Bay), episodic changes {{in the development of}} groundwater and surface water resources during this period have resulted in major changes to the potentiometric surface. On two occasions, roughly 50 years apart, reductions in groundwater withdrawals have resulted from the construction of pipelines drawing surface water from Lake Michigan. In each case, rapid recovery of the potentiometric surface by as much as 70 m has occurred in the northern of the two <b>pumping</b> <b>cones.</b> The most recent switch occurred during 2006 and 2007 when eight communities stopped pumping groundwater, reducing daily withdrawals by approximately 46. 37 million liters. The rate of water level recovery has diminished in some areas, with a return to a flowing artesian state for some municipal and residential wells. Although the northern portion of the groundwater management area has returned to a sustainable condition in the confined aquifer, the portion with the southern cone of depression remains in a state of prolonged drawdown...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} of second harmonic double-resonance cones in hyperbolic metamaterials. An electric dipole {{on the surface of}} the structure induces second harmonic light to propagate into two distinct volume plasmon-polariton channels: A signal that propagates within its own peculiar resonance cone; and a phase-locked signal that is trapped under the <b>pump's</b> resonance <b>cone.</b> Metamaterial dispersion and birefringence induce a large angular divergence between the two volume plasmon-polaritons, making these structures ideal for subwavelength second and higher harmonic imaging microscopy...|$|R
5000|$|The airport {{dates to}} the spring of 1927 when farmer Herman Will opened a 70-plus-acre tract in rural Normal Township. Bordering the field to the west was the {{recently}} paved Illinois 2 (today U.S. 51/Main Street), and to the east was the Illinois Central Railroad (today Constitution Trail). Along the IC, at {{the northeast corner of}} the airport grounds, was Kerrick, a busy grain elevator station that remains a local landmark. The Bloomington Flying Club helped rally the general public and local leaders behind the economic promise of “heavier-than-air” flight. The club owned a “Jenny”-type open-cockpit biplane, and the non-profit organization evidently helped pay for both the construction of a hangar and day-to-day operations of the field. Will offered to rent the field to the city of Bloomington for $1,000 a year, but there was little enthusiasm for a municipally owned or operated airport. In 1928 the Normal field featured a six-plane hangar, filling <b>pump,</b> wind <b>cone,</b> a circle of crushed stone 100-feet in diameter (the purpose of which was to identify the field from the air) and 75 acres of “comparatively level ground.” ...|$|R
40|$|A new machine {{system has}} been designed, {{developed}} and evaluated for extensive circle spraying of oil palms (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) {{in an effort to}} overcome the inefficient spraying problem with the conventional spraying system. The machine system consists of a four-wheeled drive 4 WD prime mover with front mounted machine attachments for the circle spraying operation. The configuration of the circle spraying attachment consists of a hexagonal curved spray boom, lifting arm, opening-tilting mechanism unit, storage tank, spray <b>pump,</b> solid <b>cone</b> nozzles, and associate hydraulic system. Field performance tests on the machine system showed an average effective field capacity of 7. 89 ha per man per day and when compared to the earlier reported effective field capacity of the walking spray-operated equipment using Serena LT 16 knapsack sprayer; a difference of 1. 97 time for circle spraying of mature palms grove. Reduction in the human energy expenditure of 101. 28 kJ man- 1 h- 1 or 10. 68 % but an increase in the spraying cost of 1. 53 USD ha- 1 or 24. 9 % were obtained with the machine system against the walking spraying-operated equipment using Serena LT 16 knapsack sprayer. Justification for machine system to be cost effective could be satisfied if the present effective field capacity is increased to 1. 263 time with good skilled operator or if the current R&D cost is reduced to 0. 41 time. This is because the improved field capacity of new machine system could not rationalize its current R&D cost. Admittedly, the machine system has great potential to overcome the limitations with the current employed machine/equipment in the circle spraying operation of oil palms in the plantation...|$|R
40|$|Las localidades de Cariló y Villa Gesell se han edificado sobre una barrera medanosa de no más de 1400 años de antigüedad. Con el fin de analizar la estratigrafía y sedimentología del subsuelo de la zona, se recurrió a 15 perforaciones, {{realizadas}} en el predio del proyecto de Ciudad Marina de Port Dorá, donde pudieron identificarse tres estratos arenosos asignables a acuíferos, sobre la base de la descripción granulométrica de las muestras recolectadas, y conocidas como Fm Punta Médanos, Fm Pozo N° 8, y Fm Canal 5. Para confirmar la información, se realizaron ocho ensayos de bombeo. La infiltración está distribuida uniformemente sobre toda el área y el flujo del agua subterránea es hacia el mar, con zonas intermedanosas donde aflora el nivel freático. Durante los meses transcurridos entre los controles de la calidad de las aguas subterráneas, los parámetros medidos (temperatura, pH, salinidad, oxígeno disuelto, turbidez) resultaron normales para los ambientes en que se practicaron las mediciones. Dada la baja densidad ocupacional de Cariló, los volúmenes aportados por precipitaciones en el área son suficientes para abastecer la demanda durante los días de verano. La transmisividad promedio obtenida es de 206, 2 m²/día para los acuíferos libres y de 130, 97 m²/día para los semiconfinados. La permeabilidad promedio estimada es de 18, 23 m/día y 4, 19 m/día, respectivamente. Cariló and Villa Gesell localities {{were constructed}} on a barrier younger than 1, 400 years BP. Dealing with the stratigraphic and textural characteritics of this area, 15 holes were drilled {{to a depth}} of 40 m at the property projected as "Ciudad Marina de Port Dora". Three sandy strata were assigned to aquifers and test by pumping essays. These aquifers considered of hydrogeologic interest comprise the stratigraphical units called Punta Medanos, Pozo N° 8 and Canal 5. The dune field is composed of transverse bodies oriented toward the north-northeast. Infiltration is uniformly distributed although at interdune ponds the water table is above the land surface. Water quality (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity) at the testing wells located close to the beach retrieves freshwater. In the sandy barrier from Villa Gesell and Cariló the sandy silts of hydrogeologic interest continue to depths below 40 m. The sedimentary record of the Eastern Barrier of Buenos Aires Province consists on a complex barrier (overlapping of barrier deposits of Quaternary age), modified during the Holocene transgressive-regressive cycle and where these transgressive and regressive processes are still being recorded at some locations (progradation of Punta Médanos, scarps of foredunes in Mar Chiquita). Considering the low density population of the area, precipitation is estimated as able to provide the volume of water needed during the summer season for the resort villages. Average trasmissivity is about 206 m²/day for the free aquifer and 130 m²/day for the semiconfined aquifers. Average permeability is 18. 23 and 4. 19 m/day at each type of aquifers. It is recommended to avoid the on-exploitation of the free aquifer in order to preserve their volumes, to prevent <b>pumping</b> <b>cones</b> and to avoid saline intrusions at the coast. The hydrogeologic reserves exceed the water volume supplied from the pampian silts (Buenos Aires formation) located {{to the west of the}} Route 11. The evaluation of these inputs of groundwater is recommended in order to better manage the semiconfined levels. Even though, recycling and reusing should be considered for the urban growth planing. At the coastal barrier, below the phreatic aquifer, a semiconfined horizontal level of variable thickness was recognised, and superimposed to a second semiconfined aquifer. This second semiconfined level with plane base and irregular top, is superimposed to a third semiconfined aquifer whose base was not drilled...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{concept in}} groundwater hydrology {{is the notion}} of steady state, or equilibrium conditions. When a system at some initial steady state condition is perturbed by <b>pumping,</b> a transient <b>cone</b> of depression will develop and the system will approach a new steady state condition. Understanding the time scale required for the transient process to occur is of practical interest since it would help practitioners decide whether to use a steady state model or a more complicated transient model. Standard approaches to estimate the response time use simple scaling relationships which neglect spatial variations. Alternatively, others define the response time to be the amount of time taken for the difference between the transient and steady state solutions to fall below some arbitrary tolerance level. Here, we present a novel approach and use the concept of mean action time to predict aquifer response time scales in a two-dimensional radial geometry for pumping, injection and recovery processes. Our approach leads to relatively simple closed form expressions that explicitly show how the time scale depends on the hydraulic parameters and position. Furthermore, our dimensionless framework allows us to predict the response time scales for a range of applications including small scale laboratory problems and large scale field problems. Our analysis shows that the response time scales vary spatially, but are equivalent for pumping, injection and associated recovery processes. Furthermore, the time scale is independent of the pumping or injection flow rate. We test these predictions in a laboratory scale aquifer and find that our physical measurements corroborate the theoretical predictions...|$|R
