5|$|Muntz {{designed}} a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars {{and had it}} inexpensively manufactured in Japan.

The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>announcements,</b> unlike radio broadcasts.

5|$|Salant later {{pulled the}} episode from the {{schedule}} and assigned producer Harry Morgan to re-edit it. According to Wallace, Salant found the piece sensationalistic; however, C. A.

Morgan scrapped all but about 10 minutes of Peters' final cut. CBS felt that the self-accepting gay men made too favorable of an impression, so Morgan edited two of the interviews to make the men seem unhappier. According to Wallace, no sponsor would buy time during the episode because of the taboo nature of the subject matter. Commercial spots were filled by <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>announcements</b> for the Peace Corps and the Internal Revenue Service.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} initially received {{negative feedback}} for their representation of an African-American family. They were praised by cast members, but Rodney Van Johnson, who played T.
