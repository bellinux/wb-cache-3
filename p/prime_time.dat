40|$|Recapitulation of endochondral {{ossification}} {{leads to}} a new concept of bone tissue engineering via a cartilage intermediate as an osteoinductive template. In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of in vitro chondrogenic <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> {{for the creation of}} cartilage template on the in vivo endochondral bone formation both qualitatively and quantitatively. To this end, rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were seeded onto two scaffolds with distinguished features: a fibrous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) /poly(epsilon-caprolactone) electrospun scaffold (PLGA/PCL) and a porous hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate composite (HA/TCP). The constructs were then chondrogenically differentiated for 2, 3 and 4 weeks in vitro, followed by subcutaneous implantation in vivo for up to 8 weeks. A longer chondrogenic <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> resulted in a significantly increased amount and homogeneous deposition of the cartilage matrix on both the PLGA/PCL and HA/TCP scaffolds in vitro. In vivo, all implanted constructs gave rise to endochondral bone formation, whereas the bone volume was not affected by the length of <b>priming</b> <b>time.</b> An unpolarized woven bone-like structure, with significant amounts of cartilage remaining, was generated in fibrous PLGA/PCL scaffolds, while porous HA/TCP scaffolds supported progressive lamellar-like bone formation with mature bone marrow development. These data suggest that, by utilizing a chondrogenically differentiated MSC-scaffold construct as cartilage template, 2 weeks of in vitro <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> is sufficient to generate a substantial amount of vascularized endochondral bone in vivo. The structure of the bone depends on the chemical and structural cues provided by the scaffold design...|$|R
40|$|Marginal gap free {{composite}} restorations in {{a cavity}} with margins in dentin {{are still a}} challenge in restorative dentistry. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of prolonged application time of primers on the marginal adaption after extended times for demineralising enamel or dentin surfaces with phosphoric acid. Additionally, the influence of thermocycling procedures was investigated. 144 human caries free premolars were subjected to 576 marginal adaption examinations. Standardized class V cavities were prepared into caries-free human premolars. All cavities were conditioned by phosphoric acid for either 15 s, 30 s or 60 s, rewetted and then treated with one of the following etch & rinse adhesives OptiBond FL, Prime&Bond NT, Excite by applying the primer for either 30 s or 60 s. The composite resin Filtek Z 250 was incrementally placed in the cavities. After polishing the samples were stored in water for 21 days and then thermocycled (2000 cycles between 5 °C and 55 °C, exposure time 30 s). Before and after the thermocycling procedure replica were taken for the margin analysis in the SEM at a magnification of 200 x using defined criteria. Statistical evaluation of the quantitative margin analysis using SPSS for enamel showed neither significant differences between the different primer application periods nor between the different etching times regarding “margin quality 1 ”. Analysis of dentin obtained the following results: Excite showed significantly better results when the primer was applied for 60 s compared to the results for 30 s. OptiBond FL and Prime&Bond NT did not show any significant differences in marginal adaptation regardless of the phosphoric acid etching and <b>priming</b> <b>times.</b> There were no statistically significant differences between the results for OptiBond FL and Prime&Bond NT. <b>Priming</b> <b>time</b> of 60 s showed a significant effect for Excite for etching times of 15 s and 30 s. Additionally, only Excite showed significantly better results when applying the adhesive for 60 s. The results showed, that a combination of 15 s phosphoric acid etching and 30 s of priming is sufficient for all tested adhesives in enamel. Extended <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> did not improve the marginal adaption, even if enamel is conditioned up to 60 s. For dentin the sufficient <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> depended on the adhesive system used. For Excite a prolonged <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> for 60 s improved the margin quality after phosphoric acid etching for 15 s and 30 s. For OptiBond FL and Prime&Bond NT an extended <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> did not improve the marginal adaption even if dentin is conditioned up to 60 s...|$|R

40|$|Siphonic roof {{drainage}} {{systems have been}} in existence for more than 40 years and are becoming an increasingly common element of urban drainage infrastructure. A siphonic system allows roof runoff to quickly reach its maximum flowrate. In contrast to a conventional system the siphonic approach to roof drainage aims to exclude air and to induce the full bore flow conditions required for siphonic action. This means that the filling and <b>priming</b> <b>times</b> are more efficient and quicker than for a conventional gravity-fed roof drainage system. Understanding the <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> of siphonic systems can help to identify potential problems in large systems {{that may not be}} able to fill and prime quickly enough to deal with high-intensity storms of short duration. The results from the work presented in this thesis will hopefully improve our understanding of the priming process in a siphonic roof drainage system and assist the water industry to move towards the use of unsteady flow models for design and performance modelling. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine optimal time of soybean seed priming and effect of primers under salt stress conditions. Testing was {{performed}} at the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops, Novi Sad, on Galina seed variety. Optimal <b>priming</b> <b>time</b> was determined by immersing seed into: KNO 3 (1 %), H 2 O 2 (0. 1 %), and H 2 O with the duration of 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h.

In the second part of the experiment, the seed was immersed into: KNO 3 (1 %), H 2 O 2 (0, 1 %), and H 2 O after which their effect on germination energy and seed germination under simulated salinity conditions was examined. Simulated salinity conditions represented substrate for germination to which NaCl in different concentrations was added (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 mM). Results of the research showed that the six-hour priming of seed was the best with all primers. The percentage of seed germination linearly reduced with the increase of <b>priming</b> <b>time.</b> The research has shown that seed priming represents a favorable technique for the reduction of a negative effect of NaCl on germination energy and soybean seed germination, and the best effect is accomplished with the use of KNO 3...|$|R
