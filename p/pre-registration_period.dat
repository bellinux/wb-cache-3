40|$|Do schools {{discriminate}} against homosexual parents? Evidence from a randomized correspondence experimentDOI: 10. 1016 /j. econedurev. 2016. 06. 001 URL: [URL] Filiació URV: SIThe recognition of homosexual rights is a controversial issue in many countries. Spain {{was the third}} {{country in the world}} (after the Netherlands and Belgium) to introduce a law recognizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children by homosexual couples. In this paper, we examine for the first time whether schools are more hesitant about giving feedback to homosexual parents during children's <b>pre-registration</b> <b>period</b> in Catalonia (Spain). To do so, we designed a correspondence experiment to be conducted in schools. We created three types of fictitious couples-one heterosexual, one gay, and one lesbian-and sent emails to schools in which the couples' sexual orientation was explicit. Our results show that gay couples had a significantly lower (22 percentage points) call-back probability than heterosexual couples. No statistically significant differences in call-back probability were found between the lesbian and heterosexual couples...|$|E

In order to do that, we designed an internet field experiment to be conducted in schools. We created three types of fictitious couples; one heterosexual, one male homosexual and one female homosexual, and send emails to schools making sexual orientation explicit.

No statistically significant differences in the response rate were found between female homosexual and heterosexual couples.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a project {{using a qualitative}} study approach. It explores the utilization of the <b>pre-registration</b> <b>period</b> as preparation for clinical nurse leadership relevant to work in contemporary health care. The empirical focus {{of this study was}} to fundamentally address only the perceptions of senior student nurses about to qualify, of their own leadership development during their programme. Using focus groups with a total of 35 third year pre-registration students about to qualify as nurses provided a rich and detailed description of what inhibited and enhanced the development of their leadership skills. Alongside this, the students' perceptions of qualities and competencies required specifically for contemporary nurse leader roles were identified. No substantive studies exist in the United Kingdom exploring the experiences and perceptions of student nurses regarding nurse leadership during their training. It is distinctive as it challenges the state of nurse leadership in healthcare and the expected developmental needs for it. Students recognised the need to be prepared for leadership during their pre-registration programme and questioned the use of the standard theoretical approach for its development. They asked instead for skills to deal with difficult conversations, unexpected power struggles, challenging and dealing with inappropriate behaviour and introducing evidence into practice in areas of resistance. The study makes an important contribution to education as the findings can inform leadership development throughout the pre-registration nursing programmes within England. It also raises the question as to whether nursing needs more leaders, or just for nurses to take the professional responsibility for their own practice...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Switching {{the patient}} from one {{pharmaceutical}} {{formulation of the}} same drug to another, may lead to therapeutic inadequancy in some cases. To minimize the risk, careful pharmacokinetic studies are desired in the <b>pre-registration</b> <b>period</b> and afterwards. Methods. A randomized, crossover design with one-week wash-out period between each dose was applied. Serum samples, obtained before dosing and at various appropriate time points up to 15 hours, were analyzed for nimesulide content by a high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet (UV) detection. The pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of three different pharmaceutical formulations containing nimesulide, manufactured by the same pharmaceutical factory, were studied prospectively in 12 healthy subjects of both sexes. A single 100 -mg oral dose of nimesulide {{was given to the}} volunteers in the form of conventional tablets, mouth dissolving tablets or as a suspension. Analysis of variance, power analysis, 90 % confidence intervals, and two one-sided tests were used for the statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters. Results. The tolerability of all preparations was excellent. The respective confidence intervals of the ratios of geometric means of Cmax and AUC 0 - ∝ of nimesulide were out of acceptable limits either for conventional tablets in comparison with suspension or for mouth dissolving tablets when compared with conventional tablets. A comparison of mouth dissolving tablets with suspension showed a statistically significant difference between Cmax values (suprabioavailability of mouth dissolving tablets), while the point estimate of the ratio of geometric means of AUC 0 - ∝ was 0. 945 with the corresponding 90 % confidence interval of 0. 902 − 0. 991. At the 5 % level of significance, there were no differences between the formulations under the study in times elapsed to peak serum concentrations, as revealed by the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Conclusion. Only a 90 % confidence interval for the relative differences of log-transformed AUC 0 - ∝ values of nimesulide absorbed from mouth dissolving tablets vs. suspension was included in the 80 % to 125 % interval proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On that basis, mouth dissolving tablets (Nimulid-MD ™) were considered bioequivalent to Nimulid ™ suspension according to the extent of drug absorption. Concerning the comparable amounts of nimesulide available in the systemic circulation after application of these formulations the one might not expect therapeutic failure after switching the patient from one to another...|$|E
40|$|This year {{marks the}} tenth anniversary of an {{unexpected}} re-orientation of medical studies {{which has had}} and is still having frustrating repercussions till the present day. In 1977 reforms in tertiary education were implemented despite strong protests by university students and the medical profession. Many students had {{no alternative but to}} persue their studies under the new scheme. The various subjects were covered in great depth during the very long hours of lectures, holidays were reduced and students struggled to study after working or lecturing hours. Never was a minute lost. University life was reduced to a purely academic one. Foreign professors lectured and examined students as was done in the past. The standard of medical education in Malta was maintained at the highest level. Never was it allowed to faulter despite what the BMA and the GMC(U. K.) were given to understand by some people who appear to have had, themselves, misjudged the whole situation. This resulted in the British Medical Authorities withholding the recognition of the Maltese M. D. degree despite the involvement of their own professors in final examinations and correction of papers. The consequences have been most unfortunate - we have been denied the right for further education in Great Britain unless we requalified in the U. K. after spending one year of pre-graduate training incurring enormous debts for the exaggerated tuition fees, board and lodging. At the end of all this we are then entitled to only limited registration {{enough to be able to}} complete one year <b>pre-registration</b> <b>period</b> as housemen. It is after these two years (at least) that we are then able to commence our post-graduate training. This applies to doctors who qualified between 1977 and 1986; those who qualified after this time, although having had identical training as their predecessors, have been exempted from the financial scourge and can requalify by sitting for the PLAB (or its equivalent) without the need to be adopted by a British university for one year. It would be interesting to know by what criteria was 1986 chosen as the dividing line. The afflicted doctors are further discriminated against by the different regulations of the different Royal Colleges. The Royal Colleges of Physicians, Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are allowing Maltese candidates to sit for the MRCP and MRCOG examinations. However, surgically orientated doctors can only do the prifTlary of the FRCS(Ed) requiring GMC(U. K.) registration to sit for the final part. Sub-specialities like radiotherapy, radiology, ophthalmology, etc. are faced with similar problems if not worse. Discussions abroad since May 1982 by Maltese Medical delegations and local meetings have yet to yield fruit. N/...|$|E
