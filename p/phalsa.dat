50|$|Several species, namely <b>phalsa,</b> {{are known}} for their edible fruit, which are of local {{commercial}} importance. The astringent and refreshing Grewia drupes are particularly popular in summertime. Folk medicine makes use of some species, which are reputed to cure upset stomachs and some skin and intestinal infections, and seem to have mild antibiotic properties. G. mollis is reputed to contain β-carboline alkaloids, though whether such compounds occur in other species too and whether they are produced in quantities to render the plants psychoactive has not been thoroughly studied.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the dangerous, and {{potentially}} fatal, {{effects of the}} loo on vegetation, humans and animals, [...] it is {{sometimes referred to as}} an evil wind in popular Indo-Pakistani culture. Avoiding exposure to the Loo is strongly recommended for children and the elderly, as well as pets. Most people attempt to stay indoors as much as possible during afternoons in the Loo-affected months. Heatstrokes are commonly referred to as Loo lagna (Hindi: लू लगना, Urdu: لُو لگنا) being stricken by the Loo [...] Certain sherbets, which are popularly believed to have a cooling effect on the body and provide some protection against Loo-caused heatstrokes, are widely consumed during the Loo-season. These include sherbets of rose, khus, shahtoot, bel and <b>phalsa.</b> A specific Unani recipe called Rooh Afza combines several of these popularly believed cooling agents, and is sold commercially as a syrup to flavor sherbets, cold milk drinks, ices and cold desserts, such as the popular falooda. Lassi, a yogurt-based drink of North India and Pakistan, is also extremely popular and believed to confer some protection against the Loo. Additionally in the desert state of Rajasthan Kairi ka Panna (कैरी का पन्ना) (drink of raw/unripe mango) is a very popular way of remaining cool and resilient to Loo.|$|E
40|$|<b>Phalsa</b> (Grewia asiatica L., Tiliaceae) is {{an exotic}} bush plant {{considered}} horticulturally {{as a small}} fruit crop but also used as a folk medicine. The ripe <b>phalsa</b> fruits (Fig. 1) are consumed fresh, in desserts, or processed into refreshing fruit and soft drinks enjoyed during hot summer months in India (Salunkhe and Desai 1984). However, <b>phalsa</b> fruit has a short shelf life and is considered suitable only for local marketing (Anand 1960). The <b>phalsa</b> plant (Fig. 2) is native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia (Hays 1953; Chundawat and Singh 1980) but is cultivated on a commercial scale mainly in the northern and the western states of India (Hays 1953; Sastri 1956). Around {{the beginning of the}} 20 th century, it was introduced into the East Indies including the Philippines where it is naturalized at low elevations in dry zones of the island of Luzon. It reached western countries much later in the century. In the United States, a few specimens have been establishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} pruning intensities as factor-A and various pruning dates as factor-B {{on the production}} of <b>phalsa</b> was checked. Pruning levels significantly affected the days taken to sprouting, flowering, fruit setting, number of branches/plant, length of branches, number of fruit clusters/plant and weight of clusters. Among different pruning intensities, 100 cm gave maximum number of clusters/plant (1771) and also the highest yield/plant (18. 41 kg). Various pruning dates significantly affected the days taken to sprouting, number of leaves/branch and number of branches/plant. Pruning at 22 Dec. produced maximum number of fruit clusters/plant (1660) and the highest yield/plant (18. 17 kg) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Grewia asiatica Linn. (Family: Tiliaceae), called <b>Phalsa</b> in Hindi is an Indian {{medicinal}} plant {{used for a}} variety of therapeutic and nutritional uses. The root bark of the plant is traditionally used in rheumatism (painful chronic inflammatory condition). Aims: The present study demonstrates the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of root bark of G. asiatica in rodents. Settings and Design: The methanolic extract of Grewia asiatica (MEGA) and aqueous extract of Grewia asiatica (AEGA) of the bark were prepared and subjected to phytochemical tests and pharmacological screening for analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in rodents. Materials and Methods: Analgesic effect was studied using acetic acid-induced writhing in mice and hot plate analgesia in rats while anti-inflammatory activity was investigated using carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rats. The MEGA or AEGA was administered orally in doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg/day of body weight. Statistical Analysis: Data were analysed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett′s test. Results: The extracts showed a significant inhibition of writhing response and increase in hot plate reaction time and also caused a decrease in paw oedema. The effects were comparable with the standard drugs used. Conclusions: The present study indicates that root bark of G. asiatica exhibits peripheral and central analgesic effect and anti-inflammatory activity, which may be attributed to the various phytochemicals present in root bark of G. asiatica...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{available}} genetic diversity of different fruit crops in the Chotanagpur plateau region, a survey was conducted in 11 horticultural diversity rich districts in Jharkhand, Purulia and Midnapur district of West Bengal and Jashpur district of Chhattisgarh. During the survey, information on people's perceptions and priorities on genetic resources of horticultural crops in their vicinity were collected through field visit, personal interaction and collection of data on predesigned questionnaire. A total of 47 numbers of fruit species belonging to 40 genera could be identified in the surveyed villages. With respect to availability status, the fruits like Bael, Custard apple, Lakoocha, Papaya, Longan, Kend, Aonla, Fig, Mahua, Mango, Guava, Kusum, Jamun and ber {{could be found in}} almost all the localities surveyed. With respect to extent of consumption, fruits like Guava, Bael, Banana, Custard Apple, Ber, Jackfruit, Pear, Litchi, Jharber, Mango, Chironji, Papaya, Tamarind, Citrus, Pomegranate, Aonla, Date Palm and Jamun were responded to be amongst the frequently consumed fruits. Fruits like like Bael, Ber, Custard apple, Kadam, Jackfruit, Harra, Mango, Jhar ber, Chironji, Kend, Jungle jalebi, Fig, Imli, Aonla, Paniala, Bahera, <b>Phalsa,</b> Kusum, Bhelwa and Jamun were responded to be having high variability in the Chotanagpur plateau region. As perceived by the respondents, the fruits like Guava, Singara, Jackfruit, Harra, Chironji, Papaya, Kusum and Jamun can be considered to have high genetic erosion whereas fruits like Bael, Cashew, Custard apple, jackfruit, Chironji, Papaya, Citrus, Coconut, Aonla, Litchi, Mango, Banana, Peach, Guava, Pomegranate, Pear, Jamun, Tamarind and Water Chestnut have high potential for commercial cultivation.
