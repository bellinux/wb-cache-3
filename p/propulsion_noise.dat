40|$|A {{review is}} {{conducted}} of the prediction techniques for CTOL aircraft noise sources which are presently {{implemented in the}} NASA Aircraft Noise Prediction Program (ANOPP).

These different degrees of complexity are called levels of prediction. The prediction methods being used imply a similarity law for aircraft noise. <b>Propulsion</b> <b>noise</b> is proportional to mass flow for a selected engine cycle and, since thrust is also proportional to mass flow, aircraft with a fixed thrust-to-weight ratio will have their <b>propulsion</b> <b>noise</b> proportional to weight...|$|E

40|$|While the {{technique}} of auralization has been in use {{for quite some time}} in architectural acoustics, the application to environmental noise has been discovered only recently. With road traffic noise being the dominant noise source in most countries, particular interest lies in the synthesis of realistic pass-by sounds. This article describes an auralizator for pass-bys of accelerating passenger cars. The key element is a synthesizer that simulates the acoustical emission of different vehicles, driving on different surfaces, under different operating conditions. Audio signals for the emitted tire noise, as well as the <b>propulsion</b> <b>noise</b> are generated using spectral modeling synthesis, which gives complete control of the signal characteristics. The sound of propulsion is synthesized as a function of instantaneous engine speed, engine load and emission angle, whereas the sound of tires is created in dependence of vehicle speed and emission angle. The sound propagation is simulated by applying a series of time-variant digital filters. To obtain the corresponding steering parameters of the synthesizer, controlled experiments were carried out. The tire noise parameters were determined from coast-by measurements of passenger cars with idling engines. To obtain the <b>propulsion</b> <b>noise</b> parameters, measurements at different engine speeds, engine loads and emission angles were performed using a chassis dynamometer. The article shows how, from the measured data, the synthesizer parameters are calculated using audio signal processing...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} has been to measure the sound power level of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>noise</b> from a heavy vehicle at {{constant}} speed. The measurement results have been compared with the Harmonoise/Imagine source model for heavy vehicles. The model {{will be used for}} noise mapping purposes. The influence of driving style, vehicle load and road gradient was also studied. Finally a city cycle test, including different driving modes; acceleration, constant speed, engine braking and low idle, was performed. The work has been performed indoors at the Noise and Vibration Laboratory at Volvo Trucks, Göteborg. Partly in the powertrain rig where the truck cab, with standard noise muffler and noise shields, was built up around the driveline, and partly in the truck noise chamber where the rear tires where encapsulated. The sound power level in third octave bands was measured according to ISO 3744 using a parallelepiped measurement surface. The tested vehicle is a typical long distance truck with a 480 hp engine. The simulated load was 30 tonnes and 18 tonnes for the powertrain rig and the truck noise chamber respectively. The results indicate that the vehicle speed dependent source model shows too high values at higher speeds. The measurements show also that the <b>propulsion</b> <b>noise</b> at constant speed can be modelled as constant below 50 km/h. The sound level increases above 50 - 55 km/h with the increased engine speed. A rougher driving style defined as driving with one gear lower than most suitable gear, leads to an averaged noise increase of 2, 3 dBA in the powertrain rig and 1, 4 dBA in the truck chamber. Simulating different vehicle load at horizontal road and with constant speed showed no influence on the emitted noise. Driving on positive and negative road grades in these measurements showed approximately the same noise increase in both up- and downhills due to increased engine load. The city cycle test showed that the difference between the maximum and minimum sound power level is 14 dB with the simulated truck...|$|E
40|$|Contributions {{from the}} {{combustor}} {{to the overall}} <b>propulsion</b> <b>noise</b> of civilian transport aircraft are starting to become important due to turbofan design trends and expected advances in mitigation of other noise sources. During on-ground, static-engine acoustic tests, combustor noise is generally sub-dominant to other engine noise sources because {{of the absence of}} in-flight effects. Consequently, noise-source separation techniques are needed to extract combustor-noise information from the total noise signature in order to further progress. A novel four-signal source-separation method is applied to data from a static, full-scale engine test and compared to previous methods. The new method is, in a sense, a combination of two- and three-signal techniques and represents an attempt to alleviate some of the weaknesses of each of those approaches. This work is supported by the NASA Advanced Air Vehicles Program, Advanced Air Transport Technology Project, Aircraft Noise Reduction Subproject and the NASA Glenn Faculty Fellowship Program...|$|E
40|$|The CNOSSOS-EU {{method is}} {{recommended}} in Europe for environmental noise prediction. In regards to road traffic, it includes vehicle noise emission models implicitly referring to internal combustion vehicles. The development of electrically driven vehicles {{calls for the}} future consideration of these vehicles in prediction models. On the basis of experimental data, the study reported in this paper proposes a noise emission model for extending CNOSSOS-EU to light electric vehicles. Correction terms {{to be applied to}} the <b>propulsion</b> <b>noise</b> component are determined. Investigations on a sample of tyres with good rolling resistance performance, which is a main tyre selection criterion on these vehicles, indicated that no correction is required for the rolling noise component. Differences between the noise emission from conventional vehicles and electric vehicles are discussed for several road surfaces. Owing to the limited vehicle sample as well as transitional statements, this new model for electric vehicles running at constant speed over 20 km/h should be considered as a first step towards the definition of this vehicle technology in CNOSSOS-EU...|$|E

40|$|The term “open rotor” {{refers to}} unducted {{counter-rotating}} dual rotors or propellers used for <b>propulsion.</b> The <b>noise</b> generated by an open rotor is very complicated and requires special techniques for its analysis.

The data analysis technique developed by Sree for processing raw acoustic data of open rotors has been modified to yield much better results of tone and broadband separation particularly for the case when the two rotor speeds are approximately the same. The modified algorithm is found to eliminate {{most or all of}} the “spikes” previously observed in the broadband spectra computed from the original algorithm.

NASA is considering purchasing a DGEN 380 turbofan to test new <b>propulsion</b> <b>noise</b> reduction technologies in a relevant engine environment. To explore this possibility, NASA and Price Induction have signed a Space Act Agreement and have agreed to cooperate on engine acoustic testing. Static acoustic measurements of the engine were made by NASA researchers during July, 2014 at the Glenn Research Center. In the event that a DGEN turbofan becomes a NASA noise technology research testbed, {{it is in the}} interest of NASA to develop procedures to evaluate engine system noise metrics.

Special {{attention has been paid to}} potential and dedicated tyre sets which meet the demands for low energy consumption and a low rolling resistance to optimize the range of electric vehicles.

In a second part of the work, the EU tyre labels have been considered. The tyre labels have been introduced by the European Community for informing and helping consumers to choose products according to energy efficiency, safety in wet braking conditions and exterior rolling noise. Minimum requirements are also set in type-approval legislation. In the FOREVER project the exterior noise labels of the nine selected tyres have been compared with the results of the pass-by noise measurements performed on a common real-life road surface.
