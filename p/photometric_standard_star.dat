40|$|All {{available}} {{observations of}} photometric standard stars obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at Gemini North {{in the period}} from August 2001 to December 2003 {{have been used to}} establish the calibrations for photometry obtained with the instrument. The calibrations presented in this paper are based on significantly more <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> observations than usually used by the individual users. Nightly photometric zero points as well as color terms are determined. The color terms are expected to be valid for all observations taken prior to UT 2004 November 21 at which time the Gemini North primary mirror was coated with silver instead of aluminum. While the nightly zero points are accurate to 0. 02 mag or better (random errors), the accuracy of the calibrations is limited by systematic errors from so-called "sky concentration", an effect seen in all focal reducer instruments. We conclude that an accuracy of 0. 035 to 0. 05 mag can be achieved by using calibrations derived in this paper. The color terms are strongest for very red objects, e. g. for objects with (r'-z') = 3. 0 the resulting z' magnitudes will be ~ 0. 35 mag too bright if the color term is ignored. The calibrations are of importance to the large Gemini user community with data obtained prior to UT 2004 November 21, as well as future users of achive data from this period in time.

High signal-to-noise multi-color photometry were obtained using the USNO 1 -m telescope. These light curves show asymmetry at quadrature phases (O'Connell effect), which can be modeled with the presence of star spots. A low resolution spectrum obtained with the 3. 5 -m WIYN telescope at orbital phase 0. 76 is consistent with a spectral type of dK 7 e and dM 3 e. A radial velocity curve for the primary star was constructed using twenty-four high resolution spectra from the 9. 2 m HET. Spectra show H-alpha and H-beta in emission confirming chromospheric activity and possibly the presence of circumstellar material. Binary star models that simultaneously fit the U, B, V, R and RV curves are those with a primary star of mass 0. 59 +- 0. 02 Msun, temperature 4100 +- 25 K, mean radius of 0. 67 Rsun, just filling its Roche lobe and a secondary star of mass 0. 31 +- 0. 09 Msun, temperature 3425 +- 25 K, mean radius of 0. 48 Rsun, just within its Roche lobe.

40|$|Context. The star γ Cep {{is known}} as a single-lined spectroscopic triple system at a {{distance}} of 13. 8 pc, composed of a K 1 III-IV primary star with V = 3. 2 mag, a stellar-mass companion in a 66 - 67 year orbit (Torres 2007, ApJ, 654, 1095), and a substellar companion with M_p sin i = 1. 7 M_(Jup) that is most likely a planet (Hatzes et al. 2003, ApJ, 599, 1383). Aims. We aim to obtain a first direct detection of the stellar companion, to determine its current orbital position (for comparison with the spectroscopic and astrometric data), its infrared magnitude and, hence, mass. Methods. We use the Adaptive Optics camera CIAO at the Japanese 8 m telescope Subaru on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, with the semi-transparent coronograph to block most of the light from the bright primary γ Cep A, and to detect {{at the same time the}} faint companion B. In addition, we also used the IR camera Ω Cass at the Calar Alto 3. 5 m telescope, Spain, to image γ Cep A and B by adding up many very short integrations (without AO). Results. γ Cep B is clearly detected on our CIAO and Ω Cass images. We use a <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> to determine the magnitude of B after PSF subtraction in the Subaru image, and the magnitude difference between A and B in the Calar Alto images, and find an average value of K = 7. 3 ± 0. 2 mag.

More than 15, 000 stars suitable for use as <b>photometric</b> <b>standards</b> have been identified, where "suitable" means that the star has been observed five or more times during photometric conditions and has a standard error of the mean magnitude less than 0. 02 mag in {{at least two of the}} four bandpasses, and shows no significant evidence of intrinsic variability. Many of these stars are in the same fields as Landolt's equatorial standards or Graham's (1982, PASP, 94, 244) southern E-region standards, but are considerably fainter. This enhances the value of those fields for the calibration of photometry obtained with large telescopes. Other standards have been defined in fields containing popular objects of astrophysical interest, such as star clusters and famous galaxies, extending Landolt-system calibrators to declinations far from the equator and to stars of sub-Solar chemical abundances.

40|$|We {{describe}} the flattening of scientific CCD imaging data using a dome flat field system. The system uses {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs) to illuminate a carefully constructed dome flat field screen. LEDs have several advantages over more traditional illumination sources: they are available {{in a wide range}} of output wavelengths, are inexpensive, have a very long source lifetime, and are straightforward to control digitally. The circular dome screen is made of a material with Lambertian scattering properties that efficiently reflects light of a wide range of wavelengths and incident angles. We compare flat fields obtained using this new system with two types of traditionally-constructed flat fields: twilight sky flats and nighttime sky flats. Using <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> <b>stars</b> as illumination sources, we test the quality of each flat field by applying it to a set of <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> observations. We find that the dome flat field system produces flat fields that are superior to twilight or nighttime sky flats, particularly for photometric calibration. We note that a ratio of the twilight sky flat to the nighttime sky flat is flat to within the expected uncertainty; but since both of these flat fields are inferior to the dome flat, this common test is not an appropriate metric for testing a flat field. Rather, the only feasible and correct method for determining the appropriateness of a flat field is to use <b>standard</b> <b>stars</b> to measure the reproducibility of known magnitudes across the detector.

We have augmented this survey by taking nightly exposures of <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> <b>stars</b> and have utilized this data to photometrically calibrate the MEarth system, identify photometric nights, and obtain an optical magnitude with 1. 5 % precision for each M dwarf system. Each optical magnitude is an average {{over many years}} of data, and therefore should be largely immune to stellar variability and flaring. We combine this with trigonometric distance measurements, spectroscopic metallicity measurements, and 2 MASS infrared magnitude measurements in order to derive a color-magnitude-metallicity relation across the mid-to-late M dwarf spectral sequence that can reproduce spectroscopic metallicity determinations to a precision of 0. 1 dex. We release optical magnitudes and metallicity estimates for 1567 M dwarfs, many of which {{did not have an}} accurate determination of either prior to this work. For an additional 277 stars without a trigonometric parallax, we provide an estimate of the distance assuming solar neighborhood metallicity.

40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} {{the distance and}} linear dimensions of the Draco Molecular Cloud (MBM 41) we have obtained new CCD photometry for a selection of stars in 20 selected areas toward the cores of the cloud. The selected areas were chosen {{to coincide with the}} brightest IRAS emitting portions of the cloud, and also with dense 12 CO emission from the cloud. For each area we have obtained V and B photometry, and a subset of the fields has also been observed through a narrow-band Hα filter and in the U band. We present V and B magnitudes for the 362 stars which have high-quality observations in both bands. In addition we have derived star counts in the V band using a larger sample of 465 stars, which is complete to a limiting magnitude of V = 19. 0. The star counts were compared to a galactic model from Bahcall & Soneira (1980). Using the galactic model of star counts, slightly modified to include the effects of a cloud of arbirary distance and extinction, we find a best fit to our data with values of AV = 2. 5 and 800 < d < 1300 pc for the Draco molecular cloud. We also report results of photometric spectral classification using the index [V −α], which was found to correlate well with (B −V) 0 for our <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> <b>stars.</b> The modelled B − V colors of the stellar sample were compared with the catalog values, and the observed colors best matched a cloud distance of d = 1100 + 200 − 300 pc, with AV = 2. 5 ± 0. 5 and RV = 1. 5. Our photometry detects reddening and extinction from the densest portions of the Draco cloud, and {{it seems likely that the}} cloud is within the range of distances 800 < d < 1300 pc, which corresponds to a height |z | = 640 pc above the galactic plane, and linear dimensions as large as 40 pc for the cloud...|$|R
40|$|We present imaging {{data and}} {{photometry}} for the COSMOS survey in 15 photometric bands between 0. 3 µm and 2. 4 µm. These include data {{taken on the}} Subaru 8. 3 m telescope, the KPNO and CTIO 4 m telescopes, and the CFHT 3. 6 m telescope. Special techniques are used {{to ensure that the}} relative photometric calibration is better than 1 % across the field of view. The absolute <b>photometric</b> accuracy from <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> measurements is found to be 6 %. The absolute calibration is corrected using galaxy spectra, providing colors accurate to 2 % or better. Stellar and galaxy colors and counts agree well with the expected values. Finally, as {{the first step in the}} scientific analysis of these data we construct panchromatic number counts which confirm that both the geometry of the universe and the galaxy population are evolving...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of stars that show spectra {{very close to the}} black-body radiation. We found 17 such stars out of 798, 593 stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data archives. We discuss the value of these stars for the calibration of photometry, whatever is the physical nature of these stars. This gives us a chance to examine the accuracy of the zero point of SDSS photometry across various passbands: we conclude that the zero point of SDSS photometric system is internally consistent across its five passbands to the level below 0. 01 mag. We may also examine the consistency of the zero-points between UV photometry of Galaxy Evolution Explorer and SDSS, and IR photometry of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer against SDSS. These stars can be used as not only <b>photometric</b> but spetrophotometric <b>standard</b> <b>stars.</b> We suggest that these stars showing the featureless black-body like spectrum of the effective temperature of 10000 ± 1500 K are consistent with DB white dwarfs with the temperature too low to develop helium absorption features.

40|$|We {{have created}} a digital {{spectral}} library, using low resolution optical spectra, of <b>photometric</b> and spectral <b>standard</b> <b>stars.</b> The data were acquired using the Cassegrain Spectrograph installed on the 1. 9 m Radcliffe telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory. The library consists of optical wavelength (~ 3500 - 7500 AA) spectra for main sequence and giant stars encompassing those most commonly observed in the Galaxy, namely the late-B, A-, F-, G-, K-, and early- to mid-M stars. We intend that our <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> spectra will be especially useful for spectral classification of stars {{in the field and}} Galactic clusters alike, and will have high pedagogic value when included into representative Introductory Astronomy or Stellar Astronomy curricula for undergraduate astronomy major and minor programs. We exploit the spectral library in order to derive spectral types for seventy-six optically and X-ray selected members of the young open cluster NGC 6475. Comparison of spectral-type, optical and infrared photometric data to theoretical colors derived from spectral type show that the reddening of the cluster is E(B-V) = 0. 068 +/- 0. 012 (1 sigma= 0. 058), a vector consistent with earlier surveys. Our analysis also highlights the utility of such spectra in rejecting cluster non-members, thereby allowing the creation of a clean sample of bona fide cluster members for follow-up science observations.

40|$|Discussed are the {{specifications}} for a <b>Photometric</b> <b>Standard</b> of Hard Dot Area.

40|$|The IRAF photmetric {{calibration}} package PHOTCAL is discussed. PHOTCAL {{is a set}} {{of tasks}} designed to derive the transformation from the instrumental photometric system to the <b>standard</b> <b>photometric</b> system, and apply the transformation to the observations. The PHOTCAL package contains tasks for: (1) creating and/or editing <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> catalogs and observations catalogs, (2) creating, checking and editing the configuration file which specifies the format of the <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> and observations catalogs and the form of the transformation equations, (3) solving the transformation equations interactively or non-iteractively using non-linear least squares fitting routines, and (4) applying the transformation to the observations. PHOTCAL <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> and observations catalogs are simple text files, whose columns are delimited by whitespace, and whose first column contains the star names. This format makes it relatively easy to interface the output of non-IRAF photometry programs as well as the output of the IRAF APPHOT and DAOPHOT photometry packages to PHOTCAL. PHOTCAL maintains a <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> catalog directory for the convenience of the user, but users can easily create their own <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> catalogs and/or define their own <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> catalog directory. Separate observations files produced by APPHOT, DAOPHOT or a user program containing data for stellar fields taken through different filters, can be combined into observations catalogs using one of the PHOTCAL preprocessor tasks. The input configuration file required by PHOTCAL is a text file, consisting of a series of instructions written by the user in a mini-language understood by the PHOTCAL parser. These instructions: (1) assign names to the input data columns in the <b>standard</b> <b>star</b> and observations catalogs, (2) assign names and initial values to the parameters to be fit, (3) define and describe how to solve the transformation equations. The mini-language approach permits great flexibility in the format of the input catalogs and the form of the transformation equations...|$|R
