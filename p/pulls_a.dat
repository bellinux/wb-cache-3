5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker.

Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity.

From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space.

The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E
