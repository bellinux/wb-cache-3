40|$|Organisation and {{management}} of the product development process have been an issue in both academia and industry for over three decades. The literature on product development is growing, but <b>Process</b> <b>Industry</b> is often lacking in these discussions. Therefore, this paper focuses on linking the determinants of an effective product development <b>process</b> to <b>Process</b> <b>Industry</b> and the implication this may have on a traditionally very process-oriented industry by nature. Further, the paper organises the burgeoning product development literature into three main determinants: innovation type, technology strategy and organisational aspect. The selection of determinants to the conceptual framework, adjusting for <b>Process</b> <b>Industry</b> origins in previous written research material and our own empirical work of product development in <b>Process</b> <b>Industry,</b> is briefly presented {{at the beginning of the}} paper. Our literature review focuses on the product development process and builds the framework of our conceptual model detailing the elements of intra- and inter-firm processes in the product development process of the <b>Process</b> <b>Industry.</b> Our purpose is to give an increased understanding of the changed innovation pattern in <b>Process</b> <b>Industry</b> and its implication on activities concerning organisation {{and management}} of the product development process.

500|$|Distillation {{is one of}} {{the unit}} {{operations}} of chemical engineering. Continuous distillation is used widely in the chemical <b>process</b> <b>industries</b> where large quantities of liquids have to be distilled. Such industries are the natural gas processing, petrochemical production, coal tar processing, liquor production, liquified air separation, hydrocarbon solvents production and similar industries, but it finds its widest application in petroleum refineries. In such refineries, the crude oil feedstock is a very complex multicomponent mixture that must be separated and yields of pure chemical compounds are not expected, only groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points, which are called fractions. [...] These fractions are the origin of the term fractional distillation or fractionation. [...] It is often not worthwhile separating the components in these fractions any further based on product requirements and economics.|$|E

If they cannot affect product performance, {{what could be the}} reason behind it?   Purpose: This paper aims to conclude general view of impact of value chain activities on product performances (quality, cost and innovation). Accordingly we would create a conceptual model. And then test whether this model applies for <b>process</b> <b>industry</b> and further more figure out the reason behind through case study.   Methodology: In this paper, qualitative research is our approach. We choose single case study as research strategy and conduct three interviews. Documentation and interview data are collected and analyzed to provide theoretical framework and empirical evidence for the whole paper.     Result: Based on case study, and previous work, the model concerning impact of major activities for <b>process</b> <b>industry</b> (Marketing sales, Human Resource and Supplier management) on product performances (Quality, Cost and Innovation) is derived. This model contains answers to nine hypotheses assumed in theoretical part, giving reader a new and easy way to understand <b>process</b> <b>industry.</b>         Conclusions: Distinguished from other <b>industry,</b> <b>process</b> <b>industry</b> with its own unique characteristics does not lend support to all nine hypotheses. Fundamental analysis proved that some assumptions do not establish for <b>process</b> <b>industry</b> while the others may have more significant relationships. To be specific, there exists strong impact of human resource on product quality and cost, supplier management on product cost and also marketing and sales on product quality. But, to our surprise, the other assumed relationships are not that significant while product innovation has adverse affect on marketing and sales...|$|R
