50|$|On 15 June, the Civil Service Tribunal of the European Union {{issued its}} ruling in case F-35/08, Pachtitis/Commission, which principally {{concerned}} {{the authority of}} the European Personnel Selection Office to set pre-selection tests. The cornerstone of the case was an interpretation of Annex III of the Staff Regulations, which led the Tribunal to conclude that only the Selection Board, and not EPSO, has the power to determine the content of questions for <b>pre-selection</b> <b>test.</b> Since the ruling pre-selection tests are organised under the responsibility of the Selection Board. Following the decision EPSO arranged a new competition for the approximately 36000 candidates who were excluded from the open competition EPSO/AD/177/10.|$|E
40|$|A {{crossing}} programme to develop compact-dwarf varieties was initiated in 2003 / 04 whereby 32 Colombian (dwarf) and 61 tall hybrid lines were involved. Lines {{involved in the}} {{crossing programme}} are good sources of coffee berry disease (CBD) and coffee leaf rust (CLR) resistance. A total of 67 compact hybrid lines were developed. Out of 67, 15 lines considered as the best crosses were subjected to CBD <b>Pre-selection</b> <b>test</b> at hypocotyls stage to study inheritance of resistance. VC 298, VC 506 and HdT 1593 (CBD resistant candidate), and N 39 and KP 423 (CBD susceptible varieties) were included as check varieties. Results show that Disease Intensity Reaction (DIR) of hybrid compact lines ranged from 0. 0 to 3. 5. Line with DIR < 25 {{is considered to be}} CBD resistant candidate. Resistance inherited appears to be controlled by VC 298, VC 506, HdT 1593 from tall hybrid lines, and Colombian 086, 088, 089 and 090 lines used as female parents. The resistance of these compact lines will be qualified with CBD attached berry test at fruit bearing stage...|$|E

Sheldrake and Smart [1, 2] conducted experiments where participants had to determine which one of four possible callers is on the phone while the telephone was still ringing. They report highly significant hit rates that cannot be explained by conven-tional theories. We attempted to replicate these findings in a series of three experiments. In study one, 21 participants were asked to iden-tify the callers of 20 phone calls each. Overall 26. 7 % were identified correctly (mean chance expectation 25 %, ns). In a second study a <b>pre-selection</b> <b>test</b> was introduced in a different experimental setting. Eight participants identified 30 % of the calls correctly (p =. 15). However one of the participants recognized 10 out of 20 calls correctly (p =. 014). We conducted a third study with only this participant. In an additional 60 trials she could identify 24 callers correctly (p =. 007). We conclude that we could not find any anomalous cognition effect in self-selected samples. But our data also strongly suggest that there are a few participants who are able to score reliably and repeatedly above chance.

50|$|As a rule, {{candidates}} sit <b>pre-selection</b> <b>tests</b> (except situational judgement) {{in their}} first language, and the assessment centre in their second language. For some positions specific language qualifications may be required {{within the framework of}} the competition or recruitment stage as each institution recruits on the basis of its own requirements regarding language.|$|R
50|$|When a {{competition}} is published, European citizens {{are invited to}} apply electronically by creating their own EPSO profile directly on the EPSO website. All communication with candidates is done electronically through their EPSO profile. EPSO normally organises <b>pre-selection</b> <b>tests</b> in specialised test centres in all Member States; therefore, candidates may select their preferred testing location {{at the time of}} online registration. The assessment phase is usually held in Brussels or Luxembourg.|$|R
40|$|The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana is a {{promising}} agent {{for use in}} insect control. Its pathogenic activity, {{as well as other}} factors such as temperature that can interfere with its development, should be assessed, thus, establishing the foundations for B. bassiana use in biological control programs. The objective {{of this study was to}} select and induce tolerance of B. bassiana isolates to high and low temperatures and to assess their virulence before and after exposure to those temperatures. A <b>pre-selection</b> <b>test</b> was performed, in which the tolerance of isolates to stress temperatures was tested and compared to the ideal growth temperature of 25 °C for this organism. For the isolates/temperature combinations resulting in growth, conidia germination and colony-forming units (CFUs) were assessed. The isolates Unioeste 4 and Unioeste 40 exhibited > 95 % germinated conidia at 16 and 31 °C. Thereafter, they underwent four consecutive passages at maximum and minimum tolerated temperatures (10 and 37 °C). A significant difference in germination was observed between the two isolates at all temperatures tested. More CFUs were observed for Unioeste 4 compared to Unioeste 40 at all temperatures, and in the case of the latter, there was no difference in CFU formation at 10 and 25 °C. For both isolates, decreased vegetative growth was observed at 37 °C. Recovery of virulence was observed in both isolates, as determined by insect mortality. No relationship was observed between production of the enzyme Pr 1 and the virulence of the isolates. </p...|$|E
50|$|It is a {{right of}} an EU citizen, {{according}} to the EU treaties, to take a case to the Ombudsman. One example of a case dealt with by the Ombudsman involved a late payment from the Commission to a German science journalist. The Commission explained the delay, paid interest and accelerated future payments to experts. On another occasion, following a complaint from a Hungarian, EPSO agreed to clarify information in recruitment competition notices concerning eligibility and <b>pre-selection</b> <b>tests.</b> A third case was resolved when the Ombudsman compelled the Council to release to the public documents it had previously not acknowledged the existence of.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1989 / Town & Country Hotel & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaA UH- 60 A (Black Hawk) {{full-scale}} {{main rotor}} blade has been instrumented with 242 subminiature pressure transducers placed beneath the blade skin. The instrumented blade will be flight tested on a UH- 60 A helicopter at the AMES Research Center. The pressure transducers are of the sub-miniature silicon full-bridge type with a small diameter tube (. 028 inches OD) leading into the pressure sensing cavity. Fifty of the transducers have built-in temperature monitoring sensors used in correcting the pressure data. The pressure signals and corresponding temperature signals will be processed by PCM Encoders and FM mulitplex systems. This paper describes the following: the <b>pre-selection</b> <b>testing</b> of the pressure transducers which included sensitivity, centrifugal effects, fatigue testing, etc.; the mechanical method of installing the transducers {{as well as the}} wiring installation beneath the {{main rotor blade}} skin surface and the final/periodic calibration of the installed transducers by using a "Vacuum bag" which encompasses the entire main rotor blade...|$|R

During {{the process of}} partner selection, {{there was a time}} delay. The target plan was 4 months but in reality it took 12 months. This research evaluates factors which cause the time delay. One of the causes was the unavailability of pre-selection model. This research <b>test</b> a qualitative <b>pre-selection</b> model using variables of management, availability oftransport choices, value added services, rate profile and quality services, service characteristics and performance measurements. The six variables described into 36 dimensions and indicators. The model tested to 10 pharmaceutical companies with sterile production facility needed for production of meropenem sterile dosage form. Research method used is qualitative descriptive analysis with searching data method through observational study. The data source is secondary data. Based on the research result, timedelay was caused by several factors related to product, procedure, quality and fee. The <b>tested</b> <b>pre-selection</b> model can be used as an alternative solution to avoid future time delay in toll manufacturing partner selection...|$|R
