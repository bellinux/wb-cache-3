2500|$|Dihydrocodeine is {{available}} in Japan as tablets which contain 2.5mg of dihydrocodeine phosphate and caffeine, the decongestant d,l-methylephedrine HCl, and the antihistamine chlorpheniramine, and packets of granules which effervesce like Alka-Seltzer with 10mg of dihydrocodeine with lysozyme and chlorpheniramine, marketed for OTC sale as New Bron Solution-ACE. [...] These two formulations may have once contained <b>phenyltoloxamine</b> citrate as the antihistamine component.|$|E
2500|$|Itching and {{flushing}} {{and other}} effects of blood vessel dilation are also common side-effects, due to histamine release {{in response to}} the drug using one or more types of receptors in the CNS or other responses elsewhere in the body. [...] First-generation antihistamines such as tripelennamine (Pyrabenzamine), clemastine (Tavist), hydroxyzine (Atarax), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cyproheptadine (Periactin), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), chlorphenamine (Chlor-Trimeton), doxylamine (NyQuil) and <b>phenyltoloxamine</b> (Percogesic Original Formula) not only combat the histamine-driven side-effects, but are analgesic-sparing (potentiating) in various degrees. The antihistamine promethazine (Phenergan) may also {{have a positive effect on}} hepatic metabolism of dihydrocodeine as it does with codeine. Higher doses of promethazine may interfere with most other opioids with the exception of the pethidine family (Demerol and the like) by this or other unknown mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|Amongst analgesics {{there are}} {{a small number of}} agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid {{receptor}} system and therefore have none of the other (narcotic) qualities of opioids although they may produce euphoria by relieving pain—a euphoria that, because of the way it is produced, does not form the basis of habituation, physical dependence, or addiction. [...] Foremost amongst these are nefopam, orphenadrine, and perhaps <b>phenyltoloxamine</b> or some other antihistamines. [...] Tricyclic antidepressants have painkilling effect as well, but they're thought to do so by indirectly activating the endogenous opioid system. Paracetamol is predominantly a centrally acting analgesic (non-narcotic) which mediates its effect by action on descending serotoninergic (5-hydroxy triptaminergic) pathways, to increase 5-HT release (which inhibits release of pain mediators). It also decreases cyclo-oxygenase activity. It has recently been discovered that most or all of the therapeutic efficacy of paracetamol is due to a metabolite, AM404, which enhances the release of serotonin and inhibits the uptake of anandamide.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phenyltoloxamine</b> {{combinations}} {{are sold}} under {{wide variety of}} preparations, brand names and dosages around the world: ...|$|E
50|$|Though {{it is rare}} {{in several}} western countries, <b>phenyltoloxamine</b> is widely used on the global scale, {{particularly}} in the developing world.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenyltoloxamine</b> is an {{antihistamine}} with sedative and analgesic effects. It is {{a member}} of the ethanolamine class of antihistaminergic agents and an anticholinergic.|$|E
50|$|For both {{pain and}} coughing, {{thebacon}} {{can be made}} more effective along with NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and/or antihistamines like tripelennamine, hydroxyzine, promethazine, <b>phenyltoloxamine</b> and chlorpheniramine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenyltoloxamine</b> {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{effective}} potentiators of codeine and derivatives such as ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, oxycodone, nicocodeine, hydrocodone and similar drugs like tramadol and propoxyphene for all indications, pain relief and cough suppression in particular.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenyltoloxamine,</b> like {{diphenhydramine}} and doxylamine, is {{an effective}} non-narcotic anti-tussive on its own but tends to be effective only for productive coughs as the anticholinergic action will exacerbate dry, unproductive coughs, so it is often combined with dextromethorphan, codeine, ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, or hydrocodone in cough suppressants both over the counter and prescription.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Phenyltoloxamine</b> {{is widely}} used in {{preparations}} as an enhancing agent for some analgesics and antitussives (acetaminophen, dihydrocodeine, codeine, hydrocodone). It {{is widely used}} {{in certain parts of}} the world as cough suppressant usually with codeine, and sometimes by itself or in addition to dextromethorphan as it, like diphenhydramine, possesses antitussive action of its own and is particularly useful in semi-productive coughs because of its moderate drying action.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also used}} to {{discourage}} abuse in certain opiate analgesics due to its unpleasant side effects at high doses. While therapeutic doses of <b>phenyltoloxamine</b> can generate mild to moderate euphoria as can many of its close chemical relatives, much higher doses have a side effect profile similar to that of atropine, which {{is also used}} in this fashion for tablets of diphenoxylate and morphine for oral administration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenyltoloxamine</b> has {{analgesic}} and anti-spasmodic {{properties of}} its own and is used in combination with paracetamol, aspirin and other salicylates and other drugs in proprietary preparations available over the counter for backache, muscle strains and similar conditions. In this respect, it {{is similar to a}} closely related antihistamine, orphenadrine, and both drugs are very closely related to diphenhydramine and to doxylamine, the latter of which is the active ingredient in NyQuil and many other cough preparations.|$|E
50|$|Side effects include {{dry mouth}} and throat, eye pain, blurred vision, restlessness, dizziness, arrhythmia, flushing, and faintness. An {{overdose}} will cause headache, nausea, vomiting, and {{central nervous system}} symptoms including disorientation, hallucinations, euphoria, sexual arousal, short-term memory loss, and possible coma in extreme cases. The euphoric and sexual effects are stronger than those of atropine but weaker than those of scopolamine, as well as dicycloverine, orphenadrine, cyclobenzaprine, trihexyphenidyl, and ethanolamine antihistamines like <b>phenyltoloxamine.</b> It can also act as a diuretic.|$|E
50|$|Scopolamine {{was also}} one of the active {{ingredients}} in Asthmador, an over-the-counter (OTC) smoking preparation marketed in the 1950s and 1960s claiming to combat asthma and bronchitis. In November 1990, the US Food and Drug Administration forced OTC products with scopolamine and several hundred other ingredients that had allegedly not been proved effective off the market. Scopolamine shared a small segment of the OTC sleeping pill market with diphenhydramine, <b>phenyltoloxamine,</b> pyrilamine, doxylamine, and other first-generation antihistamines, many of which are still used for this purpose in drugs such as Sominex, Tylenol PM, NyQuil, etc.|$|E

40|$|OCT 2 is {{the entry}} step for organic cation {{secretion}} by renal proximal tubules. Although many drugs inhibit OCT 2 activity, neither the mechanistic {{basis of their}} inhibition nor their transport status is generally known. Using representatives of several structural classes of OCT 2 inhibitory ligands described by Kido et al, we determined the kinetic basis of their inhibition of 1 -methyl- 4 - phenylpyridinium (MPP) transport into CHO cells that stably expressed hOCT 2. The 'Cluster II' inhibitors, metformin and cimetidine, interacted competitively with MPP. However, other Cluster II compounds, including tetraethylammonium (TEA), diphenidol and <b>phenyltoloxamine,</b> were mixed-type inhibitors of MPP transport. Cluster III representative, adrenosterone, and Cluster I representative, carvedilol, displayed noncompetitive inhibitory profiles. Competitive Counterflow (CCF) {{was used to determine}} if the inhibitory ligands served as substrates of hOCT 2. Carvedilol and adrenosterone did not support CCF, consistent with the prediction that members of these structural classes are likely to be nontransported inhibitors of OCT 2. Cluster II representatives MPP, metformin, cimetidine and TEA all supported CCF, consistent with independent assessments of their OCT 2 -mediated transport. Other Cluster II representatives, diphenidol and <b>phenyltoloxamine,</b> failed to support CCF, suggesting that neither compound is transported by OCT 2. The results underscore the caution required for development of predictive models of ligand interaction with multidrug transporters...|$|E
