50|$|Typical uses of PSO include {{regional}} airline {{services in}} districts of {{for instance in}} Northern Norway or Ireland, where the airlines serve marginally populated areas not profitable for the carriers without subsidies. Rail services can be unprofitable even on major routes, and government subsidies are sometimes offered through PSO on unprofitable routes, for instance this has been very popular in Germany. Most cities subsidize their public transport, and in places where the transport is provided by private companies, that may be awarded through PSO. Other common <b>PSO</b> <b>services</b> are ferries, such as the routes to Gotland in Sweden, or car ferries on the road network of Norway. Ferry routes serving outlying islands in Hong Kong are also subsidised since recently, {{as a result of}} rising oil price and therefore the costs of operations.|$|E

30|$|Nevertheless {{the public}} {{transport}} system {{needs to be}} upgraded in quality terms as {{the average age of}} buses and trains are still too high, and there are several unresolved issues in the solid financing of operator companies. The non-efficient overlapping <b>PSO</b> (Public <b>Service</b> Obligation) services of the trains and buses should be harmonized by securing fast, comfortable and reliable connections and common integrated ticketing. Part of the measures are taking place now in forms of new intermodal transport hub buildings at certain bigger cities around Hungary, but the economic interests of the different (curiously nearly always state-owned) projects largely slow down the realization of a transparent, electronic integrated ticketing system, which would be favorable for the taxpayers.|$|R
50|$|To guide local {{authorities}} in implementing eGovernment, the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (and its successor the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)) issued {{a list of}} key targets, most {{commonly referred to as}} the Priority Outcomes or <b>PSOs</b> (Priority <b>Service</b> Outcomes). The list was issued in the snappily entitled document Defining E-government Outcomes for 2005 to Support the Delivery of Priority Services & National Strategy Transformation Agenda for Local Authorities in England - Version 1.0.In September 2004, detailed guidance on the Priority Outcomes was issued in the document Priority Outcomes - Explanatory Notes for Practitioners, published by the IDeA (Improvement and Development Agency) and endorsed by the ODPM.|$|R

However, a reprieve was granted due to protest over the change of airport and loss of local jobs and the tender was withdrawn. Aer Arann Islands will continue services until at least February 2016, pending a revised tender launch.|$|R
40|$|The {{interconnected}} {{world has}} simplified {{several aspects of}} a processing system. The best of them being component reuse. Software components written by professionals can be reused in a system to incorporate required functionalities. Web services are such components facilitating reuse. However, due to the huge number of web services available in the repository, the process of selecting an appropriate service for the current requirement becomes challenging. The selection requirements do not demand best services, instead, they require optimal services. This paper presents a metaheuristic based solution for service selection and <b>service</b> optimization. Modified <b>PSO</b> {{is used for the}} selection and orchestration process. PSO is discretized and incorporated with catfish particles to eliminate the problem of local optima.

40|$|Public <b>Service</b> Obligation (<b>PSO)</b> is government's {{obligation}} to provide affordable price and to optimize service in typicaly economy class of urban railway commuting. It is therefore important to evaluate its technical and service effectiveness. This article aims {{to assess the}} effectiveness of <b>PSO</b> railway <b>services</b> in economy class of urban railway, {{in accordance with the}} initial goals of PSO implementation. Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) tool, technical effectiveness analysis is carried out by comparing the input (operating expenses, number of facilities, and amount of PSO) and output (and revenue passenger kilometers). Services Effectiveness is aimed to determine the effectiveness of service of two inputs that are train kilometers and kilometer of seats by comparing the 2 output namely kilometers passengers and revenue. The results show that only 4 out of 12 DMU have maximum level of technical effectiveness, and   only 3 out of 12 DMUs are having effective service...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Web {{services}} {{model has}} emerged as a standard for representation, discovery, and invocation of services in a distributed environment. During service composition, Selection of appropriate services for composition is the chief task. A series of tasks are tied together to form a composite web service. Such composition is a challenging task because a number of Web services with the same or similar functions are increasing rapidly. QoS plays a vital role in the problem of selecting the most appropriate web service for composition. It is a measure for how well the composite web service serves the requester. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Gravitational Search Algorithm can be used to resolve this problem of optimal service selection. To compose individual web services dynamically according to users ‟ requirements in functional aspects as well as in non-functional preferences. In order to meet the QoS requirements of consumers, this paper presents the QoS calculation of non-functional requirements such as cost, availability, reliability and execution time. To verify the effectiveness in latency of Web Services selection the above two algorithms are compared. Results indicate the Gravitational Search Algorithm improves the latency over the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Keywords: <b>PSO,</b> GSA, <b>Service</b> Selection. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel computation model for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based on process algebras, {{which consists of}} some additional primitives, such as beam channel, logic parallels, logic choices, cost, cost choices and so forth. In this calculus, everything is a cost expression including {{the cost of a}} expression, the choice of expressions, or even the search procedure of PSO itself. As an instance of the applications using discrete <b>PSO,</b> QoS-aware web <b>service</b> selection can be modeled naturally in this calculus and the algebraic and physical representation of the solution is imported to guideline the design of discrete scheme of PSO. In the experiments in simulation platform, the results show that the proposed approach can effectively formalize the QoS-aware web service composition in both algebraic and physical perspectives, and also generate the well-scrutinized service in accordance with the high QoS cost requirements in the acceptable time...|$|R
40|$|Public aid is {{the kind}} of {{advantage}} granted directly or indirectly for private companies from State resources. The European Commission prerogative to control the transfer of public resources by the public authorities (national or local) for the benefit of private undertakings, as a general rule, there is an obligation of notification, as provided for in article 108 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It should be noted in the beginning that State aid given to undertakings conducting economic activity is, in principle, incompatible with the European Union’ law, as provided for in article. 107 (1) of the TFEU. There are certain situations that the granting of public funds will not constitute “public aid” within the meaning of article 107 of the TFEU and, therefore, will not violate European rules in this field. One of them are activities related to the exercise of the prerogatives of the public authority (security, safety, customs, air traffic control). The other is related to the exercise of services in general economic interest. This could be an example of public <b>service</b> obligation (<b>PSO).</b> This <b>service</b> can be applied {{in the light of the}} provisions of European law on two types of action on air routes, and on airport managing body. The imposition of a PSO to the specified route is the support given by the State to the outermost regions that due to their unfavourable geographical position cannot fully develop economically, and no carrier had not been interested in performing air services to that region due to the lack of cost effectiveness. Some activities at the airport may be considered as activities of general economic interest...|$|R
40|$|For a multi-resource {{service request}} task (MRSRTask) in {{manufacturing}} grid (MGrid) system, {{in addition to}} the search for all qualified resource services according to each subtask, the system selects one candidate resource service for each subtask. Then the system generates a new composite resource service (CRS) and selects the optimal resource service composite path from all possible paths to execute the task with the given multi-objective (e. g., time minimization, cost minimization and reliability maximization) and multi-constraints. The above problem is defined as multi-objective MGrid resource service composition and optimal-selection (MO-MRSCOS) problem. The formulation is presented for an MO-MRSCOS problem. The correlations among resource services are taken into account during MGrid resource service composition, and a QoS description mode supporting resource service correlation is presented. The basic resource service composite modes (RSCM) for CRS are described, and the principles for translating a complicated RSCM into a simple sequence RSCM are presented for simplifying the resolving process and complexity of MO-MRSCOS problem. A new method based on the principles of particle swarm optimization (PSO), is proposed for solving MO-MRSCOS problem. Unlike previous works: (a) the proposed PSO algorithms combine the non-dominated sorting technique to achieve the selection of global best position and private best position; (b) the parameters of particle updating formulation in PSO are dynamical generated {{in order to make a}} compromise between the global exploration and local exploitation abilities of PSO; (c) permutation-based and objective-based population trimming operators are applied in PSO to maintain diversity of solutions in population. The experimental results and performance comparison show that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.
