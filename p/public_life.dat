In so doing the article will focus on the Committee on Standards in <b>Public</b> <b>Life’s</b> latest report (2005), which revisits the ethical framework in local government, and assess how it perceives the impact of its earlier recommendations...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{structural}} transformation of <b>public</b> musical <b>life</b> in Stockholm {{during the period}} 1840 – 1890, with focus primarily on the classical musical sphere. The study is based on qualitative and quantitative analysis {{of a number of}} different sources such as newspapers, music magazines, offprints, and other archival material. Using Jürgen Habermas’s theory of structural transformation of the public sphere as a starting point, the thesis aims to elucidate the processes within the structural transformation of Stockholm’s <b>public</b> musical <b>life.</b> In particular, this study examines processes of institutionalisation and professionalisation within four main areas of public musical life: the music press market, concert life, performers, and audiences. The actions of individuals and institutions are also studied in order to highlight the priorities and proclivities underlying the identified changes to <b>public</b> musical <b>life.</b> The period in question saw the transition of concert life from representational culture to the bourgeois public sphere, as well as the gradual division between ‘classical’ and ‘popular’ musical spheres. The study shows that <b>public</b> musical <b>life</b> emerged and expanded within the bourgeois public sphere. Therefore, the ideas and demands of the bourgeoisie were crucial to structural transformation of Stockholm’s <b>public</b> musical <b>life.</b> The old Royal institutions still constituted the core of the <b>public</b> musical <b>life</b> but were adapted to the new bourgeois society. The process of institutionalisation within the musical life was characterized by organisational functions, but also by social institutionalisation of practices within the four main areas mentioned above. The bourgeois ideas of musical Bildung {{played a significant role in}} the processes of institutionalisation and professionalization, as it illuminates the priorities and proclivities underlying this process. Several aspects of this development are related to influences from early nineteenth-century musical idealism. The structural transformation of <b>public</b> musical <b>life</b> in Stockholm during the period 1840 – 1890 laid the foundation for the further developments in the 20 th century, and its impact is in some respects evident still today...|$|R

It is {{the view of the}} author that a keen grasp and application of the various frameworks, as well as their various components, could project their viewing and that of their components, not in isolation, but in an interconnected and intertwined manner. This could enhance the clarification of ethical and moral alternatives, as well as facilitate the spreading and diffusion of techniques for ethical reasoning and moral awareness, throughout <b>public</b> service <b>life...</b>|$|R

500|$|Nicholas Fraser {{writes that}} Evita {{is the perfect}} popular culture icon for our times because her career foreshadowed what, by the late 20th century, had become common.

But by the late 20th century, Fraser claims, the public had become engrossed in the cult of celebrity and <b>public</b> political <b>life</b> had become insignificant. In this regard, Evita was perhaps ahead of her time. Fraser also writes that Evita's story is appealing to our celebrity-obsessed age because her story confirms one of Hollywood's oldest clichés, the rags to riches story.
