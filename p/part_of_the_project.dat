5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the 42nd Street Shuttle {{will become}} ADA accessible, and the shuttle will be reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains will become six cars long. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would be installed from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, a new control area would be installed {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The cost of this <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for a study that would develop the requirements for a second program to automate the shuttle. The cost of this <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Second Avenue Subway resumed construction.

5|$|An English fan {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications, which had to be approved for them to become <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most fan translation projects letting anyone help if they want, but said that it made the project more professional. A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E
5|$|As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> ML Pin made {{preparations}} for the founding of Chiang Mai University, planning the campus and beginning construction, but the authority over the project was ultimately transferred to the Office of the Educational Council. He served three terms as President of Silpakorn University from 1965 to 1971, during which he founded the university's Sanam Chandra Palace Campus. There he intended to established a collegiate university system following that used at Oxford, as advised when he was Permanent Secretary of Education by Prime Minister Pibulsonggram, and Thap Kaew College was opened in 1968. However, the college system {{turned out to be}} unsuccessful, lacking support from both the student body and the government, and was dissolved.|$|E
5|$|As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} {{from two to}} three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new diamond interchange was constructed with Dunreath Drive {{to provide access to}} the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to the precinct. International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond interchange with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing interchange in the future.|$|E

40|$|Today most Software Development Companies use Agile Project Management {{to manage}} their <b>project,</b> here <b>the</b> {{decisions}} are made as <b>the</b> <b>project</b> progresses to keep the agility in <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> This has been a successful transition {{with a lot of}} benefits, but many agree that estimation remains a great area <b>of</b> concern. <b>The</b> most important reasons for this are <b>the</b> unknown <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> that make it hard to calculate accurate estimates. Many teams are unable to deliver what they have committed to, because their estimates are often way off. This results in large project overruns, which prevent the organizations from reaching the market early enough and can result in bad market performance. In this thesis, <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> estimation in Software Development Projects is discussed. Interviews with experienced project managers where held to find out how theory coincides with the Software Development Industry, Also, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main goals <b>of</b> these interviews were {{to find out more about}} how estimates in Software Development Projects are created within the industry today, and how necessary it is to have accurate estimates or estimates at all, for project managers. This thesis shows that there are a lot of benefits and often necessary to have good estimates. The thesis also shows that it is important to have early specification <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> where <b>the</b> decisions about the software should be made as early as possible to create the most accurate estimates. But only <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> which are soon going into development must be heavily specified, otherwise agility will be lost. For less specified <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> rough estimates should be enough to make the right decisions...|$|R

5|$|In 1939, {{the group}} E Clampus Vitus {{commissioned}} and dedicated a plaque commemorating Emperor Norton's {{call for the}} construction of a suspension bridge between San Francisco and Oakland, via Yerba Buena Island (formerly Goat Island). The group's intention was that the plaque be placed on the newly opened San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge itself. This was not approved by the bridge authorities, however; and, sometime shortly after World War II, the plaque was installed at the Cliff House. In the 1990s, the plaque was moved to the Transbay Terminal. When the Terminal was closed and demolished in 2010, as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> to construct a new Transbay Transit Center, the plaque was placed in storage, where it remains.|$|E

The portion of Broad Street between Allen and Main Streets was closed to all traffic in February and was originally scheduled to open on October30. It finally reopened to traffic on December3.|$|E
5|$|Massive {{resources}} {{were required to}} construct Castle Rising, which included three baileys with large earthwork defences and a stone keep, with an adjacent deer park just behind the castle. As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> the existing settlement was moved away to the north, where it became a planned settlement adjacent to the new castle. A pre-existing Norman chapel on the site, built around 1100, was encircled by the castle defences, and the new parish church of St Lawrence {{was built in the}} town instead, although it is possible that this church also pre-dates the castle. William received permission from King Stephen to open a mint at the castle in 1145 and, probably linked to this development, settled a community of Jews in the town.|$|E

There would also be a rebuilding the Jamaica station so that there is a direct connection to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed start date for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for master plans to renovate the airport.|$|E
