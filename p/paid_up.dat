The Department of Public Works and Highways <b>paid</b> <b>up</b> to 60% of the construction and maintenance costs for these roads, while the counties were responsible for the remaining 40%. In 1919, the federal government passed the Canada Highways Act, which provided $20,000,000 to provinces under the condition that they establish an official highway network; up to 40% of construction costs would be subsidized. The first network plan was approved on February26, 1920, and included the Talbot Road. The majority of what would soon become Highway3 was designated several months later in August.|$|E

The first two options would limit eligible interest to the amount <b>paid</b> on <b>up</b> to $ 500, 000 of an eligible mortgage. The report also considers options that phase out the mortgage interest deduction and phase in the new credits over five years...|$|R

After losing a season to a labour dispute in 2005, the League's TV audience was slower to rebound because of American cable broadcaster ESPN's decision to drop the sport. The league's post-lockout agreement with NBC gave the league a share of revenue from each game's advertising sales, rather than the usual lump sum <b>paid</b> <b>up</b> front for game rights.

25|$|The {{investigation}} of Spitzer was reportedly initiated after North Fork Bank reported suspicious transactions to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network {{as required by}} the Bank Secrecy Act, which was enhanced by Patriot Act provisions, enacted to combat terrorist activity such as money-laundering. Spitzer reportedly had at least seven liaisons with prostitutes from the agency over six months, and paid more than $15,000 for their services.

25|$|With {{no income}} {{and outside of}} the law, Giuliano turned to banditry, and later {{extortion}} and kidnapping. His exclusive target was the wealthy, partly from identification with poor peasants, but mostly for efficiency—the rich had more money. Thanks to Sicily's omerta tradition, local peasants were reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement, and Giuliano made them his allies and effective co-conspirators. Throughout his career he <b>paid</b> <b>up</b> to ten times the going market rate for his supplies to the locals. They became good sources of intelligence about rich targets for his crimes, as well as law enforcement activity. While Giuliano's core band was never larger than 20 men, peasants from Montelepre and nearby Giardinello would join him in the mountains temporarily for the excellent pay the bandit offered. This pattern continued until the last few beleaguered months of Giuliano's career.|$|E

25|$|On March 10, 2008, The New York Times {{reported}} that Spitzer had patronized a high-priced escort service called Emperors Club VIP and met {{for two hours}} with a $1,000-an-hour call girl. This information originally {{came to the attention}} of authorities from a federal wiretap. During a six month span, Spitzer had at least seven or eight liaisons with women from the agency and paid more than $15,000. According to published reports, investigators alleged that Spitzer <b>paid</b> <b>up</b> to $80,000 for prostitutes over a period of several years while he was attorney general, and later as governor. Spitzer first drew the attention of federal investigators when his bank reported suspicious money transfers under the anti-money laundering provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. The resulting investigation was triggered by the belief that Spitzer might have been hiding bribe proceeds and led to the discovery of the prostitution ring.|$|E
25|$|He also {{suffered}} a form slump in Tests, {{but that was}} not quite as brutal, and he was never dropped from the Test team. Despite recording eight single-figure scores between the 1982–83 tour of New Zealand {{and the end of the}} 1983–84, but that period also included three Test fifties. On one of those occasions, at Wellington, he carried his bat through the Sri Lankan innings. And he <b>paid</b> <b>up</b> for his lean streak with his second Test century on the 1984 tour of England. Batting for eleven hours in a match frequently interrupted by rain, he eked out 190, which gave Sri Lanka a 121-run first innings lead. However, that had taken four days to achieve, and Sri Lanka opted to bat out the fifth day for a draw. Wettimuny only made 13 in the second innings, but he had set a new Sri Lankan record highest score, which stood until Brendon Kuruppu passed it with Sri Lanka's first Test double century in a 1986–87 Test against New Zealand. The 190 also made an imprint in the minds of English cricket fans, as he was made Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1985, the first Sri Lankan to be thus honoured, and only the fifth Sri Lankan to date. In fact, he became the first Sri Lankan to score a test century at Lord's Cricket Ground.|$|E
