40|$|Positive Youth Development (PYD) {{comprises}} three interrelated aspects: (1) {{a developmental}} process, (2) {{an approach to}} youth programmes, and (3) specific instances of organisations or youth programmes that aim to promote positive or healthy development among adolescents. New Zealand has committed to a PYD approach to youth development; however, there {{is yet to be}} any research exploring the implementation of PYD in New Zealand youth programmes. The present study explored the application of PYD in 24 - 7 YouthWork, a nationally implemented New Zealand youth development programme. More specifically, the objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate whether a PYD approach is reflected in the 24 - 7 Youth Work programme; (2) examine if stakeholders in different roles within 24 - 7 and across different schools concur about the PYD programme components that 24 - 7 is promoting; and (3) explore additional strengths and potential challenges that 24 - 7 Youth Work has that are outside of the PYD framework. An in-depth review of the key PYD theoretical and applied literature was conducted to establish an integrated PYD <b>programme</b> <b>framework.</b> Using Deductive Qualitative Analysis (DQA), this PYD <b>programme</b> <b>framework</b> was then applied in an evaluation of three Christchurch-based 24 - 7 YouthWork programmes. Nine participants (3 from each programme) representing three important roles in the 24 - 7 programme (former participant, youth worker, and school professional) were interviewed about their experiences with 24 - 7 YouthWork and their perceptions of the programme’s objectives, accomplishments, and challenges. Substantive individual differences in participants’ perceptions of the facilitation of PYD through 24 - 7 were evident. However, the results strongly confirmed that 24 - 7 facilitates a number of outcomes of positive development through the assets associated with the youth workers, the promotion of positive adult-youth relationships, incorporating resources from the school and the community, opportunities for life skill development, and creating opportunities for self-determination or youth empowerment. The findings suggest that this approach is a feasible alternative when experimental evaluation approaches are not practical due to the variability commonly present in youth development programmes. Overall, the current study has contributed to best-practice youth development in New Zealand, as evidenced by the identification of a distinct PYD approach in 24 - 7 YouthWork. Further, this research has provided a platform for future research in this area, to use this integrated PYD <b>programme</b> <b>framework</b> in the evaluation of other youth development programmes...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2003 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} how foundation phase educators in the North West Province facilitate learning in Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) classrooms. In essence the study looked into the manner and extent to which the educators implement OBE as envisaged in South Africa. The nature of the research question led to the study following a qualitative research paradigm. Observation and interviews were used to collect data in an explanatory approach. The classroom observations were done by means of a schedule produced through literature review. The interviews were conducted in a one-to-one basis following each classroom observation, and were used to clarify any matters picked up from the observations. Two standard questions, what role do parents play in teaching and learning in your classroom? plus what do you use assessment for? were asked in every interview. In addition, any other question was asked flowing from the responses as well as matters and/or actions/behaviour picked up from the observation. The study culminated on recommendation for In-service Education and Training (INSET) <b>programme</b> <b>framework.</b> The findings of this study revealed that the educators, who participated,. although labelled the best in their cohort, were far from performing as expected. It was clear that although they tried their best to implement as directed, they need thorough training to do it right. Most of these educators have some insight of the theory of OBE but lack the skill to implement in their classrooms. For instance, although all of them indicated that assessment is an integral part of teaching in OBE, in practice it was not. These findings may be summarised by saying that the educators who participated 1 need to be retrained to implement OBE. Also, if the subject advisors who chose the participants were right in labelling them best within their cohort, then the challenge is even bigger for OBE to succeed. As such, the INSET <b>programme</b> <b>framework</b> suggested in this study, would contribute a great deal towards retraining. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|In broadcast, {{message is}} the {{penultimate}} product, and language {{is one of}} the medium that carries meanings across to the audience. Therefore, a broadcaster uses language as his tool of trade, strategising to maximise the impact of his message. However, different forms of broadcast programmes have different framework, and calls for different types of talk strategies. This paper poses an approach towards defining language use in broadcast; one that looks at the generic construct behind the types of broadcast programmes, the content and talk goals. Derived from an eclectic mix of three different models of defining talk programmes, this paper attempts to describe the talk strategies of a talk programme produced in English by a television station in Malaysia, TV.
