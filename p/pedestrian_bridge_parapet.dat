40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} study of a high strength, light weight and durable glass fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (GFRP) composite material that was used in a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> in Tai-Jiang National Park, Taiwan. In order to better understand the carbon footprint and carbon reduction of GFRP <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge,</b> the evaluated carbon footprint of the superstructure of the GFRP <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> is compared with those of traditional construction materials, such as reinforced concrete (RC) and steel. The evaluation includes material production stage, transportation stage and construction stage of the carbon emission of GFRP <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge.</b> From the calculated carbon emission results, it is found that the GFRP <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> reduced total carbon emission about 43 % compared to an RC <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> and up to 19 % compared to a steel <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1998 the John Seigenthaler <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>Bridge</b> was {{admitted}} to the National Register of Historic Places, due mainly to the unique truss design.

The Jefferson Street Bridge was rejected because of its similarity to the John Seigenthaler <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{and the fact that the}} John Seigenthaler <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>Bridge</b> was in better condition.

40|$|Proceedingsof the International Journal of Arts and Sciences (IJAS) Conference, University of London Union, London, UK, November 5 - 8, 2013 In the city, the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> is {{normally}} {{a form of}} infrastructure designed to segregate pedestrians from vehicular traffic. However, in many places <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> have become urban stages on which vibrant communal life unfolds. Hong Kong, known as Asia’s world city, has a landmass of 1, 104 km 2 and a population of seven million people, {{and is one of}} the most densely populated cities in the world. <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> have been widely used in Hong Kong since the 1960 s due to rapid development of the economy and the population. By 2008, there were 693 <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> in Hong Kong, all of which play a critical role in people’s everyday urban life. Using case studies of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> in Hong Kong, this paper presents an empirical study that examines the changing role of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> in the city. By observing people’s everyday activities and their tactical uses of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges,</b> the study investigates and summarises the diverse roles of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> in Hong Kong. The discussion and findings should provide inspiration for public place making and public infrastructure design and management. School of DesignRefereed conference pape...|$|R

500|$|An {{additional}} part of {{the highway}} improvement plan were three <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges,</b> located at 6th, 40th and 44th Streets. [...] The three bridges were replacements for bridges which were too narrow to accommodate the newly widened highway. These highly visible bridges act as icons, locating the neighborhoods for travelers along the freeway. The design of the I-235 <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> was completed by Boston-based bridge designer Miguel Rosales in collaboration with HNTB Engineering. The three bridges, the Edna M.

More than 30 % of all car accidents in Jordan involve pedestrians, a percentage considered very high compared to other countries such as the UK and USA. The main objectives of this study are to collect data, analyze, and evaluate the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> and <b>pedestrian</b> safety in the greater Amman area. In addition, to develop regression prediction models that relate the percentage use of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> with possible factors that affecting the use of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges.</b> A sample of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> and tunnels were chosen for this study. Detailed data were collected from the location of each <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge.</b> The collected data was analyzed and used in forming the regression models. Several regression prediction models were formed and the best models were chosen. Also, a questionnaire survey was prepared and distributed to a random sample of pedestrians at the selected locations. Also, personal one-to-one interviews were conducted to collect more data from a random sample of pedestrian on the selected sites in order to study the pedestrian behavior and attitude in the area of a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge.</b> It was concluded that <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> have a positive impact and have great potential of reducing number of pedestrian fatalities. The main factors that affecting the use of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> are: the posted speed limit, the overall width of the cross walkway, and the existence of median barrier...|$|R

40|$|The {{study on}} The {{effectiveness}} of <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>Bridge</b> Utilization {{is to determine}} the factors that effecting the usage of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge.</b> The effectiveness of the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> is depends on amount of use by pedestrian. However, they are costly and may not be used by pedestrian if not planned properly. The use rate of two <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridges</b> was observed in the Jalan Lin Chen Mei, Sitiawan, Perak and Lebuhraya Tun Razak, Kuantan, Pahang. Three set of the data has been collected at two different location of pedestrian bridge; traffic volume survey, pedestrian volume survey and pedestrian interview survey. Volume of traffics and pedestrian crossing the roads are recorded by manual and electronically by using video camera. A survey was conducted among <b>pedestrians</b> using those <b>bridges</b> and crossing at street level. The study from data analysis has shown that the usage rate of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> is linearly proportionate with the traffic volume. In the present database, the frequent use of the bridge when crossing the road concerned, and seeing bridge use as time saving and safe in general were positively related to respondents' bridge use. In addition, the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> designs, signboards, fences, and speed of vehicle which leads to the pedestrian's comfort and safety, also play some important roles on the effectiveness of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>bridge</b> utilization. The finding from this study, there are various measures to increase the pedestrian's bridge use. Addition the site study area should be done to get the good result...|$|R
