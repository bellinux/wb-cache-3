40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} the molecular {{mechanisms by which}} catecholamine synthesis is controlled in <b>pheochromocytomas</b> – tumors that synthesize and release catecholamines, which are related to various clinical manifestations of the condition. Methods: We measured the concentrations of mRNA coding for the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine b-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase (PNMT) and for the catecholamine contents in 12 <b>pheochromocytomas</b> and 12 normal adrenal medullas. Results: The mean content of total catecholamine and the b-actin mRNA expression in the <b>pheochromocytomas</b> were almost {{the same as those}} in the normal adrenal medullas. However, the tyrosine hydroxylase, AADC and DBH mRNA concentrations in the <b>pheochromocytomas</b> were greater than those of the normal adrenal medullas. Conversely, the PNMT mRNA concentration in the <b>pheochromocytomas</b> was lower than that in the normal adrenal medullas. These differences are responsible for the difference in the proportions of catecholamines between <b>pheochromocytomas</b> and normal adrenal medullas. The constitutive expression of the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme mRNAs varied in magnitude among the <b>pheochromocytomas,</b> and the tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expressions correlated with the contents of total catecholamine in the tumors (r= 0. 964, P< 0. 0001). Conclusions: These findings indicate that catecholamine production in <b>pheochromocytomas</b> is pri-marily controlled by the level of gene expression.

25|$|Increased {{epinephrine}} secretion {{is observed}} in <b>pheochromocytoma,</b> hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction {{and to a}} lesser degree in benign essential familial tremor. A general increase in sympathetic neural activity is usually accompanied by increased adrenaline secretion, but there is selectivity during hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, when the ratio of adrenaline to noradrenaline is considerably increased.

25|$|Epinephrine may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma or serum as a diagnostic aid, to monitor therapeutic administration, or {{to identify the}} causative agent in a potential poisoning victim. Endogenous plasma epinephrine concentrations in resting adults are normally less than 10ng/L, but may increase by 10-fold during exercise and by 50-fold or more during times of stress. <b>Pheochromocytoma</b> patients often have plasma adrenaline levels of 1000–10,000ng/L.

40|$|Objectives: In adults, {{increasing}} numbers of adrenalectomies for <b>pheochromocytomas</b> are performed laparoscopically. We report {{for the first time}} laparoscopic bilateral subtotal adrenalectomy for <b>pheochromocytomas</b> in an 8 -year-old boy with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Methods, In July 1998, an 8 -year-old boy with von Hippel-Lindau disease underwent laparoscopic adrenal-sparing surgery for bilateral <b>pheochromocytomas.</b> The boy presented with severe hypertension and two <b>pheochromocytomas</b> on both sides. Results: The child could be solely treated with laparoscopic adrenal-sparing surgery. The procedure was completed as planned. There were absolutely no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Postoperatively, catecholamine levels and hypertension went back to normal. At follow-up no residual tumor could be detected and no steroid replacement therapy was necessary. Conclusions: In experienced hands, laparoscopic adrenal-sparing surgery for <b>pheochromocytomas</b> is feasible and safe. Moreover, this minimal invasive approach represents an exceptional improvement in life quality, especially in children with von Hippel-Lindau disease since surgery will probably be necessary again and again in their future life.

25|$|Mutations (DNA changes) in the RET proto-oncogene, {{located on}} {{chromosome}} 10, {{lead to the}} expression of a mutated receptor tyrosine kinase protein, termed RET (REarranged during Transfection). RET is involved in the regulation of cell growth and development and its germline mutation is responsible for nearly all cases of hereditary or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Its germline mutation may also be responsible for the development of hyperparathyroidism and <b>pheochromocytoma.</b> Hereditary medullary thyroid cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that each child of an affected parent has a 50% probability of inheriting the mutant RET proto-oncogene from the affected parent. DNA analysis makes it possible to identify children who carry the mutant gene; surgical removal of the thyroid in children who carry the mutant gene is curative if the entire thyroid gland is removed at an early age, before there is spread of the tumor. The parathyroid tumors and pheochromocytomas are removed when they cause clinical symptomatology. Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) accounts for approximately 25% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas.|$|E
30|$|<b>Pheochromocytomas</b> are rare, catecholamine-producing, neuroendocrine tumors {{originating}} from the adrenal medulla or from chromaffin {{cells in the}} sympathetic ganglia.

Surgical resection under general anesthesia is the only curative treatment [1]. Both anesthesia and surgery are stimuli that elicit a catecholaminergic crisis, and preanesthetic preparation and intraoperative management of hemodynamic conditions are required. Although various anesthetics {{have been used for}} surgery of <b>pheochromocytomas,</b> there has been no preoperative and intraoperative management that can totally prevent hemodynamic fluctuations [2].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Pheochromocytomas</b> are {{uncommon}} tumours {{arising from}} chromaffin {{cells of the}} adrenal medulla and related paraganglia. So far, {{one of the few}} reported markers to discriminate malignant from benign tumours is the betaB-subunit of inhibin and activin, members of the transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta superfamily of growth and differentiation factors. DESIGN: We investigated the expression of the mRNAs coding for activin and inhibin subunits, their receptors and binding proteins by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and studied the presence of the inhibin betaB-subunit in human <b>pheochromocytomas</b> by immunohistochemistry. PATIENTS: Samples from resected <b>pheochromocytomas</b> of patients operated between 1973 and 2003 were used for experiments. RESULTS: The immunohistochemical investigations revealed that staining of the inhibin betaB-subunit was positive in 12 of 36 (33 %) benign and 5 of 34 (15 %) malignant <b>pheochromocytomas</b> (P > 0. 05). Therefore, {{it was not possible to}} discriminate between benign and malignant tumours solely on the basis of inhibin betaB-subunit immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR in nine benign and four malignant tumours showed expression of inhibin alpha-, betaA- and betaB-subunits, the activin receptors Alk- 4, ActRIIA, and ActRIIB, and the inhibin- and activin-binding proteins betaglycan and follistatin in all samples. No correlations were detected between individually coupled expression of mRNAs of these activin- and inhibin-related genes in the 13 <b>pheochromocytomas.</b> Only inhibin betaA-subunit expression was different in malignant compared to benign <b>pheochromocytomas</b> (P = 0. 020).

Malignant <b>pheochromocytomas</b> presented a low grade of pleomorphism, higher rate of mitoses, necrosis, infiltrative growth and in 1 case metastases in the lung. Ganglioneuromas were characterized by ganglion and neuron-like cells embedded in an eosinophilic matrix containing neurites, Schwann cells, and scant fibrovascular elements. All <b>pheochromocytomas</b> were strongly immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. Subpopulations of chromaffin cells expressed chromogranin A (CGA) positivity. Matrix and Schwann cells were positive for S- 100 and for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In focal areas of the tumors, ganglion cells and axons were positive for neurofilament proteins (NFP) and synaptophysin. Ganglion cells exhibited peripherin and ß-tubulin. Proliferative activity of the tumors was assessed by immunostaining the endogenous cell proliferation associated-antigen Ki- 67 and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). As expected, cell proliferation indeces were much higher in malignant <b>pheochromocytomas</b> than in benign, yet ganglioneuromas remained immuno-negative.
