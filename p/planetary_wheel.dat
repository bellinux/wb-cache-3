40|$|Abstract. To {{introduce}} {{a new type of}} electric power steering system, the structure and working principle of the system were introduced, and the models of the car, the tire and the steering system were established. The assist characteristic of the power steering and the ideal steering ratio were also designed and optimized. At last, the simulation tests were carried out. The double <b>planetary</b> <b>wheel</b> mechanism is the most important component of the system. With this mechanism, the system synthesizes the force or motion from the steering wheel and the motor. So the power steering and a small steering ratio can be provided at a low speed, and the steering ratio can be changed initiatively at a medium or high speed. Whatâ€™s more, the steering ability still exists when there is a fault in the system. The simulation results show this steering system can effectively improve the steering portability, low-speed sensitivity, and the vehicle handling stability...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the development of a volumetric wheel-soil ground contact model that is suitable for mobile robotics applications with a focus on efficient simulations of <b>planetary</b> rover <b>wheels</b> operating on compliant and irregular terrains. To model the interaction between a rover wheel and soft soil for use in multibody dynamic simualtions, the terrain material is commonly represented by a soil continuum that deforms substantially when in contact with the locomotion system of the rover. Due to this extensive deformation and the large size of the contact patch, a distributed representation of the contact forces is necessary. This requires time-consuming integration processes to solve for the contact forces and moments during simulation. In this work, a novel approach is used to represent these contact reactions based on the properties of the hypervolume of penetration, which is defined by the intersection of the wheel and the terrain. This approach is based on a foundation of springs for which the normal contact force can be calculated by integrating the spring deflections over the contact patch. In the case of an elastic foundation, this integration results in a linear relationship between the normal force and the penetration volume, with the foundation stiffness as the proportionality factor. However, due to the highly nonlinear material properties of the soft terrain, a hyperelastic foundation has to be considered and the normal contact force becomes proportional to a volume with a fractional dimension [...] - a hypervolume. The continuous soil models commonly used in terramechanics simulations can be used in the derivation of the hypervolumetric contact forces. The result is a closed-form solution for the contact forces between a <b>planetary</b> rover <b>wheel</b> and the soft soil, where all the information provided by a distributed load is stored in the hypervolume of interpenetration. The proposed approach is applied to simulations of rigid and flexible <b>planetary</b> rover <b>wheels.</b> In both cases, the plastic behaviour of the terrain material is the main source of energy loss during the operation of planetary rovers. For the rigid wheel model, a penetration geometry is proposed to capture the nonlinear dissipative properties of the soil. The centroid of the hypervolume based on this geometry then allows for the calculation of the contact normal that defines the compaction resistance of the soil. For the flexible wheel model, the deformed state of the tire has to be determined before applying the hypervolumetric contact model. The tire deformation is represented by a distributed parameter model based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations. There are several geometric and soil parameters that are required to fully define the normal contact force. While the geometric parameters can be measured, the soil parameters have to be obtained experimentally. The results of a drawbar pull experiment with the Juno rover from the Canadian Space Agency were used to identify the soil parameters. These parameters were then used in a forward dynamics simulation of the rover on an irregular 3 -dimensional terrain. Comparison of the simulation results with the experimental data validated the <b>planetary</b> rover <b>wheel</b> model developed in this work...|$|R

40|$|Fault-tolerant {{control design}} of <b>wheeled</b> <b>planetary</b> rovers is described. This paper covers all {{steps of the}} design process, from modeling/simulation to experimentation. A {{simplified}} contact model is used with a multibody simulation model and tuned to fit the experimental data. The nominal mode controller {{is designed to be}} stable and has its parameters optimized to improve tracking performance and cope with physical boundaries and actuator saturations. This controller was implemented in the real rover and validated experimentally. An impact analysis defines the repertory of faults to be handled. Failures in steering joints are chosen as fault modes; they combined six fault modes and a total of 63 possible configurations of these faults. The fault-tolerant controller is designed as a two-step procedure to provide alternative steering and reuse the nominal controller in a way that resembles a crab-like driving mode. Three fault modes are injected (one, two, and three failed steering joints) in the real rover to evaluate the response of the nonreconfigured and reconfigured control systems in face of these faults. The experimental results justify our proposed fault-tolerant controller very satisfactorily.

40|$|In {{domestic}} {{automotive industry}} {{the need for}} transition from transmission with manual control to automatic gearboxes (GB) emerged long ago. Regarding the leading foreign manufacturers (Allison, ZF, Eaton, etc.), an experience in design of automatic transmissions {{and the level of}} technological development is incomparably small. Thus, to have an informed choice of the gearbox structure types and control system is a relevant problem. Application efficiency of this or other gearbox depends both on its adaptability to the actual operating conditions and on the quality of transition refinement. This paper analyzes the special features of the gear change process in the most common types of automatic gearboxes. Constructive feasibilities of an "ideal" gear change (without power loss) and strategies for gear shifting are compared. The paper offers an overview of common problems when achieving these goals and the ways to solve them. An automatic transmission of the particular type used in the wheeled vehicles under off-road conditions determines the probability of maintaining their mobility. This is due to the phenomenon of wheel`s breakdown to slipping caused by sharp increase of torque on the <b>wheel.</b> <b>Planetary</b> hydromechanical transmissions (AT) provide continuous input torque to the wheels, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture and use. Besides, to provide a high number of density ratios in them is more complicated than in the automated and manual transmissions (AMT). This is important when moving long in the lower gears under difficult conditions. Compared with AT dual clutch transmissions due to design features require even more precise and fast control system of actuators and engine. Automation of constant-mesh or synchromesh transmissions provides a significant reduction in the duration of interruption in torque delivery. If {{it is not enough to}} increase mobility in the harsh conditions, a rational choice is to use a transmission type of TCCT (torque converter â€“ clutch â€“ (constant-mesh or synchromesh) transmission). Adding the torque converter to AMT increases the durability of clutch and synchronizers. It reduces the amount of gear changes and duration of interruption in torque delivery. Thus, the cost and repair complexity of such a transmission is much lower than those of AT. For almost 15 years thereÂ were no domestic scientific publications about economically perspective TCCT transmission. The fully automatic TCCT has been never investigated in domestic science...|$|R
