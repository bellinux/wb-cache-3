In contrast to that metal catalyzed <b>polycondensations</b> are step growth reactions involving {{a change of}} the valence of the metal. Tuning of the reaction by structural variations of the metal catalyst are demonstrated with the Pd-catalyzed vinyl polymerization of norbornene, the alternating copolymerization of ethylene with carbon monoxide and the Heck reaction as examples. One and two electron processes can be involved in metal catalyzed <b>polycondensations.</b> The oxidative polymerization of 2, 6 -dimethylphenol, the Heck reactions as well the Ni-catalyzed synthesis of polyphenylenes are discussed. m-Metal catalyzed reactions are of indispensable importance in the value adding chain of chemical technology. In the area of macromolecular chemistry metal catalyzed polymerizations are of basic importance to produce commodity polymers.

25|$|A novel biodegradable, tough {{elastomer}} {{has been}} developed from poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) for use in creation of a nerve guidance conduit. PGS was originally developed for soft tissue engineering purposes to specifically mimic ECM mechanical properties. It is considered an elastomer because {{it is able to}} recover from deformation in mechanically dynamic environments and to effectively distribute stress evenly throughout regenerating tissues in the form of microstresses. PGS is synthesized by a <b>polycondensation</b> reaction of glycerol and sebacic acid, which can be melt processed or solvent processed into the desired shape. PGS has a Young's modulus of 0.28 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength greater than 0.5 MPa. Peripheral nerve has a Young's modulus of approximately 0.45 MPa, which is very close to that of PGS. Additionally, PGS experiences surface degradation, accompanied by losses in linear mass and strength during resorption. Following implantation, the degradation half-life was determined to be 21 days; complete degradation occurred at day 60. PGS experiences minimal water absorption during degradation and does not have detectable swelling; swelling can cause distortion, which narrows the tubular lumen and can impede regeneration. It is advantageous that the degradation time of PGS can be varied by changing the degree of crosslinking and the ratio of sebacic acid to glycerol. In a study by Sundback et al. (2005), implanted PGS and PLGA conduits had similar early tissue responses; however, PLGA inflammatory responses spiked later, while PGS inflammatory responses continued to decreases.|$|E
