5|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot {{for the single}} by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, respectively. Hernandez's version opens with busy streets and the dawn of Los Angeles, California. Hamasaki begins singing the song {{on top of a}} skyscraper, whilst several intercut scenes of people walking around Los Angeles during a time lapse are shown.

5|$|A Vision of the Last Judgement is a {{painting}} by William Blake that was designed in 1808 before becoming a lost artwork. The painting was to be shown in an 1810 exhibition with a detailed analysis added to a second edition of his Descriptive Catalogue. This plan was dropped after the exhibition was cancelled, and the painting disappeared. Blake's notes for the Descriptive Catalogue describe {{various aspects of the}} work in a detailed manner, which allow the aspects of the painting to be known. Additionally, earlier designs that reveal similar Blake depiction of the Last Judgement have survived, and these date back to an 1805 precursor design created for Robert Blair's The Grave. In addition to Blake's notes on the <b>painting,</b> <b>a</b> letter written to Ozias Humphrey provides a description of the various images within an earlier design of the Last Judgement.|$|E
5|$|A panel {{very similar}} in {{description}} {{was purchased by}} the Aachen art collector Barthold Suermondt sometime during the 1860s and catalogued in 1869 with a detailing of the frame's inscription. This work was thought {{to have come from}} Nantes, suggesting it was the same as the panel mentioned in 1851. The Suermondt collection was acquired by the Berlin museum in May 1874, as part of an acquisition of 219 paintings. The painting was stolen in March 1877, generating worldwide news coverage; it was recovered ten days later, but without the original frame. The 1875 Berlin museum catalogue attributes a van Eyck imitator; the 1883 catalogue describes the original as lost and the Berlin <b>painting</b> <b>a</b> copy. Soon after, however, its authenticity was verified, and the 1904 Berlin catalogue attributed Jan.|$|E

5|$|Marigene Butler, head {{conservator}} at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, oversaw a multi-national {{research project}} between 1983 and 1989. Her team investigated the provenance {{of the two}} paintings and relationships between them through technical analyses. At that time both paintings underwent further restorations. They examined the wooden supports, parchment fibres and priming layers of the Philadelphia <b>painting.</b> <b>A</b> sample of paint {{was taken from the}} seraph-Christ's wings; analysis found particles of pure ultramarine, the most expensive pigment at the time. The team identified red organic lake in the stigmata wounds, and vermilion and lead white on Francis's cheeks. Infrared reflectography found a base layer of paint overlaid with hatching and fine brush strokes on an additional layer. The greenery was painted with a copper resinate that over time has darkened to brown. The mountains and sky were painted with ultramarine and lead white. Compared to the Turin painting, the Philadelphia version shows little evidence of underdrawing.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Dooley {{was invented}} by Dunne to replace a similar {{character}} whose real-life analogue had objected. By having the garrulous bartender speak in dialect and live in an unfashionable area of Chicago Dunne gained a freedom of expression he often did not have in standard English. The first four years of the weekly column made Mr. Dooley popular in Chicago, but little noticed elsewhere. Dunne was a rapidly rising newspaperman, and the pieces mainly appeared in the Chicago paper which he worked for. During that time, Dunne detailed the daily life of Bridgeport through Dooley's lips, <b>painting</b> <b>a</b> portrait of ethnic urban life unparalleled in 19th-century American literature.|$|E
