[Subjects and Methods] This study had a nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group design. Ninety-seven older adults (mean age ± SD, 60. 1 ± 5. 5 years) joined the smartphone <b>pedometer</b> group and underwent a 2 -week walking intervention based on a smartphone <b>pedometer</b> application. Fifty-four older adults (mean age ± SD, 65. 3 ± 8. 7 years) joined the traditional <b>pedometer</b> group and underwent a 2 -week walking intervention based on a traditional <b>pedometer.</b> The participants’ physical activity was evaluated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire– Short Form, and their weight status was quantified by calculating the body mass index. The daily <b>pedometer</b> count was also documented. [Results] No significant time, group, or time-by-group interaction effects were found for any of the outcome variables. However, trends of improvement in physical activity and body mass index were seen only in the smartphone <b>pedometer</b> group.

This {{randomized}} controlled pretest-posttest group comparison study aimed 1) to systematically examine the feasibility and acceptability of <b>pedometer</b> use and selfmonitoring of daily steps, 2) to empirically evaluate the potential reactivity effects associated with <b>pedometer</b> use and self-monitoring of walking, and 3) {{to investigate the}} potential short-term treatment effects of <b>pedometer</b> use on health outcomes in people with severe and persistent mental illnesses (SPMI). Sixty participants (mean age 46. 8, 67 % men, 83. 3 % unemployed) were recruited from a Clubhouse and Community Mental Health Centers in Hawaii. The large majority of participants had a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent (45 %), followed by Bipolar Disorder (30 %) and Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (21. 7 %).

This study compared the number of <b>pedometer</b> step counts with accelerometer data in pregnant women in free-living conditions to assess agreement between these measures. Methods Pregnant women (n = 58) with body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m 2 at median 13 weeks' gestation wore a GT 1 M Actigraph accelerometer and a Yamax Digi-Walker CW- 701 <b>pedometer</b> for four consecutive days. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients were determined between <b>pedometer</b> step counts and various accelerometer measures of PA. Total agreement between accelerometer and <b>pedometer</b> step counts was evaluated by determining the 95 % limits of agreement estimated using a regression-based method. Agreement between the monitors in categorising participants as active or inactive was assessed by determining Kappa. Results <b>Pedometer</b> step counts correlated moderately (r = 0. 36 to 0. 54) with most accelerometer measures of PA. Overall step counts recorded by the <b>pedometer</b> and the accelerometer {{were not significantly different}} (medians 5961 vs. 5687 steps/day, p = 0. 37). However, the 95 % limits of agreement ranged from - 2690 to 2656 steps/day for the mean step count value (6026 steps/day) and changed substantially over the range of values. Agreement between the monitors in categorising participants to active and inactive varied from moderate to good depending on the criteria adopted. Conclusions Despite statistically significant correlations and similar median step counts, the overall agreement between <b>pedometer</b> and accelerometer step counts was poor and varied with activity level. <b>Pedometer</b> and accelerometer steps cannot be used interchangeably in overweight and obese pregnant women. </p...|$|R

The present study aimed to examine the characteristics of intervention participants (n = 438) who (1) used a <b>pedometer</b> and (2) increased their step counts. Additionally, the third aim was to examine the mediational effect of <b>pedometer</b> use on step count change. Methods: The study sample consisted of 438 adults (207 male, mean age 49. 8 (13. 1) years). Binary logistic regressions were used to examine whether individual characteristics (gender, age, educational level, employment status, self-reported health condition, baseline step counts, baseline sitting time, baseline transport-related PA) and intervention exposure variables (having heard/seen a PA promotion message, being aware of the PA guidelines, and knowing about " 10, 000 Steps Ghent") were associated with (1) <b>pedometer</b> use and (2) a step count increase of 896 steps/day or more. Using pooled data (n = 864) from the intervention and comparison participants, a mediation analysis was conducted to see if the change in step counts was mediated by <b>pedometer</b> use. Results: Age (49 years or more: OR = 3. 19, p < 0. 005), awareness of a PA promotion message (OR = 2. 62, p < 0. 01) and awareness of " 10, 000 Steps Ghent" (OR = 2. 11, p < 0. 05) were significantly associated with <b>pedometer</b> use. Participants with a college or university degree (OR = 1. 55, p < 0. 05) and those who used a <b>pedometer</b> (OR = 2. 06, p < 0. 05) were more likely to increase their steps by 896 steps/day or more.
