5000|$|At the IAA in September 2010, Kögel {{presented}} their new vehicles for the forwarding and construction industries on the largest stand {{of all the}} trailer manufacturers. They exhibited the [...] "Container chassis Port 40 multiplex" [...] - a sliding chassis vehicle. They also showed the Euro Trailer Cool, which offers forwarding companies in the refrigerated transport sector {{the advantage of a}} refrigerated body extended by 1.3 m. Kögel offers the optimum trailer for every application with its 2nd generation of the Cargo <b>platform</b> <b>trailer.</b> In addition, they showed a trailer variant as a volume trailer, the [...] "Kögel Mega Centre Axle Trailer“, which is new at Kögel. From the refrigerated vehicle range they presented the revised and extended [...] "Kögel Cool Rail" [...] for rail transport. In the construction sector, where the brand was once present, Kögel now offers the flatbed trailer as a turntable trailer or semi variant. A total of 1,000 orders prove that the products from the traditional brand from southern Germany continue to be in demand.2 ...|$|E

5|$|The {{limitations}} on resources available {{in developing countries}} are particularly evident {{in the area of}} emergency transport. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries. Indeed, there may be no roads at all. One study found that modes of transport as diverse as motorboats, canoes, bicycles with <b>trailers,</b> tricycles with <b>platforms,</b> tractors with <b>trailers,</b> reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts were used for emergency transport.|$|R
5000|$|The Gunderson Do-All Machine {{includes}} more than 30 individual machines that are linked together by an array of belts, gears, pulleys, and transmissions. Collectively, they operate in a continuous chain reaction {{on the power of}} one [...] Whitte gas oil well engine, forming a kinetic sculpture. The entire network is mounted on a 15 ft flat bed <b>trailer</b> <b>platform,</b> {{so that it can be}} transported to engine shows, educational venues, and county fairs. The combined weight of the trailer and all components is about 6000 pounds.|$|R
50|$|Then {{government}} of Andhra Pradesh led by N. T. Rama Rao was ousted in 1989. By the next year, the statue {{was ready for}} erection. ABC Limited, a local company, was given the responsibility of transferring the statue onto the concrete <b>platform.</b> Using a <b>trailer</b> vehicle, the statue {{was brought to the}} shore of Hussain Sagar. On 10 March 1990, company workers shifted the statue on top of a barge. After traveling only 100 yd, the statue tipped and fell into the lake. The accident killed 10 people.|$|R
50|$|The bottom rear of {{the trailer}} is near head level for an adult seated in a car, and without the {{underride}} guard, the only protection for such an adult's head in a rear-end collision would be the car's windshield. The {{front of the car}} goes under the <b>platform</b> of the <b>trailer</b> rather than making contact via the passenger car bumper, so the car's protective crush zone becomes irrelevant and air bags are ineffective in protecting the car passengers. The underride guard provides a rigid area for the car to contact at the height of its bumper.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1930, a new towed 4-wheeled sprung <b>trailer</b> <b>platform</b> was {{introduced}} to replace the obsolete lorries still used as mounts from World War I, together with modern new barrels, and equipment to connect the guns to the new Vickers No. 1 Predictor.8 more Mks followed between the World Wars. By 1934 the rocking-bar deflection sights {{had been replaced by}} Magslip receiver dials which received input from the Predictor, with the layers matching pointers instead of tracking the target. Predictor No. 1 was supplemented from 1937 by Predictor No. 2, based on a US Sperry AAA Computer M3A3. This was faster and could track targets at 400 mi/h km/h at heights of 25000 ft, both Predictors received height data, generally from the Barr & Stroud UB 7 (9 feet base) instrument.|$|R
50|$|The heavy {{transporter}} Franziska {{belongs to}} the Bundeswehr's 3rd generation of vehicles and extends the ability to carry extra heavy tanks. While the STL56 is externally similar to the SLT 50, {{it is in fact}} an independently and completely new developed vehicle. The best way to tell the SLT56 apart from the Elefant are the tandem lights the SLT56 carries in the front bumper, while the Elefant only has single lights. Technically, they differ in the drive train and the engine. The trailer is also different, as is the configuration of the winches and boxes. Similar to the Elefant, the SLT56 is equipped with two Rotzler winches for pulling tanks or other disabled vehicles onto the <b>trailer.</b> The <b>trailer's</b> <b>platform</b> measures 8.9m by 3.15m, the weight is distributed on 24 wheels, two per short axle, six of those axles per side (the front two are steerable).|$|R
5000|$|On-line mass {{spectrometry}} was develop to {{solve some of}} the limitations and problem that develop from off-line analysis, such as evaporation and chemical reactions of particles in the filters during long analysis time. On-line Mass spectrometry solves these problems by being applied to collect and analysis aerosol particles instantaneously. On-line instruments are very portable and allow for spatial variability to be examined. [...] These portable instruments can be put on many different platforms such as boats, planes, and mobile <b>platforms</b> (e.g. car <b>trailers).</b> An {{example of this is}} in the picture at the beginning with the instrumentation attached to an aircraft. Like off-line, on-line {{mass spectrometry}} has many different type of instruments, which can be broken up into two types; instruments that measures the chemistry of the particle ensemble (bulk measurement) and those that measure the chemistry of individual particles (single-particle measurement). Thus based on analytical need different instrumentation is used in analysis of the aerosol particles.|$|R
5000|$|An {{extremely}} dangerous situation occurs during [...] "underride collisions", {{in which a}} passenger vehicle collides with the rear of a tractor-trailer lacking a rear underride guard, or hits the side of such a trailer not equipped with a side underride guard. [...] The platform bed of a typical trailer is approximately at the head height of a seated adult occupant of a typical passenger car. This means that {{there may not be}} much between a head and the edge of the <b>trailer</b> <b>platform,</b> except a glass windshield. [...] In an underride collision, the car's crush zones designed to absorb collision energy are completely bypassed, and the airbags may not deploy in time because the car does not decelerate appreciably until the windshield and roof pillars have already impacted the trailer bed. [...] Even delayed inflation of airbags may be useless because of major intrusion into the passenger space, leaving occupants at high risk of major head trauma or decapitation in even low speed collisions. Western European standards for underride guards have been stricter than North American standards, which typically have allowed grandfathering of older equipment that may still be on the road for decades.|$|R
5000|$|Speed Dating: Teams have to {{jump back}} and forth from one tractor trailer to another, while each trailer is moving {{side-by-side}} at a speed of 30 mph on a runway. Each team is positioned on one trailer, with an empty wall that has an arrow slot, while attached to a safety harness that is hanging from a <b>platform</b> on one <b>trailer.</b> Each partner alternates retrieving several colored balls from the opposite trailer. The goal is to deposit as many balls into the arrow slot on the wall as possible, before the trailers reach the end of the runway. The guys must stay on the outside of their female partners in order to avoid having their safety harness tangled up, and midway through the runway, the trailers will separate when they reach smoke signals, making it impossible for any partner to jump. A player must wait for their partner to return to the wall on one trailer before jumping onto the opposite trailer. The team that deposits the most balls into the wall wins the Power Couple, while the team that deposits the least amount of balls is automatically sent to the Dome.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first time}} Goofy {{tried to pass}} it, a milk bottle falls off the <b>trailer's</b> <b>platform</b> and damages his car's tire and motor and is forced {{to go to a}} {{workshop}} to get it fixed. The owner fixes the motor but the workshop then closes for two weeks before Goofy asks them to fix the tire and is forced to do it himself. The trailer comes by while he's working. After getting his car fixed, Goofy races through the desert and comes across a traveler and offers him a lift but he refuses after noticing the car's poor qualities. Goofy passes a traffic light which is on [...] "stop". He managed to stop and go back to it. While waiting, a rain cloud shows up and pours water over Goofy's car. At the same time, the traffic light switches to [...] "go" [...] and the trailer passes him. In response, Goofy tries to pass it a second time, but dust was swept out the trailer's door, clouding Goofy's sight. This also causes him to drive off the road and into a tree, allowing the trailer to pass him again. It was then nighttime and Goofy tries {{to find a place to}} sleep. He comes across a sign and after striking a match, he lifts his car with a carjack to shine it's headlights on the sign so he can read it. He then turns around and notices that all hotels have no vacancy except one. However, his car runs out of gas before he can reach it and worst of all, the trailer has taken the extra spot in the hotel. Goofy pushes his car to a gas station, but it suddenly rolls down a hill, leading him to a hotel that has a beautiful designed house which reveals to be a fake display in front of a plain cabin. He stays there for the night, but was forced to leave when a train wakes him up. A really tired Goofy travels through the night, being stunned by passing cars along the way. He once again encounters the trailer and can see people partying inside of it and is nearly hit by a truck when he tries to pass it again. He is finally able to pass the trailer by driving on a cliff wall, but when he yells at the driver, he is alarmed to see no one driving the car. He speeds away to avoid the car and trailer which is running out of control. Goofy is then knocked out of his car and into the trailer's car. After he notices that he's driving the trailer, he sees his own car slowing down while he passes it and is caught by a policeman. He is then arrested for speeding and is finally seen in jail, but happy for having found the [...] "perfect haven for rest and relaxation." ...|$|R
