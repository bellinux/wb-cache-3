50|$|Seventeen {{parts of}} the M1911 were reduced in size {{for the design of}} the EMP. The slide and frame were both shortened, necessitating changes to the extractor, firing pin, firing pin spring, and trigger bow, as well as the <b>plunger</b> <b>tube.</b> The grip frame {{circumference}} has also been reduced due to the magazine itself being made shorter, front-to-back.|$|E
5000|$|The GRP or Global Response Pistol is {{the main}} pistol in the Tactical product offering. It is a base model that offers the {{accuracy}} and reliability of the highest end Nighthawk pistol, but does not include some of the additional high-end upgrades that are available from Nighthawk. Nighthawk states that their Enforcer pistol {{is considered to be}} Nighthawk's flagship in their tactical line of handguns. This handgun has been designed and built to address several weak points in the M1911 handgun. Its unique 'features' include a <b>plunger</b> <b>tube</b> that is integral to the handgun frame, a magazine-well that is also integral, and a slide stop that has been cut flush with the frame. The other top seller in the Tactical pistol line is the Shadowhawk. Resulting from a collaboration with Steve Fisher, the Shadowhawk has many upgrades that will satisfy any customer looking for the best tactical 1911 on the market.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to scientifically {{understand}} the operation of the plunger cooling system and quantify the heat transferred from the parison to the plunger during the glass container production process. The paper highlights the results attained and the problems encountered during this investigation. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the cooling air flowing within the <b>plunger</b> cooling <b>tube</b> system used experimental data obtained from both the laboratory test rig and container manufacturing process on the shop floor. Preliminary results attained demonstrated choking together with recirculation of air in some areas along the airflow passage. This confirmed previous findings that areas of excessive tool temperature and rapid tool wear were caused by the ineffective heat extraction. The ineffective heat extraction can be attributed to the poor circulation of cooling air in the plunger. It was concluded that the cooling tube design should be reassessed to improve the airflow in the <b>plunger</b> cooling <b>tube</b> system...|$|R
40|$|The metal plunger in an Narrow Neck Press and Blow (NNPB) process {{serves a}} dual {{function}} of forming the parison and extracting sufficient heat to stabilise the parison when {{going into the}} blow stage of producing a glass container. Previous work (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in this area has indicated {{that there is a}} need to understand and quantify the heat transferred from the parison to the plunger and subsequently extract sufficient heat without causing "chill" defects in the final product. Preliminary work using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling that has been carried out by others (6, 7, 8, 9) shows that recirculation and choking of the airflow pattern within the bore of the <b>plunger</b> cooling <b>tube</b> system corresponds to the areas of poor cooling. Thus producing areas of ineffective heat extraction from the parison by the air flowing through the <b>plunger</b> cooling <b>tube</b> system. The current work addresses the above problem by examining the cooling tube design using CFD modelling and analyses the heat transfer from the parison to the plunger. These results should prove to be of immense value to designers and manufacturers associated with the glass production industry...|$|R

Preliminary results obtained using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package show that there are areas within the airflow passage along the cooling tube system that experience recirculation and choking. Further work is being undertaken by the authors using the ANSYS CFD software package to establish the appropriate parameters for optimum plunger cooling to overcome plunger failure...|$|R

Tampon applicators may be made of plastic or cardboard, and are similar in design to a syringe. The applicator consists of two tubes, an [...] "outer", or barrel, and [...] "inner", or <b>plunger.</b> The outer <b>tube</b> has a smooth surface to aid insertion and sometimes comes with a rounded end that is petaled.|$|R
50|$|The AeroPress is {{a device}} for brewing coffee. It {{was invented in}} 2005 by Aerobie {{president}} Alan Adler. Coffee is steeped for 10-50 seconds (depending on grind and preferred strength) and then forced through a filter by pressing the <b>plunger</b> through the <b>tube.</b> The filters used are either the AeroPress paper filters or disc shaped thin metal filters. The maker describes the result as an espresso strength concentration of coffee, but its most frequent use is more in the filter brew strength.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thin-walled {{tubes are}} {{generally}} used as {{impact energy absorber}} in various application due to their ease of fabrication and installation, high energy absorption capacity and long stroke. However, {{the main drawback of}} plain tube is the high initial peak force. A concentric plunger in the form of tapered block is proposed to overcome this shortcoming while at the same time, improving the impact performance. Static and dynamic axial crushing were performed to determine the initial peak force (IPF), crush force efficiency (CFE) and specific energy absorption (SEA) for the concentric plunger with various taper angles. It was found that the concentric <b>plunger</b> affected the <b>tube</b> impact response. Comparison with plain circular tube was carried out and {{it was found that the}} concentric plunger improved the impact response of the tube especially in term of initial peak force...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: At present, the {{corrosion}} of {{the casing}} near downhole pump suction port {{is common in}} some domestic oilfield. In order to study the corrosion mechanism, we design and manufacture a dynamic simulation test device for the corrosion of the casing near downhole pump suction port. The device adopts the single <b>plunger</b> pump and <b>tube</b> and casing string in line with site structure to simulate the intermittent production mode of pump {{as well as the}} fluids flow state near the pump inlet adequately, and achieves the corrosion velocity measurement and the research of corrosion behavior under different temperature, CO 2 partial pressure, and velocity. The preliminary experimental results show that the test device has the advantages of reasonable structure, strong simulation and practicality; it provides new methods of testing for the related experimental study under the condition of different corrosion mechanism and has good application prospects...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} setup was designed, fabricated {{and used}} to form radial hydrides in Zr- 2. 5 %Nb alloy pressure tube spool. The design of setup was based on ensuring a hoop stress in the spool greater than threshold stress for reorientation of hydrides in this alloy, which was achieved by manipulating the thermal expansion coefficient of the <b>plunger</b> and pressure <b>tube</b> material and diametral interference between them. The experimental setup was loaded on a universal testing machine (UTM) fitted with an environmental chamber and subjected to a temperature cycle for the stress reorientation treatment. The metallographic examination of the hydrogen charged spools subjected to stress re-orientation treatment using this set up revealed formation of predominantly radial hydrides. The variation of fracture toughness of material containing radial hydride with test temperature showed typical 'S' curve behavior with transition temperatures more {{than that of the}} material containing circumferential hydride.
