5000|$|<b>Powder-actuated</b> {{fasteners}} {{are made}} of special heat treated steel. Common nails should never be used for <b>powder-actuated</b> fastenings. There are many specialized fasteners designed for specific applications in the construction and manufacturing industries.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two common}} <b>powder-actuated</b> fasteners: drive pins and {{threaded}} studs.|$|E

5000|$|Several makes of {{starter pistols}} use [...]22 Short blank {{cartridge}}s. Some <b>powder-actuated</b> nail guns use the [...]22 Short cartridge {{as a power}} source.|$|E
50|$|Most {{manufacturers}} of <b>powder-actuated</b> nail guns offer training and certification. Many projects and employers require this before an employee {{is permitted to}} use the tool.|$|E
50|$|<b>Powder-actuated</b> {{technology}} {{was developed for}} commercial use during the Second World War, when high velocity fastening systems were used to temporarily repair damage to ships. In the case of hull breach, these tools fastened steel plates over damaged areas. These tools were developed by Mine Safety Appliances, for the United States Navy. <b>Powder-actuated</b> tools were investigated and used prior to this development; they were used as part of submarine hunting during the First World War and were {{the subject of a}} 1921 United States patent (US Patent No. 1365869).|$|E
50|$|Fasteners used in <b>powder-actuated</b> {{tools are}} not common nails. They are {{manufactured}} from special steel and heat-treated {{to produce a}} very hard yet ductile fastener. These properties permit the fastener to penetrate concrete or steel without breaking. A <b>powder-actuated</b> fastening results in a permanently installed fixture. Every fastener must be equipped with some type of tip, washer, eyelet or other guide member. This guide member aligns the fastener in the tool as it is being driven and is commonly used to retain the fastener in the tool. Common nails are not suitable for powder actuated fastening.|$|E
50|$|As {{with their}} air-actuated cousins, <b>powder-actuated</b> guns have a muzzle safety interlock. If the muzzle is not pressed against a surface with {{sufficient}} force, {{the firing pin}} is blocked and cannot reach the load to fire it. This ensures that the gun does not discharge in an unsafe manner, causing the nail to become a projectile. Nonetheless, good judgment should always be used when using a <b>powder-actuated</b> nail gun, since the nail is driven with far more force than an air-actuated gun. The surface being nailed should, therefore, certainly be capable of stopping and holding the nail.|$|E
50|$|With percussive {{stunning}}, {{a device}} which hits the animal on the head, {{with or without}} penetration, is employed. Such devices, such as the captive bolt pistol, can be either pneumatic, or <b>powder-actuated.</b> Percussive stunning produces immediate unconsciousness through brain trauma.|$|E
50|$|Not all <b>powder-actuated</b> {{tools are}} rated for high {{capacity}} charges — the strongest charge (nickel - purple @ 1295 ft/s), for example, is dangerous in a tool not rated for its use. Above {{is for a}} 350 grain slug from a test device.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Powder-actuated</b> tools come {{in either}} high {{velocity}} or low velocity types. In high velocity tools the propellant charge acts {{directly on the}} fastener. This process {{is similar to a}} firearm. Low velocity tools introduce a piston into the chamber. The propellant acts on the piston, which then drives the fastener into the substrate. (The piston is analogous to the bolt of a captive bolt pistol.) A <b>powder-actuated</b> tool is considered to be low velocity if the average test velocity of the fastener does not exceed 492 ft/s. High velocity tools may not be made or sold in the United States, however some made decades ago are still in use in shipbuilding and steel industries. The main manufacturers of powder actuated tools are Ramset, Hilti, Powers/Dewalt, Tomarco and Simpson Strong Tie.|$|E
50|$|Fasteners take various forms, {{for example}} with {{threaded}} ends {{to use as}} an embedded bolt, with washers at the tips that grip softer material etc. Fasteners used in <b>powder-actuated</b> tools are manufactured from special steel and heat-treated to produce a very hard yet ductile fastener. Those properties are necessary for the fastener to penetrate concrete or steel without breaking.|$|E
50|$|A nail gun, nailgun or nailer {{is a type}} of tool used {{to drive}} nails into wood or some other kind of material. It is usually driven by {{compressed}} air (pneumatic), electromagnetism, highly flammable gases such as butane or propane, or, for <b>powder-actuated</b> tools, a small explosive charge. Nail guns have in many ways replaced hammers as tools of choice among builders.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>powder-actuated</b> tool (often generically {{called a}} [...] "Hilti gun" [...] or a [...] "Ramset gun" [...] after their {{manufacturing}} companies) {{is a type}} of nail gun used in construction and manufacturing to join materials to hard substrates such as steel and concrete. Known as direct fastening, this technology relies on a controlled explosion created by small chemical propellant charge, similar to the process that discharges a firearm.|$|E
50|$|Fasteners join, or affix, {{two or more}} objects. Although {{they are}} usually used to attach pipe and {{fittings}} to mechanical supports in buildings, they do not connect the pipes to each other. Fasteners commonly used with piping are a stud bolt with nuts (usually fully threaded, with two heavy, hexagonal nuts); a machine bolt and nut; or a <b>powder-actuated</b> tool (PAT) fastener (usually a nail or threaded stud, driven into concrete or masonry).|$|E
50|$|Hot work is {{a process}} that can be a source of {{ignition}} when flammable material is present or can be a fire hazard regardless of the presence of flammable material in the workplace. Common hot work processes involve welding, soldering, cutting, brazing burning and the use of <b>powder-actuated</b> tools or similar fire producing operations outside of designated hot work areas. When flammable materials are present, industrial processes such as grinding and drilling become cold work processes.|$|E

50|$|The free bolt stunner is {{used for}} the emergency, in-the-field {{euthanasia}} of large farm-animals that cannot be restrained. It differs from a true captive bolt gun in that the projectile is not retractable; it is similar in operation to a <b>powder-actuated</b> nail gun or conventional firearm. Capable of firing only when pressed firmly against a surface (typically the animal's forehead), the device fires a small projectile through the animal's skull. The veterinarian can then either leave the animal to die from the projectile wound, or administer lethal drugs.|$|E
5000|$|Cartridge based {{concrete}} anchoring {{and steel}} anchoring {{systems have been}} devised for firearms used as tools, such as developed by Hilti and Ramset with their so-called <b>powder-actuated</b> tools. Typical calibers range from [...]22 cal up to 9 mm for the cartridges, which propel anchors and nails into concrete, steel, and other materials. Developed in World War II to temporarily repair ship damage quickly {{in the case of}} hull breach, this technology is today commonly used in construction and manufacturing to join materials to hard substrates such as steel and concrete.|$|E
50|$|Special blank {{cartridges}} {{are also}} used when the explosive power of a cartridge is needed, but a projectile is not. Blank cartridges were commonly used for launching tear-gas or rifle grenades, though some types of grenades are capable of trapping the bullet of a live round. Larger blanks {{are also used}} for line launching guns, such as the line launching kit for the Mossberg 500 shotgun.Blank rimfire cartridges, commonly called power loads, are also used in some nail guns (<b>powder-actuated</b> tools), where the power is tapped to force a heavy piston into the nail, with enough force to bury its full length in steel or concrete.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Powder-actuated</b> tool {{cartridges}} are specially-designed blank firearm cartridges. In many cases, {{the charges}} are ordinary firearm cartridges with modified casings, and the bullet removed. The [...]22 Short, developed by Smith & Wesson is common. These charges may be hand-fed, or manufactured and distributed on a plastic strip. The charges are activated when a firing pin strikes the primer, which is an explosive charge {{in the base of}} cartridge. The primer ignites the charge, which burns rapidly. The gases released by the burning of the propellant build pressure within the cartridge, which acts either on the head of the nail, or on the piston, accelerating the nail towards the muzzle.|$|E
5000|$|During some {{of these}} {{nighttime}} attacks, PT boat positions may have been given away by {{a flash of light}} caused by grease inside the black <b>powder-actuated</b> Mark 8 torpedo tubes catching fire during the launching sequence. In order to evade return fire from the enemy ships, the PT boat could deploy a smoke screen using stern-mounted generators. Starting in mid-1943, the old Mark 13 torpedo tubes and Mark 8 torpedoes were replaced. The new Mark 1 [...] "roll-off" [...] torpedo launcher rack ( [...] loaded with an improved Mark 13 aerial torpedo) effectively eliminated the telltale flash of light from burning grease, did not use any form of explosive to launch the torpedo, and weighed about 1000 lb less than the tubes.|$|E
50|$|Snoop, Marlo Stanfield's {{young female}} enforcer, needs {{to replace her}} {{cordless}} nail gun that is continually running out of charge. A salesman cordially and enthusiastically recommends a <b>powder-actuated</b> model and explains its characteristics to her. Grateful for his time and effort, Snoop pays for the tool and heavily tips the bewildered salesman and walks out with the nail gun. Chris Partlow, her mentor is waiting outside the store in their car. Snoop cheerfully relates her new-found knowledge of their new hardware. Partlow and Snoop prepare a vacant row house while a prisoner pleads with them. Partlow promises him a quick and clean death and then shoots him with a suppressed pistol. They cover the body with quicklime and plastic sheets and nail the vacant building closed before they leave.|$|E
50|$|Currently an {{electric}} motor {{is the most popular}} choice to power stationary tools, though in the past they were powered by windmills, water wheels and steam. Some museums and hobbyists still maintain and operate stationary tools powered these older power sources. Portable electric tools may be either corded or battery-powered. Compressed air is the customary power source for nailers and paint sprayers. A few tools (called <b>powder-actuated</b> tools) are powered by explosive cartridges. Tools that run on gasoline or gasoline-oil mixes are made for outdoor use; typical examples include most chainsaws and string trimmers. Other tools like blowtorches will burn their fuel externally to generate heat. Compressed air is universally used where there is a possibility of fuel or vapor ignition - such as automotive workshops. Professional level electric tools differ from DIY or 'consumer' tools by being double insulated and not earthed - in fact they must not be earthed for safety reasons.|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} for strengthening reinforced concrete (RC) slabs using FRP composites is investigated. It {{is referred to}} as the mechanically fastened (MF) technique, which is based on fixing FRP materials to concrete using closely spaced <b>powder-actuated</b> fasteners. A special FRP material, known by the trade name SAFSTRIP ª, is used in this method. It is characterized by a high bearing strength as well as a high tensile strength. This {{new technique}} is very rapid compared to the conventional bonded FRP techniques. Furthermore, it allows for immediate use of the structure after completion of the installation process. In addition, unlike the bonded system, the use of the MF system results in a desirable ductile behaviour of the strengthened structure. The commonly used fasteners in this technique are embedded into the concrete using a powder actuated fastening"gun". The shot of this fastener is very strong and may sometimes cause initial cracking or concrete spalling or may locally damage the FRP if the fastener is overdriven. To overcome these problems we have proposed a new fastener based on screwing rather than shooting the fastener into the concrete. This screwed fastener has a better anchorage into the concrete, and displays a much better performance. This study attempts to investigate the behaviour of RC slabs strengthened in flexure with the mechanically fastened FRP system. Two series of large-scale reinforced concrete slabs are tested. The first series is comprised of five slabs without a cut-out, and measuring 2600 x 2600 x 120 mm; the second series consists of four slabs of the same dimensions with a central cut-out measuring 800 x 800 mm. In each series, one slab is left unstrengthened to serve as a reference while FRP strips are used to strengthen the remaining slabs. Different strengthening patterns are used with different spacings between fasteners. Also, the conventionally bonded strengthening technique is used for the sake of comparison. The mechanically fastened system is found to be an interesting alternative to the bonded system resulting in a rapid, economic, and effective system. The gained increases in ultimate capacities of the MF FRP-strengthened slabs range between 30 to 70 % over those of the unstrengthened specimens. Moreover, the use of the MF system shows a desirable pseudo-ductile mode of failure. As a complementary study, experimental results from 27 direct shear tests on FRP strips mechanically fastened to concrete blocks are reported. Based on the results from these tests, new analytical models that describe the interfacial behaviour between the MF FRP and concrete substrate are developed. These models are referred to as"bearing-slip" models. Finite element models are then introduced to address the interfacial behaviour between the FRP strips and the concrete substrate for the MF FRP/concrete direct shear specimens. Results are presented in terms of ultimate load capacities and load-slip relationships. The numerical predictions are verified against the experimental data, and very good agreement is obtained. Based on this verification, the proposed bearing-slip models are subsequently used in finite element analyses to simulate the cases of RC beams and slabs strengthened with the MF system. Also, the theoretical part of this study is extended to include finite element modelling of bonded FRP-strengthened slabs. The interfacial behaviour between the FRPs and the concrete substrate is accounted for by using appropriate interfacial models. It is shown that the numerical models can be applied to arbitrary FRP configurations, and can also accommodate both passive as well as prestressed FRP strengthening schemes. Results are presented in terms of load-deflection relationships, ultimate load capacities, failure modes, and interfacial slip and stress distributions. When compared to test results reported in the literature, the analysis is shown to lead to very good predictions...|$|E
