In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.|$|E

PHP is allied to other public health disciplines including epidemiology, nutrition, genetics and biostatistics.

25|$|Angkor Wat, {{the largest}} Angkorian temple (built AD 1116–1150), {{features}} both apsaras and devata, however the devata type {{are the most}} numerous with more than 1,796 in the <b>present</b> <b>research</b> inventory. Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (30–40cm as seen at left) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately 95–110cm) more prominently {{at every level of}} the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewelry and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period. Some devatas appear with arms around each other and seem to be greeting the viewer. “The devatas seem to epitomize all the elements of a refined elegance,” wrote Marchal.|$|E

2500|$|Rugbrød (...) (Danish style rye bread) is a {{very common}} bread in Denmark. Rugbrød usually resembles a long brown {{extruded}} rectangle, no more than 12cm high, and 30–35cm wide, dependent upon the bread pan {{in which it is}} baked. The ingredients typically include rye flour, cracked or chopped rye kernels and seeds such as sunflower seeds, linseeds or pumpkin seeds. Sourdough is almost always the base because commercial yeasts are unsuitable. The naturally fermented dough will develop a naturally occurring Lactobacillus culture in symbiotic combination with naturally present yeasts. It is essential [...] in baking rye-based breads because the chemistry of rye flour produces an environment that is acidic. The most commonly present yeast species in the production of naturally leavened dough is Saccharomyces exiguus, which is more acid-tolerant than commercially produced S. cerevisiae, although the latter and other strains may also be <b>present.</b> <b>Research</b> has shown that when creating a naturally fermented starter, any naturally present S. cerevisiae will have died off after a few days.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to classes, {{a number of}} traditions create camaraderie and foster the intellectual formation of students. The most notable of these annual events are the fall Christ College Freshman Production and the spring Christ College Oxford Debates. The Freshman Production is an original play or musical that is written, scored, choreographed, directed, produced, and performed exclusively {{by members of the}} Christ College freshman class. The Christ College Oxford Debates are a series of formal debates in which two groups of students represent either the affirmative or negative side of a topic they have researched for the previous five or six weeks. Following debate, the debate moderator asks the audience members to [...] "vote their minds" [...] and decide the winner of the debate. Another notable academic opportunity offered by Christ College is the Student Scholarship Symposium, in which undergraduates <b>present</b> <b>research</b> in a formal lecture setting. It features student-selected research projects, from a diverse set of academic fields, delivered in a critical and interactive environment. Students in the college often spend a semester studying abroad at one of Valpo’s overseas study centers; many take a Christ College Abroad course, which are led by faculty each spring break.|$|E
