5|$|Section 9 {{operatives}} {{develop a}} theory that a hacker known as the <b>Puppeteer</b> or 傀儡廻 (Kugutsumawashi, literally 'Puppet Spinner', contrasted with the original film Puppet Master who was 人形使い Ningyō-zukai, literally 'Doll Handler') is responsible for Siak agents' forced suicides and Togusa discovers sixteen kidnapped children who were intended carriers of the virus. All the children are listed as the children of Noble Rot Senior Citizens and Section 9 begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when {{they are part of}} a larger body of 20,000 children. Soon afterwards, the <b>Puppeteer</b> causes the disappearance of the sixteen children and Batou reveals to Togusa that he believes Kusanagi to be the <b>Puppeteer.</b> Section 9 next intercepts a Siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of Ka Rum's assassination. After his capture it is revealed the informant and the target are one in the same. The sniper says that the <b>Puppeteer</b> is a mechanism in the Solid State and cannot be killed.|$|E
5|$|A {{designer}} named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, {{claiming he}} developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The <b>Puppeteer</b> reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a Solid State, allowing him {{to move into the}} society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the <b>Puppeteer</b> was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the <b>Puppeteer</b> will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal.|$|E

50|$|As the {{clothing}} of the puppets wear out or are soiled {{the clothing}} {{is replaced by}} the <b>puppeteers.</b> The process of dressing or redressing the puppets by the <b>puppeteers</b> is called koshirae.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Puppeteers</b> {{first moved}} their worlds into this {{formation}} when their home star {{turned into a}} red giant, using an inertialess, reactionless drive purchased at great price from the Outsiders. After the discovery that {{the core of the}} galaxy is exploding, the <b>Puppeteers</b> turned the fleet towards the Magellanic Clouds, gradually reaching a speed of 80% lightspeed. Although the <b>Puppeteers</b> have Faster-than-light technology they prefer to travel at safer, sub-light speeds.|$|R
5|$|David O'Hara as Michael Canaris, {{a senior}} {{official}} within the British government whose position is never stated, who acts as Hatcher's <b>puppeteer.</b> Canaris was depicted to have a fascist background, speaking lines that paralleled Adolf Hitler's mindset of cleansing.|$|E
5|$|Kevin Jeffrey Clash (born September 17, 1960) is an American <b>puppeteer,</b> {{director}} and producer whose characters include Elmo, Clifford, Benny Rabbit, and Hoots the Owl.|$|E
5|$|The show {{took five}} years to make. The idea was first {{suggested}} between the creator and director of Mongrels, Adam Miller, and the show's head <b>puppeteer,</b> Andy Heath, when they worked on ITV children's show Ripley and Scuff.|$|E
5000|$|Biologically, <b>Puppeteers</b> {{are highly}} {{intelligent}} herbivores; a herd animal, <b>Puppeteers</b> prefer the company (and smell) {{of their own}} kind. Their cycle of reproduction {{is similar to that}} of Earth's digger wasps: the <b>Puppeteers</b> consider themselves to have three genders (two male, one female): the two [...] "male" [...] genders are the equivalent of human female and male (one has an ovipositor, the other produces sperm) and the [...] "female" [...] is a (non-sentient) parasitized host into which the ovum and spermatozoon are deposited.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the theater is {{documented}} in the film, Turnabout: the Story of the Yale <b>Puppeteers,</b> directed by Dan Bessie (a nephew of Harry Burnett). Brown {{wrote a book about}} the puppet troupe, and Bessie discussed the <b>puppeteers</b> in his memoir of his family, Rare Birds.|$|R
50|$|The puppets needed {{electronic}} <b>puppeteers</b> {{and voice}} actors.|$|R
5|$|Togusa tracks {{down one}} of the missing children, now {{assigned}} to an elderly man in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State. Later, Togusa receives a call from the <b>Puppeteer</b> who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The <b>Puppeteer</b> and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the <b>Puppeteer</b> as a rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the leprechauns, the series also saw {{the introduction of a}} new puppet rat called 'Renoir'. The character did not speak, instead he communicated by squeaking and was puppeteered by Lee Brooks (who would later go on to <b>puppeteer</b> Nev The Bear).|$|E
5|$|Smithers' {{devotion to}} Mr. Burns was {{inspired}} from how numerous Fox executives {{and staff members}} acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but little attention should be drawn to it. Smithers' first name (Waylon) was derived from that of <b>puppeteer</b> Wayland Flowers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1931 {{he married}} Georgia Taylor and {{together}} started The Folktale Puppet Theatre. He was {{widely recognized as}} one of the best <b>puppeteers</b> in the United States, and in 1983 he received the President's Award of the <b>Puppeteers</b> of America (a year before Frank Oz received it) https://web.archive.org/web/20061001145928/http://www.puppeteers.org/awardshistory.html ...|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, their sun {{converted}} from a yellow dwarf to a red giant, so the <b>Puppeteers</b> moved the [...] "Fleet of Worlds", the five planets, to their system's Oort cloud. This {{is one of}} the reasons the <b>Puppeteers</b> were so successful at keeping the location of their homeworld a secret—explorers would be looking for a yellow dwarf (as one could surmise that <b>Puppeteers</b> had evolved around a yellow dwarf from their biology and that they were comfortable on Earth-like planets without pressure suits) when their planet(s) were actually near a red giant.|$|R

5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving her is more difficult. As Marion {{spends much of his}} time sitting on top of a rubbish bin, his <b>puppeteer,</b> Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali is said to be the most difficult puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his own puppetry projects, Henson aided others in their work. In 1979, he {{was asked by the}} producers of the Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back to aid make-up artist Stuart Freeborn in the creation and articulation of enigmatic Jedi Master Yoda. Henson suggested to Star Wars creator George Lucas, himself a Muppets fan, that he use Frank Oz as the <b>puppeteer</b> and voice of Yoda. Oz voiced Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back and each of the four subsequent Star Wars films. The naturalistic, lifelike Yoda {{became one of the most}} popular characters of the Star Wars franchise. Lucas even lobbied unsuccessfully to have Oz nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.|$|E
5|$|James Maury Henson (September 24, 1936– May 16, 1990) was an American <b>puppeteer,</b> artist, cartoonist, inventor, screenwriter, and filmmaker who {{achieved}} international fame as {{the creator}} of the Muppets. Born in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in Leland, Mississippi, and Hyattsville, Maryland, Henson began developing puppets while attending high school. While he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, he created Sam and Friends, a five-minute sketch-comedy puppet show that appeared on television. After graduating from the University of Maryland with a degree in home economics, he produced coffee advertisements and developed some experimental films. Henson founded Muppets Inc. in 1958 (which would later become the Jim Henson Company).|$|E

5|$|Series 6 {{began on}} 26 September 1998 and {{began with the}} leprechaun Mr Onion being {{temporarily}} written out of the show after supposedly being swept down the plughole in the bath. This was done intentionally as <b>puppeteer</b> John Eccleston was in Australia filming for Farscape for the year {{and would not be}} available. To compensate for Eccleston's absence, a new leprechaun puppet was added called 'Shamrock' (voiced by Rebecca Nagan of Rosie and Jim fame) who made her debut {{at the end of the}} first show as their long lost sister. She then became a regular fixture from the following week and performed alongside Mr Sage for the rest of the series as a replacement to Mr Onion.|$|E
5|$|The {{team that}} worked on Labyrinth was largely {{assembled}} from talent {{who had been}} involved in various other projects with the Jim Henson Company. Veteran performers Frank Oz and Dave Goelz operated various puppets in the film, as did Karen Prell, Ron Mueck and Rob Mills who had all worked with Henson on Fraggle Rock. Kevin Clash, a crew member on Sesame Street best known for voicing the character Elmo, worked on the film. Members of Henson's family also worked on the production, including son Brian and daughter Cheryl. Newcomers working on the production included <b>puppeteer</b> Anthony Asbury, who had previously worked on the satirical puppet show Spitting Image.|$|E
5|$|Asma is a {{professional}} Emirati <b>puppeteer,</b> storyteller and creative drama specialist. A graduate of the United Arab Emirates University, Asma earned her BA in English Literature, minoring in drama and theater. Through a Summer Master’s Degree Program in Applied Drama at the City University of New York, Asma distinguished herself as a creative drama specialist, {{with a focus on}} puppetry and early childhood education. This led her to be chosen by the Zayed Higher Organization in 2012 to work with children with special needs. As a result of her training with the ‘Kids on the Block’ program, which uses special puppets crafted with different disabilities, Asma has opened up a new field of early childhood intervention; one that uses the dynamics of puppetry and creative drama to enhance education for the most impressionable audience in the UAE.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell {{was perfect for}} the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was {{not familiar with the}} comic book when he got the part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM <b>puppeteer</b> Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.|$|E
5|$|The Jim Henson Company and the Jim Henson Foundation {{continued}} {{after his}} death, producing new series and specials. Jim Henson's Creature Shop, founded by Henson, also continues to build creatures {{for a large}} number of other films and series (e.g. the science-fiction production Farscape, the film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the movie MirrorMask) and {{is considered one of the}} most advanced and well respected creators of film creatures. As of 2017, his eldest son Brian and eldest daughter Lisa are the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the company; his daughter Cheryl is the president of the foundation. Steve Whitmire, a veteran member of the Muppet puppeteering crew, assumed the roles of Kermit the Frog and Ernie, the most famous characters formerly played by Jim Henson. Whitmire also assumed the roles of Link Hogthrob, starting with the video game Muppet RaceMania, as well as The Muppet Newsman, starting in 2008, with Muppet.com viral online videos. However in 2017 Whitmire was fired from the Muppets Studio and as a result, Matt Vogel has taken over the role of Kermit. Muppeteer veteran Bill Barretta has taken over for Henson's fairly deeper voiced roles, such as the Swedish Chef, Mahna Mahna, Rowlf the Dog, and Dr. Teeth. Guy Smiley, in recent years, has been taken over by Eric Jacobson, and the role of Waldorf, in 1992, was assumed by Muppet performer veteran Dave Goelz. As of 2017, Ernie is now performed by <b>puppeteer</b> Peter Linz.|$|E

50|$|Four years later, in 2645, Shaeffer is on Jinx when he {{is again}} {{approached}} by the <b>puppeteers,</b> this time by the Regional President of General Products on Jinx. <b>Puppeteers</b> have developed the Quantum II hyperdrive, capable of traveling one light-year every 1.25 minutes, but the engineering is unwieldy and requires further research to become more useful. The <b>puppeteers</b> hire Shaeffer {{to travel to the}} core of the Milky Way galaxy as a publicity stunt in the ship, which Shaeffer names the Long Shot. In doing so, Shaeffer learns that the core of the galaxy has exploded and a wave of hard radiation is spreading outward. In about twenty thousand years it will pass through known space, rendering all the worlds there uninhabitable. When Shaeffer returns to Jinx he discovers that General Products has become defunct and that all <b>puppeteers</b> have disappeared.|$|R
