25|$|The new {{division}} {{was still being}} formed when the Luftwaffe launched a series of devastating raids, beginning with the notorious Coventry Blitz on 14/15 November. The Coventry raid was preceded by a dozen <b>pathfinder</b> <b>aircraft</b> of Kampfgeschwader 100 riding an X-Gerät beam to drop flares and incendiary bombs on the target. The huge fires that {{broke out in the}} congested city centre then attracted successive 40-strong waves of bombers flying at heights between 12,000 and 20,000 feet to saturate the defences. The AA Defence Commander (AADC) of 95th HAA Rgt had prepared a series of concentrations to be fired using sound-locators and GL Mk. I gun-laying radar, and 128 concentrations were fired before the bombing severed all lines of communication and the noise drowned out sound-location. Some gun positions were able to fire at searchlight beam intersections, glimpsed through the smoke and guessing the range. Although the Coventry guns fired 10 rounds a minute for the whole 10-hour raid, only three aircraft were shot down over the UK that night, and the city centre was gutted. The Coventry raid was followed by three consecutive nights (19–22 November) of attacks on Birmingham and other Black Country industrial towns including West Bromwich, Dudley and Tipton.|$|E

2500|$|Two Air Commando H-19 pilots {{received}} the Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Crosses from an attempted rescue mission described in their citations as [...] "the deepest helicopter {{penetration of the}} Korean War". [...] Taking off from Cho-do Island {{in the early morning}} hours, Captain Frank J. Westerman and Lieutenant Robert Sullivan flew low-level through darkness for two hours, guided north by an Air Rescue SA-16 <b>pathfinder</b> <b>aircraft</b> flying overhead at an altitude of 100 feet. [...] At first light, the helicopter was 16 miles south of the Chinese border and within ten minutes flying time of the Chinese MiG fighter base at Antung, the largest Chinese fighter base in North Korea. [...] Racing inland they discovered the valley the downed pilot was reported to be in, {{which turned out to be}} a massive camouflage supply and troop depot. The valley contained at least a regiment of troops, all armed and firing as fast as they could. [...] The hills looked like a large warehouse, piles of equipment and supplies under camouflage nets. [...] It was quickly evident that no evading American was walking around in the area. [...] The Air Commandos fled for their lives, informing the SA-16 offshore to do the same. [...] It was likely that the rescue attempt was bait for a Chinese trap. All of the Air Commandos returned to Cho-do successfully.|$|E
2500|$|The Troop Carrier Command {{moved from}} Tunisia to Sicily in early September and Williams opened his {{headquarters}} at Licata. Two airborne operations were planned. GIANT I was an airborne {{assault on the}} Volturno River crossing. It was cancelled as the risks to both paratroops and aircraft were considered too great. GIANT II was an airborne assault on Rome area. Williams planned parachute drops on airfields at Poligono di Furbara and Cerveteri, northwest of the city. It too was cancelled amid doubts {{as to whether the}} Italian Rome garrison could hold the area. However, in response to the deteriorating situation in the Battle of Salerno, Lieutenant General Mark Clark called for an emergency mission to bring the 82nd Airborne Division. The 51st and 52nd Troop Carrier Wings were given only hours to prepare but Williams was able to improvise by using the plans for GIANT I. This time extraordinary measures were taken to silence Allied anti-aircraft guns afloat and ashore. Three <b>pathfinder</b> <b>aircraft</b> led the way, dropping fifty paratroops equipped with Rebecca/Eureka and Krypton lamps precisely on the drop zone behind Allied lines. Most of the paratroops landed within [...] of the drop zone, and no troops or aircraft were lost. A second drop the following night was just as successful. This encouraged Allied commanders to attempt a battalion-sized drop behind enemy lines at Avellino the night after but the hilly terrain made it difficult for the pathfinders' Aldis lamps and radio transmitters and the drop was scattered.|$|E

50|$|On {{the night}} of the 21/22 June 705 RAF bombers—262 Lancasters, 209 Halifax, 117 Short Stirlings, 105 Vickers Wellingtons and—12 Mosquitos {{attacked}} Krefeld. 17 Halifax, 9 Lancasters, 9 Wellingtons and 9 Stirlings were lost o the operation. This represented 6.2 per cent of the force. The raid was carried out before the full moon period was over and the heavy casualties were mostly caused by night fighters. 12 of the aircraft lost were from the Pathfinders; No. 35 Squadron RAF lost 6 out of the 19 Halifax bombers it sent. The raid took place in good visibility and the Pathfinders produced an almost perfect marking effort, ground-markers dropped by Oboe-equipped Mosquitos were supplemented by the <b>Pathfinder</b> heavies. 619 <b>aircraft</b> bombed struck the area within 3 miles of the centre of the target.

50|$|During World War II the British Bomber Command {{was engaged}} in night time area bombing of Germany. In 1942 these {{operations}} were resulting in an aircraft loss rate of between 4 and 5 percent and {{only a third of}} the aircraft were able to drop their bombs within 5 miles (8 km) of the target. In an effort to improve the accuracy the Pathfinder Force was created on 15 August 1942, under the leadership of Acting Group Captain Don Bennet, who was born in Toowoomba. The specialised squadrons in the <b>Pathfinder</b> Force had <b>aircraft</b> that were crewed by experienced crews who would lead the main bomber force to locate the target and mark it with flares. This would give the bomber force coming in behind an improved chance of dropping their bombs in the right place.To commemorate the Pathfinder Force the museum has a large display, which was established and maintained in conjunction with the Pathfinder Force Association of Australia. It includes uniforms, memorabilia, models and a reproduction of Don Bennett’s office which contains many of his original possessions. The display is located adjacent to the F-111 strike aircraft which provides a link to the modern air force.|$|R
40|$|NASA’s ERAST {{program is}} {{developing}} unmanned aerial vehicles to fly high altitude, long endurance missions. This paper studies {{the performances of}} these aircraft in low Martian atmosphere, an environment very similar to Earth’s stratosphere. Since no oxygen {{is available in the}} Martian atmosphere, a solar powered aircraft is analyzed. Such an aircraft could help to deploy planet-wide weather station and microrover networks, greatly enhancing their flexibility. Results show that with current technology it is possible to develop an UAV capable of continuous flight in low Martian atmosphere. <b>Pathfinder</b> and Centurion <b>aircraft,</b> developed by AeroVironment Inc., could meet that goal. Pathfinder was found to be the best suited to the Martian environment, being able to fly continuously at latitudes between 30 °N and 50 °N with a 20 Kg payload for up to 160 sols. Both Pathfinder and Centurion are able to fly all year long during daylight hours with a 100 Kg payload near the equator, and in spring and summer months in the ± 50 ° latitude range. Flight latitude and time of year play significant roles in determining payload mass for both aircraft. Improvements in fuel cell and solar cell efficiency could greatly enhance the performances of this kind of aircraft. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) Alliance {{was created}} in 1994 and {{operated}} for 9 years as a NASA-sponsored coalition of 28 members from small companies, government, universities, and nonprofit organizations. ERAST s goal was to foster development of remotely piloted aircraft technology for scientific, humanitarian, and commercial purposes. Some of the aircraft in the ERAST Alliance were intended to fly unmanned at high altitudes {{for days at a}} time, and flying for such durations required alternative sources of power that did not add weight. The most successful solution for this type of sustained flight is the lightest solar energy. Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. They are made of semi-conducting materials similar to those used in computer chips. When sunlight is absorbed, electrons are knocked loose from their atoms, allowing electricity to flow. Under the ERAST Alliance, two solar-powered technology demonstration <b>aircraft,</b> <b>Pathfinder</b> and Helios, were developed. Pathfinder is a lightweight, remotely piloted flying wing aircraft that demonstrated the technology of applying solar cells for long-duration, high-altitude flight. Solar arrays covering most of the upper wing surface provide power for the aircraft s electric motors, avionics, communications, and other electronic systems. Pathfinder also has a backup battery system that can provide power for between 2 and 5 hours to allow limited-duration flight after dark. It was designed, built, and operated by AeroVironment, Inc., of Monrovia, California. On September 11, 1995, Pathfinder reached an altitude of 50, 500 feet, setting a new altitude record for solar-powered aircraft. The National Aeronautic Association presented the NASA-industry team with an award for 1 of the 10 Most Memorable Record Flights of 1995...|$|R

40|$|The LLNL {{effort to}} develop {{electrochemical}} energy storage systems occupies a crucial regime in the hydrogen technologies` adoption process, between pure research/conceptual feasibility and near-term demonstrations of commercial systems This effort leaves as many component innovations as possible to others, and seeks to integrate the best systems from the highest performance, readily procurable components. The integration research and component testing being undertaken has already uncovered many operational and design issues that might hinder the adoption of breakthrough technologies being funded by the DOE and NASA A focus on delivering energy storage to the most weight-sensitive applications (aircraft and spacecraft) ensures that key technologies will be properly implemented and combined to perform in real, upcoming vehicle tests. The two key technologies that LLNL is aggressively implementing are proton exchange membrane (PEM) -based RFCs and high-performance tankage for storing compressed hydrogen and oxygen gases Tankage built from available technologies must be lightweight and must cope with volume penalties, gas permeation, and moisture handling to adequately furnish the breakthrough levels of specific energy that RFC systems offer Such multidisciplinary specifications {{have yet to be}} combined {{in the form of a}} commercial product. Were it not fat LLNL`s role as integrator leading industry, and as technical monitor promoting relevant specifications from within DOE-funded demonstration efforts in industry, such functional combinations of component performances would be years lather than months away. In particular, the DOE PRDA funded at Thiokol is on track to deliver vehicle-compatible hydrogen test tanks to support the Ford P 2000 demonstration vehicle early next year The supervision of and close interaction with this industrial demonstration project is one important example of the real effort DOE is sponsoring at LLNL to bridge research into demonstrations Another DOE-funded industrial demonstration effort, with Proton Energy Systems as prime contractor, has recently been funded to introduce PEM-based energy storage into electrical utility applications Besides monitoring this field demonstration, LLNL will be directly supporting Proton Energy System`s technology development by testing electrolyzer and URFC cell stacks. In the cases of Proton Energy Systems, Thiokol, and Hamilton Standard (which currently offers the most advanced electrochemical components) LLNL has achieved close cooperation with industrial partners who hold the intellectual property. With these partners, LLNL is jointly developing systems relevant to a wide spectrum of applications, as depicted in Figure 1. These systems include high altitude long endurance (HALE) solar rechargeable aircraft (SRA), zero emission vehicles (ZEVs), hybrid energy storage/propulsion systems for spacecraft, energy storage for remote (off-grid) power sources, and peak shaving for on-grid applications (Carter 1998, de Groot 1997, Mitlitsky 1998, Mitlitsky 1996 -a, Mitlitsky 1996 -b, Mitlitsky 1996 -c, Mitlitsky 1996 -d, Mitlitsky 1994, Mitlitsky 1993). Figure 2 illustrates the original application for this set of innovations: solar powered <b>aircraft</b> This <b>aircraft</b> (<b>Pathfinder)</b> set the altitude record (71, 500 ft) for all propeller- driven aircraft on July 7, 1997 (Mitlitsky 1998, NASA 1997) ...|$|R
50|$|Night {{missions}} {{had similar}} profiles {{to and from}} the target, except that aircraft did not assemble in the target area but bombed individually, guided by their own navigation systems and by the glow of fires started by <b>pathfinder</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In addition, bombing altitudes were rarely higher than 8,000 feet.|$|E
50|$|A very {{accurate}} navigation system {{consisting of a}} receiver/transponder for two radar stations transmitting from widely separated locations in Southern England which, when used together, determined the aircraft's position.

50|$|On 20 June, {{the force}} {{took off from}} Scampton. As they {{approached}} France the entire force dropped down {{as low as possible}} to fly under the enemy radar. Once they reached a waypoint on the Rhine, the force began a gradual climb to 5,000 ft. Group Captain Slee’s aircraft developed engine trouble and he returned, handing over his duties to Wing Commander Gomm. The main force of 56 aircraft continued to climb to 10,000 ft to give cover to the four <b>Pathfinder</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{proportion}} of <b>Pathfinder</b> <b>aircraft</b> to Main Force bombers could {{vary according to}} the difficulty and location of the target; 1 to 15 was common, though it could be as low as 1 to 3. By the start of 1944, the bulk of Bomber Command was bombing within 3 miles of the PFF indicators, an appreciable improvement in accuracy since 1942. The success or failure of a raid now largely depended on the Pathfinder's marker placement and the success of further correction marking.|$|E

Although weather prevented effective fighter protection against enemy aircraft, the group bombed assigned targets and destroyed many enemy airplanes. Individual aircraft and crews led Eighth Air Force elements on attacks against factories at Gotha, Brunswick, Schweinfurt, and other German industrial centers during Big Week, 20-25 February 1944.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} of 21 June, the Combat Wing of B-17s which earlier landed at Poltava {{sustained}} severe losses in a German air attack. Hungarian planes also participated in the attack.

At 0030 hours, <b>Pathfinder</b> <b>aircraft</b> released flares directly above the airfield and ten minutes later the first bombs were dropped. For almost two hours, an estimated 75 Luftwaffe bombers attacked the base, exhibiting a very high degree of accuracy. Nearly all bombs were dropped in the dispersal area of the landing ground where only B-17s were parked, indicating without question that the B-17s constituted the specific objective of the raiders.|$|E

50|$|Of {{the three}} prototypes, two were {{representative}} of the Valiant B.1, while one was built as a further developed version, referred to the Valiant B.2. The B.2 variant was intended {{to serve as a}} <b>Pathfinder</b> <b>aircraft,</b> functioning to mark targets for the main bomber force and to reach its targets at low level and high speed. To cope with the rougher ride compared with high altitude operations, the B.2 had a strengthened airframe. In particular, the wing received design alterations to strengthen it, a key change being the removal of the large cut-outs in the wing structure into which the main wheels retracted, allowing the wing torsion box structure to be uninterrupted and giving more room for internal fuel storage; instead the main landing gear, which had four wheels instead of the two large wheels of the B.1, retracted backwards into large fairings set into the rear of the wings. The B.2 had a lengthened fuselage with a total length of 112 ft, in contrast to a length of 108 ft for the Valiant B.1, with the extra length giving room for more avionics.|$|E
5000|$|The General Managers {{lived in}} Tondu House until 1940 {{when the house}} was commandeered by the Ministry of Supply for the Pyrotechnic Research Department (PRD), {{evacuated}} from London. The site was chosen {{because it was in}} an elevated and relatively isolated position, some distance from a built-up area and only four miles from ROF Bridgend. This involved Tondu with some very important war work, including the development of incendiary flares that were dropped on targets by <b>Pathfinder</b> <b>aircraft.</b> These aircraft, including the famous Mosquito, would fly ahead of the main bomber force and locate and mark the targets with the flares. PRD was relocated to Langhurst Sussex in 1957, where it merged with the former Flame Warfare Research Establishment.

Most of the damage was in the semi-industrial suburb of Reinickendorf but the city centre and the Siemensstadt (with its many electrical equipment factories), was also hit. A raid was made on Stuttgart by 157 Halifaxes and 21 Lancasters as a diversion. Both bombing forces flew the same route almost as far as Frankfurt which the Luftwaffe fighter controllers identified as the RAF target. The total sorties for the night, including minelaying operations, was 666 with 34 aircraft (5.1%) lost, but the losses over Berlin was high and combined with casualties landing in fog in England, reached 9.3%.
