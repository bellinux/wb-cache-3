30|$|Although DSC/TGA systems share broad commonalities, even {{specific}} {{models are}} often {{available in a}} broad set of configurations to accommodate a variety of sample, measurement, and environment types. The specifics of our instrument are as follows: The system consists of an open-loop, tap-water fed, water-cooled vertical tube furnace with cylindrical graphite resistive heating element that is enveloped in Ultra High Purity Grade Argon gas. The alumina vertical furnace tube of this Setaram 16 / 18 contains a single platinum heat flux pan with two symmetric pockets for holding cylindrical 100  μL alumina crucibles, one for the sample and one for a reference material. This platinum pan is suspended from an alumina rod attached to an electromagnetically stabilized microbalance. In addition to transferring the load to the balance, the rod contains lead wires for a sample thermocouple and heat flow sensor for measuring the heat flux {{across the bottom of}} the two crucibles. During testing, the current compensated balance holds a sample (mass between 50 and 150  mg) and a reference (77  mg of NIST SRM 720 Sapphire rod) at a fixed height in the furnace so long as the balance is within +/− 200  mg of its zero point. This zero point can be adjusted to accommodate a variety of sample and reference masses via the addition and subtraction of tungsten shot from the counterweight arm of the balance. This entire balance, rod and pan assembly is mounted on a vertical moving linear actuator to enable loading and unloading of the pan outside the furnace tube. The balance environment is <b>pressure</b> <b>sealed</b> and coupled with the sample environment. Thus the sample and balance can be purged at various flow rates with a selectable so called carrier gas. In this work, Ar was used at a flow rate of about 1.5  L per hour to purge the sample. Type S Pt/Pt- 10 %Rh thermocouples were used for the sample temperature, heat flow sensor, and the furnace temperature measurement. While sample and heat flow sensors are integrated into the platinum pan on the DSC, the furnace thermocouple is separate and sits just below the pan {{at the end of an}} alumina rod with a notched disk alumina heat shield just below the exposed thermocouple junction. All thermocouple junctions are bare and as small as practical for maximum rate sensitivity.|$|E
40|$|In single bubble {{following}} it's rapid collapse each {{cycle of}} oscillation of an ultrasonic field. Since widely varying length and time scales affect the bubble dynamics and optical emission processes, {{it is difficult}} to anticipate the importance of the effects of gravity present for observations on earth. Our bubble is driven in an acoustically resonating cavity at it's first harmonic mode. The acoustical radiation pressure (Bjerknes force) will then keep it suspended in the center near the pressure antinode. When driven in a region where the diffusive processes balance the bubble it acts in a nonlinear but regular way, emitting a short (approx. 200 ps) burst of light each acoustic cycle. Balancing the Bjerknes force with buoyancy, as in, we can see that the bubble should be displaced from the velocity node approximately 20 m at normal gravity. Therefore, water flows past the bubble at the time of collapse. Gravitation also changes the ambient pressure at the bubble's location, as Delta. P = rho. g. h this gives a change of approximately - 0. 5 % in our experiment when going from 1. 8 g to 0 g. Studies of ambient pressure changes were also done in order to assess these effects. Inside a <b>pressure</b> <b>sealed</b> chamber a spherical glass cell is filled with distilled water which has been degassed to 120 mmHg. A bubble is then trapped in the center and driven by a piezoelectric transducer at 32. 2 kHz attached {{to the side of the}} cell. An optical system is then set up to take strobbed video images along and light emission data simultaneously. Temperature, pressure, drive voltage, and listener voltage are also monitored. PMT output in Volts The radii of the bubbles for both experiment s are fit using the Rayleigh-Plesset equation and the acoustic drive amplitude and the ambient bubble radius are found. There is little change in the acoustic drive amplitude as we expect, since we are not varying the drive voltage. However. the ambient bubble radius goes up considerably. These changes (increased light output, increased maximum bubble radius, and increased ambient bubble radius) are also observed when the ambient pressure is varied in the laboratory by an amount similar to that due to gravitation. The changes in the ambient bubble radius and light output with a change in ambient pressure are predicted by the "dissociation hypothesis" and have been observed by other groups in the laboratory. It seems clear that buoyancy's effect on light output and bubble radius, are at best on the same order as the effects of ambient pressure...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{nanoparticles}} {{as well as}} assembled nanostructures play {{a crucial}} role in the development of new materials. The reason for this is that nanomaterials, with a size ranging from 1 to 100 nm, display significantly different chemical and physical properties in comparison to their bulk (or microscopic) counterpart, including altered optical, magnetic, or electric properties. Especially, gold nanoparticles proved to be very attractive platforms in a broad range of applications from optics to biology because of their inertness, well-established surface chemistry and unique optical properties. Gold nanoparticles feature enhanced light absorption when excited at their plasmonic resonance wavelength, which can be tuned from visible to near infrared light by varying size, shape or interparticle distance. Moreover, nonradiative absorption of gold nanoparticles can rapidly be converted into heat - the photothermal effect - turning them into ideal nano-sources of heat. Although plasmonic applications focused for a long time on the use of the optical properties of gold nanoparticles, light-induced heat has gained more and more attention over the past years. It allows the investigation of thermal events down to the nanoscale remotely controlled through laser irradiation. Hitherto, photothermal applications commonly utilize gold nanoparticles dispersed in various chemical environments, while the use of nanoparticle assemblies on planar substrates would allow the design of functional interfaces. Such substrates would offer a better-defined photothermal profile with potential applications in the fields of nanochemistry and biomolecular manipulation. However, the fabrication of nanoparticle-based surfaces with tuneable optical properties still rely on complex and not scalable procedures, which constitute a major limitation to prepare uniform and robust plasmonic substrates. Therefore, new strategies need to be established to simplify multi-step procedures and simultaneously control the growth, the shape and the arrangement of gold nanoparticles into functional plasmonic interfaces. In the first part of this thesis, homogeneous and micropatterned arrays of gold nanoparticles with different morphologies were generated with a new synthetic technique, called micelle templated photochemistry (manuscript I). By irradiating 6 surfaces made of block copolymer micellar monolayers with ultraviolet light, it is possible to synthesize gold nanoparticles without requiring any commonly used reagents, such as photosensitizers or photoresists. In this method, micelles play the dual role of nanocarriers and reactive templates in order to simultaneously synthesize and organize gold nanoparticles with a high spatial resolution. This novel technique enables the growth, the arrangement and the shaping of gold nanoparticles with tuneable plasmonic resonance wavelengths on glass substrates. Explicitly, it leads to the formation of particle arrays over arbitrarily large areas decorated with either gold deformed nanoparticles (“potatoids”) or nanorings featuring enhanced photothermal properties and high heat-sustainability. Moreover, control over particle distribution is possible at the microscale level in combination with photolithographic techniques. Micropatterning structures enables surface labelling necessary for serial experiments and correlative microscopy. This makes them ideal platforms for fine-tuned heat-manipulation of chemical and biological reactions. In the second part of this work, a new application based on the use of plasmonic substrates was introduced with substantial implications for solvothermal synthesis (manuscript II). Solvothermal synthesis constitutes a well-established chemical method that involves the use of a solvent heated above its boiling point under moderate or high pressure to synthesize inorganic nanomaterials. Experimentally, this approach requires the use of a <b>pressure</b> <b>sealed</b> chamber (autoclave) to avoid solvent evaporation and sustain high pressure. Using illuminated gold nanoparticles as nanosources of heat allows performing solvothermal chemistry at ambient pressure and in an open reaction medium. This method benefits from the possibility for chemical exchange and monitoring during the reaction. The concept was successfully demonstrated by the synthesis of In(OH) 3 nanocrystals at the micrometric scale using optical and thermal microscopy means. The underlying mechanism involves plasmon-assisted superheating of water above its boiling point and displays faster reaction times by decreasing the heated/illuminated region. Due to much faster kinetics and higher spatiotemporal resolution than standard synthetic approaches, this plasmon-assisted method is highly attractive for fundamental 7 research in solvothermal synthesis and could lead to novel applications in the fields of nanomaterials deposition and patterning...|$|E
