40|$|Background: Complex dentitions {{and decline}} in {{adequate}} oral hygiene in elderly {{may lead to}} poor oral health. This may have impact on their general health, wellbeing and quality of life. With increased longevity, the <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> needs in oral health of community dwelling elderly lead to changes in oral health care needs. We identified <b>and</b> prioritized <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> needs in oral health of community dwelling elderly. Methods: The <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> needs in oral health of community dwelling elderly were elicited during focus groups and interviews. The list of <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> needs derived thereof was presented to 97 elderly who prioritized these. Results: Overall, older people appeared {{to be satisfied with}} their current oral health, and the maintenance and care for their oral health. Cost of care was identified as a major problem in general. There are differences in current perceived <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> needs <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> needs anticipated for the future. Perceived current <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> needs concern dental care provision and knowledge on oral health of professionals and patients. For anticipated future <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> needs the importance of daily oral care by caregivers was prioritised, while emphasis was placed on fear of losing autonomy. Conclusion: It is important to take the perspectives and expectations of elderly into account in policy and planning of future oral health care practice, because these differ from the perspectives of dental professionals...|$|R

40|$|Potential {{risk factors}} for conduct <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> {{depressive}} symptoms were tested in a cohort of 10 - to 12 -year-old Ukrainian children (N = 544, 47. 6 % male). Risk factors examined were child emotional lability, child attention problems, poor mother–child communication, coercive maternal discipline, maternal depression, and low marital satisfaction. Results indicated that poor mother–child communication was related to conduct <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms for both boys and girls. In addition, con-duct <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> depression were associated with attention <b>problems</b> for boys <b>and</b> with low marital satisfaction for girls. Emotional lability was related specifically to conduct <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> maternal punishment was related specifically to depressive symptoms.

5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up.

30|$|Among {{the five}} RCT meeting the {{inclusion}} criteria [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], {{the study by}} Holbrook and co-workers did not describe the fracture subtypes considered; Tornetta et al. treated only Gustilo type IIIB fractures; Tu et al. and Mohseni et al. treated both IIIA and IIIB fractures; and Inan et al. considered only IIIA fractures. No study seemed to include IIIC fractures. We divided patients into two approach-based groups: IMN and EF. Of the 57 patients described by Holbrook et al. [8], 29 were treated by IMN and 28 by EF; 2 of the former patients had infection, 7 had fracture healing <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> 12 had “other complications”; of their EF patients 11 had infection, 9 had fracture healing <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> 11 had “other complications”. Tornetta et al. [9] included 29 patients, 14 with IMN and 15 with EF; of those treated with IMN 3 had infection, none had fracture healing <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> 5 had “other complications”; among those managed by EF, there were 6 cases of infection, 2 fracture healing <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> 8 “other complications”. Tu et al. [10] described 36 patients, 18 treated with IMN and 18 with EF; those receiving IMN had 4 infections, 3 fracture healing <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> 2 “other complications”, whereas patients treated with EF had 2 infections, 8 fracture healing <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> 3 “other complications”. Inan et al. [11] treated 61 patients, 29 with IMN and 32 with EF; of the IMN patients, 3 had infection, 4 had fracture healing <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> 7 had “other complications”; of the EF patients, 2 had infection, 4 had fracture healing <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> 3 had “other complications”. Mohseni et al. [12] considered 50 patients, 25 treated by IMN and 25 by EF; of those managed by IMN, 4 developed infection, 1 had fracture healing <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> 2 had “other complications”, whereas of those receiving EF 8 had infection, 8 had fracture healing <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> 3 had “other complications”.|$|R
