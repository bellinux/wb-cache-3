Additionally, such high frequencies virtually eliminates the stroboscopic effect which is very noticeable in those cases when tubes are powered by means of low frequency alternating or <b>pulsating</b> <b>currents</b> as happens when regular 50 or 60 Hz AC mains are used as power source. Transistorized devices are also silent, unlike true Ruhmkorff coils, which make its characteristic buzzing noises when in action, even if they are contained in closed casings or boxes. Indeed, the principle of modern fluorescent portable lamps or lanterns remains the same as in Dumas and Benoit's original mining electric lamp.|$|E

The maps reveal numerous closed depressions and mounds about 50 to 100 m in diameter and 2 to 3 m in relief, presumably related to grounded ice floes common in the area year round. Some of the features were obliterated {{over the course of}} three seasons while new ones formed. Although the depressions resemble kettles, they are formed by very different mechanisms. We believe that these bedforms represent erosion and deposition caused by: a) intensified flow around stationary ice floes serving as obstacles and b) <b>pulsating</b> <b>currents</b> generated by vertical oscillations or rocking motions of grounded floes in a seaway. Because sediment transport occurs around the ice, not where it directly touches the sea floor, the depressions are much larger than the base of the acting floes.

40|$|The {{electrolytic}} capacitor {{is the key}} component that limits the operating lifetime of LED drivers. If an ac-dc LED driver with power factor correction (PFC) control is allowed to output a <b>pulsating</b> <b>current</b> for driving the LEDs, the {{electrolytic capacitor}} {{will no longer be}} required. However, this <b>pulsating</b> <b>current</b> will introduce light flicker that varies at twice the power line frequency. In this paper, a configuration of flicker-free electrolytic capacitor-less single-phase ac-dc driver for LED lighting is proposed. The configuration comprises an electrolytic capacitor-less PFC converter and a bidirectional converter, which serves to absorb the ac component of the <b>pulsating</b> <b>current</b> of the PFC converter, leaving only a dc component to drive the LEDs. The output filter capacitor of the bidirectional converter is intentionally designed to have a large voltage ripple, thus its capacitance can be greatly reduced. Consequently, film capacitors can be used instead of electrolytic capacitors, leading to the realization of a flicker-free ac-dc LED driver that has a long lifetime. The proposed solution is generally applicable to all single-phase PFC converters. A prototype with 48 -V, 0. 7 -A output is constructed and tested.

40|$|Pulse Electrochemical Machining (PECM) is a {{potentially}} cost-effective technology meeting the increasing needs of precision manufacturing of superalloys, like titanium alloys, into complex shapes such as turbine airfoils. This dissertation reports (1) {{an assessment of}} the worldwide state-of-the-art PECM research and industrial practice, (2) PECM process model development, (3) PECM of a superalloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), and (4) key issues in future PECM research. The assessment focuses on identifying dimensional control problems with continuous ECM and how PECM can offer a solution. Previous research on PECM system design, process mechanisms, and dimensional control is analyzed, leading to a clearer understanding of key issues in PECM development such as process characterization and modeling. New interelectrode gap dynamic models describing the gap evolution with time are developed for different PECM processes with an emphasis on the frontal gaps and a typical two-dimensional case. A 2 ̆ 2 PECM cosineθ principle 2 ̆ 2 and several tool design formulae are also derived. PECM processes are characterized using concepts such as quasi-equilibrium gap and dissolution localization. Process simulation is performed to evaluate the effects of process inputs on dimensional accuracy control. Analysis is made on three types (single-phase, homogeneous, and inhomogeneous) of models concerning the physical processes (such as the electrolyte flow, Joule heating, and bubble generation) in the interelectrode gap. A physical model is introduced for the PECM with short pulses, which addresses the effect of electrolyte conductivity change on anodic dissolution. PECM of the titanium alloy is studied from a new perspective on the <b>pulsating</b> <b>currents</b> influence on surface quality and dimension control. An experimental methodology is developed to acquire instantaneous currents and to accurately measure the coefficient of machinability. The influence of pulse parameters on the surface passivation is explained based on the correlation among the instantaneous current, gap resistance, and surface microscopical features. A planned research is also introduced including a new concept of gap on-line recognition. In summary, this dissertation presents PECM problem identification, dynamic and physical modeling, and application to machining a titanium alloy. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} work is aimed {{to obtain an}} analytic expression describing universal magnetic characteristic and enabling {{to take into account}} the demagnetizing effect of the armature. On the basis of the universal magnetic characteristics one need to obtain universal expressions for inductive parameters of electric traction machines of direct and <b>pulsating</b> <b>currents.</b> Methodology. A universal magnetic characteristic (UMC) is the dependence of the relative units of the magnetic flux on the magnetomotive force (MMF) of the excitation winding. Since MMF was built for machines operating under load, therefore, in fact it is a dependency on the MMF and on the MMF of the armature reaction. For the calculation of electromechanical characteristics at constant excitation one can use one of the well-known expressions approximating the UMC. However, during modeling the electric traction engine operation in wide ranges of excitation change it is necessary the expression, in which there is a second variable in the form of MMF of the anchor reaction. Such an expression is also necessary to determine the inductive parameters of electric traction engine, to a large extent dependent on the current. The expression for the approximation of the UMC with two variables can be obtained by analyzing the magnetic field distribution in the air gap at the calculated pole arc. Findings. The author obtained expression for approximation of the UMC, which depends on two variables: MMF of excitation and MMF of armature reaction. For a particular mode of excitation weakening it is possible to convert the expression into the function of one variable, for example, the anchor current. Also, the MMF of excitation winding can be the argument. Originality. For the UMC approximation it was proposed a methodology that makes it possible to record into approximating expression the second variable in the form of the anchor reaction MMF. Practical value. Due to the presence of speed characteristic or saturation ratio of this electric traction engine, one can determine its inductive parameters in a particular operation mode or to obtain their dependencies on the winding currents for all modes of operation...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{intensive}} research on modifying glow-discharge nitriding processes. One {{of the most commonly}} used glow-discharge methods includes cathodic potential nitriding (conventional method), and active screen plasma nitriding. Each of these methods has a number of advantages. One very important, common feature of these techniques is full control of the microstructure, chemical and phase composition, thickness and the surface topography of the layers formed. Another advantage includes the possibility of nitriding such materials as: austenitic steels or nickel alloys, i. e. metallic materials which do not diffuse nitrogen as effectively as ferritic or martensitic steels. However, these methods have some disadvantages as well. In the case of conventional plasma nitriding, engineers {{have to deal with the}} edge effect, which makes it difficult to use this method for complexly shaped components. In turn, in the case of active screen plasma nitriding, the problem disappears. A uniform, smooth layer forms, but is thinner, softer and is not as resistant to friction compared to layers formed using the conventional method. Research is also underway to combine these methods, i. e. use an active screen in conventional plasma nitriding at cathodic potential. However, there is a lack of comprehensive data presenting a comparison between these three nitriding processes and the impact of <b>pulsating</b> <b>current</b> on the formation of the microstructure and functional properties of austenitic steel surfaces.
