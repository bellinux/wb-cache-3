50|$|Occupational Therapy (OT) enables {{individuals}} {{with cerebral palsy}} to participate in {{activities of daily living}} that are meaningful to them. A family-centred philosophy is used with children who have CP. Occupational therapists work closely with families in order to address their concerns and priorities for their child. Occupational therapists may address issues relating to sensory, cognitive, or motor impairments resulting from CP that affect the child's participation in self-care, productivity, or leisure. <b>Parent</b> <b>counselling</b> is also an important aspect of occupational therapy treatment with regard to optimizing the parent's skills in caring for and playing with their child to support improvement of their child's abilities to do things. The occupational therapist typically assesses the child to identify abilities and difficulties, and environmental conditions, such as physical and cultural influences, that affect participation in daily activities. Occupational therapists may also recommend changes to the play space, changes to the structure of the room or building, and seating and positioning techniques to allow the child to play and learn effectively.|$|E
40|$|Background This paper explores {{benefits}} of <b>parent</b> <b>counselling</b> offered alongside music therapy with {{children with autism}} spectrum disorders (ASD). Research {{studies have shown that}} the stress levels of primary caregivers of children with ASD are not only higher than in the general population but also higher than in parents of children with other developmental disabilities. It is therefore recommended that music therapists working with children with ASD also engage and support their parents. Participants and procedure In the international randomised controlled trial TIME-A, which investigates the effects of music therapy on the social communicative skills of autistic children, participating families are offered three <b>parent</b> <b>counselling</b> sessions. For this paper, 68 counselling sessions with 25 families were evaluated; 14 sessions were transcribed and subjected to a content analysis. Case examples illustrate the impact of concomitant <b>parent</b> <b>counselling</b> sessions on the families. Results The analysis generated emerging themes that were grouped into two categories: 1) Non-music therapy specific themes, and 2) Music therapy specific themes. The first category comprised four sub-groups: Exchange of information, Experiences with professionals/friends/society, Worries about the future, Personal/matrimonial problems. Music therapy specific themes were subdivided into the following groups: Working in a partnership, Empowering parents, Celebrating strengths, Rejoicing in child’s enjoyment. Challenges caused by the dual roles of music therapist and parent counsellor were outweighed by the benefits. In addition to the therapeutic effect of counselling, video material from the music therapy sessions helped carers to see their children’s strengths, to gain new ideas, and to develop a more positive outlook. Conclusions The findings support the provision of <b>parent</b> <b>counselling</b> sessions alongside music therapy for children with ASD. This study highlights that extending the role of the music therapist and using video feedback offers encouraging possibilities to further support the wellbeing of the whole family...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1983 Man {{lives in}} a {{constantly}} changing society. As {{a result of these}} changes new problematic situations and circumstances come to the fore, which cause people who are being educated, to experience some or other obstacle. A diagnosis of such a problematic situation or event must be made in order to provide the necessary educative assistance. As such a programme is currently not available, this study was attempted in order to design a diagnostic programme for sociopedagogic <b>parent</b> <b>counselling</b> based on Christian education theoretical premises, a programme which may be effectively applied in practice. A Scriptural approach is utilized in order to construct an ontology of God, a Christian anthropology and a Christian theory of human society. A study of the literature is undertaken in order to determine on which premises some Christian educators base their view of education, the nature of the structure of reality and how these premises are embodied in sociopedagogic practice in relation to society, marriage, the family and the school. The fundamental - reflective method is used in determining the hypotheses, the guidelines for sociopedagogic diagnostic <b>parent</b> <b>counselling</b> programmes, the functional and operational questions to be put and the eventual construction of the programme proposed. The programme thus devised is tested by means of the hypothetical sociopedagogic situation described in the novel Ciske de Rat by Piet Bakker. This novel is chosen because the problematic circumstances surrounding Ciske's education are reflected in the framework of society, marriage, family and school. The answers obtained clearly outline the problematic educational situation in which Ciske found himself. The diagnostic instrument develop through this research is able to determine and interpret the encompassing problematic educational situation and also to dictate the guidelines which may be followed in the ensuing therapeutic programme. A recommendation is made that departments of education give consideration to the possibility of implementing this programme as the official programme to be used in practice. Master...|$|E

40|$|Objective In the UK, 1 in 10 babies require {{specialist}} neonatal care. This {{care can}} last from hours to months {{depending on the}} need of the baby. The increasing survival of very preterm babies has increased neonatal care resource use. Evidence from multiple studies is crucial to identify factors which may be important for predicting length of stay (LOS). The ability to predict LOS is vital for resource planning, decision-making and <b>parent</b> <b>counselling.</b> The objective of this review was to identify which factors are important to consider when predicting LOS in the neonatal unit. Design A systematic review was undertaken which searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus for papers from 1994 to 2016 (May) for research investigating prediction of neonatal LOS. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Quality of each study was discussed, but not used {{as a reason for}} exclusion from the review. Main outcome measure Prediction of LOS in the neonatal unit. Results 9 studies were identified which investigated the prediction of neonatal LOS indicating a lack of evidence in the area. Inherent factors, particularly birth weight, sex and gestational age allow for a simple and objective prediction of LOS, which can be calculated {{on the first day of}} life. However, other early occurring factors may well also be important and estimates may need revising throughout the baby's stay in hospital.

40|$|The current {{democratic}} {{climate in}} South Africa, along with current educational reform {{has called for}} a re-consideration of assessment and intervention procedures in the education and psychology context. Historical procedures of assessment and intervention programmes have been seen to be culturally biased, unfair, and unethical to children. These methods have been further regarded as too simplistic. A call for an approach to assessing and supporting children, which takes into consideration many factors of the child’s environment, has been placed. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the constructivist ecosystemic approach to assessment and intervention used with a case study, Matthew, who was assessed and supported in this approach prior to the onset of this study. A constructivist, ecosystemic assessment process, The Initial Assessment and Consultation (IAC) was used in understanding the child’s development. Such an assessment process called for an ecosystemic intervention programme, including, learning support through the application of the Cognitive Approach to Literacy Instruction (CATLI) as well as play therapy for the child and <b>parent</b> <b>counselling</b> for the parents.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} music therapy may facilitate skills in areas typically affected by autism spectrum disorders such as social interaction and communication. However, generalisability of previous findings has been restricted, as studies were limited in either methodological accuracy or the clinical relevance of their approach. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine effects of improvisational music therapy on social communication skills of children with autism spectrum disorders. An additional aim of the study is to examine if variation in dose of treatment (i. e., number of music therapy sessions per week) affects outcome of therapy, and to determine cost-effectiveness. Methods/Design Children aged between 4; 0 and 6; 11 years who are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions. Parents of all participants will receive three sessions of <b>parent</b> <b>counselling</b> (at 0, 2, and 5 months). In addition, children randomised to the two intervention groups will be offered individual, improvisational music therapy over a period of five months, either one session (low-intensity) or three sessions (high-intensity) per week. Generalised effects of music therapy will be measured using standardised scales completed by blinded assessors (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, ADOS) and parents (Social Responsiveness Scale, SRS) before and 2, 5, and 12 months after randomisation. Cost effectiveness will be calculated as man years. A group sequential design with first interim look at N = 235 will ensure both power and efficiency. Discussion Responding to the need for more rigorously designed trials examining the effectiveness of music therapy in autism spectrum disorders, this pragmatic trial sets out to generate findings that will be well generalisable to clinical practice. Addressing the issue of dose variation, this study's results will also provide information on the relevance of session frequency for therapy outcome.
