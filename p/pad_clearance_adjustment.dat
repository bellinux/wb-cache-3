40|$|A novel {{tilting pad}} journal bearing model {{including}} pivot flexibility {{as well as}} temporal fluid inertia effects on the thin film fluid flow aims to accurately predict the bearing forced performance. The predictive model also accounts for the thermal energy transport effects in a TPJB. A Fortran program with an Excel GUI models TPJBs and delivers predictions of the bearing static and dynamic forced performance. The calculation algorithm uses a Newton-Raphson procedure for successful iterations on the equilibrium pad radial and transverse displacements and journal center displacements, even for bearings pads with very soft pivots. The predictive model accounts for the effect of film temperature on the operating bearing and <b>pad</b> <b>clearances</b> by calculating the thermal expansion of the journal and pad surfaces. The pad inlet thermal mixing coefficient (lambda) influences moderately the predicted fluid film temperature field. Pad pivot flexibility decreases significantly and dominates the bearing stiffness and damping coefficients when the pivot stiffness is lower than 10 % of the fluid film stiffness coefficients (with rigid pivots). Pivot flexibility has a more pronounced effect on reducing the bearing damping coefficients than the stiffness coefficients. Pad pivot flexibility may still affect the bearing behavior at a light load condition for a bearing with a large pad preload. Pad pivot flexibility, {{as well as the}} fluid inertia and the pads? mass and mass moment of inertia, could influence the bearing impedance coefficients, in particular at high whirl frequencies. The stiffness and damping coefficients of a TPJB increase with a reduction in the operating bearing and <b>pad</b> <b>clearances.</b> The work delivers a predictive tool benchmarked against a number of experimental results for test bearings available in the recent literature. The static and dynamic forced performance characteristics of actual TPJBs can not be accurately predicted unless their pad flexibility and pivot flexibility, fluid film temperature, pad inlet thermal mixing coefficient, operating bearing and <b>pad</b> <b>clearances,</b> among others are well known in advance. However, the extensive archival literature showcasing test procedures and experimental results for TPJBs does not report the above parameters.

The three seal designs included solid-ring fluid-film seals often referred to as floating ring seals, back-to-back fluid-film face seals, and a circumferential sectored seal that incorporated inherent <b>clearance</b> <b>adjustment</b> capabilities. Of the three seals designed, the sectored seal is favored because the self-adjusting clearance features accommodate the variations in clearance that will occur because of thermal and centrifugal distortions without compromising performance.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have compared predicted stiffness and damping coefficients for tilting-pad journal bearings (TPJBs) to measurements. Most {{have found that}} direct damping is consistently overpredicted. The thrust {{of this research is}} to explain the difference between measured and predicted stiffness and damping coefficients for TPJBs, and to provide some confidence to designers that TPJB dynamic coefficients can be accurately predicted. 	Most analytical models for TPJBs are {{based on the assumption that}} explicit dependence on pad motion can be eliminated by assuming harmonic rotor motion such that the amplitude and phase of pad motions resulting from radial and transverse rotor motions are predicted by rotor-pad transfer functions. In short, these transfer functions specify the amplitude and phase of pad motion (angular, radial, translational, etc.) in response to an input rotor motion. 	A new pad perturbation model is developed including the effects of angular, radial, and circumferential pad motion and changes in <b>pad</b> <b>clearance</b> due to <b>pad</b> bending compliance. Though all of these pad variables have previously been included in different analyses, there are no publications containing perturbations of all four variables. In addition, previous {{researchers have}} only perturbed the journal, while both the bearing and journal motions are perturbed in the present analysis, and the applicability of comparing rotor-perturbed bearing impedance predictions to impedances measured on a bearing-perturbed test rig is discussed. This perturbation model was implemented in a Reynolds-based TPJB code to predict the frequency-dependent bearing impedances and rotor-pad transfer functions. 	Direct measurements of pad motion during test excitation were recorded to produce measured transfer functions between rotor and pad motion, and a comparison between these measurements and predictions is given. Motion probes were added to the loaded pad (having the static load vector directed through its pivot) of a 5 -pad TPJB to obtain accurate measurement of pad radial and tangential motion, as well as tilt, yaw, and pitch. Strain gages were attached to the side of the loaded pad to measure static and dynamic bending strains, which were then used to determine static and dynamic changes in <b>pad</b> curvature (<b>pad</b> <b>clearance).</b> 	Good agreement was found between the amplitude of the measured and predicted transfer functions concerning radial and transverse pad motions throughout the range of speeds and loads tested, while pad tilt was moderately underpredicted. 	For the bearing investigated, radial pad motions resulting from pivot compliance were as large as 60 % of the radial component of shaft motion when operating at 4400 rpm under heavily loaded conditions. Hence, if a dynamic load applied to the shaft resulted in a shaft displacement of 25 microns (1 mil), the pad would displace radially 15 microns (0. 6 mils), and the fluid film height would only decrease by 10 microns (0. 4 mils). The consequence of this pad motion is that fluid film stiffness and damping forces produced by relative rotor-pad motions are significantly reduced, resulting in a bearing having significantly less direct stiffness and damping than predicted. A similar effect occurs when shaft motions produce significant changes in <b>pad</b> <b>clearance</b> due to <b>pad</b> compliance. For the pad tested here, the measurements show that predicting TPJB stiffness and damping coefficients without accounting for pad and pivot compliance will produce large errors, and is not advised. 	Transverse pad motion was predicted and observed. Based on phase measurements, this motion is lightly damped, and appears to be caused by pivot deflection instead of slipping. Despite observing a lightly damped phase change, an increase in magnitude at this natural frequency was not observed. 	Predicted direct stiffness and damping for unit loads from 0 - 3200 kPa (0 - 450 psi) fit through 1. 5 ? running speed are within 18 % of measurements at 4400 rpm, while predictions at 10200 rpm are within 10 % of measurements. This is a significant improvement on the accuracy of predictions cited in literature. 	 	Comparisons between predictions from the developed bearing model neglecting pad, pivot, and pad and pivot flexibility show that predicted direct stiffness and damping coefficients for a model having a rigid pad and pivot are overestimated, respectively, by 202 % and 811 % at low speeds and large loads, by 176 % and 513 % at high speeds and high loads, and by 51 % and 182 % at high speeds and light loads. While the reader is likely questioning the degree to which these predictions are overestimated in regard to previous comparisons, these predictions are based on measured operating bearing clearances, which are 20 - 30 % smaller than the cold bearing clearances that previous comparisons were based on. 	The effect of employing a full bearing model (retaining all of the pad degrees of freedom) versus a reduced bearing model (where only journal degrees of freedom are retained) in a stability calculation for a realistic rotor-bearing system is assessed. For the bearing tested, the bearing coefficients reduced at the frequency of the unstable eigenvalue (subsynchronously reduced) predicted a destabilizing cross-coupled stiffness coefficient at the onset of instability within 1 % of the full model, while synchronously reduced coefficients for the lightly loaded bearing required 25 % more destabilizing cross-coupled stiffness than the full model to cause system instability. This overestimation of stability is due to an increase in predicted direct damping at the synchronous frequency over the subsynchronously reduced value. This increase in direct damping with excitation frequency was also seen in highly loaded test data at frequencies below approximately 2 ?running speed, after which direct damping decreased with increasing excitation frequency. This effect was more pronounced in predictions, occurring at all load and speed combinations. 	The same stability calculation was performed using measured stiffness and damping coefficients at synchronous and subsynchronous frequencies at 10200 rpm. It was found that both the synchronously measured stiffness and damping and predictions using the full bearing model were more conservative than the model using subsynchronously measured stiffness and damping. This outcome contrasts with the comparison between models using synchronously and subsynchronously reduced impedance predictions, which showed the subsynchronously reduced model to be the most conservative. This contrast results from a predicted increase in damping with increasing excitation frequency at all speeds and loads, while this increase in damping with increasing excitation frequency was only measured at the most heavily loaded conditions...|$|R
40|$|Static {{and dynamic}} {{performance}} test results are provided for a horizontal-application three-lobe bearing evaluated {{over the following}} range of static-load orientations (all taken from {{the leading edge of}} the loaded pad) : 0 ?, 20 ?, 30 ?, 40 ?, 60 ?, 80 ?, 90 ?, and 100 ?. This bearing has the following specifications: 100 ? pad arc angle, 0. 52 preload, 70 % offset, 101. 74 mm (4. 0057 in) minimum bore diameter, 0. 116 mm (7. 55 mils) radial <b>pad</b> <b>clearance,</b> and 76. 3 mm (3 in) axial length. The static and dynamic test results are evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the bearing to changes in the static load direction. The two questions the study aims to answer are: (1) ?Is an offset three-lobe bearing a good choice when the radial static load vector represents an unknown variable?? and (2) ?Can an offset three-lobe bearing be oriented advantageously with a known load direction?? Both the static and dynamic test results are compared to predictions obtained from a fixed-arc bearing Reynolds equation solver. Predictions using both the measured hot clearance and measured cold clearance as inputs are compared to the measured data. Dynamic tests show that the horizontal-application three-lobe bearing is sensitive to load orientation at low speeds and high loads. Whirl-frequency ratios (WFR) at 6750 rpm with loads of 1149 kPa, 1723 kPa, and 2298 kPa are equal to zero for loads oriented towards {{the leading edge of the}} pad, and between 0. 35 and 0. 5 for loads oriented towards the trailing edge of the pad. This same general trend can be seen for WFR values at 9000 rpm and 10800 rpm. The horizontal-application three-lobe bearing is not sensitive to load orientation at high speeds and light loads. At 13200 rpm, measured WFRs are between 0. 3 and 0. 7 at all loads and for all load orientations. Measured WFR at the no-load condition are between 0. 45 and 0. 7 for all cases. Stiffness orthotropy was found to vary significantly with load orientation. At 6750 rpm and 2298 kPa, the bearing is most orthotropic when the static load orientation is 30 ? and 40 ?, with K_(yy) being larger than K_(xx) by approximately 800 MN/m. At 13200 rpm and 2298 kPa, the bearing is most orthotropic for the 40 ? and 100 ? load orientations, with K_(yy) being larger than K_(xx) by approximately 800 MN/m. Overall, it is concluded that the three-lobe bearing is not a good choice when the load direction is unknown, as the bearing can have different rotordynamic coefficients with different load orientations. Also, at high speeds, the three-lobe bearing cannot be oriented advantageously with a known load direction to enhance stability, as the WFR of the three-lobe bearing tested is largely independent of load direction. However, the three-lobe bearing can be oriented advantageously to split/change a critical speed, since the direct stiffness and stiffness orthotropy change with load direction. Additionally, dynamic performance test results are provided for a vertical-application (nominally unloaded) three-lobe bearing. The vertical-application bearing has the following specifications: 100 ? pad arc angle, 0. 64 preload, 100 % offset, 101. 74 mm (4. 0057 in) nominal diameter, 0. 116 mm (5. 27 mils) radial <b>pad</b> <b>clearance,</b> 76. 3 mm (3 in) axial length, and 100 ? static load orientation from the leading edge of the loaded pad. The performance of this bearing is evaluated to determine: (1) whether a fully (100 %) offset three-lobe bearing configuration is more stable in terms of the WFR than a standard plain journal bearing and (2) whether a fully offset three-lobe bearing provides a larger direct stiffness (centering force) than a standard fixed-arc bearing. Dynamic tests show that the vertical-application three-lobe bearing does not improve stability over conventional plain journal bearings. The measured WFRs for the vertical-application bearing are approximately 0. 4 - 0. 5 for nearly all test cases. Predicted WFRs are 0. 46 at all test points. The vertical-application bearing dimensionless direct stiffness coefficients are compared to those for the horizontal-application bearing. The equivalent stiffness for the vertical-application bearing is larger than that of the horizontal-application bearing by a factor of 1. 33 at 6750 rpm and a factor of 1. 25 at 9000 rpm. Thus, the vertical-application bearing does impart a larger centering force to the journal relative to the horizontal-application bearing when the journal is not carrying a radial static load...|$|R

The three-dimensional flow in the semi-open impeller and volute of a centrifugal pump is numerically simulated. The main advantage of semi-open impeller centrifugal pump is its efficiency which can be considered constant thanks to the <b>clearance</b> <b>adjustment.</b> In addition this kind of impeller is less likely to clog with solid bodies (important in case of slurry-processing). The open impeller has all the parts visible, so it is easier to inspect for wear and damages. Eventually it is lighter than a shrouded impeller: it can spin faster. The stress due to centrifugal force is indeed a limit for the speed of this machines. On the other hand its main disadvantage if compared to a shrouded pump is its lower efficiency due to the heavier tip leakage. In addition it cannot be employed in case of explosive products: the risk of contact between impeller and volute causing sparks is not negligible.

The performance of the machine handling both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are also investigated. The numerical models and the results of the different computational strategies were compared with the experimental data and the accuracy of different software is evaluated in the case of Newtonian model. It is well known that the performance of a centrifugal pump drops processing a viscous fluid. Even so the behavior during the pumping of non-Newtonian fluids has not been investigated so far.

At 3 weeks of age, growth of the mammary epithelial tree is confined to the vicinity of the nipple and the fat pad is largely devoid of mammary epithelium, but by 7 weeks of age the epithelial ductal tree extends throughout the entire fat pad.

The bearing has the following design parameters: 4 pads with pad arc angle 72 o and 50 % pivot offset, pad axial length 0. 0762 m (3 in), <b>pad</b> radial <b>clearance</b> 0. 254 mm (0. 010 in), bearing radial clearance 0. 1905 mm (0. 0075 in), preload 0. 25 and shaft nominal diameter of 0. 11684 m (4. 600 in). The dynamic coefficients and the static performance parameters of the FPB have been compared with the theoretical predictions using the isothermal analysis from the rotordynamic software suite XLTRC 2 -XLTFPBrg. The bearing shows a small attitude angle, about 10 o, which indicates small crosscoupling stiffnesses. The pad temperatures increase in the circumferential direction of rotation with speed and load. The pads maximum temperature was measured near the trailing edge. The dependency of the stiffness and damping coefficients on the excitation frequency has been studied. The frequency dependency in the dynamic coefficients was removed by introducing an added mass coefficient to the bearing model. The direct added mass coefficients were around 32 kg. The direct stiffness and damping coefficients increase with load, while increasing and decreasing with rotor speed, respectively. A small whirl frequency ratio (WFR) was found of about 0. 15, and it decreases with load and increases with speed. A comparison between the dynamic stiffnesses using a Reynolds equation and the bulk-flow Navier-Stokes models with the experimental dynamic stiffnesses shows that the Reynolds model (even for laminar flows) is not adequate, and that the bulk-flow model {{should be used for}} rotordynamic coefficients prediction.

The bearing design parameters include: 4 pads with pad arc angle 72 ???? and 50 % pivot offset, pad axial length 0. 0762 m (3 in), <b>pad</b> radial <b>clearance</b> 0. 254 mm (0. 010 in), bearing radial clearance 190. 5 ????m (0. 0075 in), preload 0. 25, and shaft nominal diameter of 0. 11684 m (4. 600 in). An important {{distinction between the two}} sets of tests is the difference in experimental bearing radial clearance, which for this case measured 208 ????m (0. 00082 in), and for Al-Ghasem??????s was 165. 1 ????m (0. 0065 in). The rotordynamic coefficients are determined experimentally using a test rig equipped with motion and load sensors. The rig is modeled using Newton??????s laws, which is converted from the time to frequency domain using Fourier Transform to give complex dynamic stiffnesses. From the resulting complex dynamic stiffnesses the associated real and imaginary components are plotted as a function of excitation frequency and curve fitted via linear regression to give the rotordynamic coefficients. The primary objectives were to determine whether the real component of the complex dynamic stiffnesses could be better modeled with or without the mass coefficient and to contrast the rotordynamic coefficients with an analytical model. Only in the load range of 1 to 2. 2 MPa were the unloaded direct mass coefficients near or at 0, which would allow for a [K][C] model to be used. The remaining real components are better represented with the mass term. The analytical model generally overpredicted the stiffness, damping and mass coefficients, especially for the direct components; the trends were generally consistent...|$|R
40|$|AbstractZonisamide is a {{synthetic}} 1, 2 -benzisoxazole- 3 -methanesulfonamide with anticonvulsant properties. The sulfamoyl group on zonisamide {{was expected to}} suppress seizures {{in a manner similar}} to another sulfonamide analogue, acetazolamide, through inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. However, this does not appear to be the primary mechanism of action since zonisamide requires much higher doses than acetazolamide to achieve equivalent titration in vivo. Studies with cultured neurons indicate that zonisamide blocks repetitive firing of voltage-sensitive sodium channels and reduces voltage-sensitive T-type calcium currents without affecting L-type calcium currents. Its dual mechanism of action may explain its efficacy in patients resistant to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Zonisamide has a pharmacokinetic profile favorable for clinical use. It is rapidly and completely absorbed and has a long half-life (63 – 69 h in healthy volunteers) which allows twice-daily, or even once-daily, dosing. Zonisamide is not highly bound to plasma proteins. Consequently, it does not affect protein binding of other highly protein-bound AEDs. Furthermore, zonisamide does not induce its own metabolism and does not induce liver enzymes. However, since zonisamide is metabolized by cytochrome P 450, liver enzyme-inducing AEDs will increase zonisamide <b>clearance,</b> and dosage <b>adjustments</b> may be necessary when it is used in combination with certain AEDs...|$|R
40|$|Background: DUE (Drug Utilization Evaluation) {{studies can}} help {{identify}} and correct {{problems associated with}} irrational use of drugs. Considering lack of data regarding how rational vancomycin is being used, we evaluated this DUE study in a referral infectious center to evaluate compliance with guidelines in terms of rational use of this valuable antibiotic. Methods: This retrospective study was done for 6 months from March to September 2012 at Razi hospital, an educational hospital affiliated to Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. Data including patients’ demographics, vancomycin dose, kidney function assessment, dose adjustments, sampling and culture were collected. Based on the HICPAC (Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee) and Up-to-date 2012 advices, the concordance of practice with standard guidelines was assessed. Results: One hundred and forty six medical records were reviewed in this study. Fever and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms {{at the time of}} initiation of vancomycin. Skin infections, lower respiratory tract infection and septicemia were the most common initial diagnosis of patients. Sampling was done in almost one-third of patients. Most of patient with a specific order were received vancomycin in half an hour. Considering the indication, Vancomycin was administered appropriately in 58 percent of patients. Conclusion: Vancomycin was used irrationally in a great proportion of patients. The main observed drawbacks were empiric use of vancomycin without subsequent adjustment of antimicrobial agent according to culture and sensitivity data and lack of paying enough attention to calculation of creatinine <b>clearance</b> and dosage <b>adjustment.</b> </p...|$|R

It is {{an ideal}} antibiotic for treatment of serious nosocomial infections and severe sepsis for its exceptionally high efficiency and broad antibacterial spectrum of action. Doripenem is eliminated mainly by the kidneys. In cases of acute kidney injury, dosing of doripenem depends on creatinine <b>clearance</b> and requires <b>adjustments.</b> Doripenem is eliminated during hemodialysis because its molecular weight is 300 – 400 Da. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the impact of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) on doripenem serum concentrations in a population of intensive-therapy patients with life-threatening infections and severe sepsis. Ten patients were enrolled in this observational study. Twelve blood samples were collected during the first administration of doripenem in a 1 -hour continuous infusion while CRRT SLED was provided. Fluid chromatography was used for measurement of the concentration of doripenem in serum. In all collected samples, concentration of doripenem was above the minimum inhibition concentration of this antibiotic. Based on these results, we can draw the conclusion that doripenem concentration is above the minimum inhibition ­concentration throughout all of CRRT. The dosing pattern proposed by the manufacturer can be used in patients receiving CRRT SLED without necessary modifications.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in aerostatic thrust bearings have included: (a) the porous aerostatic thrust bearing containing a porous pad and (b) the inherently compensated compliant surface aerostatic thrust bearing containing a thin elastomer layer. Both these developments {{have been reported}} to improve the bearing load capacity compared to conventional aerostatic thrust bearings with rigid surfaces. This development is carried one stage further in a porous and compliant aerostatic thrust bearing incorporating both a porous pad and an opposing compliant surface. The thin elastomer layer forming the compliant surface is bonded to a rigid backing and is of a soft rubber like material. Such a bearing is studied experimentally and theoretically under steady state operating conditions. A mathematical model is presented to predict the bearing performance. In this model is a simplified solution to the elasticity equations for deflections of the compliant surface. Account is also taken of deflections in the porous pad due to the pressure difference across its thickness. The lubrication equations for flow in the porous <b>pad</b> and bearing <b>clearance</b> are solved by numerical finite difference methods. An iteration procedure is used to couple deflections of the compliant surface and porous pad with solutions to the lubrication equations. Comparisons between experimental results and theoretically predicted bearing performance are in good agreement. However these results show that the porous and compliant aerostatic thrust bearing performance is lower than that of a porous aerostatic thrust bearing with a rigid surface in place of the compliant surface. This discovery is accounted to the recess formed in the bearing clearance by deflections of the compliant surface and its effect on flow through the porous pad...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of occlusal forces(the contractile force of masticatory muscles) exerted during occlusal adjustment on the distribution of the forces among teeth, implants, and TMJs in intercuspal clenching in cases with bilateral missing molars and premolars by using finite element analysis. Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional finite element model of the mandible with eight implants in the premolar and molar regions was constructed. Linearly elastic material properties were defined for all elements except the periodontal ligament, which was defined as nonlinearly elastic. The TMJs and antagonists were simplified and replaced with nonlinear springs. Antagonists were assumed to be natural teeth or implants and had two- or three-stage displaceability. We constructed FE models in which occlusal adjustment with three kinds of occlusal force (40 N as a light bite, 200 N as a hard bite, and 400 N as a maximum biting force) was performed. The <b>clearance</b> by occlusal <b>adjustment</b> was decided beforehand with a trial-and-error method so that the occlusal forces were distributed similarly to the distribution of the natural dentition. Each model was evaluated under loads of 40 N, 100 N, 200 N, 400 N, and 800 N to determine the distribution of occlusal forces on the teeth and implants. Results: The occlusal forces were concentrated on the most posterior implants while the load was larger, and the percentage of bearing force at the TMJ was small, and vice versa. Conclusion: Maximum biting force was better for occlusal adjustment to prevent overloading of the most posterior implant...|$|R
40|$|Adequate sealing in {{turbomachinery}} reduces secondary leakage {{and results}} in more efficient and stable systems. Labyrinth seals are most common, although brush seals are popular in specialized applications. The Hybrid Brush Seal (HBS) is a novel design that adds to the bristle brush matrix a number of cantilever pads that rest on the rotor surface. Upon shaft rotation the pads lift due to the generation of a hydrodynamic gas film while the brushes effectively seal an upstream pressure. Hence the HBS has no wear and no local thermal distortion effects. Measurements of leakage versus pressure differential are obtained in a three-teeth labyrinth, a conventional brush seal, and a hybrid brush seal for operation at high temperature (300 ?C), with shaft surface speeds to 27 m/s, and at supply pressures to 3. 5 bar. Flow measurements are presented {{in terms of a}} flow factor to remove dependency on the air temperature and supply pressure. The measurements demonstrate the HBS leaks less (~ 61 %) than a standard brush seal and is significantly better (~ 38 %) than a similarly sized labyrinth seal. Predictions of flow through a labyrinth seal predict well at supply pressures under 1. 7 bar but overpredict by as much as 25 % at high supply pressures. A porous medium fluid flow model predicts the flow through the HBS and brush seal. The model for the HBS and brush seal underpredicts the flow rate at low supply pressures but match well at high supply pressures. Measurements of the drag torque of the test seals show the HBS has a larger torque when pressurized compared to the brush seal and labyrinth seal. This indicates that the HBS experiences a larger degree of blow-down due to the <b>pads</b> decreasing the <b>clearance.</b> The mechanical parameters of the brush seal and HBS are found based upon the flexibility function from impact load tests. A combined structural and dry friction damping model represent well the measured flexibility. An equivalent damping is found based upon the energy dissipation. Based upon the damping ratio, the HBS has twice of the viscous damping as the brush seal at a supply pressure of 2. 0 bar...|$|R
