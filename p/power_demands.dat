25|$|The SIMD vector {{processor}} (VMX128) was modified for the Xbox {{to include a}} dot-product instruction. The dot-product instruction took far less latency than discrete instructions. The VMX128 was also modified {{by the addition of}} direct 3D (D3D) compressed data format. This led to an approximate 50 percent savings in required band-width and memory footprint making the CPU having a theoretical peak performance of 115.2GFLOPS, being capable of 9.6 billion dot products per second. Each core of the CPU was capable of simultaneous multithreading and was clocked at 3.2GHz. However, to reduce CPU die size, complexity, cost, and <b>power</b> <b>demands,</b> the processor used in-order execution in contrast to the Intel Coppermine 128-based Pentium III used in the original Xbox, which used more complex out of order execution. The original chip used a 90nm process, although a newer 65nm process SOI revision was implemented on later models, which was in-turn superseded by a 45nm combined CPU and GPU chip. A 21.6GB/s front side bus, aggregated 10.8GB/s upstream and downstream, connected Xenon with the graphics processor/northbridge. Xenon was equipped with an 8th way set associative 1MB Level 2 cache on-die running at half CPU clock speed. This cache was shared amongst the three CPU cores. Each core had separate L1 caches, each containing a two-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 instruction cache and a four-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 data cache. The write-through data cache did not allocate cache lines on writes. The CPU also contained ROM storing Microsoft private encrypted keys, used to decrypt game data. The heat sink implemented to cool the Xenon CPU was composed of aluminum fins with a copper base, and a heat pipe. Newer revisions, which had a smaller core, do not feature the heat pipe or copper base. The heat sink was cooled by two 70mm fans {{at the rear of the}} console on original-style consoles, while a single fan mounted on the side of the consoles was used in Xbox 360 S consoles. There were several types of fan used in Xbox 360s, which were produced by Nidec, Sunon and Delta Electronics.|$|E

They account for nearly 20 % of the peak <b>power</b> <b>demand</b> and 15 % of the annual energy consumption. Thus energy efficient lighting systems and their smart operation can be very effective in reducing the national peak power and energy consumption, particularly for a country like Kuwait where <b>power</b> <b>demand</b> grew from 6750 MW in 2001 to 9075 MW in 2007 (MEW, 2002 - 2008).

40|$|The Department of Defense (DoD) is researching {{methods to}} enhance energy {{security}} and reduce energy costs.

A microgrids <b>power</b> <b>demand</b> {{and the benefits of}} a microgrid integrated with a power electronics enabled Energy Management System (EMS) is investigated in this thesis. The <b>power</b> <b>demand</b> of a single family household is analyzed. The peak <b>power</b> <b>demand</b> of the single family household displays the drawbacks of peak <b>power</b> <b>demand</b> on the commercial electricity grid and the installations receiving power from it. Drawbacks include reduced energy security due to blackouts and increased cost as a result of meeting the peak demand.

A second benefit is reduced <b>power</b> <b>demand</b> on the commercial electricity grid during peak <b>power</b> <b>demand</b> or on distributed resources (DR) while islanded by performing peak power control.

2500|$|The first {{hydroelectric}} power station was built in 1890 just below the confluence of Red Tarn Beck and Glenridding Beck.

From there it was piped down to a water turbine driving a dynamo which produced a 600volt DC supply. Copper cables took this to the mine, through the Low Horse Level and down the Low Level Shaft to a switchroom in Warsop's Crosscut. As the mine deepened, <b>power</b> <b>demands</b> increased. In 1899 a second turbine and a 500volt dynamo was installed in the power station.

New equipment was put into the power station in 1911 to produce a 2,000 volt threephase AC supply.
