50|$|Jehner was born, {{the last}} of {{eighteen}} children, in Queen's Head Court, Great Windmill Street, Westminster, London to Johan Jehner, a German-born gunsmith silver <b>planisher.</b> His mother died whilst he was an infant. At the age of eleven years he damaged his legs leaving him of limited stature and disabled. Jehner later wrote of his childhood claiming that he was taught to read eating gingerbread letters. His father mixed {{with a group of}} artists and the young Jehner got himself apprenticed to an elderly draughtsman. His master retired and set Jehner up with basic equipment. Despite his disability he obtained work with the mezzotint engraver William Pether. Jehner realised that there was a large but competitive business for prints and if he was to gain more business he decided to learn how to paint in oils.Jehner and Elizabeth, his wife, went to Lille where Jehner learnt about painting and also made a useful business contact in Marmaduke Gwynne (a relative of Marmaduke Gwynne who was an early Welsh Methodist) who bought his prints and introduced him to useful contacts. Gwynn and Jehner resolved to return to the United Kingdom, but Jehner was delayed due to a problem with his passport.|$|E
40|$|Hand-operated tool repairs weld {{defects in}} large-diameter, {{thin-walled}} stainless steel tubes. Tool {{consists of a}} three-roll external <b>planisher</b> and an internal backup mandrel, both hydraulically pressurized by hand pumps, and an external restraining mandrel, which keeps the tube from turning during the planishing operations...|$|E
5000|$|There are {{hundreds}} of tools which can be used. They are generally made by the jeweller/crafts person. They are typically made from bars of tool steel, which is forged and tempered at the tip. These hardened steel punches may be purchased by a supplier, but the specialized punches are made by the jeweler or special ordered to suit a particular design. [...] A saw {{can be used to}} cut designs into the tip for making patterns, or the tool can be hammered onto a patterned surface, which will indent the tip. The end of the tool which is to be hammered should be bevelled to allow for expansion of the metal from repeated hammering. Some of the main styles of tool include: Liners, <b>planishers,</b> matting, and doming. Liners have thin tips, which are slightly rounded. If they are too thin they will cut the metal. They are used in the initial marking out of the design, and in the finishing stages to refine any thin outlines. <b>Planishers</b> have smooth, flat tips which are used for pushing out large, flat areas of metal. Matting tools have patterns cut into them, and provide detail to areas of the design. Matting tools can also be made by filing a thin line around a steel bar, hardening it, then snapping it. This will result in a fine grain pattern. Doming tools push out rounded areas of metal, and can either be round or oval, quite pointed or almost flat. An oxyacetylene torch, coal forge or propane forge is required for heating the steel sufficiently for forging. The more tools available, the easier it is to create a detailed, accurate piece.|$|R
