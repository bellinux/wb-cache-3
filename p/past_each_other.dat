5|$|The Carnegie Ridge is sliding under Ecuadorian land, causing coastal uplift and volcanism. The ridge's {{movement}} {{may also}} have changed the type of faulting along the coast, causing strike-slip faults (faults that move horizontally <b>past</b> <b>each</b> <b>other).</b> Evidence of this subduction altering the course of faulting is found at the Yaquina fault, which, {{unlike the rest of}} the Panama Basin faults, trends to the west instead of north-south, indicating that the Carnegie Ridge may be colliding with the continental mass of Ecuador. This collision created northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest-trending faults in the region, and with that, caused strong earthquakes in Riobamba in 1797 and Alausi in 1961. Several of the northwest-southeast-trending faults converge in the Inter-Andean Valley where the 1949 Ambato earthquake took place.|$|E

5|$|The boron {{nitrides}} are {{notable for}} {{the variety of}} structures that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure, called cubic boron nitride (tradename Borazon), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds {{can be viewed as}} a coordinate covalent bond, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acidic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip <b>past</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.|$|E

25|$|Calder {{then moved}} south to intercept, while Villeneuve {{assembled}} his force into {{the line of}} battle and began moving north. The two fleets moved slowly <b>past</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> before Calder came about by tacking in succession and began to close on the enemy's rear. The action eventually began when the frigate , in the van of the British fleet, attempted to attack the French frigate Siréne, trailing in the rear. Fearing the British were attempting to cut off his rear, Villeneuve brought his fleet about and the Spanish van opened fire on the leading British ships at about 5.30pm. The action quickly became general, but in the failing light, mist and gunsmoke both fleets soon became scattered. By the time the action broke off at 9.30pm, two Spanish ships had been isolated and captured. Both fleets were still scattered the following day. They continued to observe each other, but neither made an attempt to resume the action, and despite more favourable winds on 24 July, Calder declined to give battle. By 25 July the fleets had drifted {{out of sight of}} each other, at which point Villeneuve sailed south to Vigo, while Calder headed east.

25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move <b>past</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E
