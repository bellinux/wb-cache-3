50|$|Among over 150 {{species of}} {{butterflies}} {{recorded in the}} national park, there are several species included in Red Book of the Republic of Armenia. Those are <b>Parnassius</b> mnemosyne, <b>Parnassius</b> <b>apollo,</b> Papilio alexanor, Pontia chloridice, Colias aurorina, Polyommatus zarathustra, and others.

50|$|The {{vicinity}} of the village was designated as a Prime Butterfly Area, due to rich species diversity that includes number of rare and endangered butterflies, such as Pyrgus alveus, Pyrgus jupei, <b>Parnassius</b> mnemosyne, <b>Parnassius</b> <b>apollo,</b> Pieris bryoniae, Colias thisoa, Erebia graucasica, Satyrus effendi, Boloria caucasica, Maculinea arion, Eumedonia eumedon, Polyommatus dorylas, Agrodiaetus damon, and Agrodiaetus altivagans.|$|R
25|$|There is {{variation}} in size between the isolated populations.

50|$|After a first note {{published}} in the journal Alexanor, Pierre Capdeville wished to publish a more detailed study on the <b>Parnassius</b> <b>apollo.</b> Jean Bourgogne, then director of the publication, found the work too voluminous. He contacted then the company Sciences Nat which looked for authors. This work was {{published in}} 6 parts bilingual French-German. As author, Pierre Capdeville took care himself of all the part illustration, maps and photography of specimens of his collection.|$|R
25|$|Another {{possible}} cause of extinction is the interesting connection between nectar plant distribution and the <b>Parnassius</b> <b>apollo.</b> If there was present a constraint of migration from nectar plant populations to another the red Apollo's population would slowly dissipate and reproduction might seize. This {{is because the}} outcrop of the nectar plants are the sight of reproduction and if the spatial structure is too far for the butterfly to migrate to {{the dynamics of the}} population is in danger.|$|R
40|$|After {{examining}} the flight pattern of <b>Parnassius</b> <b>apollo</b> males {{we have discovered}} that the patrolling strategy of that species {{can be divided into}} two modes – random flights exhibited when females were abundant and there was limited time for flight (bad weather conditions), and scanning flights when the population was sparse and favourable climatic conditions allowed undisrupted flight. According to the field observations we have assumed that time limited by weather conditions and female abundance on the field causes the switch in the male’s flight mode. The assumption was simulated on the computer where on the “field ” of 10000 cells two patterns of male flights were examined. The computer simulation confirmed our supposition that large number of females and the short time for hunting give an advantage (higher probability to find the female) to the random flights, and on the field where there was one or only a few females and the duration of flights were not limited, then the scanning flights were more beneficial.

50|$|The <b>Parnassius</b> <b>apollo</b> {{butterfly}} {{is classified}} as a threatened species, having many disjointed populations in Western Palaearctic region. The population in the Mosel Valley of Germany has been genetically characterized, and has shown to have six long-term monomorphic microsatellites. Six microsatellites were examined looking at the current population in 2008 as well as museum samples from 1895 to 1989. One of the microsatellite alleles examined has fixed within the population prior to 1895. For the current population all six microsatellites {{as well as all}} sixteen alloenzymes analyzed were fixed.|$|R
25|$|The {{invertebrate}} fauna {{is poorly}} studied. There are between 2475 and 2600 identified species, including 1703 insects, but their actual number {{is estimated to}} be 6500–7000. The main hotspots are Rila Monastery Forest Reserve, the area around the Fish Lakes to the east and the Kalin reservoir, as well as the areas around the river Radovichka and Bukovo bardo. There are 96 rare, 85 endemic and 146 relict species; 116 are included in worldwide or European lists of endangered animals. Some of the endangered species include beetles: Calosoma sycophanta, Carabus intricatus, Morimus funereus; net-winged insects: Libelloides macaronius; ants: Formica lugubris, Formica pratensis, Formica rufa; butterflies: <b>Parnassius</b> <b>apollo,</b> <b>Parnassius</b> mnemosyne, Euphydryas aurinia, Polyommatus eroides, Apatura iris, Carterocephalus palaemon, Colias caucasica, Erebia rhodopensis, Charissa obscurata, Limenitis populi, Melitaea trivia, Zerynthia polyxena, etc.|$|R

A good example is the Indian white admiral Limenitis procris, which has five forms, each geographically separated from the other by large mountain ranges. An even more dramatic showcase of geographical polymorphism is the <b>Apollo</b> butterfly (<b>Parnassius</b> <b>apollo).</b> Because the Apollos live in small local populations, thus having no contact with each other, coupled with their strong stenotopic nature and weak migration ability, interbreeding between populations of one species practically does not occur; by this, they form over 600 different morphs, {{with the size of}} spots on the wings of which varies greatly.|$|R

[...] These very very large, beautiful and conspicuous white butterflies are decorated with five large black eyespots on the forewing and two bright red or sometimes orange eyespots on the hindwing. These striking red eyespots can vary in size and form depending on the location of the Apollo butterfly, and the bright red colour often fades in the sun, causing the eyespots of older individuals to appear more orange. The wings are shiny, with slightly transparent edges, and some individuals are darker (sphragismelanistic); a general phenomenon common in many butterflies.
