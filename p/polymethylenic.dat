40|$|The {{crystal and}} {{molecular}} structures of two liquid crystalline symmetric dimers containing the mesogenic group alpha,alpha'-dimethylbenzalazine and flexible <b>polymethylenic</b> spacers of different parity (even and odd) are reported. They show nematic phases with strong odd-even effects.

The crystal packing of the two dimers is also analogous...|$|E

Solid state ¹³C nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to examine kerogen composition in weathering profiles of the Monterey, Green River, Woodford, and New Albany formations. Techniques include cross polarization (CP) and Bloch decay (BD) spectral acquisition, dipolar dephasing (DD), spin counting, experiments to provide estimates of relaxation times (T₁ρH and T₁H), and proton spin relaxation editing (PSRE). It is demonstrated that CP/MAS (cross polarization/magic angle spinning) spectra obtained on isolated kerogens provide reliable characterization of kerogen composition (compared with BD spectra and whole-rock samples). Highly aliphatic (<b>polymethylenic)</b> kerogens are not appreciably altered during weathering. Aromatic and/or branched aliphatic kerogens accumulate oxidation products and preferentially lose aliphatic relative to aromatic carbon during weathering. No relation is observed between T₁ρH times and either kerogen composition or degree of weathering; T₁H times correlate with aromaticity. Two distinct components within kerogens are discerned by PSRE: one highly aliphatic (largely <b>polymethylenic)</b> component and one mixed aliphatic/aromatic component. During weathering, the highly aliphatic component remains largely unaltered, while the mixed component loses aliphatic carbon and accumulates carbonyl oxidation products. Thus it appears that kerogen weathering is dominated by two separate processes: Linear alkyl fragments are cleaved without oxidation, and aromatic/branched alkyl fragments are oxidized while attached to the kerogen macromolecule and then cleaved.

40|$|Nucleotide analogues with an {{aliphatic}} chain (5 C or 10 C) attached to C 1 of 2 - deoxy-D-ribofuranose were synthesized and incorporated into short double helices. The syntheses were accomplished using {{the reaction of}} organometallics with alpha- 1 -chloro-(3, 5 -O-diacyl) - 1. 2 -dideoxy-D-ribofuranose. An excellent chemo- and stereoselectivity (inversion at C 1) was reached with organocuprates. Duplexes incorporating an {{aliphatic chain}} {{in place of a}} natural base were more stable (i. e. had a higher T(m)) than those incorporating an abasic site or even a primary amide function attached to C 1 by a <b>polymethylenic</b> chain. The increase in T(m) was attributed to a better screening of the aliphatic chain from water in the duplex than in the single-strand oligomer (hydrophobic effect) ...|$|E
40|$|Negatively charged gemini {{guests in}} the {{presence}} of a tetracationic host trigger the formation of self-assembling structures at physiological pH in water generating entities of the HG and H 2 G type (H = host and G = guest). ITC measurements show that the gemini guests are included via concerted electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and that the formation of the HG adduct is enthalpically driven while the formation of the capsular entity (H 2 G) is driven by entropy gain. It is shown that the efficiency of capsule formation is influenced by the number of –CH 2 – units contained in the spacer and that spacers with an even number of methylene groups seem to be the best templating agents. In line with the above picture, MD simulations and DFT calculations show that the entropic contribution strongly depends on the length of the <b>polymethylenic</b> spacer. In the solid state, for the HG assembly three different structures are revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction; the flexible interacting units create multiple interactions reaching the optimum balance between inter- and intramolecular energies. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first structures ever reported for water-soluble calixarenes and organic anions...|$|E
40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{spectra of}} an extant Archaea, Halobacterium salinarum, an extant micro-eukaryote resistant biopolymer isolated from Botrycoccus braunii, and an extinct (ca. 590 - 565 Ma) micro-eukaryote microfossil Tanarium conoideum, {{have been recorded}} using near-infrared FT Raman spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy. Raman biosignatures for the carotenoid pigment, bacterioruberin {{was obtained from the}} halophilic Archaea H. salinarum. Another pigment biosynthesized by halophilic Archaea, bacteriorhodopsin a retinal-protein complex was also investigated. The FTIR analysis of H. salinarum showed the presence of proteins and lipids, and the spectrum of isolated bacteriorhodopsin was different in that it contained retinal C-C stretching bands. FT Raman and FTIR analysis of the resistant biopolymer isolated from B. braunii indicated a composition of long straight chain <b>polymethylenic</b> macromolecule-termed algaenan. Moreover, these biopolymers can be preserved on geological timescales, hence the importance of generating a database of these materials for palaeobiology and astrobiology applications. The FT Raman and FTIR spectra acquired from T. conoideum contain intense aliphatic C-H stretching modes in the 2700 - 3000 cm(- 1) region. Both the FT Raman and FTIR spectra are consistent with vibrational spectra obtained from algaenans isolated from extant chlorophytes, for example, B. braunii, or eustigmatophyte micro-algae.

40|$|In this {{critical}} review we summarise the currently available ‘C 1 polymerisation’ techniques as valuable alternatives for ‘C 2 polymerisation’ {{in the preparation}} of saturated main-chain carbon-based polymers. C 1 polymerisation involves the growth of polymers from monomers delivering only one functionalised carbon unit (C 1 monomers; typically ‘carbene precursors’) in each chain-growth step, which contrasts with common polymerisation of C=C bond containing substrates (C 2 monomers). In the general introduction (section 1) we comment on the availability of C 1 monomers and the most important differences between C 1 and C 2 polymerisation techniques, highlighting the opportunities provided by C 1 polymerisation to prepare new polymer structures. In section 2 we describe several Lewis acid mediated C 1 polymerisation reactions based on diazocompounds and sulfur ylides as C 1 monomers. Some of these are ‘living polymerisation’ reactions which allow the synthesis of functional telechelic block-copolymers and <b>polymethylenic</b> homo-polymers {{with a wide variety of}} different functional end-groups at both polymer chain-ends in a controlled fashion. Miscellaneous related reactions of other C 1 monomers are described in section 3. Transition metal mediated C 1 polymerisation methods in section 4 allow the polymerisation of polar functionalised C 1 monomers. Several homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts are capable of producing polymers from a variety of diazo compounds, some of which even allow the formation of stereoregular polar functionalised polymers (which is a major challenge in traditional olefin polymerisation). An overview of the current state-of-the art, challenges and opportunities, as well as an overview of the available mechanistic information (sections 4 and 5) is provided. Some related C-C bond forming reactions proceeding via (migratory) carbene insertion (section 6) are also discussed (106 references) ...|$|E
