Seventeen days later, the Red Sox named veteran MLB executive Dave Dombrowski to the new position of president, baseball operations, to oversee Cherington and the on-field side of the Boston organization. Cherington then turned in his resignation, declining the club's request that he remain as the team's general manager. By that time, only one of the 2013 free agents, injured closer Uehara, remained on the Red Sox' roster. However, Cherington left behind a group of young players (Xander Bogaerts, Mookie Betts, Brock Holt, Eduardo Rodríguez, Blake Swihart, Travis Shaw, Henry Owens, Christian Vázquez, and others) as a <b>potential</b> <b>core</b> of their 2016 team.

30|$|Accordingly, {{the change}} of {{influence}} power {{can be described in}} the following three phases. First, every node starts with an initial value as its initial influence power. In this part, a random initialization strategy based on degree centrality is used Freeman (1978). Second, every node can influence its neighbors and be influenced by its neighbors, which can lead to the pure influence power. Third, as time evolves, if the pure influence power of a node is negative, it will lose chance to be a core and be ignored temporarily. Otherwise, the node can be retained and the pure influence power in this iteration will determine the influence power in the next iteration. In every iteration, the remaining nodes are chosen to be the <b>potential</b> <b>cores</b> of distinct communities. As a temporary result, communities will be detected by allocating non-core nodes into the community associated with the <b>potential</b> <b>cores.</b> We will always save the community detection result with largest modularity until convergence.|$|R

The arrangement of the PIV system allows for mapping out the flow field with a vector pitch equal to 0. 17 mm along the streamwise direction. The flow field is characterized by single-point statistics.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} change of {{velocity}} and concentration fields in the initial region of a round jet in stagnant fluid and in a moving environment of the co-flow, counter-flow or cross-flow situation. The aim was to discuss issues of flow establishment and in the initial region, to determine the <b>potential</b> <b>core</b> length, and to observe {{the effect of a}} moving ambient. Turbulent jet velocities and concentration were measured with the planar imaging techniques of particle-image velocimetry (PIV) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). The mean flow fields were obtained and analyzed to investigate the validity of 1 /. x decay relationship for jet centerline velocity and concentration. Values for the decay constant and jet virtual origin were obtained from the data. While the results show that the decay constant is increased by a co-flow but reduced by a counter-flow or a cross-flow, the virtual origin was found to be affected as well.
