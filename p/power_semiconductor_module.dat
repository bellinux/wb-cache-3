40|$|Because {{failures}} in power electronics can cause production stops and unnecessary damage to interconnected equipment, monitoring schemes that {{are able to}} predict such failures provide various economic and safety benefits. The primary motivation for this thesis is that such monitoring schemes can increase the reliability of energy production plants. <b>Power</b> <b>semiconductors</b> are crucial components in power electronics, and monitoring their temperatures yields information {{that can be used to}} predict incipient failures. This thesis presents a system concept for wireless, single-chip, high-temperature monitoring of <b>power</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> A wireless single-chip solution is both cost effective and easy to integrate with existing <b>power</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>modules.</b> However, the concept presents two major challenges: the implementation of wireless power and communication, and the low-power design of the temperature sensors. Thus, the feasibility of using on-chip coils to provide communication with and obtain power from an external reader coil is assessed, and a low-power, high-temperature bandgap temperature sensor is developed. The sensor is capable of operating in the high-temperature range, allowing it to be useful for detecting incipient faults, particularly solder faults, at up to 230 °C. This is achieved by compensating for leakage currents that arise in hot reverse-biased p-n junctions, which become significant at these high temperatures. A single-chip, on-chip coil solution provides the combined advantages of galvanic isolation from the power device and simplicity of integration in existing modules. However, as the use of a wireless design with a small on-chip coil will limit the amount of available power, it incurs the disadvantage of requiring a low-power design for the sensor. Initial experiments have been performed on a prototype on-chip coil to assess the feasibility of this concept and provide insight into the challenges of on-chip coil design. In this thesis, focus is placed on the challenge of how to handle large leakage currents in low-power integrated silicon circuits. At high temperatures, these leakage currents can approach or even surpass the level of the circuit's quiescent current. Earlier work on leakage current compensation techniques is examined, compared to and combined with a compensation technique designed to compensate for collector-base leakage in the main bipolar pair of a Brokaw bandgap reference. Experiments show that fully analogue sensors operating at up to 228 °C with an accuracy of 10 °C that consume only 8. 2 µW are feasible. If a higher accuracy, such as 3 °C, is required, then a temperature range of up to 200 °C can be achieved with a power consumption of 2. 3 µW. It is likely that the high temperature range and low power consumption of the sensors presented in this thesis, in combination with on-chip coils, will make them suitable for use in solder fault prediction in <b>power</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>modules.</b> Godkänd; 2016; 20160304 (joanil); Nedanstående person kommer att hålla licentiatseminarium för avläggande av teknologie licentiatexamen.

40|$|In this {{doctoral}} thesis, {{methods to}} estimate the expected power cycling life of <b>power</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>modules</b> based on chip temperature modeling are developed. Frequency converters operate under dynamic loads in most electric drives. The varying loads cause thermal expansion and contraction, which stresses the internal boundaries between the material layers in the power module. Eventually, the stress wears out the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>modules.</b> The wear-out cannot be detected by traditional temperature or current measurements inside the frequency converter. Therefore, {{it is important to}} develop a method to predict the end of the converter lifetime. The thesis concentrates on power-cycling-related failures of insulated gate bipolar transistors. Two types of power modules are discussed: a direct bonded copper (DBC) sandwich structure with and without a baseplate. Most common failure mechanisms are reviewed, and methods to improve the power cycling lifetime of the power modules are presented. Power cycling curves are determined for a module with a lead-free solder by accelerated power cycling tests. A lifetime model is selected and the parameters are updated based on the power cycling test results. According to the measurements, the factor of improvement in the power cycling lifetime of modern IGBT power modules is greater than 10 during the last decade. Also, it is noticed that a 10 C increase in the chip temperature cycle amplitude decreases the lifetime by 40 %. A thermal model for the chip temperature estimation is developed. The model is based on power loss estimation of the chip from the output current of the frequency converter. The model is verified with a purpose-built test equipment, which allows simultaneous measurement and simulation of the chip temperature with an arbitrary load waveform. The measurement system is shown to be convenient for studying the thermal behavior of the chip. It is found that the thermal model has a 5 C accuracy in the temperature estimation. The temperature cycles that the <b>power</b> <b>semiconductor</b> chip has experienced are counted by the rainflow algorithm.

This paper addresses a new approach and focuses on the investigation of the cracks in the interface region between the die and the wire by using the shear test. These cracks form after several thousand temperature swings due to CTE mismatch and ultimately lead to wire bond lift off. New results of active power cycling with different temperature amplitudes and medium temperatures will be discussed. Shear tests have been carried out in regular intervals to monitor the degradation of the 400 m wire bonds on power MOS-FETs.
