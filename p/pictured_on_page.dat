5000|$|Tacketts Mill {{appears in}} several post-war {{records in the}} Stafford County Courthouse tax and {{property}} records through the late 1800s. Clearly, the mills continued to operate even in the deeply depressed reconstruction era. In the December, 1892, edition of the periodical, [...] "Farm Journal", E. L. S. of Tacketts Mill, VA, (one of the Skinner family, perhaps?) wrote in {{to ask a question}} about raising chickens. According to the [...] "Electrical Review", a national listing of telephone companies and telephone lines, Tacketts Mill received its first telephone line in 1905. In 1910 Tacketts Mill is listed in the Virginia Department of Agriculture’s list of corn and wheat mills with a capacity of 100 bushels of corn meal per day. In the same year the publication, “The Operative Miller” lists L. A. Skinner and Son, operators of Tacketts Mill, as having purchased a steel, overshot water wheel, 14 feet in diameter by 3 foot face, from the Fitz Water Wheel Company. It is highly likely that this steel water wheel is the same one donated by the Emerts to the Tacketts Mill shopping center in Woodbridge, (which was subsequently never used) and is <b>pictured</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 67 of “Stafford County, Then & Now”, by Anita L. Dodd and M. Amanda Lee. In 1914, L. A. Skinner is listed by the Virginia Secretary of the Commonwealth as the Constable of Tacketts Mill in the Rock Hill Magistrate. In 1942 the property was purchased by the Gutches family and the place was known as Gracewood. The mill was still standing, but in disrepair. Mr. Gutches sold some lumber off of the land and as payment had the lumber cut to repair the mill, including the 12” x 12” support beams. As it turned out, however, no one was willing to do the repair work. He contacted all of the local historical societies and no one was interested in the mill. Over the years the mill continued to deteriorate and eventually collapsed. The lumber Mr. Gutches had prepared for the repair work stood outside and eventually rotted away. The portion of the property the mill stood on was sold and the subsequent owners, the Ermerts, donated the mill’s remnants.|$|E
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1967, long before I ever dreamed that I would {{eventually}} become a wood craftsman, I viewed a collection of small ancient (see missing word in text.) glass perfume vials and bottles which struck me as being very beautiful and sensitive. Their shapes were simple, and the glass had a light blue, iridescent hue {{to the effect of}} being buried for centuries. Eventually, the inspiration from these pieces came to affect my basic theory of wood design, although I did not come to realize the fact until about four years after I started working with wood. I have now developed a very strong liking for the simple curved line. Best of my designs reflect this very strongly, and it has worked exceptionally well for me. I feel that smooth linear shape remains consistently pleasing to just about anybody???s eye because it creates and projects a feeling of rhythm and it is easily understood. So why not incorporate this idea into wood design? It occurred to me after this thought that {{there is no reason why}} wood could not be treated as delicately as glass or crystal and still be a functional piece. The first result of this is a vase <b>pictured</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 6. The form is simple and classical and the piece is functional. (See more in text. ...|$|E
40|$|The View from Khayelitsha Tuberculosis {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{pathogens}} known to humankind. Our experience with this pathogen goes back to ancient times. Remnants of tubercular infections have been found in the bones of mummies. Medi-cal texts through the ages are replete with accounts of tuberculosis. Our literature and music has been deeply influenced by our experience with tuberculosis as witnessed in accounts by Thomas Mann and Feodor Dos-toyevsky. Tuberculosis was also one of the most promising candidates for early erad-ication in the new era of infectious diseases. Our knowledge of the causal factors of infectious diseases directly relates back to Robert Koch and the formulation of Koch’s postulates to determine whether a microbial agent caused disease. Some of the earliest clinical trials tested the effectiveness When Mike was admitted to the hospital with worsening heart failure, he was one of hundreds of thousands of people who have an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) in their chests to prevent sudden cardiac death. This time Mike was on the threshold of death. Having accepted his fate, he was waiting for peace after many years of struggle. His wife Terry asked him to “just hang on, they haven’t turned it off yet. ” She knew that his death might be complicated by multiple electrical resurrec-tions, which would be anything but peaceful. A recent Wall Street Journal article described how new technologies to improve health care delivery are presenting new ethical challenges. 1 The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) <b>pictured</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> three, is a technological advance that revolutionized therapy for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death.

40|$|This volume {{includes}} {{reports from}} the January 2000 conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 2 papers {{not included in the}} previous proceedings, and a small number of invited papers intended to broaden the scope of the volume and to replace the few papers presented at the conference but withdrawn from publication. In serving as Editor, I wish, first of all, to express thanks to the many authors, reviewers, and associate editors, and to Gary Lingle who hosted the conference and was the intended Chief Editor: Gary underwent an employment change early in 2001 and so passed the task to me. I hope he is pleased with the final product. We also express our deep appreciation to Scott Hereford, President of the North American Crane Working Group, for his role in organizing and conducting the conference. Richard Urbanek also deserves special mention for his role in managing the review of one-third of the papers in these proceedings. Special thanks go to Cathy Ellis: she spent even more time than I in preparing the volume for publication. We appreciate Billi Wagner for use of her crane drawings to enhance the text. In my role, 1 have the opportunity to make mention of some remarkable people whose names seldom or never appear elsewhere in this volume. All 3 have made long-tenn, substantial contributions to crane husbandry. The first, Bruce Williams, came to Patuxent from the National Zoo in 1966. Very likely there was never an endangered species enclosure built at Patuxent without his input, and most of our facilities involved his labor and his supervision. Bruce is <b>pictured</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 219 in the volume, Cranes: Their Biology, Husbandry, and Conservation (Crane Manual). As Bruce nears {{the end of a long}} and dynamic career, I convey the deep appreciation of myself and my colleagues and coworkers for all that he has accomplished. For the last 9 years, much of Bruce 2 ̆ 7 s administrative and husbandry responsibilities have fallen to Jonathan Male. Like Bruce, Jonathan came to Patuxent from the National Zoo. He also worked in Liberia, Africa for 2 Y 2 years. Also, like Bruce, Jonathan prefers to work behind the scenes. He has repeatedly refused authorship on papers depending importantly on his work. Although Jonathan is not pictured in the Crane Manual, several of his photos are included there (pages 246 - 251). Jonathan constantly exemplifies cheerfulness, that trait so important in any employee or colleague. All at Patuxent offer him our thanks. Last of all, we focus on Scott Swengel who recently left the position of curator at the International Crane Foundation where he served for 19 years. Scott has been prominent in the international crane community, although he is so quiet and self effacing that only those who know him well realize his monumental worth. Scott has published often: he was senior author on 4 chapters in the Crane Manual and has published more than 40 other papers (mostly on owls, grassland birds, and butterflies). During a lifetime, you will very occasionally meet someone who personifies integrity. Scott is such an one. From our close association while working together describing the social behavior of the world 2 ̆ 7 s cranes (a task that for me would have been impossible without Scott 2 ̆ 7 s help), I noticed that his daily speech was without affectation, seemingly devoid of the exaggerations that typifies most mortals. Although his honesty and courage are the traits I most admire, you should also know that Scott may have the world 2 ̆ 7 s literature on cranes in his head: he can very often provide exact bibliographic citations at will. No surprise when you learn that he invented his own form of calculus when 14 years old (1 scolded him that he owes it to the world to slow down and transcribe the process he follows in his head: perhaps his method is superior). He can also calculate the cube root of a 4 digit number to 3 decimal places in 20 seconds without touching pencil to paper. As Scott leaves full time involvement in crane husbandry and research, we express our gratitude for having walked in his shadow...|$|E
