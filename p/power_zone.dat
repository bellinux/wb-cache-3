In January 2009 Davis revealed that Slazenger were weeks away from releasing a new bat designed by Danny Waugh, a younger brother of former Test stars Steve and Mark, called the Clubba, in competition with Gray-Nicolls, maker of the only 'double-sided' bat in top level cricket, controversially used by New South Wales and Australia opener David Warner. Davis was quoted, [...] "The Waugh bat has a slightly longer handle for batsmen who go the tonk, no shoulders and a <b>power</b> <b>zone.</b> While we're marketing for the 50-over form of the game, {{it can also be}} used for Twenty20." [...] Although the bat was not released with Slazenger Australia's new 2009 range, some of the design features have been included specifically the [...] "power zone" [...] and a flatter back to the bat.|$|E

2500|$|As the two coalitions grew, their {{separate}} interests kept coming into conflict. Under {{the influence of}} King Archidamus II (the Eurypontid king of Sparta from 476 BC through 427 BC), Sparta, {{in the late summer}} or early autumn of 446 BC, concluded the Thirty Years Peace with Athens. [...] This treaty took effect the next winter in 445 BC [...] Under the terms of this treaty, Greece was formally divided into two large power zones. Sparta and Athens agreed to stay within their own <b>power</b> <b>zone</b> and not to interfere in the other's. Despite the Thirty Years Peace, it was clear that war was inevitable. [...] As noted above, at all times during its history down to 221 BC, Sparta was a [...] "diarchy" [...] with two kings ruling the city-state concurrently. [...] One line of hereditary kings was from the Eurypontid Dynasty while the other king was from the Agiad Dynasty. [...] With the signing of the Thirty Years Peace treaty Archidamus II felt he had successfully prevented Sparta from entering into a war with its neighbours. [...] However, the strong war party in Sparta soon won out and in 431 BC Archidamus was forced {{to go to war with}} the Delian League. [...] However, in 427 BC, Archidamus II died and his son, Agis II succeeded to the Eurypontid throne of Sparta.|$|E
5000|$|Power Snooker {{uses the}} {{concepts}} of the Power Ball, Power Play, and <b>Power</b> <b>Zone.</b> The Power Ball is dark red and {{is placed in the}} centre of the diamond rack, identified by a special logo, and is worth two points. When the Power Ball is potted, a two-minute Power Play period starts, where all points values are doubled. If a shot is missed however, the opponent can also benefit from the remaining Power Play time. The Power Ball changed in 2011 to a red striped ball. On the Power Snooker table, the [...] is known as the <b>Power</b> <b>Zone.</b> Any [...] potted from a shot originating in the <b>Power</b> <b>Zone</b> counts for double, and if potted during a Power Play, quadrupled. In 2011 this was extended to the [...] as well.

Weibull and Rayleigh’s distribution were used to adjust the data series from the study period to find the probability density function, mean wind speed, maximum and minimum from each data series adjusted per pixel.
