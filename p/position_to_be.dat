5|$|In 1536 {{the natives}} of Yamala, near Tencoa, rebelled; the Spanish responded by burning the Indians' homes and storehouses. Around {{the middle of}} 1536, Pedro de Alvarado {{received}} news that Alonso Maldonado had been appointed to investigate his governorship of Guatemala, and that Francisco de Montejo had finally accepted governorship of Honduras and was en route. Alvarado was incensed, as his decisive intervention had prevented the complete collapse of the Spanish colonisation efforts in the territory, and he now believed the Spanish <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> secure. With Spanish control apparently firmly established in Honduras, he travelled to Puerto de Caballos and sailed back to Spain {{to deal with his}} legal difficulties.

5|$|In {{retaliation}} for his dismissal and his son's virtual demotion, Qasim al-Ahmad organized the a'ayan (notables) of Nablus, Hebron and Jerusalem against Ibrahim Pasha. On 19 May 1834, the notables gathered and notified Egyptian officials {{that they were}} not able to conscript the Palestinian Arab peasantry into the army or collect taxes from them, claiming that the peasantry had taken up arms and fled to the mountains which were difficult to access. At the time of the notables' stated failure to conscript local peasants, Ibrahim Pasha had been in need of new troops to replenish his army in preparation for further advances against the Ottomans. He considered the notables' <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treasonous and amounting to an insurrection.|$|E
5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked to himself that it could not survive him.|$|E

5|$|PedroII {{began his}} rule as a figurehead who held {{together}} a realm {{on the verge}} of disintegration. He quickly matured and successfully navigated the empire through repeated and serious crises. By the time of Afonso's death, the nation was entering an unprecedented era of prosperity, development and tranquility. Even as the emperor's political successes and policies began to bear fruit, the lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation to promote the imperial office as a <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried on by his descendants. The emperor turned away from personal and family ties, and focused on upholding the constitution while directing Brazil toward policies that furthered modernization and social advancement. The future of the monarchy as an institution no longer mattered to him, and in 1889, he was deposed in a coup, marking the end of the Empire of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, {{the pass}} at Thermopylae was {{ideally suited to}} the Greek style of warfare. A hoplite phalanx could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx {{would have been very}} {{difficult}} to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry. The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in mountain warfare). Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from Trachis, and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.|$|E

5|$|According to Lucas and Sobus, {{the type}} species P. bugtiense {{from the late}} Oligocene of Pakistan {{includes}} junior synonyms such as B. osborni and P. zhajremensis. P. transouralicum, formerly Indricotherium, from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and northern China includes B. grangeri and I. minus. P. orgosensis, formerly Dzungariotherium, from the middle and late Oligocene of northwest China includes D. turfanensis and P. lipidus. P. orgosensis may be distinct enough to warrant its original genus name, but its exact position requires evaluation. P. prohorovi from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan may be too incomplete for its <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved {{in relation to the}} other species; the same applies to proposed species such as I. intermedium and P. tienshanensis, as well as genera like Benaratherium and Caucasotherium. Though the genus name Indricotherium is now a junior synonym of Paraceratherium, the subfamily name Indricotheriinae is still in use because genus name synonymy does not affect the names of higher level taxa that are derived from these. Members of the subfamily are therefore still commonly referred to as indricotheres.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Roosters {{became the}} first club to play 100 seasons of first grade rugby league; {{they were the only}} outfit to play in each season since the competition's {{inception}} in 1908. They appointed Chris Anderson as coach in 2007 and 2008 following two relatively unsuccessful years under Ricky Stuart. On 9 July 2007, Anderson resigned after a 56–0 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Assistant Coach Fittler acted as the caretaker {{for the remainder of the}} 2007 season, before being appointed in August to the top job for two years.

5|$|Meanwhile, the US 1st Marine Division {{was holding}} firm against the Chinese 39th Army to the east, and the {{withdrawal}} of the South Koreans had left their flank exposed. However, with the Chinese 39th and 40th Armies only tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the 9th Army Group against possible counterattacks from the 1st Marine Division, the Chinese did not exploit this opportunity and the Americans remained relatively unmolested. Yet with the forward UN positions in both the US I Corps and US IX Corps sectors increasingly untenable as the Chinese exploited gaps between formations, Van Fleet ordered a withdrawal to the Kansas Line in the mid-morning. Hoge subsequently ordered the US Marines to form a new defensive position beyond the Pukhan River, between the Hwachon Reservoir and the new <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> occupied by the South Korean 6th Division. Hoge's plan relied on the South Koreans reforming and offering some resistance, and although a rearguard of 2,500 men was belatedly established it was in no condition to fight. Fearing a breakthrough, Hoge ordered the 27th Brigade, as the corps' reserve, to establish defensive positions north of Kapyong on the afternoon of 23 April as a precaution in the event the South Koreans were unable to hold, tasking them with blocking the two approaches to the village and to prevent the Chinese from cutting Route 17, a key route south to Seoul and an important main supply route.|$|E
5|$|Mulan is {{initially}} misguided by Mushu who encourages {{her to go}} to war and in how to behave like a man. However, under command of Li Shang, she and her new friends at the camp, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, become skilled warriors. Mushu, desiring to see Mulan succeed, creates a fake order from Li Shang's father, General Li, ordering Li Shang to follow them into the mountains. They arrive at a burnt-out village and discover that General Li and his forces have been wiped out by the Huns. As they solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns when Mushu accidentally fired a cannon causing their <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given away, but a second firing of a cannon by Mulan buries most of the enemy forces in an avalanche. Mulan is slashed by Shan Yu in his rage at her wiping out his army during the battle, and she is forced to reveal her deception when she receives medical attention. Instead of executing Mulan as the law states, Li Shang spares her life for saving his life from the avalanche by leaving her on the mountain {{as the rest of the}} army departs for the Imperial City to report the news of the Huns' demise. However, the avalanche failed to eliminate all the enemies, as Mulan catches sight of a small number of surviving Huns, including Shan Yu, making their way to the City, intent on capturing the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on {{the evening}} of the 10th, around 22:00, French {{reconnaissance}} elements using Panhard 178 armoured cars had started to arrive at the Dutch border, forming a vanguard for the French 1st Mechanised Light Division. This division operated, with the 25e DIM on its left, on the northern flank of the French 7th Army; its mission was to ensure contact between the Vesting Holland and Antwerp. Attempts to coordinate the French advance with Colonel Leonard Johannes Schmidt, the military commander of the Dutch troops on Noord-Brabant, were largely unsuccessful as, apart from the fact he could not be reached that day, Dutch defences there were already collapsing. At Mill, 256. Infanteriedivision at first could not exploit the opportunity offered by having a battalion {{in the back of the}} defenders because it failed to locate it. When a first attack by forward elements had been repulsed, a full assault at the Main Defense Line was initially postponed to the next day because most artillery had not yet passed the single pontoon bridge over the Meuse, which had caused a traffic jam after having been damaged by an incident. In the early evening in a sudden change of plans it was decided to attack even though artillery support was absent apart from one 105mm battery. An unrequested Stuka attack that also happened to hit the Mill sector just prior to the advance routed some Dutch defenders, creating a weak section in the line from which the Dutch troops were dislodged. Though the Germans were slow to exploit the breakthrough, Colonel Schmidt at 20:30 ordered the Peel-Raam <b>Position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abandoned and his troops to fall back to the west improvising a new line at the Zuid-Willemsvaart canal.|$|E

5|$|The German {{artillery}} bombardment was heaviest in {{the sector}} {{held by the}} right company of the 47th Battalion and the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers {{on either side of}} the railway bridge northwest of Dernancourt. I/230 RIR had barely been able to reach its jumping off point in time, and fell behind its barrage. It advanced through the British barrage south of Dernancourt and quickly moved through the village, with part of the battalion reaching the railway embankment. About 09:30, the German shelling in the sector near the bridge lessened. The commander of the right section of the 12th Machine Gun Company, stationed near the bridge with the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers, climbed up the embankment and looking over the rails, saw a number of German bayonets sticking up on the other side. After a quick discussion with the ranking officer of the pioneers in that area, it was decided they would attack immediately. Charging across the railway line, they pushed the German force back far enough to bring one of the Vickers guns into action. The fire from this gun drove the Germans of I/230 RIR back as far as Dernancourt. Before this counter-attack was launched, Foord, feeling his <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> insecure, requested reinforcement. Two companies of Highland Light Infantry were sent forward from the 106th Brigade support line, arriving around the time of the counter-attack, although they suffered significant casualties as they moved down the exposed slope. II and III/230 RIR were unable to get through Dernancourt to reinforce I/230 RIR, due to a tremendous British bombardment that fell on the village as they approached. They sought shelter in the cellars of the village. Any troops that attempted to cross the open ground between the village and the railway were shot down.|$|E
