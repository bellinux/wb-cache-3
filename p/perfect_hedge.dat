He was on the lower end of a fallen log, gliding rapidly up and down, spreading wings and tail and budding ruff, as if he were drumming, and sending out his peculiar call at every pause. Above him, in a long line on the same log, five other partridges were sitting perfectly quiet, save now and then, when an answer came to the leader's call, they would turn their heads and listen intently till the underbrush parted cautiously and another bird flitted up beside them. Then another call, and from the distant hillside a faint kwit-kwit and a rush of wings in answer, and another partridge would shoot in on swift pinions to pull himself up on the log beside his fellows. The line would open hospitably to let him in; then the row grew quiet again, as the leader called, turning their heads from side to side for the faint answers.|$|E

40|$|Fair pricing of {{embedded}} {{options in}} life insurance contracts is usually conducted by using risk-neutral valuation. This pricing framework assumes a <b>perfect</b> <b>hedging</b> strategy, which insurance companies can hardly pursue in practice. In this article, we extend the risk-neutral valuation concept with a risk measurement approach. We accomplish this by first calibrating contract parameters {{that lead to}} the same market value using risk-neutral valuation. We then measure the resulting risk assuming that insurers do not follow <b>perfect</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies. As the relevant risk measure, we use lower partial moments, comparing shortfall probability, expected shortfall, and downside variance. We show that even when contracts have the same market value, the insurance company's risk can vary widely, a finding that allows us to identify key risk drivers for participating life insurance contracts.

40|$|It {{appears from}} discussions held with {{practitioners}} on forums and conferences that hedging products with CDSs is often {{considered to be}} an easy task. For instance, a bond-CDS position is frequently seen to be a <b>perfect</b> <b>hedge</b> as is the index CDS and its corresponding single-name counterparts. On the other hand, theoreticians claim that a <b>perfect</b> <b>hedge</b> is impossible to achieve with credit derivatives: currently it seems there is no model from which a <b>perfect</b> <b>hedge</b> of credit derivatives can be set up. So, who's right? This paper aims to show that, surprisingly, both are right, in some sense. The misunderstanding comes from a misspecification of the “hedge” term, together with a confusion between hedging and arbitraging. We focus on Credit Default Swaps and explain why, among other things, the “Bond-CDS on the Bond” position does not result in a <b>perfect</b> <b>hedge</b> (except in a very specific case, which is not market standard). By contrast, partial hedge (that is, hedging some parts of the risk) can be obtained and, of course, arbitrage opportunities could be found. We then explain, adopting a philosophical point of view, why it is so problematic to set up a credit portfolio being perfectly hedged (even in a first-order approximation sense). It appears that the nature of the derivative's underlying prevents us reaching this with the currently available financial instruments...|$|E

40|$|We provide fully analytical, optimal dynamic hedges in {{incomplete}} markets {{by employing}} the traditional minimum-variance criterion. Our hedges are {{in terms of}} generalized “Greeks ” and naturally extend no-arbitrage–based risk management in complete markets to incomplete markets. Whereas the literature characterizes either minimum-variance static, myopic, or dynamic hedges fromwhich a hedger may deviate unless able to precommit, our hedges are time-consistent. We apply our results to derivatives replication with infrequent trading and determine hedges and replication values, which reduce to generalized Black-Scholes expressions in specific settings.

40|$|We use {{a simple}} agent based model of value investors in {{financial}} markets to test three credit regulation policies. The {{first is the}} unregulated case, which only imposes limits on maximum leverage. The second is Basle II {{and the third is}} a hypothetical alternative in which banks perfectly hedge all of their leverage-induced risk with options. When compared to the unregulated case both Basle II and the <b>perfect</b> <b>hedge</b> policy reduce the risk of default when leverage is low but increase it when leverage is high. This is because both regulation policies increase the amount of synchronized buying and selling needed to achieve deleveraging, which can destabilize the market. None of these policies are optimal for everyone: Risk neutral investors prefer the unregulated case with low maximum leverage, banks prefer the <b>perfect</b> <b>hedge</b> policy, and fund managers prefer the unregulated case with high maximum leverage.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the optimal {{allocation}} of risks for an agent whose preferences may be represented with prospect theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992).

Conversely, under prospect theory, provided that the subjective probability of obtaining a <b>perfect</b> <b>hedge</b> is negligible, risk concentration is optimal ('do put your eggs in the same basket'). The intuitive reason behind this result is that a prospect theory agent is risk-seeking over losses, with the consequence that the proerty of diversification of averaging downside risks is welfare-reducing rather than welfare-improving.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the impact of market {{activity}} on the percentage bid-ask spreads of S&P 100 index options using transaction data. We propose a new market microstructure theory called a derivative hedge theory, in which option market percentage spreads will be inversely related to the option market maker's ability to hedge his positions in the underlying market, as measured by the liquidity of this underlying market. In a <b>perfect</b> <b>hedge</b> world, spreads arise from the illiquidity of the underlying market, rather than from inventory risk or informed trading in the option market itself. We estimate three models to investigate various market microstructure theories. In the static model, option spreads are a function of moneyness, time to maturity, option prices, hedge ratios and volatility. The dynamic model includes time between trades or duration and average volume per transaction while the cross-market model adds cross option market activity and spreads in the underlying market. We find option market volume is not a significant determinant of option market spreads, which challenges the validity of volume as a proxy for liquidity and supports my theory. Option market spreads are positively related to spreads in the underlying market, again supporting our theory. However, option market duration does affect option market spreads, with very slow and very fast option markets both leading to bigger spreads. Only the fast market result would be predicted by asymmetric information theory. Inventory models predict big spreads in slow markets. Neither would be observed if the underlying securities market provided a <b>perfect</b> <b>hedge.</b> We interpret these mixed results to mean that the option market maker is able to only imperfectly hedge his positions in the underlying securities market. Our result of insignificant option volume casts doubt on the price discovery argument between stock and option markets (Easley, O'Hara, and Srinivas (1997)). Asymmetric information costs in either market are naturally passed to the other market by market maker's hedging and therefore it is unimportant where the informed traders trade...|$|E
