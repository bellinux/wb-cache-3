40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the side effects}} induced by injection of Freund's adjuvant (FA) and alternative adjuvants combined with different antigens. Rabbits and mice were injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly (rabbits) and intraperitoneally (mice) with different adjuvants (FA, Specol, RIBI, TiterMax, Montanide ISA 50) in combination with several types of antigens (synthetic peptides, autoantigen, glycolipid, protein, mycoplasma or viruses). The effects of treatment on the animals' well-being were assessed by clinical and behavioural changes (POT and LABORAS assays) and gross and histopathological changes. In rabbits, treatment {{did not appear to}} induce acute or prolonged pain and distress. Mice showed behavioural changes immediately after (predominantly secondary) immunization. Injection of several adjuvant/antigen mixtures resulted in severe <b>pathological</b> <b>changes,</b> depending on adjuvant, type of antigen, animal species used and route of injection. Both rabbits and mice showed <b>pathological</b> <b>changes</b> ranging from marked to severe after injection of FA, and ranging from minimal to marked after Specol and Montanide injections. <b>Pathological</b> <b>changes</b> after RIBI injections were severe in rabbits, though slight in mice. After TiterMax injections <b>pathological</b> <b>changes</b> were moderate in rabbits, though severe in mice. In conclusion, injection of FA according to present guidelines resulted mostly in severe <b>pathological</b> <b>changes,</b> whereas only very few clinical and behavioural signs indicated prolonged severe pain. Our findings indicate that Montanide ISA 50 and Specol induce acceptable antibody titres, and cause fewer <b>pathological</b> <b>changes</b> than FA. Thus they are effective alternatives to FA...|$|R

50|$|Vascular and neural {{diseases}} {{are closely related}} and intertwined. Blood vessels depend on normal nerve function, and nerves depend on adequate blood flow. The first <b>pathological</b> <b>change</b> in the small blood vessels is narrowing of the blood vessels. As the disease progresses, neuronal dysfunction correlates closely {{with the development of}} blood vessel abnormalities, such as capillary basement membrane thickening and endothelial hyperplasia, which contribute to diminished oxygen tension and hypoxia. Neuronal ischemia is a well-established characteristic of diabetic neuropathy. Blood vessel opening agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors, α1-antagonists) can lead to substantial improvements in neuronal blood flow, with corresponding improvements in nerve conduction velocities. Thus, small blood vessel dysfunction occurs early in diabetes, parallels the progression of neural dysfunction, and may be sufficient to support the severity of structural, functional, and clinical changes observed in diabetic neuropathy.|$|E
50|$|Several rasayana herbs {{have been}} tested for adaptogenic properties:The whole, aqueous, {{standardized}} extracts of selected plants (Tinospora cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Withmania somnifera, Piper longum and Terminalia chebula) were administered orally to experimental animals, in a dose extrapolated from the human dose, following which they were exposed {{to a variety of}} biological, physical and chemical stressors. These plants were found to offer protection against these stressors, as judged by using markers of stress responses and objective parameters for stress manifestations. Using a model of cisplatin induced alterations in gastrointestinal motility, the ability of these plants to exert a normalizing effect, irrespective of direction of <b>pathological</b> <b>change</b> was tested.... All the plant drugs were found to be safe in both acute and subacute toxicity studies. Studies on the mechanisms of action of the plants revealed that they all produced immunostimulation. The protection offered by Tinospora cordifolia against stress induced gastric mucosal damage was lost if macrophage activity was blocked. Emblica officinalis strengthened the defence mechanisms against free radical damage induced during stress. The effect of Emblica officinalis appeared to depend on the ability of target tissues to synthesize prostaglandins. Recent data obtained with Tinospora cordifolia have led researchers to suggest that it may induce genotypic adaptation, further opening the arena for more research and experimentation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to perform a morphometric {{analysis}} of the uterine tube epithelium of sexually mature sows, with or without <b>pathological</b> <b>changes.</b> The sows were either in follicular or luteal phases. One hundred and twenty-four uterine tubes of sixty-two sows were obtained from slaughterhouses. Sections of the uterine tube, uterus and ovary were processed for morphometrical evaluation. The uterine tubes were divided into four groups. The first (LSP) group was composed by animals in luteal phase without <b>pathological</b> <b>changes</b> (n= 45), the second (LCP) by animals in luteal phase with <b>pathological</b> <b>changes</b> (n= 19), the third (FSP) by animals in follicular phase without <b>pathological</b> <b>changes</b> (n= 45) and the fourth (FCP) by animals in follicular phase with <b>pathological</b> <b>changes</b> (n= 15). In the follicular phase (FSP), the ampulla had a higher epithelium, followed by the infundibulum and the isthmus (P< 0. 05). Tubal epithelium was higher in the animals of FSP and FCP groups when compared to LSP and LCP, suggesting that estrogens influence epithelial height. In the isthmus, {{there were significant differences}} between FSP and LSP groups (P< 0. 05). These results indicate that the porcine uterine tube epithelium changes its height during the estrous cycle. The epithelial height {{does not appear to be}} influenced by tubarian pathologies...|$|R
40|$|Excessive {{mechanical}} loads on the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{can cause}} mandibular cartilage degradation and subchondral bone erosion, but {{the treatment of}} these conditions remains challenging. Salubrinal, which target eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha, {{has been shown to}} have multiple beneficial effects on skeletal tissue. Here, we examined the effect of a Salubrinal injection on the mandibular cartilage and subchondral bone of the TMJ under various compressive stresses. We conducted in vivo analyses in rat models using various compressive stresses (40 g and 80 g), and we observed time-related degeneration and pathological changes in the cartilage and subchondral bone of the TMJ at days 1, 3 and 7 through histological measurements, subcellular observation, and changes in proliferation and apoptosis. After the Salubrinal injection, the thickness of the cartilage recovered, and the <b>pathological</b> <b>change</b> was alleviated. In the Salubrinal/light (Sal/light) compressive stress group, the drug altered the proliferation and apoptosis of chondrocytes most significantly at day 1. In the Salubrinal/heavy (Sal/heavy) compressive stress group, the drug increased the proliferation of chondrocytes most significantly at day 1 and reduced the apoptosis of chondrocytes most significantly at day 7. Salubrinal also increased the area of the bone trabeculae and suppressed inflammatory responses and <b>pathological</b> <b>change</b> in the subchondral bone of the TMJ. Together, these results indicate that the administration of Salubrinal reduces apoptosis and strengthens the proliferation of chondrocyte to varying degrees at days 1, 3 and 7 under various compressive mechanical stresses, both of which contribute to the recovery of cartilage thickness and the alleviation of <b>pathological</b> <b>change.</b> Salubrinal also suppresses inflammatory responses and <b>pathological</b> <b>change</b> in the subchondral bone of the TMJ...|$|E

This study assessed the pathological changes in the synovium of an ovine model of OA and evaluated the effects of two HA preparations on this pathology. Methods. Eighteen sheep had bilateral lateral meniscectomy to induce OA. Four months post-surgery animals received IA saline or HA (Hyalgan®) weekly for 5 weeks or three injections of an amide derivative of HA (HYADD® 4 -G) every 2 weeks (n = 6 per group). Six months after meniscectomy, sheep were killed, knee joint synovium processed, scored for <b>pathological</b> <b>change</b> and compared with synovium from non-operated animals. Sections of synovium from normal and treated joints were also immunostained for TNF-α, HSP- 47, TGF-β, CD 44, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) or iNOS. HA synthesis by synovial fibroblasts isolated from each OA joint was quantified. Results. Aggregate scores of <b>pathological</b> <b>change</b> were higher in OA joint synovia compared with controls, with individual measures of subintimal fibrosis and vascularity predominantly affected. Depth of intimal fibrosis was also significantly higher in meniscectomized joints. IA treatment with Hyalgan® decreased aggregate score, vascularity and depth of fibrosis. HYADD® 4 -G treatment decreased vascularity, intimal hyperplasia and increased high-molecular weight HA synthesis by synovial fibroblasts. CD 44, CTGF or iNOS expression was increased in the synovial lining of OA joints compared with normal, {{but there was no}} significant modulation of this increase by either HA preparation. Conclusion. Increased fibrosis and vascularity are hallmarks of <b>pathological</b> <b>change</b> in synovium in this meniscectomy model of OA.
