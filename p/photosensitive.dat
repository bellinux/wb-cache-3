5|$|Trauma {{lighting}} – In {{addition to}} normal working lighting, ambulances can be fitted with special lighting (often blue or red) {{which is used}} when the patient becomes <b>photosensitive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is <b>photosensitive,</b> and {{containers}} {{are often}} covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it. Doxorubicin {{is also available}} in liposome-encapsulated forms as Doxil (pegylated form), Myocet (nonpegylated form), and Caelyx, although these forms must also be given by intravenous injection.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1870s Busch's {{illustrations}} {{were printed}} using zincography. With this technique {{there was no}} longer any danger that a wood engraver could change the character of his drawings. The originals were photographed and transferred onto a <b>photosensitive</b> zinc plate. This process allowed for the application of a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster printing method. Busch's use of zincography began with Mr. and Mrs. Knopp.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to <b>photosensitive</b> epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Many {{methods of}} {{decreasing}} the response time of ALFs have been developed. Even {{in the late}} 1980s, certain gases were used to catalyze the decay of the electrons of the vapor cell. In 1989, Eric Korevaar had developed his Fast ALF design which detected emitted fluorescence without <b>photosensitive</b> plates. With such methods employed, gigahertz frequencies are easily attainable.|$|E
5|$|The thallium(I) halides are stable. In {{keeping with}} the large size of the Tl+ cation, the {{chloride}} and bromide have the caesium chloride structure, while the fluoride and iodide have distorted sodium chloride structures. Like the analogous silver compounds, TlCl, TlBr, and TlI are <b>photosensitive.</b> The stability of thallium(I) compounds demonstrates its differences {{from the rest of}} the group: a stable oxide, hydroxide, and carbonate are known, as are many chalcogenides.|$|E
5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The <b>photosensitive</b> emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with <b>photosensitive</b> disorders are reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians {{have a better chance of}} getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females are more likely to be affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Later {{studies showed}} that 5–10% of the viewers had mild {{symptoms}} that did not need hospital treatment. Twelve thousand children who did not get sent to hospital by ambulance reported mild symptoms of illness; however, their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over {{three years after the}} event found that most of them had no further seizures. Scientists believe that the flashing lights triggered <b>photosensitive</b> seizures in which visual stimuli such as flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this Pokémon episode was unprecedented.|$|E
5|$|While {{the root}} of the parsnip is edible, {{handling}} the shoots and leaves of the plant requires caution as the sap is toxic. Like many other members of the family Apiaceae, the parsnip contains furanocoumarins as a defense against herbivory, <b>photosensitive</b> chemicals that causes a condition known as phytophotodermatitis. The condition is a type of chemical burn rather than an allergic reaction, and is similar to the rash caused by poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made but these have been small in number compared to {{the number of people who}} grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur on a sunny day when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone to seed. The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photosensitive</b> {{glass is}} a clear glass in which {{microscopic}} metallic particles can be formed into a picture or image by exposure to short wave radiations such as ultraviolet light. <b>Photosensitive</b> glass was invented in November 1937 by S. Donald Stookey of Corning Glass Works.|$|E
25|$|In reflex epilepsies, myoclonic {{seizures}} can {{be brought}} on by flashing lights or other environmental triggers (see <b>photosensitive</b> epilepsy).|$|E
25|$|British {{researchers}} successfully cure blindness in mice {{using an}} injection of <b>photosensitive</b> cells. Following additional testing, the treatment {{could be used}} to heal human sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa.|$|E
25|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is {{generally}} a non-invasive treatment {{using a combination}} of light and a <b>photosensitive</b> drug, such as 5-ALA, Foscan, Metvix, Tookad, WST09, WST11, Photofrin, or Visudyne. The drug is triggered by light of a specific wavelength.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{the ability}} to detect single photons {{striking}} the primary <b>photosensitive</b> surface itself reveals the quantization principle that Einstein put forth. Photon counting (as it is called) reveals that light, not only being a wave, consists of discrete particles (i.e., photons).|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps emit a {{small amount}} of {{ultraviolet}} (UV) light. A 1993 study in the US found that ultraviolet exposure from sitting under fluorescent lights for eight hours is equivalent to one minute of sun exposure. Ultraviolet radiation from compact fluorescent lamps may exacerbate symptoms in <b>photosensitive</b> individuals.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a rare type of pink quartz (also {{frequently}} called crystalline rose quartz) with color that {{is thought to be}} caused by trace amounts of phosphate or aluminium. The color in crystals is apparently <b>photosensitive</b> and subject to fading. The first crystals were found in a pegmatite found near Rumford, Maine, USA and in Minas Gerais, Brazil.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, light {{controls}} {{the sense of}} sight and the circadian clock by activating light-sensitive proteins in photoreceptor cells in the eye's retina. In the case of vision, light is detected by rhodopsin in rod and cone cells. In {{the case of the}} circadian clock, a different photopigment, melanopsin, is responsible for detecting light in intrinsically <b>photosensitive</b> retinal ganglion cells.|$|E
25|$|G protein-coupled receptors {{comprise}} a large protein family of transmembrane receptors. They are {{found only in}} eukaryotes. The ligands which bind and activate these receptors include: <b>photosensitive</b> compounds, odors, pheromones, hormones, and neurotransmitters. These vary in size from small molecules to peptides and large proteins. G protein-coupled receptors are involved in many diseases, and thus are the targets of many modern medicinal drugs.|$|E
25|$|Barn funnel weavers {{are active}} and agile hunters, relying on both their vision and {{movement}} speed {{as well as}} web mechanisms. Their eye configuration, with six out of eight sighting forward, allows them to distinguish even the smallest movement {{in front of them}} and either follow it, or retreat, if the movement is too large. These spiders are also known to be <b>photosensitive,</b> i.e. moving to or fleeing from the light, depending on situations.|$|E
25|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} {{separate}} the two functions provided by silicon in a traditional cell design. Normally the silicon acts as both the source of photoelectrons, {{as well as providing}} the electric field to separate the charges and create a current. In the dye-sensitized solar cell, the bulk of the semiconductor is used solely for charge transport, the photoelectrons are provided from a separate <b>photosensitive</b> dye. Charge separation occurs at the surfaces between the dye, semiconductor and electrolyte.|$|E
25|$|Photosensitivity is an {{abnormal}} skin reaction to direct sunlight exposure. It is unrelated to a sunburn. These reactions {{are due to}} photosensitization, the accumulation of <b>photosensitive</b> compounds beneath the skin. In some cases, the photodynamic substances come from ingested plants or drugs, after being metabolized or not. In other cases, the photodynamic substances may be produced in the body itself due to inborn errors in pigment metabolism, especially those involving the heme synthesis. Photosensitivity reactions are usually seen in herbivorous or omnivorous animals, though such reactions are not uncommon among carnivores.|$|E
25|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cones, since cone cells are not {{sensitive}} enough for a low-photon nighttime environment. There are few coloured oil droplets, which would reduce the light intensity, but the retina contains a reflective layer, the tapetum lucidum. This increases the amount of light each <b>photosensitive</b> cell receives, allowing the bird to see better in low light conditions. Owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in diurnal hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
25|$|At this point, viewers {{started to}} {{complain}} of blurred vision, headaches, dizziness and nausea. A few people even had seizures, blindness, convulsions, and lost consciousness. Japan's Fire Defense Agency reported {{a total of}} 685 viewers, 310 boys and 375 girls, were taken to hospitals by ambulances. Although many victims recovered during the ambulance trip, more than 150 of them were admitted to hospitals. Two people remained hospitalized for over 2 weeks. Some other people had seizures when parts of the scene were rebroadcast during news reports on the seizures. Only {{a small fraction of}} the 685 children treated were diagnosed with <b>photosensitive</b> epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Later {{studies showed}} that 5–10% of the viewers had mild {{symptoms}} that did not need hospital treatment. 12,000 children reported mild symptoms of illness, but their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over {{three years after the}} event found most of them had no further seizures. Scientists believe the flashing lights triggered <b>photosensitive</b> seizures in which visual stimuli like flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although about 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this Pokémon episode was unprecedented.|$|E
25|$|Light {{restriction}} in the evening, {{sometimes called}} darkness therapy or scototherapy, is another treatment strategy. Just as bright light upon awakening should advance one's sleep phase, bright {{light in the}} evening and night delays it (see the PRC). It is suspected that DSPD patients may be overly sensitive to evening light. Thus, one might be advised to keep lights and computer screens dim for the last hours before bedtime and even wear amber-colored (blue-blocking) goggles. The photopigment of the retinal <b>photosensitive</b> ganglion cells, melanopsin, is excited by light mainly in the blue portion of the visible spectrum (absorption peaks at ~480 nanometers).|$|E
25|$|Sometimes strobe {{lighting}} {{can trigger}} seizures in <b>photosensitive</b> epilepsy. An infamous event {{took place in}} 1997 in Japan when an episode of the Pokémon anime, Dennō Senshi Porygon (commonly translated as Electric Soldier Porygon), featured a scene that depicted a huge explosion using flashing red and blue lights, causing about 685 of the viewing children {{to be sent to}} hospitals. These flashes were extremely bright strobe lights. They involved multiple colors with a strobe effect at about 12 Hz. Although 95% of the 685 just complained of dizziness, some were hospitalized. Organizers later said {{that they did not know}} about the threshold of strobing.|$|E
25|$|Public {{reaction}} to the main logo in a June 2007 BBC poll was largely negative; more than 80% of votes gave it the lowest possible rating. Several newspapers ran their own logo competitions, displaying alternative submissions from their readers, and several writers from news agencies criticised the logo. A segment of animated footage released {{at the same time}} as the logo was reported to trigger seizures in a small number of people with <b>photosensitive</b> epilepsy, and a short segment was removed from the London 2012 website in response. It was suggested that the logo resembled the cartoon character Lisa Simpson performing fellatio on her brother Bart Simpson.|$|E
25|$|Compound {{eyes are}} {{found among the}} {{arthropods}} and are composed of many simple facets which, depending {{on the details of}} anatomy, may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images, per eye. Each sensor has its own lens and <b>photosensitive</b> cell(s). Some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors, which are arranged hexagonally, and which can give a full 360° field of vision. Compound eyes are very sensitive to motion. Some arthropods, including many Strepsiptera, have compound eyes of only a few facets, each with a retina capable of creating an image, creating vision. With each eye viewing a different thing, a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain, providing very different, high-resolution images.|$|E
25|$|Spatially encoded {{frequency}} domain OCT (SEFD-OCT, spectral domain or Fourier domain OCT) extracts spectral information by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector stripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a dispersive element (see Fig. 4). Thereby the information {{of the full}} depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single <b>photosensitive</b> diodes, resulting in an SNR (signal to noise ratio) advantage of ~10 dB at much higher speeds. This is {{not much of a}} problem when working at 1300nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.|$|E
25|$|The {{deposition}} of silica by diatoms may also {{prove to be}} of utility to nanotechnology. Diatom cells repeatedly and reliably manufacture valves of various shapes and sizes, potentially allowing diatoms to manufacture micro- or nano-scale structures which may be of use {{in a range of}} devices, including: optical systems; semiconductor nanolithography; and even vehicles for drug delivery. With an appropriate artificial selection procedure, diatoms that produce valves of particular shapes and sizes might be evolved for cultivation in chemostat cultures to mass-produce nanoscale components. It has also been proposed that diatoms {{could be used as a}} component of solar cells by substituting <b>photosensitive</b> titanium dioxide for the silicon dioxide that diatoms normally use to create their cell walls. Diatom biofuel producing solar panels have also been proposed.|$|E
25|$|Architect Renzo Piano {{constructed}} the Zentrum Paul Klee in June 2005. Located in Bern, the museum exhibits about 150 (of 4000 Klee works overall) in a six-month rotation, {{as it is}} impossible to show all of his works at once. Furthermore, his pictures require rest periods; they contain relatively <b>photosensitive</b> colors, inks and papers, which may bleach, change, turn brown and become brittle if exposed to light for too long. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has a comprehensive Klee collection, donated by Carl Djerassi. Other exhibitions include the Sammlung Rosengart in Luzern, the Albertina in Wien and the Berggruen Museum in Berlin. Schools in Gersthofen, Lübeck; Klein-Winternheim, Overath; his place of birth Münchenbuchsee and Düsseldorf bear his name.|$|E
25|$|In offset lithography, which {{depends on}} {{photographic}} processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates {{are used in}} place of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a <b>photosensitive</b> emulsion. A photographic negative of the desired image is placed {{in contact with the}} emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created through direct laser imaging in a CTP (Computer-To-Plate) device called a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. For many years, chemicals have been used to remove the non-image emulsion, but now plates are available that do not require chemical processing.|$|E
25|$|Back at Westlake's lab, Dr. Westlake is {{conducting}} an experiment {{when the lights}} go out. Dr. Westlake and his assistant Yakatito, are astounded to find the synthetic skin is stable after 100 minutes. Westlake deduces that the synthetic skin is <b>photosensitive.</b> Their joy is short lived, when Durant and his crew show up and demand the Bellasarious Memorandum, which Westlake knows nothing about. While searching for the document, Durant and his gang kill Yakatito. They proceed to beat Westlake, burn his hands and dip his face in acid. After they find the document, they rig the lab to explode- leaving Julie to watch the explosion. The blast throws Westlake through the roof, into the river. Thought to be dead, he survives but is hideously burned. He is brought to a hospital and subjected to a radical treatment which cuts the nerves of the spinothalamic tract, so physical pain is no longer felt. However, he also loses his tactile sensation. The loss of this sensory input gives him enhanced strength due to adrenal overload and keeps his injuries from incapacitating him, but its absence also mentally destabilizes him.|$|E
25|$|Due to the aim {{to design}} photoswitchable {{materials}} that have higher working temperatures than those reported to date (~80 K), along with long-lifetime photoexcited states, another strategy for SCO called Ligand-Driven Light Induced Spin Change (LD-LISC) has been studied. This method consists {{of using a}} ligand that is <b>photosensitive</b> in order to trigger the spin interconversion of the metal ion and exciting this ligand with light. The LD-LISC effect {{is followed by a}} structural change of the photoresponsive ligands in contrast to the SCO process where the structures of the ligands are essentially unaffected. The driving force behind the metal ion SCO in this photochemical transformation is cis-trans photoisomerization. The prerequisite for LD-LISC to be observed is that the two complexes formed with the ligand photoisomers, must exhibit different magnetic behaviors as a function of temperature. Upon successive irradiations of the system at two different wavelengths within a temperature range where the metal ion can either be LS or HS, a spin-state interconversion should occur. In order to achieve this, it is convenient to design a metal environment to where {{at least one of the}} complexes exhibits a thermally induced SCO. The LD-LISC has been observed in several iron(II) and iron(III) complexes.|$|E
