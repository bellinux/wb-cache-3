40|$|The U. S. Water and Power Resources Service is {{considering}} reregulating Lake Mohave water levels {{to increase the}} net <b>power</b> <b>benefit</b> from Hoover Dam. Reregulation will not increase the generation capacity of the Hoover powerplant but it will enable the plant operation to be increased when the energy has greater monetary value. Energy generated {{at different times of}} the year has different market value, the highest being in January-March and July- September. By generating more power during these periods more net monetary benefit can be derived from Hoover Dam. The total volume of water released from Hoover Dam over an annual period must remain unchanged due to downstream water requirements for irrigation. To obtain this <b>power</b> <b>benefit,</b> therefore, less water for generation would be discharged during the low market value periods to enable higher discharges during the high market value periods. The discharge regime at Davis Dam would also remain unchanged in order to meet downstream water requirements. Therefore more extreme fluctuations in Lake Mohave water levels would result in order to accommodate changes in the Hoover Dam discharge regime. Water levels in Lake Mohave presently fluctuate from a maximum elevation of about 647 ft. in February-April to a minimum of 630. 5 ft. in September- November. The minimum elevation has been maintained to accommodate the marinas on the lake. To optimize power generation from Hoover Dam, water levels in Lake Mohave will fluctuate from elevations of 600 to 640 ft. The greatest <b>power</b> <b>benefit</b> would be derived from decreased Hoover Dam discharge in April-June and October-December and increased discharge in January-March and July-September… The proposed reregulation alternatives will alter environmental conditions in Lake Mohave because of the extreme variations in water level.

50|$|In 1944, the Canadian and U.S. governments {{agreed to}} begin {{studying}} {{the potential for}} joint development of dams in the Columbia River basin. Planning efforts were slow until a 1948 Columbia River flood caused extensive damage from Trail, British Columbia, to near Astoria, Oregon, completely destroying Vanport, the second largest city in Oregon. The increased interest in flood protection and the growing need for power development initiated 11 years of discussion and alternative proposals for construction of dams in Canada. In 1959, the governments issued a report that recommended principles for negotiating an agreement and apportioning the costs and benefits. Formal negotiations began in February 1960 and the Treaty was signed 17 January 1961 by Prime Minister Diefenbaker and President Eisenhower. The treaty was not implemented, however, until over three years later due to difficulties in creating arrangements for funding {{the construction of the}} Canadian dams and marketing the electrical power owed to Canada which was surplus to Canadian needs during the early treaty years.

The Nevilles also held administrative office under the prince-bishops of Durham.

5000|$|As {{payment for}} the U.S. {{benefits}} realized by the Canadian storage operation, the Treaty required the U.S. to: 1) deliver to Canada one-half of the estimated increase in U.S. downstream <b>power</b> <b>benefits,</b> {{on an ongoing basis}} (the Canadian Entitlement), and 2) make a one-time monetary payment as each of the dams were completed for one-half {{of the value of the}} estimated future flood damages prevented in the U.S. The Canadian Entitlement is calculated five years in advance for each operating year using an agreed treaty calculation method, and the amount varies mainly as a function of forecasted power loads, thermal generating resources, and operating procedures. The method gives Canada a [...] "first-added" [...] storage benefit that ignores U.S. dams built after 1961 (e.g. Libby and Dworshak), limits sales of surplus power to California, and excludes modern fish related constraints at U.S. dams. Without the first two of these limits, the Canadian Entitlement would be slightly less than one-half current values. The Canadian Entitlement during the August 2012 through July 2013 operating year is 504.5 average annual megawatts of energy (reduced by 3.4% for transmission losses, net=~4,269 GWh), shaped hourly at peak rates up to 1321 MW (minus 1.9% for transmission losses, net = 1296 MW). The Canadian Entitlement is marketed by Powerex (electricity). The Canadian Entitlement varies from year to year, but is generally in the range of 4,400 GWh per year and about 1,250 MW of capacity.|$|E
50|$|The annual {{sediment}} load into the Cachi reservoir estimated at 0.81 million tons, which amounts to 1% storage {{volume of the}} reservoir, had been assessed {{at the planning stage}} to be distributed at 54% as thalweg deposits (flushed through low level sluice provided {{in the body of the}} dam), 21% getting deposited on the terraces, 18% flowing out through the spillway by gate operation and power intake through turbines and 7% trapped as bed load in the reservoir. This process is witnessed in two distinct parts of the reservoir - the upper part and the lower part - the upper part gets filled with sand and coarse sediments and the lower part, which is the deep river channel, gets deposited with fine sediment on its terraces which needs to be flushed by reservoir operation (a high concentration of sediments was noted near the power intake). However, for seven years after the project was commissioned, the reservoir was not desilted, which resulted in trapping of 82% of the sediment inflow into the reservoir and which moved towards the body of the dam and interfered with diversion of flow through the power intake in the body of the dam for power generation. The dam is provided with one scouring sluice at the bottom in the main river channel adjacent to the intake screen of the power intake that draws water for power generation. To keep the reservoir in a serviceable condition to derive planned <b>power</b> <b>benefits,</b> it became obligatory to drain the reservoir to its lowest level (though it caused an inevitable economic loss in power generation during the filling stage every year) and flush the deposited sediments downstream so that the intake does not get choked and allows sediment flow into the turbines. The first flushing operation was carried out in three well defined stages in 1973 and thereafter repeated every year till 1990. The downstream impact on the river regime as a result of the silt flushed from the reservoir was also studied when a peak concentration of 400 grams/litre were noted in the form of turbid water not only on the flood plains but also where the river merged with the Atlantic Sea. It was expected that these deposits would be flushed during the flood season. However, as a result of the silt flushing, some detrimental effect on the biota was noted by local people of the area in the downstream reaches of the river below the dam.|$|E
