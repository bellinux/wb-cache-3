5|$|After {{his service}} as governor, Wilkinson {{returned}} to his business pursuits. In the early 1990s, he began borrowing money to keep his bookstore business solvent and to support his lavish lifestyle. His interest in running for another non-consecutive term as governor appeared to be dampened by the system of <b>public</b> <b>financing</b> that Kentucky had in place at that time for gubernatorial elections. In 1995, he published his memoir entitled You Can't Do That, Governor!; a major theme of the book was his disdain for conventional wisdom and political norms. In 1999, he launched ECampus.com, an Internet book retailer. Among the investors in the company were Wendy's founder Dave Thomas, Long John Silver's founder James Patterson, and Ohio State University president William English Kirwan.|$|E

40|$|The essays that {{comprise}} this Handbook cover {{a wide variety}} of topics in the theory of <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> As a field of systematic academic inquiry, <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> arose before economics or political economy. For instance, more than 90 chairs in <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> had been established in Europe before the first chair was established in political economy (Backhaus 2002, p. 615). The first scholars of <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> were the Cameralists, who emerged in central Europe in the 16 th century. For a long time after its Cameralist founding, <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> was conceived as a multi-disciplinary field of study, and most certainly not simply a subset of economic theory. The object that <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> scholarship examined, the public household, was examined in a manner that sought to integrate the economic, political, legal, and administrative elements of <b>public</b> <b>finance.</b> In the post-war period, a splintering of approaches has taken place, sufficiently so that it is meaningful to distinguish between the old <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> and the new, recognizing that new is not a synonym for better. The old <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> has not been replaced by the new. Both are practiced currently, and are competing for the affection and attention of scholars. If the old-style <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> is still called <b>public</b> <b>finance,</b> the new style is often called public economics instead. This distinction is found in contemporary texts and journals. Fo...|$|R

McCain accepted <b>public</b> <b>financing</b> for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E
