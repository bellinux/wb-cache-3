Based on DVD <b>pick-up</b> <b>head</b> and two-photon absorption, two-photon three-dimensional optical disk storage system is built, and operating principle of the overall system is in detail. In the servo module of three-dimensional optical disk storage system, DVD circuit control board (MT 1389 SE) is conducted on three-point improvement: extract focus servo error signal and servo error signal, increase four communications interfaces，increase photoelectric detectors; the extraction of focus and track servo signal on reading and writing module is analyzed in detailed.

When {{applying a}} proper voltage on the liquid crystal cell, a Fresnel-zone-distributed electric field is induced to direct liquid crystals aligned in a concentric structure. Owing to the concentrically aligned liquid crystals, a Fresnel lens is formed. We probe the Fresnel liquid crystal lens using a polarized incident beam with a wavelength of 632. 8 nm, {{finding that the}} diffraction efficiency depends on the applying voltage. A remarkable diffraction efficiency of ~ 39. 5 % is measured at the voltage of 0. 9 V. Additionally, a dual focus lens is fabricated by attaching a plane-convex lens to the Fresnel liquid crystals cell. The Fresnel LC lens and the dual focus lens may be applied for DVD/CD <b>pick-up</b> <b>head,</b> confocal microscopy system, or electrically-controlling optical systems.

40|$|Miniature diffractive lenses are an {{integral}} part of many modern optical systems; from optical disc <b>pick-up</b> <b>heads</b> to optical interconnects. Large feature size diffractive lenses are easily modeled using simple scalar diffraction theory. However, as the feature size of diffractive lenses becomes smaller the theoretical modeling of the systems becomes more complex; a rigorous diffractive theory becomes necessary. This thesis will determine the difference in analyzing a diffractive minilens with either a scalar or rigorous diffraction theory for a free-space optical interconnect with fast Fresnel lenses. The analysis is done for minilenses with f/# of 2. 9 to 8. The results of the analysis show that there is a great amount of non-uniformity in the diffraction efficiency. In particular, for fast lenses, the diffraction efficiency dropped significantly from the center of the lens to the outer edge of the lens. There was no significant polarization sensitivity in the lenses. An experiment was conducted that supported the theoretical results...|$|R

As the project is completed, it will increase the commercial space inventory {{in the town of}} Fairfield by 30%. The project includes a railroad station to be located between Fairfield station and Bridgeport station. Many expect that this station would become a second express <b>pick-up</b> from Fairfield <b>heading</b> toward Stamford and Grand Central, in addition to the downtown Fairfield station. The complex is accessible by exit 24 of I-95, through the traffic circle at Kings Highway, and a two-lane road. As a special permit approved for the Metro Center owners, the town created a special five story zoning district just for this project. The special district will allow the planned buildings to become an office park with vibrant supporting retail and one hotel.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach developed {{to support the}} early stages of designing multidisciplinary products. In the design of such products it is important for various specialists to share representations of the engineering models they use in making trade-off studies. Sharing information among diverse engineering tools at the data level is notoriously difficult and inflexible. When any of the modeling details, assumptions or constraints change, the translation must usually be rewritten. Our solution to this problem is to formalize the exchange of information among engineering specialists and their tools as a problem in communication among agents. The agents share a common ontology and a compositional modeling language (CML) in which models can be created such that conventions, constraints, and assumptions are defined formally and ultimately grounded in logic. We have applied CML {{in the context of a}} <b>pick-up</b> <b>head</b> design problem for DVD (digital versatile disc / digital video disc) pl [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{photonic}} force microscope comprises of an optically trapped micro-probe and {{a position}} detection system {{to track the}} motion of the probe. Signal collection for motion detection is often carried out using the backscattered light off the probe - however, this mode has problems of low S/N due to the small back-scattering cross-sections of the micro-probes typically used. The position sensors often used in these cases are quadrant photodetectors. To ensure maximum sensitivity of such detectors, it would help if the detector size matched with the detection beam radius after the condenser lens (which for backscattered detection would be the trapping objective itself). To suit this condition, we have used a miniature displacement sensor whose dimensions makes it ideal to work with 1 : 1 images of micron-sized trapped probes in the back-scattering detection mode. The detector is based on the quadrant photo-IC in the optical <b>pick-up</b> <b>head</b> of a compact disc player. Using this detector, we measured absolute displacements of an optically trapped 1. 1 um probe with a resolution of ~ 10 nm for a bandwidth of 10 Hz at 95 % significance without any sample or laser stabilization. We characterized our optical trap for different sized probes by measuring the power spectrum for each probe to 1 % accuracy, and found that for 1. 1 um diameter probes, the noise in our position measurement matched the thermal resolution limit for averaging times up to 10 ms. We also achieved a linear response range of around 385 nm with crosstalk between axes ~ 4 % for 1. 1 um diameter probes. The detector has extremely high bandwidth (few MHz) and low optical power threshold - other factors that can lead to it's widespread use in photonic force microscopy.

40|$|Five {{years old}} poplar (Populus spp.) {{plantation}} represents an interesting model of productivity. The most attractive characteristics of this energy crop are the handling flexibility, the high yield of biomass per area unit {{and the good}} quality of the chips obtainable. The mechanical harvesting of five-years old poplar plantations {{requires the use of}} specialized forest machineries such as harvester, feller, forwarder and chipper. Usually, after felling, the working phases consist of extraction, stacking and chipping. Generally, the last one is carried out in a “static phase”, where the product is taken from staked logs by using a hydraulic arm having a gripper that feed the chipping machine. In order to introduce technological innovations for the medium rotation forestry harvesting, the Consiglio per la Ricerca e la sperimentazione in Agricoltura, Unità di ricerca per l’Ingegneria agraria (CRAING) of Monterotondo (Rome, Italy) has developed a five years poplar cutwindrower and a self-propelled chipper equipped with a pick up system. The prototype of cut-windrower is a semi-trailed machine powered by a 95 kW tractor (at least). It mounts a cutting system and a double pincer with variable positioning. During the cutting phase the plant is grasped by the double pincer which conveys and unloads the stem along the inter-row. The trees are placed parallel to the progress of the tractor, but oriented in the opposite direction. The biomass windrowed is then chipped in a dynamic phase directly from the inter row using the self-propelled chipper equipped with the <b>pick-up</b> <b>head.</b> In the first tests, the cut-windrower has reached an operative working capacity of 0. 22 ha h- 1, with an operative production of 44 t h- 1. On the other hand, the self-propelled chipper has showed an operative working capacity equal to 0. 18 ha h- 1, and an operative production of 35 t h- 1 about. Both machines have shown good quality of the work performed and the results obtained indicates that the work phases could be simplified in order to reduce both the time of use and the harvesting costs...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} process of {{pressure}} retarded osmosis (PRO) for salinity gradient energy conversion in power production applications. A mathematical model of the PRO process is developed with consideration for non-ideal effects including internal concentration polarization, external concentration polarization, and spatial variations that are caused by mass transfer and by pressure drop {{along the length of}} the membrane. A mathematical model of the osmotic power plant is also developed with consideration for pre-filtration and <b>pick-up</b> <b>head,</b> and for mechanical and electrical equipment efficiencies. A distinction is made between the gross power developed by the PRO process, and the net power available to the grid after parasitic loads are accounted for. This distinction leads to observation of a trade-off that exists between the different non-ideal effects. A method is developed for adjusting operating conditions in order to minimize the overall impact of non-ideal effects and to achieve maximum net power. Important improvements in net power densities are realized as compared to results obtained when general rules of thumb are used for operating conditions. The mathematical model is validated by experimental investigation of PRO at the bench-scale. It is found that test conditions generally used in the literature may not be appropriate for power production applications. Test conditions which strike a balance between pressure drop and other non-ideal effects may provide more realistic results. An analog electric circuit is developed for a simplified PRO process and osmotic power plant. The analog circuit is used to develop strategies for controlling operating conditions of the system, including by control of the load and by control of a flush valve. Both of these provide satisfactory tracking of the desired operating conditions and can also be used for tracking the maximum power point. The proposed strategies respond quickly to changes in source and load. The osmotic power potential is evaluated for remote micro-grids in Quebec. The osmotic power potential of selected rivers is calculated and compared against peak power demand of nearby communities. In each case, only a small portion of river flow is needed to satisfy the peak power demand of the micro-grids. This suggests that osmotic power can serve as a reliable source of electricity in such applications. An osmotic power plant prototype is designed for Quebec and its potential for power production in remote communities is evaluated...|$|E
