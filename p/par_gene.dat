5000|$|... pSK1 is a plasmid from Staphylococcus aureus. This plasmid has a {{partition}} system {{determined by}} a single gene, par, previously known as orf245. This gene does not effect the plasmid copy number nor the grow rate (excluding its implication in a post-segregational killing system). A centromere-like binding sequence is present upstream of the <b>par</b> <b>gene,</b> and is composed of seven direct repeats and one inverted repeat.|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a genomic clone of an auxin-regulated <b>par</b> <b>gene,</b> {{which is}} expressed {{during the transition}} from G 0 phase to S phase in the early stage of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts cultured in vitro, from a tobacco genomic library using the par cDNA as a probe. When a chimeric gene, in which a reporter gene for bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) was placed downstream of the 5 ' flanking sequences of the <b>par</b> <b>gene,</b> was introduced into tobacco mesophyll protoplasts by electroporation, the chimeric gene elicited auxin-regulated expression of GUS activity. Because deletion of a 111 -base-pair (bp) direct repeat in the 5 ' flanking sequences of the <b>par</b> <b>gene</b> abolished the auxin-induced GUS activity, it is deduced that in the 111 -bp direct repeat of the <b>par</b> <b>gene</b> promoter is localized an auxin-responsive region, which regulates auxin-mediated activation of transcription...|$|E
40|$|A cDNA clone for an auxin-regulated gene was {{isolated}} from a tobacco mesophyll protoplast cDNA library by differential screening. Nucleotide, sequence {{analysis showed that}} the deduced product of the gene, which we have designated par, is hydrophilic and is composed of 220 amino acids. No significant homology to other known proteins was detected. The mRNA of the <b>par</b> <b>gene</b> is approximately 900 bases long and its accumulation was detected in cultured mesophyll protoplasts as early as 30 min after the addition of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid to the culture medium. The par mRNA was not detected in leaves or freshly prepared protoplasts or in protoplasts {{in the absence of}} 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Expression of the <b>par</b> <b>gene</b> was detected at a low level in actively dividing BY- 2 tobacco suspension culture cells. The conspicuous accumulation of par mRNA before the initiation of DNA synthesis in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts suggests that the <b>par</b> <b>gene</b> product could {{play a role in the}} initiation of meristematic activity in differentiated mesophyll cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{causes and}} {{consequences}} of chromosome loss in bacteria with multiple chromosomes are unknown. Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the severe diarrheal disease cholera, has two circular chromosomes. Like many other bacterial chromosomes, both V. cholerae chromosomes contain homologues of plasmid partitioning (<b>par)</b> <b>genes.</b> In plasmids, <b>par</b> <b>genes</b> act to segregate plasmid molecules to daughter cells and thereby ensure plasmid maintenance; however, the contribution of <b>par</b> <b>genes</b> to chromosome segregation is not clear. Here, we show that the chromosome II parAB 2 genes are essential for the segregation of chromosome II but not chromosome I. In a parAB 2 deletion mutant, chromosome II is mislocalized and frequently fails to segregate, yielding cells with only chromosome I. These cells divide once; their progeny are not viable. Instead, chromosome II-deficient cells undergo dramatic cell enlargement, nucleoid condensation and degradation, and loss of membrane integrity. The highly consistent nature of these cytologic changes suggests that prokaryotes, like eukaryotes, may possess characteristic death pathways...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMost cell {{types in}} an {{organism}} show {{some degree of}} polarization, which relies on a surprisingly limited number of proteins. The underlying molecular mechanisms depend, however, on the cellular context. Mutual inhibitions between members of the <b>Par</b> <b>genes</b> are proposed to be sufficient to polarize the C. elegans one-cell zygote and the Drosophila oocyte during mid-oogenesis. By contrast, the <b>Par</b> <b>genes</b> interact with cellular junctions and associated complexes to polarize epithelial cells. The <b>Par</b> <b>genes</b> are also required at an early step of Drosophila oogenesis {{for the maintenance of}} the oocyte fate and its early polarization. Here we show that the <b>Par</b> <b>genes</b> are not sufficient to polarize the oocyte early and that the activity of the tumor-suppressor gene lethal giant larvae (lgl) is required for the posterior translocation of oocyte-specific proteins, including germline determinants. We also found that Lgl localizes asymmetrically within the oocyte and is excluded from the posterior pole. We further demonstrate that phosphorylation of Par- 1, Par- 3 (Bazooka) and Lgl is crucial to regulate their activity and localization in vivo and describe, for the first time, adherens junctions located around the ring canals, which link the oocyte to the other cells of the germline cyst. However, null mutations in the DE-cadherin gene, which encodes the main component of the zonula adherens, do not affect the early polarization of the oocyte. We conclude that, despite sharing many similarities with other model systems at the genetic and cellular levels, the polarization of the early oocyte relies on a specific subset of polarity proteins...|$|R
40|$|Vibrio cholerae carries homologs of plasmid-borne parA and parB genes {{on both of}} its chromosomes. The <b>par</b> <b>genes</b> help to {{segregate}} many plasmids and chromosomes. Here we have studied the <b>par</b> <b>genes</b> of V. cholerae chromosome I. Earlier studies suggested that ParBI binds to the centromeric site parSI near the origin of replication (oriI), and parSI-ParBI complexes are placed at the cell poles by ParAI. Deletion of parAI and parSI caused the origin-proximal DNA to be less polar. Here we found that deletion of parBI also resulted in a less polar localization of oriI. However, unlike the deletion of parAI, the deletion of parBI increased the oriI number. Replication was normal when both parAI and parBI were deleted, suggesting that ParBI mediates its action through ParAI. Overexpression of ParAI in a parABI-deleted strain also increased the DNA content. The results {{are similar to those}} found for Bacillus subtilis, where ParA (Soj) stimulates replication and this activity is repressed by ParB (SpoOJ). As in B. subtilis, the stimulation of replication most likely involves the replication initiator DnaA. Our results indicate that control of chromosomal DNA replication is an additional function of chromosomal <b>par</b> <b>genes</b> conserved across the Gram-positive/Gram-negative divide...|$|R

40|$|The Bacillus plasmid pLS 11 {{partitions}} faithfully during cell division. Using a partition-deficient plasmid vector, we randomly cloned DNA {{fragments of}} plasmid pLS 11 and identified the locus that regulates plasmid partition (par) by cis complementation in Bacillus subtilis. The cloned <b>par</b> <b>gene</b> conferred upon the vector plasmid {{a high degree}} of segregational stability. The par locus was mapped to a 167 -base-pair segment on pLS 11, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The cloned par fragment regulated the partition of several different Bacillus replicons, and it only functioned in cis; it did not contain the replication function nor elevate the plasmid copy number in B. subtilis. The expression of par was orientation specific with respect to the replication origin on the same plasmid. We propose that the pLS 11 -derived par functions as a single-stranded site that interacts with other components involved in plasmid partition during cell division...|$|E
40|$|Eleven {{independent}} insertion mutations {{were isolated}} that prevented expression of major outer membrane protein 1 b. Seven of the mutations were Mucts insertions located at ombP. These ompB::Mucts strains fell into two phenotypic classes {{with regard to}} expression of proteins 1 a and 1 b. The remaining four mutants were comprised of one Tn 5 and three Mucts insertions mapping at par. The Mucts insertions at par were used to construct fusions of the lac operon to the par promoter. Expression of beta-galactosidase in these fusion strains reflected known regulatory properties of protein 1 b. When an ompB allele was introduced into the par-lac fusion strains, beta-galactosidase activity was reduced 14 - to 31 -fold. Transcriptional regulation of the <b>par</b> <b>gene</b> {{and the existence of}} two functions at ompB are discussed.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{polarization}} of the anterior–posterior axis (A-P) of the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote {{depends on the}} activity of the <b>par</b> <b>genes</b> and the presence of intact microfilaments. Functional links between the PAR proteins and the cytoskeleton, however, have not been fully explored. It has recently been shown that in mammalian cells, some PAR homologs form a complex with activated Cdc 42, a Rho GTPase that is implicated in the control of actin organization and cellular polarity. A role for Cdc 42 in the establishment of embryonic polarity in C. elegans has not been described. Results: To investigate the function of Cdc 42 in the control of cellular and embryonic polarity in C. elegans, we used RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) to inhibit cdc- 42 activity in the early embryo. Here, we demonstrate that RNAi of cdc- 42 disrupts manifestations of polarity in the early embryo, that these phenotypes depend on par- 2 and par- 3 gene function, and that cdc- 42 is required for the localization of the PAR proteins. Conclusions: Our genetic analysis of the regulatory relationships between cdc- 42 and the <b>par</b> <b>genes</b> demonstrates that Cdc 42 organizes embryonic polarity by controlling the localization and activity of the PAR proteins. Combined with the recent biochemical analysis of their mammalian homologs, these results simultaneously identify both a regulator of the PAR proteins, activated Cdc 42, and effectors for Cdc 42, the PAR complex...|$|R
40|$|The <b>par</b> <b>genes</b> were {{discovered}} in genetic screens for regulators of cytoplasmic partitioning in the early embryo of C. elegans, and encode six different proteins required for asymmetric cell division by the worm zygote. Some of the PAR proteins are localized asymmetrically and form physical complexes with one another. Strikingly, the PAR proteins {{have been found to}} regulate cell polarization in many different contexts in diverse animals, suggesting they form part of an ancient and fundamental mechanism for cell polarization. Although the picture of how the PAR proteins function remains incomplete, cell biology and biochemistry are beginning to explain how PAR proteins polarize cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{orientation}} of the mitotic spindle influences the asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic determinants and the positioning of the sibling cell, and therefore has important influences on cell-fate determination and patterning of the embryo. Both {{the establishment of an}} axis of polarity and the adjustment of this axis with respect to the coordinates of the embryo have to be controlled. None of the genes identified so far that are involved in these processes seems to have been conserved between flies and nematodes. Results: Here, we show that the bazooka gene encodes a protein with three putative protein-interaction motifs known as PDZ domains and is the first Drosophila representative of the <b>par</b> <b>gene</b> family of Caenorhabditis elegans, members of which are required for establishment of anterior–posterior polarity of the nematode embryo. The bazooka RNA and protein were found to be restricted to the apical cortical cytoplasm of epithelial cells and neuroblasts. Embryos that were mutant for bazooka frequently failed to coordinate the axis of cell polarity with that of the embryo. This was manifested as defective spindle orientation and mispositioning of the daughter cell after division. Conclusions: The Drosophila gene bazooka is likely {{to be part of a}} regulatory mechanism required to coordinate the axis of polarity of a cell with that of the embryo. The PDZ domains of Bazooka provide several protein–protein interfaces, which possibly participate in the assembly of a multiprotein complex at the apical pole...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{neonatal}} bovine {{mammary fat}} pad (MFP) surrounding the mammary parenchyma (PAR) {{is thought to}} exert proliferative effects on the PAR through secretion of local modulators of growth induced by systemic hormones. We used bioinformatics to characterize transcriptomics differences between PAR and MFP from ~ 65 d old Holstein heifers. Data were mined to uncover potential crosstalk through the analyses of signaling molecules preferentially expressed in one tissue relative to the other. Results Over 9, 000 differentially expressed genes (DEG; False discovery rate ≤ 0. 05) were found of which 1, 478 had a ≥ 1. 5 -fold difference between PAR and MFP. Within the DEG highly-expressed in PAR vs. MFP (n = 736) we noted significant enrichment of functions related to cell cycle, structural organization, signaling, and DNA/RNA metabolism. Only actin cytoskeletal signaling was significant among canonical pathways. DEG more highly-expressed in MFP vs. PAR (n = 742) belong to lipid metabolism, signaling, cell movement, and immune-related functions. Canonical pathways associated with metabolism and signaling, particularly immune- and metabolism-related were significantly-enriched. Network analysis uncovered a central role of MYC, TP 53, and CTNNB 1 in controlling expression of DEG highly-expressed in PAR vs. MFP. Similar analysis suggested a central role for PPARG, KLF 2, EGR 2, and EPAS 1 in regulating expression of more highly-expressed DEG in MFP vs. <b>PAR.</b> <b>Gene</b> network analyses revealed putative inter-tissue crosstalk between cytokines and growth factors preferentially expressed in one tissue (e. g., ANGPTL 1, SPP 1, IL 1 B in PAR vs. MFP; ADIPOQ, IL 13, FGF 2, LEP in MFP vs. PAR) with DEG preferentially expressed in the other tissue, particularly transcription factors or pathways (e. g., MYC, TP 53, and actin cytoskeletal signaling in PAR vs. MFP; PPARG and LXR/RXR Signaling in MFP vs. PAR). Conclusions Functional analyses underscored a reciprocal influence in determining the biological features of MFP and PAR during neonatal development. This was exemplified by the potential effect that the signaling molecules (cytokines, growth factors) released preferentially (i. e., more highly-expressed) by PAR or MFP could have on molecular functions or signaling pathways enriched in the MFP or PAR. These bidirectional interactions might be required to coordinate mammary tissue development under normal circumstances or in response to nutrition. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{phytochrome}} (phy) photoreceptors modulate plant development after {{perception of}} light. Upon illumination of etiolated seedlings, phys initiate a transcriptional cascade by directly transducing light {{signals to the}} promoters of genes encoding regulators of morphogenesis. In light-grown plants, however, {{little is known about}} the transcriptional cascade modulated by phys in response to changes in light. The phy entry points in this cascade are completely unknown. We are particularly interested in the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). Here we describe a subset of six genes whose expression is rapidly modulated by phys during both deetiolation and SAS in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Using cycloheximide, we provide evidence that four of these phy rapidly regulated (<b>PAR)</b> <b>genes</b> are direct targets of phy signaling during SAS, revealing these genes as upstream components of the transcriptional cascade. Promoter-β-glucuronidase fusions confirmed that <b>PAR</b> <b>genes</b> are photoregulated at the transcriptional level. Analysis of gene expression in light signal transduction mutants showed that COP 1 and DET 1 (but not DET 2 or HY 5) play a role in modulating PAR expression in response to shade in light-grown seedlings. Moreover, genetic analyses showed that one of the genes identified as a direct target of phy signaling was phy-interacting factor 3 -like- 1 (PIL 1). PIL 1 has previously been implicated in SAS in response to transient shade, but we show here that it also plays a key role in response to long-term shade.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an extraordinarily useful model for studying early development, but the mech-anisms that link embryonic polarity to the specification of cell fates are still poorly understood (reviewed in [1]).

CXYorf 1 was present on the X in primates and also in mouse, but autosomal in wallaby, suggesting a later addition 70 - 130 million years ago, and IL 9 R was on the X only in primate, suggesting addition 60 - 70 million years ago. The results therefore demonstrate that at least two independent additions were necessary for PAR 2 evolution. The present gene order on the human X also requires two inversions.

40|$|The KH domain protein MEX- 3 {{is central}} to the {{temporal}} and spatial control of PAL- 1 expression in the C. elegans early embryo. PAL- 1 is a Caudal-like homeodomain protein that is required to specify the fate of posterior blastomeres. While pal- 1 mRNA is present throughout the oocyte and early embryo, PAL- 1 protein is expressed only in posterior blastomeres, starting at the four-cell stage. To better understand how PAL- 1 expression is regulated temporally and spatially, we have identified MEX- 3 interacting proteins (MIPs) and characterized in detail two that are required for the patterning of PAL- 1 expression. RNA interference of MEX- 6, a CCCH zinc-finger protein, or SPN- 4, an RNA recognition motif protein, causes PAL- 1 to be expressed in all four blastomeres starting at the four-cell stage. Genetic analysis of the interactions between these mip <b>genes</b> and the <b>par</b> <b>genes,</b> which provide polarity information in the early embryo, defines convergent genetic pathways that regulate MEX- 3 stability and activity to control the spatial pattern of PAL- 1 expression. These experiments suggest that par- 1 and par- 4 affect distinct processes. par- 1 is required for many aspects of embryonic polarity, including the restriction of MEX- 3 and MEX- 6 activity to the anterior blastomeres. We find that PAL- 1 is not expressed in par- 1 mutants, because MEX- 3 and MEX- 6 remain active in the posterior blastomeres. The role of par- 4 is less well understood. Our analysis suggests that par- 4 is required to inactivate MEX- 3 at the four-cell stage. Thus, PAL- 1 is not expressed in par- 4 mutants because MEX- 3 remains active in all blastomeres.

A mini derivative, pMT 2, was constructed by partial PstI digestion and ligation with a fragment encoding KmR. The complete sequence of pMT 2 was determined.

Loss of Par 6 resulted in defects in skeletogenesis and gut differentiation in larvae. Phenotypic analyses of chimeras constructed by PMC swapping showed that Par 6 in non-PMCs is required for differentiation of archenteron into functional gut. In contrast, Par 6 in both PMCs and ectodermal cells cooperatively regulates skeletogenesis.

The operon {{is followed by a}} centromere analog, parS, at which ParB binds. ParA, a weak ATPase, represses the par promoter most effectively in its ADP-bound form. ParB can recruit ParA to parS, stimulate its ATPase, and significantly stimulate the repression.

The repression increase was sensitive to the levels of ParA and ParB and to their ratio. The increase may be attributable to a conformational change in ParA mediated by the parS-ParB complex, possibly acting catalytically. We also observed an in cis effect of parS which enhanced expression of parB, presumably due to a selective modulation of the mRNA level. Although ParB had been earlier found to spread into and silence genes flanking parS, silencing of the par operon by ParB spreading was not significant. Based upon analogies between partitioning and septum placement, we speculate that the regulatory switch controlled by the parS-ParB complex might be essential for partitioning itself...|$|R

We previously reported that deletion of par 1 and par 2, two S. pombe genes encoding B' regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2 A, causes a multiseptation phenotype, {{very similar to that}} seen in hyperactive SIN mutants. In this study, we examined the genetic interactions between par deletions and mutations in the genes encoding components of SIN and found that deletion of par 1 and par 2 suppressed the morphological and viability defects caused by overproduction of Byr 4 p and rescued a loss-of-function allele of spg 1. However, par deletions could not suppress any mutations in genes downstream of spg 1 in the SIN pathway. We showed further that, in suppressing the lethality of a spg 1 loss-of-function allele, the correct localization of Cdc 7 p to the spindle pole body (SPB), which is normally lost in spg 1 mutant cells, was restored. The fact that par mutant cells themselves exhibited a symmetric localization of Cdc 7 p to SPBs indicated a hyperactivity of SIN in such cells.

Key properties of the ParB protein have been identified and are associated with {{different parts of the}} protein. The ParB- ParB interaction domain was mapped in vivo and in vitro to the C-terminal 56 amino acids (aa); 7 aa at the C terminus play an important role. The dimerization domain of P. aeruginosa ParB is interchangeable with the dimerization domain of KorB from plasmid RK 2 (IncP 1 group). The C-terminal part of ParB is also involved in ParB-ParA interactions. Purified ParB binds specifically to DNA containing a putative parS sequence based on the consensus sequence found in the chromosomes of Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, and Streptomyces coelicolor. The overproduction of ParB was shown to inhibit the function of genes placed near parS. This “silencing” was dependent on the parS sequence and its orientation. The overproduction of P. aeruginosa ParB or its N-terminal part also causes inhibition of the growth of P. aeruginosa and P. putida but not Escherichia coli cells. Since this inhibitory determinant is located well away from ParB segments required for dimerization or interaction with the ParA counterpart, this result may suggest a role for the N terminus of P. aeruginosa ParB in interactions with host cell components...|$|R

Sequence identity values between the X and Y copies of each gene is on average 91 %, significantly higher than the values obtained by comparing different members of the family. FISH mapping experiments performed in several primate species revealed an identical localization of the X-linked copies to that in man, but different localizations of the Y homologs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{establishment}} of polarity in the embryo is fundamental for the correct {{development of an}} organism [1]. The first cleavage of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is asymmetric with certain cytoplasmic components being distributed unequally between the daughter cells [2 – 4]. Using a genetic screen, Kemphues and co-workers have identified six <b>par</b> <b>genes</b> (partition-defective) [5, 6], which {{are involved in the}} process of asymmetric division. One of these genes encodes a highly conserved protein, PAR- 1, which is a serine/threonine kinase that localizes asymmetrically to the posterior part of the zygote and to those blastocysts that give rise to the germ line [7 – 9]. We reasoned that the mammalian homologue of PAR- 1 (mPAR- 1) might be involved in the process of polarization of epithelial cells, which consist of apical and basolateral membrane domains. We found that mPAR- 1 was expressed {{in a wide variety of}} epithelial tissues and cell lines and was associated with the cellular cortex. In polarized epithelial cells, mPAR- 1 was asymmetrically localized to the lateral domain. A fusion protein lacking the kinase domain had the same localization as the full-length protein but its prolonged expression acted in a dominant-negative fashion: lateral adhesion of the transfected cells to neighbouring cells was diminished, resulting in the former cells being ‘squeezed out’ from the monolayer. Moreover, the polarity of these cells was disturbed resulting in mislocalization of E-cadherin. Thus, in the C. elegans embryo and in epithelial cells, polarity appears to be governed by similar mechanisms...|$|R

The Drosophila homologs of par- 1, par- 3 (bazooka, baz), par- 6 (DmPar- 6), and pkc- 3 (Drosophila aPKC, DaPKC) each are known to play conserved roles in the generation of cell polarity in the germ line as well as in epithelial and neural precursor cells within the embryo. In light of this functional conservation, we examined the potential role of baz and DaPKC in the regulation of oocyte polarity. Our analyses reveal germ-line autonomous roles for baz and DaPKC in the establishment of initial anterior-posterior polarity within germ-line cysts and maintenance of oocyte cell fate. Germ-line clonal analyses indicate both proteins are essential for two key aspects of oocyte determination: the posterior translocation of oocyte specification factors and the posterior establishment of the microtubule organizing center within the presumptive oocyte. We demonstrate BAZ and DaPKC colocalize to belt-like structures between germarial cyst cells. However, in contrast to their regulatory relationship in the Drosophila and C. elegans embryos, these proteins are not mutually dependent for their germ-line localization, nor is either protein specifically required for PAR- 1 localization to the fusome. Therefore, whereas BAZ, DaPKC, and PAR- 1 are functionally conserved in establishing oocyte polarity, the regulatory relationships among these genes are not well conserved, indicating these molecules function differently in different cellular contexts...|$|R
