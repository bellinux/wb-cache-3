50|$|<b>Pre-media</b> or premedia is a {{term used}} in the design, {{creative}} and publishing industries with an evolving and contestable meaning. For some persons in those industries, it refers to any number of activities that occur between the moment an initial idea for a product is articulated and the moment production is complete. This can include further product ideation and the finalization of a product concept including a strong clear message of positive product differentiation; prototype development and design, market testing, prototype modification and finalization; and the management {{of all of these}} processes leading to and including the digital and/or print production that takes place after they are complete. For some working premedia groups, it can even include further production needed later {{in the life of the}} product when market need supports it.|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{important}} to know media and educational intervention and also produce them according to standards. Thus, media and health educational interventions should be evaluated to improve education quality. Methods:¬ The present study was conducted to evaluate the whole produced media and interventions in all medical universities, departments, offices, and centers affiliated to ministry of health as sample size in 2008 - 2009. The evaluating tool was a checklist which was prepared in four domains including <b>pre-media</b> – media and intervention specifications- production and implementation - and internal evaluation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to develop some {{comments}} and comparisons between Edgar Allan Poe’s poem “The Raven” (1845) and his essay “Philosophy of Composition” (1846), as part of a semiotic translation of that poem, notably in the movie industry, visual arts, HQ and other productions intermedia, with the theoretical and critical pillars initially based on Poe’s poetry itself. In terms of methodology, inter-semiotic and intermediality translation studies played a major role. Among the findings of this article, there is the genetic potential of the crow to interartistical and inter-semiotic transpositions, which are strongly anchored to the Philosophy of Composition, which was and still is an ode to the meticulous artistic work, and, at the same time, the poetic modern tale and an important <b>pre-media</b> trail, to signal and anticipate some features still felt in the literary, visual, and cinematographic arts today. As of Poe´s legacy to the cinema, the first film directors and producers soon realized the strength of the seventh art to translate into few images larger contexts, as the biographical ones, and they also realized the cinematographic potential in merging real and fictional stories, documenting and aestheticizing reality. Cinema was, then, perceived as a new and strong expression, able to generate new meanings and lead the viewer, which was the way Poe used to refer to narrative and poetic literature...|$|E
40|$|Offshoring is {{the reality}} of globalization. According to a survey {{conducted}} by trendstowatchgraphics. com, the percentage of American print providers who are worried about US print buyers offshoring their print requirements increased from 1 % in 1995 to 7 % in 2005. According to a survey conducted by the Graphics Arts Technical Foundation, 40 % of the printers in the US think that their current customers are also seeking out offshore printers for their printing needs. According to UN Comtrade, exports of printed matter to the US from China in 2005 amounted to $ 722 million, and exports of printed matter to the US from India during the same period amounted to $ 52 million (The market for overseas print providers, 2006). China is currently the preferred destination for US print buyers for offshoring their print requirements. But India, having invested heavily in education, is likely to see phenomenal growth in the upcoming years. While China is well-known for manufacturing, India has grown in the IT sector. India is also developing its infrastructure to enhance growth in the manufacturing sector. According to Mr. Regis Delmontagne, former president of the Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing, and Converting Technologies (NPES) : xii India, today, is not merely a target market for products from outside its borders... and not just a place foreign customers will turn for less expensive printing. It is also a source of new products, new technologies, and new ideas.... The United States remains India’s largest trading partner, providing both a market for Indian goods and services and a dependable flow of the latest technologies to help India continue its competitive emergence. (as cited in Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing, and Converting Technologies, 2006) This thesis reports on the results of two surveys: one sent to book publishers in the US and the other sent to Indian print service providers. The main results of the thesis are as follows: • Turnaround times and quality concerns are the biggest barriers prohibiting the growth of Indian printers in the US print buying market. • The US book publishers are not aware of the manufacturing capabilities of the Indian printers. They are more prone towards sending their <b>pre-media</b> requirements to India • Confidentiality, level of technology and infrastructure, and range of services offered by the Indian print service providers are the three main criteria by the US book publishers while selecting Indian print service providers. • There is definitely an opportunity for the Indian print service providers in the US print buying market if they can create brand name, pay more attention to quality, establish a common medium for communication, and plan and schedule accurately...|$|E

The study was limited to high schools in the province of Chiriqui, Panama, took a sample of six schools in the province and for each school involved both students and teachers. The main objective of the project was to demonstrate how robotics education, facilitates and encourages teaching and learning of science and technology. The results showed that robotics could become an excellent tool to understand abstract concepts and complex subjects in the area of science and technology, as well as allowing developing basic skills such as teamwork.

El estudio se limita a los colegios secundarios de la Provincia de Chiriquí, República de Panamá; se tomó una muestra de seis colegios de la provincia y por cada colegio participaron tanto estudiantes como docentes. El objetivo principal del proyecto fue demostrar como la robótica aplicada a la educación, facilita y motiva la enseñanza-aprendizaje de las ciencias y las tecnologías.   Los resultados demostraron que la robótica se puede convertir en una herramienta excelente para comprender conceptos abstractos y complejos en asignaturas del área de las ciencias y las tecnologías; así como también permite desarrollar competencias básicas tales como trabajar en equipo. <!
