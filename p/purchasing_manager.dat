The literature on clinical versus statistical prediction suggests that humans in general, including <b>purchasing</b> <b>managers,</b> are often outperformed by relatively simple statistical formulas for such kinds of tasks.

5000|$|A <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Manager</b> is an {{employee}} within a company, business or other organization {{who is responsible}} at some level for buying or approving the acquisition {{of goods and services}} needed by the company.

The position responsibilities may be the same as that of a buyer or purchasing agent, or may include wider supervisory or managerial responsibilities. A <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Manager</b> may oversee the acquisition of materials needed for production, general supplies for offices and facilities, equipment, or construction contracts.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{contribution}} of the purchasing function to ecological innovation in the upstream supply chains of manufacturing companies. In terms of innovation type, <b>purchasing</b> <b>managers</b> reported much more activity on ecological process innovation than on product or organisational innovation. Few <b>purchasing</b> <b>managers</b> initiate ecological innovation in supply themselves, although they can play a range of supporting roles, not least lobbying for internal acceptance of supplier innovations. Among the motives for undertaking such initiatives, cost advantages, corporate reputation, supply chain pressure and legal requirements dominate. While making a significant contribution, the role of <b>purchasing</b> <b>managers</b> in ecological innovation is thus, at the same time, somewhat limited. To an extent, these limitations can be explained by a lag between the technological innovations <b>purchasing</b> <b>managers</b> can induce in their supply chains and a lack in organisational innovation in the rules and practices that govern their own work.
