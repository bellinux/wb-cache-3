Twelve of these isolates and four other Xanthomonas isolates were spray- and pin-inoculated onto 21 different plant species/cultivars including horseradish (Armoracia rusticana), radish (Raphanus sativus). and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). The remaining 13 <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> isolates were spray-inoculated onto a subset of 10 plant species/cultivars. The <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> isolates were very aggressive on several Brassica spp [...] radish, and tomato causing <b>leaf</b> <b>spots</b> and dark sunken lesions on the middle vein, petiole, and stem. Based on the differential reactions of several Brassica spp. and radish cultivars, the <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> isolates were divided into three races. with races 1 and 3 predominating. A differential series was established to determine the race-type of isolates and a gene-for-gene model based on the interaction of two avirtslence genes in the pathogen races and two snatching resistance genes in the differential hosts is proposed.
