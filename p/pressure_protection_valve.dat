The main goal of the thesis is to elaborate on the dynamic modelling, to prepare and apply a model simplification approach, to identify the unknown model parameters and to develop a pressure limiting controller design using the nonlinear model of the mechatronic <b>protection</b> <b>valve.</b> It has been shown that the mechatronic <b>protection</b> <b>valve</b> can be described as a mixed thermodynamical, mechanical and electro-magnetic system. Its dynamic model is built and verified by using a systematic modelling methodology. The state equations of the nonlinear dynamic model possesses a special algebraic structure. The model exhibits hybrid or switching behavior caused by different included elements with inherently discrete behavior. Having performed a systematic modelling procedure the obtained model for control design purpose has been considered for model simplification. A systematic model simplification approach has been developed.

50|$|A high-integrity <b>pressure</b> <b>protection</b> system (HIPPS) {{is a type}} {{of safety}} {{instrumented}} system (SIS) designed to prevent over-pressurization of a plant, such as a chemical plant or oil refinery. The HIPPS will shut off the source of the high pressure before the design pressure of the system is exceeded, thus preventing loss of containment through rupture (explosion) of a line or vessel. Therefore, a HIPPS is considered as a barrier between a high-pressure and a low-pressure section of an installation.|$|R

50|$|The air {{compressor}} {{is driven by}} the engine either by crankshaft pulley via a belt or directly from the engine timing gears. It is lubricated and cooled by the engine lubrication and cooling systems. Compressed air is first routed through a cooling coil and into an air dryer which removes moisture and oil impurities and also may include a pressure regulator, safety valve and smaller purge reservoir. As an alternative to the air dryer, the supply system can be equipped with an anti-freeze device and oil separator. The compressed air is then stored in a reservoir (also called a wet tank) from which it is then distributed via a four way <b>protection</b> <b>valve</b> into the front and rear brake circuit air reservoir, a parking brake reservoir and an auxiliary air supply distribution point. The system also includes various check, pressure limiting, drain and safety valves.|$|R

40|$|Summary and Conclusion Emergency Shutdown (ESD) {{valves and}} High Integrity <b>Pressure</b> <b>Protection</b> System (HIPPS) <b>valves</b> are final {{elements}} in Safety Instrumented Systems. Proof or functional testing are performed at specific intervals {{in order to}} ensure the valves’ function. For these type of valves, such tests may require costly shutdowns. For a final element, like a valve, the interval between proof tests are by performance based standards like IEC 61505 / 61511, related to the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) for the element’s complete function. Partial Stroke Testing (PST) can reduce the time between such tests. PST is performed by allowing the valve to start closing, and to start reopening before the process is interrupted. By performing a partial test at a shorter interval, a fraction of the dangerous undetected failures, the PST coverage, are tested more often. This will reduce the PFD and imply that the proof test interval can be extended, still achieving the same Safety Integrity Level (SIL). Three systems for PST have been evaluated: The Emerson FieldVue DVC 6000 SIS, the Drallim Smart Valve Monitoring and the Crane ValveWatch II. ValveWatch and Smart Valve Monitoring provides leak testing in open and closed position, respectively. Leak testing on an open valve is treated as a partial test and is included in the PST coverage. FieldVue can not be used on hydraulic operated valves. Three ESD valves and one HIPPS valve on the Kollsnes gas processing plant have been analyzed. Two systems have been evaluated for each valve. A Failure Mode, E. ects and Diagnostic Analysis has been performed on the tested parts of each valve’s complete function. Based on this analysis, the PST coverage and increased test intervals are calculated. The PST coverage found for the hydraulic operated ESD gate valves are 66 % and 74 % for ValveWatch and Smart Valve Monitoring, respectively. For the pneumatic operated ESD ball valve, a PST coverage of 21 % has been found for FieldVue and 56 % for Smart Valve Monitoring. The calculated intervals between functional tests to achive a SIL 2 rating, are between 0, 54 and 0, 89 years for these ESD valves. SIL 2 corresponds to a PFD < 10 - 2. For the ESD valves, new control circuits with lower failure rates should be designed in order to improve the results. Today’s one year proof test interval on ESD valves seems not to be in accordance with the standard used in this project, i. e to achieve SIL 2 the proof test interval should be reduced. A PST coverage of 100 % and 0 % has been found on the HIPPS solenoid valve for Smart Valve Monitoring and FieldVue, respectively. The PST coverage for the valve and actuator is 53 % for both systems. Based on an inital annual test interval for the overall <b>pressure</b> <b>protection</b> system, is PST, by the system with best coverage, roughly estimated to increase the test interval by 76 %. The results are highly dependent on the choices and assumptions made in this project. A closer study of experience data could have increased the quality of the analysis. Such data is not found easily available. The results are assumed to be relatively conservative. Deeper involvement of professionals with operational experience from relevant areas would probably also have improved the quality. The Drallim Smart Valve Monitoring has achieved the best results in this analysis. ValveWatch and FieldVue would improve their PST coverage if ESD solenoids were tested. They are also able to monitor actual shutdowns and may contribute to document a shutdown as proof test. These systems also make more measurements and may be better suited for predictive maintenance purposes. ValveWatch has achieved the highest PST coverage for a valve separately, because of its leak test. All the evaluated systems will give increased knowledge about the valve’s condition, and thereby improve safety. The PFD will be substantially reduced. Future needs at Kollsnes should be analyzed further, and an eventual installation of such systems should be done according to these needs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Safety-instrumented systems (SISs) are {{technical}} {{systems that}} are used to protect humans, the environment, or assets from hazardous events. It is therefore important to ensure that these SISs are reliable. 61508 is an international standard {{that can be used to}} achieve this reliability for SISs in all industries. It is also used to develop sector-specific standards such as 61511 for the process industry. 61508 frames the activities needed to ensure reliable SISs in a safety life cycle. Requirements for design, installation, operation, maintenance, and so on is given in the safety life cycle. The methods and terminology presented in 61508 is clarified in this thesis. If the risk of a system is higher than what can be tolerated, the necessary risk reduction is defined as the difference between actual risk and tolerable risk. The tolerable risk is achieved by defining safety functions that reduce the risk. A safety-instrumented function (SIF) is a safety function performed by a SIS. When a SIF is defined, an integrity requirement is set. The integrity requirement is divided into four safety integrity levels (SILs). A SIL is a measure of how reliable the SIF is. The reliability of a SIF determines its ability to prevent an undesired hazard. This way, the integrity requirement can be translated into a reduction in risk for the system that the SIF protects. The process of defining SIFs and determining their integrity requirements to achieve tolerable risk is called SIL allocation. There are many ways to conduct SIL allocation. Some of these methods are examined and discussed in this thesis. An end-user of a SIS, for example an oil company, does usually not design their own SISs. They analyze the system where a risk reduction is necessary and specify functional requirements and integrity requirements for the SIS. These requirements are gathered in a safety requirements specification. The content of the safety requirement specification is presented and discussed in this thesis. One of the application areas of a SIS is in subsea installations. To reduce the cost of flowlines at the Kristin field, high integrity <b>pressure</b> <b>protection</b> systems are installed. The flowlines are rated to a lower pressure than the pressure at the wellhead of the subsea well. To be able to install these flowlines, a HIPPS is installed as an extra safety measure to block high pressure flow to enter the flowline if the control system fails. The high integrity <b>pressure</b> <b>protection</b> have to achieve a SIL 3 rating, which is the second strictest SIL rating. To verify that the high integrity <b>pressure</b> <b>protection</b> at Kristin achieves a SIL 3 rating, the average probability of failure on demand is calculated. This is a measure of the reliability of a SIS that operates in a low-demand mode according to 61508. Low demand mode means that the SIF, on the average, is demanded less often than once per year. The calculations show that the SIL 3 requirement is met if all tests suggested in the case was implemented. It is also worth mentioning that common cause failures represent a large proportion of unavailability of the SIF. Common cause failures arise due to dependencies between some of the elements of the SIS. To achieve a SIL 3 rating, the SIS also has to fulfill requirements to robustness. These requirements are called the architectural constraints. As shown in this thesis, the high integrity <b>pressure</b> <b>protection</b> system also fulfills the SIL 3 according to the architectural constraints. Assumptions and simplifications are made in the reliability assessments to enable the calculation of reliability measures such as the average probability of failure on demand. This introduces uncertainties in the calculations. The reliability data that is used will also constitute uncertainty. It is discussed in the thesis that 61508 maybe should introduce a framework for uncertainty assessments as the uncertainty in cases with small margins might be decisive...|$|R

50|$|Partial stroke testing (or PST) is a {{technique}} used in a control system to allow the user to test {{a percentage of the}} possible failure modes of a shut down valve without the need to physically close the valve. PST is used to assist in determining that the safety function will operate on demand. PST is most often used on high integrity emergency shutdown valves (ESDVs) in applications where closing the valve will have a high cost burden yet proving the integrity of the valve is essential to maintaining a safe facility. In addition to ESDVs PST is also used on high integrity <b>pressure</b> <b>protection</b> systems or HIPPS. Partial stroke testing is not a replacement for the need to fully stroke valves as proof testing is still a mandatory requirement.|$|R
