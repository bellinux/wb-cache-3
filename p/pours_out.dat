5|$|The upper {{creature}} {{may be a}} dog or a cat. Blood <b>pours</b> <b>out</b> of {{its mouth}} onto the head and body of its prey, a chimera rendered as owl-like with human facial characteristics. The prey unsuccessfully struggles to flee from its captor. The lower figure's human aspect is most notable {{in the details of}} its mouth and genitalia. Both figures are positioned in the centre foreground of the canvas, and are each mutilated and covered in blood, their physical discomfort contrasted against the flat, neutral background typical of Bacon's paintings. The figures exhibit many elements found in his early work, noticeably the expressive broad strokes set against the tightness of the flat, nondescript background. The link with the biblical Crucifixion is made through the raised arms of the lower creature, and the T-shaped cross.|$|E

It is a long low building with an ornate wooden ceiling, a matching floor and crowded with corrals finished by his successors to Michelangelo’s design. But it is a light room, the natural lighting streaming through a long row of windows that appear positively crammed between the order of pilasters that march along the wall. The vestibule, on the other hand, is tall, taller than it is wide and is crowded by a large staircase that <b>pours</b> <b>out</b> of the library in what Pevsner refers to as a “flow of lava”, and bursts in three directions when it meets the balustrade of the landing. It is an intimidating staircase, {{made all the more}} so because the rise of the stairs at the center is steeper than at the two sides, fitting only eight steps into the space of nine.|$|E

Mangrove trees begin to grow in fresh water ecosystems when the salt water goes far enough inland.|$|E

"Being judged {{before you}} today stands {{a nation that}} has been {{deprived}} of everything that is dear and sacred to it from its emergence in its own land – the graves of its patriarchs, the graves of its great kings, the graves of its holy prophets and, above all, the site of its glorious Temple. Everything has been taken from it and of all the witnesses to its sanctity, only one vestige remains – one side of a tiny portion of a wall, which, on one side, borders the place of its former Temple.

Susanna tries to find love, but six of her seven husbands have a flaw which proves fatal. The killings (and her yearning for love) are {{explained}} by the loss of her mother at a young age. The story is told by a young forensic pathologist, Arun (Vivaan Shah), to his wife, Nandini (Konkona Sen Sharma). Arun has watched Susanna since their childhood, and has a secret crush on her. He owes his life to her; she funded his education, making him what he is today. Arun tells his wife that Susanna has committed suicide, leaving him a note congratulating him on his marriage. The doctor must now confirm that the body found is Susanna's. Arun is unable to overcome his grief over her death and <b>pours</b> <b>out</b> his heart to his wife, who listens patiently.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Weeping Angels are not statue props {{but young}} women wearing masks, costumes, and paint that took {{two to three}} hours to apply. Adam Smith called them [...] "an {{absolute}} nightmare to film with" [...] because {{it took a long time}} for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. Smith wished River Song's entrance to be a shocking surprise to the audience. A stunt double was used for some shots of the scene where River flies out of the Byzantium airlock, but Kingston wished to do some of it herself. The scene was filmed on a greenscreen with Kingston hooked up on wires that pulled her up and backwards as a wind machine was blown to create the effect of the airlock.

Her dancers conglomerate around her near the end and Gaga reveals herself to be covered with blood.

Gaga and her friends then find the Eternal Fountain, which <b>pours</b> <b>out</b> red colored liquid and Gaga explains that it bleeds for anyone. She starts singing [...] "Alejandro" [...] while jumping into the fountain and singing, as blood pours over her. Gaga then returns and sings [...] "Poker Face" [...] on the cat-walk. After the performance, she and her friends find themselves in a dark place, and after some dialogue, Gaga's friends run off, leaving her alone to deal with the Fame Monster, a giant angler fish. Gaga starts singing [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and eventually kills the Fame Monster by shooting sparks from her pyrotechnic bra and underwear. She then leaves for the Monster Ball and after appearing there, meanwhile fans assume the show is over, suddenly Gaga appears on stage and [...] performs the final song, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] while standing inside a giant gyroscope.|$|E

[...] The Supreme was personally involved in the affairs of the state to such extent, that it was reported by contemporary press that [...] " [...] personally trained his cavalry {{in the use of the}} saber, ascertained the exact number of nails in Fort Orange, awarded 102 pesos to a Frenchman whose anchor had been melted down by the state... lowered the price of salt in the capital, donated state yerba to the people of Saladillo, and denied permission for [...] to marry in Villa Rica."

2500|$|Rebbe Nachman also placed great {{emphasis}} on Jewish prayer.

Rebbe Nachman claimed that every true tzaddik attained his lofty spiritual level almost uniquely because of hitbodedut. The Rebbe explained that hitbodedut is the loftiest form of Divine service, {{and that it is}} virtually impossible to be a good Jew without this practice. During hitbodedut, the individual <b>pours</b> <b>out</b> his thoughts and concerns to God in his mother tongue, as if talking to a close personal friend.

Jourgensen and Barker, along with Max Brody who had joined as a saxophone player for the 1999 tour, focused on developing songs for a new record during 2001 and 2002, with the band issuing Animositisomina on Sanctuary Records in 2003. The sound was strongly heavy metal laden with voice effects, and matched the ferocity of Psalm 69 (though it featured an almost-pop cover of Magazine's [...] "The Light <b>Pours</b> <b>Out</b> Of Me"). Animositisomina, compared to previous releases, sold poorly and singles for [...] "Animosity" [...] and [...] "Piss" [...] were canceled before they could be released.|$|E

2500|$|Berry's love of North Staffordshire {{was deep}} and permanent; he indulged an incurable {{addiction}} to the place. He [...] "had an inexplicable attraction to the place and...was attached to the area by [...] "an invisible umbilical cord", which could never be cut." [...] He said of his childhood [...] "every house seemed to have an old woman, a drunken man, a gang of kids and a snarling dog." [...] Certainly then he was, [...] "a thinker {{of the working class}} who developed a love of middle class pursuits." [...] He said he had [...] "always worked out of one world, the working class world of which I am part", while declaring, [...] "I am a man of habit and pattern." [...] He [...] "became a cult figure following many television appearances in the Midlands." [...] His attachment to the place was a legend. For example, [...] "when he obtained work as a teacher in Chelsea College of Art he commuted every day and night from Biddulph Moor." [...] And indeed [...] "propping up the bar at his local public house...is where he felt most comfortable." [...] Yet it was during the 1950s that the, [...] "crushing black agoraphobia descended on him, virtually imprisoning him in North Staffordshire {{for the rest of his}} life." [...] But as a man, poet, playwright and artist he came into his own. Peter Cheeseman (Director, for thirty five years, of the Victoria Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent and, latterly, the New Victoria Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme), recalls the many animated conversations they had enjoyed, and [...] "the swift gestures of his good left arm, banging at the elbow of his useless right...and the rich talk that <b>pours</b> <b>out</b> of him." [...] He was [...] "eloquent in every way...a vigorous and expressive poet...a writer of stories, a dramatist...grotesquely hilarious... an inspiring teacher of art, loved and admired by his students." [...] He was [...] "a large, ungainly and glum man, tall and remote, cloth cap sitting permanently over his expressionless face." [...] He seemed to have something of a love-hate relationship with his art, for [...] "he once sent a groaning van-load off to Stoke tip: a great weight lifted off me." [...] He was really [...] "a painter and poet of the cluttered and dying landscape of pits and ironworks...he writes of that world with unexpected imagery and a great roaring sense of humour, sometimes wry, often grotesque." [...] As a painter, he strained [...] "to paint a world he loved passionately for its vigour and its energy and its richness before the bulldozer scraped it away." [...] He felt his paintings to be [...] "the most eloquent utterances, portraits of a world seen from the bottom of my rut." [...] This was indeed [...] "a world filled with images of people and landscape that have been twisted and worn into strange shapes by hard work and poverty. My Parthenon is an allotment hut knocked together out of bits of rubbish. It is the richness of poor things that I am drawn to." [...] As he told Peter Cheeseman, [...] "everything I have ever drawn, every house, every man, every face has its roots in those few streets [...] All the things I have written, or hope to write, I am sure will have the same roots." ...|$|E
