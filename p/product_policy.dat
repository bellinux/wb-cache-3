The small tan pellets in the arcade original were changed to rectangular [...] "wafers" [...] that shared the wall color on the 2600, a change necessitated because both the pellets and walls were drawn with the 2600's Playfield graphics, which have a fixed width. To achieve the visual effect of wafers disappearing as Pac-Man eats them, the actual map of the maze was updated as the data was written into the Playfield registers, excluding those pellets that had been eaten. The 2600's Player-Missile graphics system (sprites) {{were used for the}} remaining objects, the one pixel-wide Missiles were used to render the flashing power pills and the center of the vitamin. [...] Pac-Man and ghost characters were implemented using the 2600's two Player objects, with one being used for Pac-Man and the other being used in for all four ghosts, with the result that each ghost only appears once out of every four frames, which creates a flickering effect. This effect takes advantage of the slow phosphorescent fade of CRT monitors and the concept of persistence of vision, resulting in the image appearing to linger on screen longer, but the flickering remains noticeable, and makes each individual ghost's color nearly impossible to discern. Frye chose to abandon plans for a flicker-management system to minimize the flashing in part because Atari didn't seem to care about that issue in its zeal to have the game released. His game also did not conform to the arcade game's color scheme in order to comply with Atari's official home <b>product</b> <b>policy</b> that only space type games should feature black backgrounds. [...] Another quality-impact was his decision that two-player gameplay was important, which meant that the 23 bytes required to store the current difficulty, state of the dots on the current maze, remaining lives, and score had to be doubled for a second player, consuming 46 of the 2600's meager 128 byte memory, which precluded its use for additional game data and features.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} aspects of life cycle {{thinking}} incorporated into European policy. The Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan {{is a piece of}} legislation that aims to reduce environmental impact and consumption of resources associated with the complete life cycles of goods and services. On July 16, 2008 the European Commission presented this legislation. This proposal suggests plans on how to not only reduce the environmental impacts of goods and services, but also encourages the use of more sustainable goods and production technologies. This action plan also encourages the European Union to seek out every opportunity to innovate in industry. The Integrated <b>Product</b> <b>Policy</b> is another legislative action that Europe has taken in order to facilitate life cycle thinking.

With this purpose, several policies product-related coexist under the scope of different EU regulations, for example: Ecodesign Directive (2009 / 125 /EC), Labelling Directive (2010 / 30 /EU), Green Public Procurement (GPP COM (2008) 400), EU Ecolabel (Regulation EC No 1980 / 2000), Building the Single Market for Green Products (COM (2013) 196 and related Recommendation (2013 / 179 /EU)). While Ecodesign and Labelling Directives are compulsory for certain energy-related and energy-using products, GPP, EU Ecolabel and the Single Market for Green Products establish voluntary measures for some product categories. The Ecodesign Directive defines minimum requirements for products to access the single market considering their life cycle. The Labelling Directive is focused in the energy consumption during the use phase providing purchase relevant information to the consumer.

40|$|The {{design of}} heating, {{ventilation}} {{and air conditioning}} systems is still a challenging engineering task which requires experienced and informed decision-making. These systems have a great energy-saving potential at the system level {{rather than at the}} level of the individual products of which they are composed. European environmental <b>product</b> <b>policies</b> have been very useful in facilitating a homogeneous rating scheme which can be used to compare the energy performance of different products that provide the same service. This paper proposes a simplified design method  which uses the performance of components that are regulated by European <b>product</b> <b>policies</b> to obtain the overall performance of heating systems in residential buildings. It is a flexible method and allows different product configurations to be assessed so as to optimise the system performance during the design phase. The method is tested on a real case study with domestic hot water and space heating systems. The case study shows the potential for improving the heating systems according to the performance levels of its products currently available in the market. Results of the domestic hot water system show that upgrading its storage tank to the maximum energy class (A+) could bring the highest energy savings (4162  kWh/y) ...|$|R

40|$|Different {{policies}} {{with the goal}} of reducing energy consumption and other environmental impacts in the building sector coexist in Europe. Sustainable product polices, such as the Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Directives, have recently broadened the scope of their target product groups from a strict product approach to extended product and system approaches. Indeed, there is a potential for greater savings when the focus is at a system level rather than on regulating individual <b>products.</b> <b>Product</b> <b>policies</b> for space and water heating systems have recently introduced and implemented the package label, which is a modular approach, standing between the extended product and the system approaches. This paper presents a systematic analysis of the different system approaches of various policies from an engineering perspective. It analyses in detail the package concept and its features through a practical application using a real case study. It focuses on how the package concept can support decisions made in the building design phase and, in particular, how can support the choice of appropriate components based on estimating system performances. This brings building engineers and regulators closer regarding the use of more consistent data on energy performance.
