The Royal Navy developed the bomb even though the Fleet Air Arm operated no aircraft capable of carrying it. The navy was interested in a concrete-penetrating weapon due to the German navy's extensive use of fortified submarine pens to protect their U-boats and E-boats from air attack while docked.|$|E
5|$|After the Met and the District had {{withdrawn}} from the ELR in 1906, services were provided by the South Eastern Railway, the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway (LB) and the Great Eastern Railway.

Discussions continued, and in 1911 it was agreed that the ELR would be electrified with the UERL providing <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Met the train service. Parliamentary powers were obtained in 1912 and through services restarted on 31 March 1913, the Met running two trains an hour from both the SER's and the LB's New Cross stations to South Kensington and eight shuttles an hour alternately from the New Cross stations to Shoreditch.|$|E
