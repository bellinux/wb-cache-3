Governing equations are derived for axisymmetric deformations considering material orthotropy and temperature-dependent mechanical and thermal properties. Numeracal calculations are carried out by virtue of Runge-Kutta integration scheme for the two-point boundary value ploblem together with multi-dimensional Newton-Raphson iteration procedure. It is pointed out by numerical solutions that the temperature-dependent effects on finite deflections differ greatly for distinct boundary conditions.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{for studying the}} influence of a temperature gradient on the crystallization of quiescent polymer melts. The apparatus used consists of two brass plates with embedded electrical resistance heaters and cooling coils. The crystallizations experiments were conducted by placing polymer specimens between the <b>paltes,</b> and manually adjusting heaters and cooling fluids for temperature control. Linear polyethylene, isotactic polyprophylene, and a high density polyethylene were used. It is concluded that the role of a temperature gradient in producing oriented crystallization is in producing conditions which lead the spherulitic growth pattern to proceed primarily in one direction. Steep gradients diminish the penetration of supercooling and favors oriented growth...|$|R

One of the great challenges in the field of nanotechnology is preparation of nanoparticles and nanostructures where new, not ordinary materials are used. In the present study, we observed self organizing structures prepared by the gas deposition method in N 2 atmosphere. Glass <b>palte</b> served as a substrate. Typically, the structures have shape of hexagonal pyramid with base diagonal length higher then 2 µm. Characterization of the structures was performed utilizing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and several X-ray techniques. The crystallographic structure determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) corresponds to FCC ytterbium however signals corresponding to hexagonal ytterbium and YbN can be also observed. XRD pattern shows significantly more intense (111) diffraction peak which {{can be explained by the}} presence of hexagonal structures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Drought {{monitoring}} is {{a fundamental}} ingredient of drought risk management. It is normally performed using various drought indices that are effectively continuous functions of rainfall and other hydrometeorological variables. In many instances drought indices used for monitoring purposes. However, these indices are calculated at sites and it is required to estimate the spatial distribution of drought in the forms of maps. Geostatistical methods allow the interpolation of spatially referenced data. They allow the prediction of values for arbitrary points {{in the area of}} interest. In this research, several geostatistical methods including Ordinary Kriging,Inverse Distance Weighted and Thin <b>Palte</b> Smoothing Splinewere assessed for the derivation of maps of drought indices at 27 climatic stations in the Boushehr province of Iran. The results indicated that IDW method with the power of two is more appropriate for spatial analysis of SPI index and Ordinary Kriging method is more appropriate for spatial analysis of EDI index...|$|E

40|$|Microscopic, histochemical and ultrastructural {{techniques}} {{were used to}} define characteristics of high endothelial venules (HEV) in rat lymphatic tissues. This endothelium contained acetyl esterase and acid hydrolase activities which were not altered by lymphocyte depletion. No immunoglobulins were detected on luminal surfaces of HEV by fluorescent antibody staining. Only minor structural differences were seen between HEV within lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. At both sites, high endothelial cells were linked together by macular junctional complexes and interlocking basal foot processes. Endothelial cell cytoplasm moulded about surfaces of lymphocytes migrating through the venular wall, and flocculant deposits of basement membrane formed over lymphocytes penetrating the basal lamina. The endothelium was ensheathed by three to five layers of overlapping reticular cell plates and connective tissue. Each plate {{was linked to the}} reticular meshwork of the node by collagen bundles and anchoring filaments which inserted into the plate's external limiting membrane. This permitted individual <b>paltes</b> to separate or approximate each other as tissue and intravascular pressure varied, and lymphocytes moved across the sheath by insinuating themselves into gaps between overlapping plates.

Features of interaction between the Antarctic Plate and other plates are shown with our gravimetric tomography data over more than 40, 000 km along the <b>palte</b> boundary. Two bodies (plumes) dominate in the mantle. Less dense masses ascend from depth of 2800 km and then split up at the depth of 200 km as three branches to the Australian-Antarctic Discordance (AAD), the Ross Sea and the Nazca plate. Dense masses descend from a surface as subducted slabs and collect at depths of 60 km and 280 km. It was discovered in the AAD area and the Nazca Ridge that thinning hot masses penetrate into the colder crust and lithosphere. Citation: Greku and T. R.

40|$|Abstract. In the Southern Ocean, {{mixing and}} {{upwelling}} {{in the presence}} of heat and freshwater surface fluxes trans-form subpycnocline water to lighter densities as part of the upward branch of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). One hypothesized impact of this transformation is the restoration of nutrients to the global pycnocline, with-out which biological productivity at low latitudes would be significantly reduced. Here we use a novel set of modeling experiments to explore the causes and consequences of the Southern Ocean nutrient return pathway. Specifically, we quantify the contribution to global productivity of nutrients that rise from the ocean interior in the Southern Ocean, the northern high latitudes, and by mixing across the low lati-tude pycnocline. In addition, we evaluate how the strength of the Southern Ocean winds and the parameterizations of subgridscale processes change the dominant nutrient return pathways in the ocean. Our results suggest that nutrients upwelled from the deep ocean in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and subducted in Subantartic Mode Water support between 33 and 75 % of global export production between 30 ◦ S and 30 ◦ N. The high end of this range results from an ocean model in which the MOC is driven primarily by wind-induced Southern Ocean upwelling, a configuration favored due to its fidelity to tracer data, while the low end results from an MOC driven by high diapycnal diffusivity in the py-cnocline. In all models, nutrients exported in the SAMW layer are utilized and converted rapidly (in less than 40 years) Correspondence to: J. B. <b>Palte...</b>|$|E
40|$|Howard D <b>Palte</b> Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Medicine and Pain Management, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA Abstract: In {{the past}} decade {{ophthalmic}} anesthesia has witnessed a major transformation. The sun has set on the landscape of ophthalmic procedures performed under general anesthesia at in-hospital settings. In its place a new dawn has ushered in the panorama of eye surgeries conducted under regional and topical anesthesia at specialty eye care centers. The impact of the burgeoning geriatric population is that {{an increasing number of}} elderly patients will present for eye surgery. In order to accommodate increased patient volumes and simultaneously satisfy administrative initiatives directed at economic frugality, administrators will seek assistance from anesthesia providers in adopting measures that enhance operating room efficiency. The performance of eye blocks in a holding suite meets many of these objectives. Unfortunately, most practicing anesthesiologists resist performing ophthalmic regional blocks because they lack formal training. In future, anesthesiologists will need to block eyes and manage common medical conditions because economic pressures will eliminate routine preoperative testing. This review addresses a variety of topical issues in ophthalmic anesthesia with special emphasis on cannula and needle-based blocks and the new-generation antithrombotic agents. In a constantly evolving arena, the sub-Tenon’s block has gained popularity while the deep angulated intraconal (retrobulbar) block has been largely superseded by the shallower extraconal (peribulbar) approach. Improvements in surgical technique have also impacted anesthetic practice. For example, phacoemulsification techniques facilitate the conduct of cataract surgery under topical anesthesia, and suture-free vitrectomy ports may cause venous air embolism during air/fluid exchange. Hyaluronidase is a useful adjuvant because it promotes local anesthetic diffusion and hastens block onset time but it is allergenic. Ultrasound-guided eye blocks afford real-time visualization of needle position and local anesthetic spread. An advantage of sonic guidance is that it may eliminate the hazard of globe perforation by identifying abnormal anatomy, such as staphyloma.

Methods: Prospective, double-blind study of 30 adult patients aged 21 – 84 years scheduled for elective strabismus surgery with adjustable sutures. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups of 15 patients each based on the local anesthetic. Group A received 2 % lidocaine and Group B received 2 % lidocaine/ 0. 4 % ropivacaine. Pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) preoperatively and at 2, 4, and 6 hours postoperatively. The Lancaster red-green test was used to measure ocular motility at the same time points. Results: The pain scores in the two groups were low and similar at all measurement intervals. The VAS for Group A versus Group B at 2 hours (1. 7 versus 2. 4, P= 0. 5) and 4 hours (3. 5 versus 3. 7, P= 0. 8) showed no benefit from the addition of ropivacaine. At 6 hours, the VAS (3. 7 versus 2. 7) was not statistically significant, but the 95 % confidence interval indicated that ropivacaine may provide some benefit. A repeated measures ANOVA did not find a statistically significant difference in VAS scores over time (P= 0. 9). In addition, the duration of akinesia was comparable in both groups (P= 0. 7). Conclusion: We conclude that the 50 : 50 mixture of 2 % lidocaine with 0. 4 % ropivacaine as compared to 2 % lidocaine in peribulbar anesthetic blocks in adjustable-suture strabismus surgery does not produce significant improvements in pain control during the postoperative and adjustment phases. In addition, ropivacaine did not impair return of full ocular motility at 6 hours, which is advantageous in adjustable-suture strabismus surgery.

40|$|The {{aggregation}} method utilizes outbred blastocysts {{which are}} easier to obtain in numbers. The ES cells are intorduced into the developing embryo by the adherance of the cells to a dezonulated 8 cell stage embryo. The embryos are cultured to blastocysts and then transfered into a pseudopregnant hybrid (C 57 X CBA) F 1 recipient. ### Method: **Preparation of the aggregation plate. ** Aggregation {{and culture of the}} embryos with the ES cells is performed in microwells prepared in a plastic tissue culture plate using a darning needle. 1. In a 6 cm petri dish add up to 10 drops of M 16 media (ca. 3 - 4 mm, larger allows too muh turbulence when the <b>palte</b> is moved). - Cover the entire plate with parafin or Dow Corning Fluid 200 (viscosity 50 cs). - Sterilize a darning needle by dipping in ethanol and ignite. Note be very careful not to burn the plastic layer off (ie. don't place in a bunsen burner). Just sterilizing in ethanol is probably sufficient and more"needle friendly". - Press the darning needle through the oil and media into the palstic and make a circular movement with the free end of the needle but DO NOT twist the needle (it scores the sides). The well should be ca. 300 um dia with a smooth wall. *NOTE. In our experience it is critical to make the wells through the oil and media rather than on a dry plate, presumably to make smooth (lubricated) wells. When we made wells on dry plates the embryos always died*. - Make 5 - 6 wells in each drop and then return the plate to the incubator. **Removal of the Zona pellucida from the embryo. ** After recovering 2. 5 day mouse embryos (see Flushing Morula protocol) the zona is removed in acid Tyrode's solution. Acid Tyrode's: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") - Make to 90 ml with Travenol water and dissolve components. Adjust pH to 2. 5 with 5 M HCl and make to 100 ml with Travenol water. Filter sterilize and make aliquots of 1 ml. Store at - 20 °C. - Warm to room temperature before use. - After removing the zona the embryos become extremely sticky and therefore siliconized pipettes are required for handling them. **Siliconizing Capillary Glass** Embryos that have had the zona pellucida (jelly-like outer coating) removed are "sticky" to handle, often getting stuck inside the transfer pipette during handling. This problem is overcome by siliconizing the capillary glass (inside only) before it is used to fashion transfer pipettes. NOTE: This procedure must be carried out wearing gloves in a fume hood! Use a 27 gauge needle and 3 cc syringe (filled) to run a small amount of silicone (Sigmacote) through the inside of a piece of capillary glass, allowing excess Sigmacote to drip into a 10 ml tube. This is repeated with each piece of glass and the glass placed in a measuring cylinder. The excess Sigmacote in the 10 ml tube may be used to refill the syringe when empty. Once 50 - 80 pieces have been siliconized the glass is rinsed no less than eight times with Milli-Q water, shaking the water out of the glass by hand after each rinse. The glass is then rinsed six times with "Travenol" water. The cylinder is then sealed with Parafilm which is punctured several times with a needle to allow evaporation with minimal dust collection. The cylinder is placed in a hot air oven to speed evaporation. Once completely dry, the glass is ready to use. Sigmacote is made by Sigma Chemicals. The catalogue number for Sigmacote is SL- 2 **Dezonulating** 1. Put several drops of M 16 and also acid Tyrodes into a small petri dish (do not mix). - Transfer all of the embryos to one of the drops of M 16. We use Random bred Swiss embryos. - Collect up to 50 embryos (less if unable to handle that no. quickly) with as little media as possible and transfer to a drop of acid Tyrodes, then transfer immediately to a fresh drop of acid Tyrodes. - Agitate the embryos while watching them under the scope. - Transfer the embryos to a drop of M 16 as soon as the zona dissolves. This should take around 90 seconds. - Rinse in a second drop of M 16 immediately and then transfer to the aggregation plate, placing one embryo in each well. Return plate to the incubator. - We include a control of 6 - 8 unmanipulated embryos during the culture period. **Preparation of ES cells for aggregation** We use small clumps of ES cells rather than single ES cells as these are much easier to place in the wells. The cells are harvested essentially as described in "Passaging and Spliting ES cells" except {{that at the end of}} the tyripsinization step they are GENTLY pipetted up and down 6 - 8 times rather than the vigourous motion usually used to create a single cell suspension. This yields clumps of cells of 4 - 12. 1. Aspirate media from the plate, wash with 5 ml PBS and with 5 ml PBS/EGTA. Aspirate and place plate on 37 °C warming tray. - After 2 - 5 min. remove the flask and checl under the dissecting scope. Individual cells should be apparent in the collonies. - Add 1 ml trypsin/EDTA and rock flask back and forward for ca. 1 min. until the cells lift off the plate. Gently pipette the cells up and down with a 1 ml pipette 6 times and then add 1 ml of ES cell media. Wash gently up and down several times. - Add cells to 2 ml of ES cell media to dilute to an appropriate concentration. **Aggregation** 1. Using a pasteur pipette, place a drop of suspended ES cell clumps in a small petri dish. - Under the dissecting scope and using a very narrow siliconized transfer pipette, select clumps of 5 - 10 cells. Transfer one clump to each well and watch to be sure that it comes to rest adjacent to the embryo. Very carefully return the plate to the incubator once all the embryos and wells are filled. - Our embryos take 24 hours to develop to expanded blastocysts at which point they are transfered into psuedopregnant (C 57 X CBA) F 1 mice using a siliconized, flame polished pipette. **Removal of Expanded Blastocysts from Aggregation Wells** Before attempting to remove expanded blastocysts, make sure that the pipette is wide enough. To remove blasts from wells, fill a transfer pipette with M 16 up to the end of the narrow pulled section then position the end over each well and blow the embryos out. Arrange them in groups of 12 for easy collection during transfer...|$|E
