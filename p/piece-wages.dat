All labor produces something, {{but it does not}} necessarily help to create profit for one reason or another. What interests a businessman in a financial sense, is the cost of labor which directly creates the product or service that generates profit, versus the cost of labor that is effectively only a necessary overhead expense for his own business. The general aim is, to maximize productive labor in this sense, and minimize unproductive costs. That is the efficiency principle that guides the development of the division of labor organizationally. Ideally speaking, everything the employee does would directly contribute to profit for the enterprise (but in reality it usually doesn't). If employers paid piece wages then, in theory, they would incur costs, [...] "only if" [...] their employees created new value for them. Marx believed that piece wages – whether paid on an individual or team basis – were, in the long term, the most favorable form of remuneration for capitalist labor-exploitation, although he recognized that often workers earning <b>piece-wages</b> could initially earn more than workers on time-wages.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{distinct}} forms of wages {{that is used}} in the production of capital: Time-wages and <b>Piece-wages.</b> These forms facilitate the illusion of the actual value of labor-power and the increase of productivity from the worker employed.|$|E
5000|$|Logic {{would lead}} a laborer {{to believe that}} {{straining}} one's labor power [...] "as intensely as possible" [...] works in one's own interests because the more efficiently they produce the more they will be paid. Therefore, the workday will lengthen {{to the extent that}} worker's allow and necessitate. However, prolongation in the workday requires the price of labor to fall. Marx elucidates that, [...] "the piece-wage therefore has a tendency, while raising the wages of individuals above the average, to lower this average itself," [...] and [...] "it is apparent that the piece-wage is the form of wage most appropriate to the capitalist mode of production." [...] Marx gives examples of the weaving industry {{around the time of the}} Anti-Jacobin War where [...] "piece-wages had fallen so low that in spite of the very great lengthening of the working day, the daily wage was then lower than it had been before." [...] So in this example we are able to see how <b>piece-wages</b> do nothing but decrease the value of labor and better disguise the true way the workers are exploited.|$|E
50|$|Marx {{explains}} the exploitative {{nature of the}} <b>piece-wage</b> system. Under this system workers are paid a pre-determined amount for each piece they produce, creating a modified form of the time-wage system. A key difference is {{in the fact that}} the <b>piece-wage</b> system provides an exact measure of the intensity of labor. Meaning that the capitalists' know about how long it takes to produce one piece of finished product. Those who cannot meet these standards of production will not be allowed to keep their jobs. This system also allows for middlemen (wholesaler or reseller) to usurp positions between the capitalists and laborers. These middlemen make their money solely from paying labor less than capitalists are actually allotting, thus, bringing about worker on worker exploitation.|$|R

Agrarian-influenced cooperatives used two metaphors, “serfdom” and “cooperatives are like a family” to manage uncertainty and influence producer expectations by predicting industrialization's eventual outcome and cooperatives’ producer driven compensation. The serfdom metaphor alluded to industrialization's potential to either bypass family farmers, {{the cornerstone of the}} economy according to agrarian ideology, or to transform them into the equivalent of <b>piece-wage</b> labor as contract growers. The “family” metaphor reflects how cooperatives personalized the connection between cooperative and farmer-member to position themselves as the exact opposite of serfdom. Hypotheses advanced by Roessl (2005) and Goel (2013) suggest that intrinsic characteristics of family businesses such as a resistance to change and operating according to a myth of unlimited choice and independence reinforced the risk of institutional lock-in posed by agrarian ideology. To determine whether lock-in occurred, Woerdman's (2004) neo-institutional model of lock-in was examined in the context of late 20 th century cooperative grain and livestock marketing. Increasingly ineffective open markets prompted three regional cooperatives to develop their own models of industrialized pork production. Direct experience with producer contracting allowed cooperatives to evade institutional and ideological lock-in...|$|R

40|$|Analyzing two {{research}} projects on the industrial home-based work (HBW) in 2003 and 2006 in Istanbul, Turkey, this paper argues that {{two forms of}} rigidities shape the organizational characteristics of the HBW: limited physical mobility of the homeworkers and the in-built pressures within the labor process of the factory system. On one hand, the rigidities regarding the mobility of homeworkers determine {{the conditions of the}} labor process of the HBW. Among some dimensions of the labor process of HBW, mechanisms for the distribution of piecework, the training of homeworkers, or storage of the piecework are directly related with the physical mobility of homeworkers. On the other hand, the co-existence of labor- and capital-intensive processes in the factory system unavoidably creates management bottlenecks, which account for another form of rigidity. HBW appears as the solution for such management problems. These corresponding rigidities characterize the organizational variety of the HBW. Negative work conditions of the homeworkers such as low <b>piece-wages</b> and precariousness in the employment practices are accounted for by these rigidities. As much as the low <b>piece-wages</b> generally associated with the HBW in the literature. Thus, investigation of the HBW should go beyond the argument about the low <b>piece-wages</b> and start to analyze the actual conditions of organization resulting in the deteriorating conditions of work for homeworkers. The literature emphasizes the centrality of the low <b>piece-wages</b> turning this form of labor into an alternative for the factory system. Although the {{research projects}} analyzed in this paper verify this consensus, two forms of rigidities motivate both workers and employers to 'get into the HBW-nexus': Homeworkers shape the organizational arrangements significantly, given that HBW does not pertain to a formal form of employment. Thus, their conditions of physical mobility account for a key element in the organization of HBW. Since the state of mobility by homeworkers is rather one of rigidity than an advantage, their regarding condition should be the focus to understand the mindsets of the homeworkers. mobility of homeworkers, labor market rigidity...|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies of}} {{handicraft}} industries in India attempt to fuse aesthetic and economic perspectives. The present study explores how {{the knowledge and}} skills of female embroiderers in the chikan industry of Lucknow illuminate relations of production between merchants and embroiderers, and among embroiderers themselves. ^ Informal organisation, <b>piece-wages</b> and cheap products have characterised the chikan industry for a century. All stages of production are presently affected by the overwhelming emphasis on a cheap form called bakhya. Embroiderers are almost all Muslim women from town and country, linked to merchants through male and female sub-contractors. With occupational opportunities and organisational capacities constrained by purdah, embroiderers are in fierce competition for meagre and unreliable <b>piece-wages.</b> ^ Highly-skilled embroiderers find limited outlets for their creativity in government award schemes and in commissioned work for private patrons. Most make their living sub-contracting simpler work to other women. Agent roles have often been passed in the family from previous generations of embroidering men. ^ Government organisations give some work directly to rural workers at the bottom of agent pyramids. In circumventing agents, the government frustrates the same women they reward in other setting with awards and incentives for their fine work. Increasingly, the highly skilled have less control over the terms by which fine chikan is defined. Any fine chikan they do make is subsidised by agent-activities in the commercial sector. ^ One must recognise the ways in which skilled embroiderers exploit other workers, as well as show the ways in which embroiderers, as women, share some of the conditions of their oppression. Caught up in the volatile fashion market inside India, the future of chikan and of embroiderers is uncertain. Future research needs to be conducted into the wider relationships of embroiderers, and of the productive lives of other specialists implicated in chikan, in order to form a more comprehensive portrait of working class culture surrounding this unique commodity. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports the}} author's {{experience}} {{of working in}} telesales. Through a call center, the case study company sells home improvements. The article describes the everyday organizational life of the telesales unit. Using this autoethnographic experience, the article analyses the organization of work-time in call centers. In particular, the article probes how commission constitutes a form of piece-wage. This piece-wage assists the manipulation of working hours. It does so by masking their extension. To understand this, the article appliesthe conceptual tools of Marx’sCapital. Marx directs attention to how capitalists organise time {{in the pursuit of}} surplus-value. The autoethnographic account explores the application of this to call-center work. Flexible working arrangements and zero-hour contracts extend work-time. A pay framework based around commission and performance-linked <b>piece-wages</b> conceals this. In the case study, there is an absence of technology as productivity-raising measure or means of control. This challenges existing Foucauldian approaches to call-center work. It suggests that traditional forms of capitalist domination-the contract, the wage, time organization- are highly relevant to the call center context...|$|E
40|$|An ongoing {{discussion}} in the Netherlands between employers and the Labour Inspectorate about the interpretation of legal rules of employing youth in agricultural work situations is addressed. A working group, consisting of representatives of agricultural employers, employees, government, Labour Inspectorate, advisory boards and knowledge workers, has analysed two inspection reports (2003, 2004), interviewed 13 inspectors, and consulted 35 employers of 5 different agricultural branches in 4 workshops to know their (possible) conflicts and solutions. Analysis of the inspection reports showed that a relatively large amount of violations dealt {{with a lack of}} the obligatory risk and safety evaluation of the farm, or work-rest registration, or violated the time aspects of labour for younger people. The working group did not address these items and insisted these rules to be obeyed. The evaluation concentrated on the age group 13 to 15 years, and the items mechanized environment, physical load, re-entry after application of herbicides of fungicides, and mental well-being were addressed. Mechanized environment: the present rules exclude youth of 13 - 15 years old to work in any mechanized environment. Part of the working group suggests the law to be redirected more close to International and European law, and to include safety risk into the rules. Physical load: present rules have limitations for lifting, pushing/pulling and bad working postures, but not for repetitive work. The working group argues the protection level at present not to be too high, and suggests to implement a time limitation for low-level repetitive work for this age group. Furthermore, it is advised to gain knowledge on the time-effects of kneeled work and low-level repetitive movements. Re-entry: the present rules exclude youth of 13 - 15 years to come in contact with crops that are treated with chemicals within a period of 14 days, irrespective of the substance. The working group advises to develop and implement a herbicide-specific approach, in which the risk, speed of degradation and safety factor for youth should be implemented. Also, the knowledge on the eventual specific effects of chemicals on children should be improved. Well-being: the law does not show many rules regarding this aspect. The working group advises a forced working speed to be prevented by technical and organisational measures. <b>Piece-wages</b> were argued to be not advisable, as stated in the present rules...|$|E
