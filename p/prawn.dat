5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by <b>prawn</b> trawlers on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized. Because of its size and strength, it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per person per day, and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by <b>prawn</b> trawlers, this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This species has also been listed under Least Concern in the Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The plain maskray {{generally}} hunts at {{the surface}} of the bottom substrate, rather than digging for prey. Its diet consists predominantly of caridean shrimp and polychaete worms.

Larger rays consume a greater variety of prey and relatively more polychaete worms when compared to smaller rays. This species is parasitized by the tapeworm Acanthobothrium jonesi.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} smoking {{and the presence of}} aromatic herbs on the quality of freshwater <b>prawns</b> muscle (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), through the analysis of sensory characteristics and proximate composition. Fifty-five freshwater thermally stunned <b>prawns,</b> with average weight of 33. 9 ± 13. 49 g, were used. After cephalothoraxes and carapaces removal, the freshwater <b>prawns</b> were washed, weighed, identified, immersed in brine solution (20 %) and then smoked at a temperature of 50 to 90 °C. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments (T 1 = smoked freshwater <b>prawns</b> with herbs; T 2 = smoked freshwater <b>prawns</b> without herbs), with 25 experimental units per treatment.

40|$|The {{effects of}} feeding {{different}} lipids {{on the growth}} and fatty acid composition of juvenile leader <b>prawns.</b> Penaeus monodon, were evaluated using pelleted diets. Seven experimental diets were formulated using 4 % canola oil, 4 % cod liver oil, 4 % lard, 4 % linseed oil, 4 % medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, 4 % soy bean oil and 2 % cod liver oil + 2 % MCT oil. The diets were fed to triplicate groups of ten <b>prawns</b> (1. 49 ± 0. 01 g) for 40 days. Growth rates of <b>prawns</b> were significantly (P < 0. 01) affected by lipid source. Mean growth rates of <b>prawns</b> fed linseed oil, canola oil, soybean oil and MCT/cod liver oil were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than in <b>prawns</b> fed cod liver oil or lard. <b>Prawns</b> fed MCT oil exhibited a significantly (P < 0. 05) lower mean growth rate than <b>prawns</b> fed all other diets. Survival of <b>prawns</b> was between 77 and 100 %. Analysis of fatty acid composition of neutral and polar lipids of whole <b>prawns</b> revealed similar fatty acid profiles to the diets. Partitioning of 20 : 5 n- 3 and 22 : 6 n- 3 to polar lipids and shorter chain fatty acids to neutral lipids was observed in all treatments. <b>Prawns</b> may desaturate 16 : 0, elongation and desaturation products of 18 carbon fatty acids were not noted...|$|R

5|$|Shy and {{difficult}} to approach, the nervous shark is harmless to humans. It is occasionally marketed for food. This species is susceptible to being caught incidentally in coastal gillnets, such as the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) gillnet fishery operating off northern Australia. It may also be caught on line gear and in <b>prawn</b> trawls. The Australian nervous shark population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by fishing activities, and there the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern. No data on the impact of fishing are available elsewhere in its range, and thus the IUCN has listed it overall under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|The main {{conservation}} {{threat to}} the plain maskray is incidental capture by commercial bottom trawl fisheries. In the present day, this is mostly caused by Australia's Northern <b>Prawn</b> Fishery, which operates throughout its range. Although this species is discarded when caught, it is more delicate-bodied than other maskrays and is thus unlikely to survive encounters with trawling gear. Historically, this species {{may also have been}} negatively affected by Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese trawlers that fished intensively off northern Australia from 1959 to 1990. These factors, coupled with the plain maskray's limited distribution and low reproductive rate, have resulted in its being assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray lacks {{economic value}} and is discarded by fisheries. It is often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, {{and due to}} its small size does not benefit from Turtle Exclusion Devices. In particular, this species accounts for approximately 4.5% of the total catch of the Northern <b>Prawn</b> Fishery (NPF) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over half of the rays caught by the NPF, including almost all the males, are fatally crushed within the trawl. Despite this mortality, the NPF is not believed to have negatively affected the local population because its operational area {{does not include the}} waters where this species is most abundant. The peppered maskray is also caught frequently in scallop trawls operated by the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. Elsewhere in its range, fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as fuel prices. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, because it remains common and its range includes several Marine Protected Areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries across {{most of its}} range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat {{and low levels of}} dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that they are much less common now than in the past. They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered. Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in <b>prawn</b> trawls, and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{mangrove}} whipray {{is capable}} of injuring a human with its venomous sting. It is occasionally caught in tangle nets and bottom trawls, {{and to a lesser}} extent on longlines; it is marketed for its meat, skin, and cartilage. Because of its inshore habitat preferences, this naturally uncommon species is highly susceptible to intensive artisanal and commercial fishing occurring across much of its range. In Southeast Asia, immature rays have been particularly affected by local fishing, as well as by habitat degradation from the widespread loss of mangrove forests. Additionally, the numbers of this species in the Arafura Sea have dropped significantly due to an Indonesian gillnet fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), which involves over 600 vessels and has been increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. These factors have led to an inferred decline of the Southeast Asian population by over 50%, leading the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to give it a regional assessment of Endangered. The mangrove whipray is minimally threatened off northern Australia, where it is caught incidentally by the Northern <b>Prawn</b> Fishery (NPF) but only in small numbers following the mandatory adoption of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs). As a result, the IUCN assessment for the Australian population is Least Concern. Globally, the IUCN has listed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the successful use of two tagging systems, both produced by Northwest Marine Technology Inc., on larval and postlarval giant freshwater <b>prawns,</b> Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Visible implant (VI) elastomer tags (a coloured liquid that solidifies under the epidermis) were used on stage XI larval <b>prawns</b> (mean weight 0. 01 g) and postlarval <b>prawns</b> (mean weight 0. 07 g). VI alphanumeric tags (small biocompatible plastic labels also inserted under the epidermis) were tested on postlarval <b>prawns</b> (from a weight of 0. 5 g). Tags were inserted using clove oil as anaesthetic, and survival, mortality and {{growth rates of}} tagged animals were {{compared with those of}} controls that were handled but not anaesthetized or marked. Twenty per cent of the larval <b>prawns</b> (the smallest of the group) died just after tagging, but thereafter the remaining <b>prawns</b> survived well, as did all the tagged postlarval <b>prawns.</b> Visibility of the VI elastomer tags in larval <b>prawns</b> deteriorated with time, though 79 % of marks were still {{visible to the naked eye}} 70 days after tagging. VI elastomer tags in the postlarval group remained clearly visible for up to 100 days. Visibility of the VI alphanumeric tags fell shortly after tagging, but remained adequate thereafter. Moult rates in control and tagged animals were the same in larvae with VI elastomer tags and postlarvae with VI alphanumeric tags, but the moult rate in the postlarval <b>prawns</b> given elastomer tags was slower than in controls. Rates of growth were similar in tagged (elastomer and alphanumeric) and control postlarval <b>prawns,</b> once the size-dependent mortality of tagged larval <b>prawns</b> was taken into account. We conclude that VI elastomer tags could be used to mark small numbers of individual larval and immediately postlarval <b>prawns</b> for periods of several months, and that VI alphanumeric tags could be used to mark an unlimited number of individuals from a size of approximately 0. 5 g...|$|R

5|$|Though {{not highly}} {{dangerous}} to humans, the pink whipray's venomous sting {{makes it difficult}} to handle when it is thrashing in a fishing net. Usually, it must be thrown overboard before the rest of the catch can be sorted. Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia, and probably elsewhere in its range, this species is a regular incidental catch of coastal fisheries using tangle nets, bottom trawls, gillnets, seine nets, {{and to a lesser extent}} longlines. When retained, the meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized. Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated, and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate. The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. Off northern Australia, the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the Northern <b>Prawn</b> Fishery (NPF), but bycatch levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) became compulsory in 2000.|$|E
