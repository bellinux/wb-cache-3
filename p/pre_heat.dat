50|$|The {{catalyst}} {{requires that}} the fuel/air mixture is stoichiometric. This means that the mixture is neither rich or lean, it is exactly 14,7 kg air to 1 kg gasoline (Lambda=1). That is why the system is equipped with an oxygen sensor in the forward part of the exhaust system. The sensor is connected to pin 23 in the ECU and {{is grounded in the}} ECU via pin 47. The exhaust fumes pass the oxygen sensor. The content of oxygen in the exhaust fumes is measured through a chemical reaction, this results in an output voltage. If the engine runs rich (Lambda lower than 1) the output voltage would be more than 0.45 V and if the engine runs lean (Lambda higher than 1) the output voltage would be less than 0.45 V. The output voltage swings about 0.45 V when Lambda passes 1. The ECU continuously corrects the injection duration so that Lambda=1 is always met. To be able to function the oxygen sensor needs to be hot, this requirement is meet by electrically <b>pre</b> <b>heat</b> the sensor. The pre heating element is fed by B+ via fuse 38 and the main relay, the sensor is grounded in the ECU via pin 50. The ECU estimates the temperature on the exhaust gases (EGT) {{on the basis of the}} engine load and the engines RPM. At high EGT the electrical pre heating is disconnected.

40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBC) processed by electron beam {{physical vapor deposition}} (EB-PVD) show complex deformation behavior due to their columnar microstructure and multi-scale porosity. Limited information is available regarding the inelastic deformation behavior. Furthermore, the existing data for the elastic properties of EB-PVD coatings varies in a wide range, depending on the measurement method. In most cases, the fragile EB-PVD coatings are tested on the substrate, onto which they were deposited. Since the ceramic coatings are deposited onto metallic substrates, which have about 1000 °C, compressive residual stresses develop in the coating after cooling down. Since the deformation behavior of EB-PVD coatings is stress dependent, the residual stresses cannot be calculated without knowledge of the stress-strain response, and without knowledge of the residual stress the elastic properties cannot be measured correctly. To overcome this dilemma, tubular free standing EB-PVD coating samples with a thickness of 250 µm have been processed and tested in compression at room temperature. For introducing the mechanical load safely into the gauge length a soft clamping has been developed, and the strain was measured using a contact-free laser extensometer.

The study has covered all the stages involved in heat treatment such as pre-washing, to post washing. The type of heat treatment that has been performed in this facility has mainly been bainitic hardening. In order to compare the results an overviewing study of another bainitic hardening facility on SKF was made.

40|$|Transcription is a {{fundamental}} and tightly regulated process in living cells and a key step in {{the expression of the}} information contained in DNA. A wide variety of experimental assays have been developed that enable genome-wide analysis of the features of transcription and transcription regulation. We present statistical analysis combining both large existing datasets and new experimental assays to explore three aspects of transcription regulation: (i) determinants of transcription factor binding intensity, (ii) characterization of transcription initiation regions at both promoters and enhancers and (iii) unsupervised identification of transcription units. Transcription factor binding intensity is affected by both DNA sequence and local chromatin landscape. We aimed to disentangle these influences by combining PB-seq (a new experimental approach developed by Michael Guertin) with existing modENCODE data in the study of Drosophila Heat Shock Factor (HSF). PB-seq enabled the estimation of the genome-wide binding energy landscape in the absence of chromatin. It further allowed the development of a statistical model to predict the departure of in-vivo binding intensities (from ChIPseq) from the naked chromatin binding intensities (from PB-seq), based on covariates describing the local <b>pre</b> <b>heat</b> shock chromatin environment. We found that DNase I hypersensitivity and tetra-acetylation of H 4 were the most influential covariates. Furthermore DNase I hypersensitivity could also be largely recapitulated from the remaining covariates. Lastly, PB-seq data was applied to develop an unbiased model of HSF binding sequences, which revealed distinct biophysical properties of the HSF/HSE interaction and a previously unrecognized substructure within the HSE. Transcription initiation regions at promoters and enhancers have conventionally been treated separately, although they share many features in mammals. We examined all transcription initiation sites, for both stable and unstable transcripts, using GRO-cap (a new experimental assay developed by Leighton Core). Statistical modeling and analysis of this data, and its contrast with existing ENCODE datasets, reveal a common architecture of initiation at both promoters and enhancers. This common architecture features tightly spaced (110 bp) divergent initiation with similar frequencies of core-promoter sequence elements, highly-positioned flanking nucleosomes, and two modes of TF binding. Transcript elongation stability, a feature determined after transcription initiation, provides a more fundamental distinction between promoters and enhancers than the relative abundance of histone modifications and the presence of TFs or co-activators. These results support a unified model of transcription initiation at both promoters and enhancers. Finally, we turn to the identification of transcription units from nascent RNA assays (GRO-seq and PRO-seq). Although existing annotations focus on stable RNA transcripts (cleavage and poly-Adenylation point), transcription extends beyond the cleavage site. As such, the transcription process can potentially influence surrounding regions. We improve on previous work on the detection of transcription units by obtaining an unsupervised method that does not depend on RNA product annotations.

In an ongoing research, starting more than 10 years ago, the authors developed laboratory test facilities {{for evaluating the}} damage behavior of TBC-systems for gas turbine blades in aeroengines under realistic thermal {{mechanical loading}} conditions [1]. Fatigue tests involving thermal gradients have been conducted and damage behavior in dependence of load pattern and <b>pre</b> <b>heat</b> treatment has been intensively investigated on TBC-systems comprising a partially yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) topcoat and a MCrAlY bond coat both applied by electron physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) onto nickel based super alloys serving as substrate [2]. Numerical analyses by means of FE-calculations did provide hypotheses explaining the observed damage behavior [3], but even though the results are plausible they did depend on reasonable assumptions on materials properties since reliable data on {{the properties of the}} thin coating layers are still lacking, especially for high temperatures. High energy X-ray diffraction can provide the requested information since it is possible to achieve information on the local deformation processes in each layer with high spatial resolution, and short acquisition times allow for in situ investigation of time dependent deformation processes. A new test facility based on concepts after [1] for cyclic thermal loading of tubular specimens and applying a controlled thermal gradient across the coated specimen’s wall has been developed for implementation into an electro-mechanical test machine at the advanced photon source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. A precision positioning rig allows for exact µm-positioning of the entire test machine with respect to the focused X-ray beam, and X-ray diffraction patterns were taken using a 2 D detector, giving accurate 360 ° lattice parameter data [4]. Tests have been performed with varying thermal and mechanical load schemata intending to determine material properties from the respective strain response. The beam energy was 65 keV, and throughout all experiments the beam scanned through the coating layers with a window and step size of 30 µm. Strain data were acquired in plane parallel to the specimen’s length axis and out of plane. Results of the strain data evaluation will be presented and discussed. Exemplary results are: - Elastic properties of the YSZ showed a gradient across the coating thickness reflecting the microstructure gradient of the YSZ resulting from the EB-PVD process. - The YSZ strain was – below the deposition temperature - in plane compressive and out of plane tensile, which is a consequence of (i) the higher thermal expansion coefficient of YSZ with respect to the substrate and (ii) the cylindrical specimen geometry with the YSZ at the outer surface.

40|$|Annual {{operating}} costs for buildings are a substantial cost in a lifetime. It is therefore {{of interest to}} try and reduce these costs. A large fraction of this cost today as the buildings {{become more and more}} energy efficient is the cost of hot tap water. The study in this report looks into the potential for energy savings from grey wastewater. It is here looked at the amount of energy which can be recovered from hot water leaving the building and reused for <b>pre</b> <b>heating</b> of hot tap water and heating of building. The unit which would recover this energy {{is referred to as the}} grey-water heat recovery unit in this report. A residential building with three floors where each floor has one washing machine, one shower and one dishwasher has been as the case building for the report. The total living area of the building is 450 m 2. In the case building used in this report as much as 17. 1 % of the total used energy goes to heating of hot tap water. By installing a heat recovery system which can recover some of the energy stored in the used hot water which leaves the building, this this could be reduced to 10. 9 % of the total used energy according to simulations done in SIMIEN. There are also possibilities of using this energy for heating of the building as well as <b>pre</b> <b>heating</b> of hot tap water. There are a few different solutions for implementing a grey-water heat recovery unit which could give different energy recovery between 2 716 kWh/year to 3 759 kWh/year. The best solution would be to connect the grey-water heat recovery unit to pre-heating of hot tap water, heating of the building as well as installing an accumulation tank to store recovered energy in. The most simple solution which would give the lowest amount of recovered energy would be to just connect the grey-water heat recovery unit to <b>pre</b> <b>heating</b> of hot tap water. In this report two different simulation programs have been used, EnergyPlus and SIMIEN, to find what impact the energy reduction would have on the building and to see if the simulations would correspond to the theoretical estimates done in this report. The theoretical estimates based on equations for heat recovery and measured data for energy use in the case building gave a little bit better results than the simulated results for the same case building. Although there is a difference both gave a positive indication that a heat recovery unit would not only reduce the energy consumption but also reduce the annual operating cost of a building. The investment cost for a heat recovery system could be a bit large for small buildings compared to the annual savings but for larger buildings the investment cost could be substantially higher. Regarding the energy as much as 87. 7 % of the energy stored in the grey-water could be recovered for a system with an accumulation tank and a connection to the buildings heating system. For a system without the accumulation tank and district heating as the energy source it would have a theoretical efficiency of 76. 7 % and a simulated efficiency of 63. 3 % when simulated in EnergyPlus. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study {{experiments}} were carried out in a constant speed, stationary direct injection diesel engine and the performance was investigated. Initially the engine fueled with diesel, rice bran biodiesel (methyl ester), raw rice bran oil and preheated rice bran oil with standard injection timing and injection pressures at different load conditions and the performances were compared. With {{the help of a}} heat exchanger and using the exhaust gases, the rice bran oil was preheated. It was found that the <b>pre</b> <b>heated</b> rice bran oil exhibits a closer performance as compared to rice bran biodiesel. Then the injection timing and injection were varied and the performance and emission parameters were investigated using preheated rice bran oil. It was found that the brake thermal efficiency and oxides of nitrogen were found to be higher and BSFC and smoke were found to be lower at 21 ° CA bTDC of injection timing and 230 bar injection pressure. From the test results the optimum injection timing and injection timing for the engine fueled with preheated rice bran oil were evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} oxidation of propane by oxygen {{has been}} investigated {{on a series of}} gallium modified Cs 2. 5 H 1. 5 PV 1 Mo 11 O 40 samples, with Ga content varying from 0 to 0. 32 per Keggin unit (KU). The physicochemical properties of the samples have been studied by using a variety of techniques, namely ICP, FTIR, XRD, 31 P-NMR, BET and TG-DTG-DSC. The effect of several parameters, such as pre-treatment temperature, reaction temperature, residence time (W/F) on the conversion and product distribution has been examined. The presence of gallium has been observed to increase surface area by a factor of more than two and to improve the selectivity to oxygenates (acrylic and acetic acids, acrolein). It has been found that there is an optimum value of Ga content of 0. 16 per KU in the Keggin structure and of <b>pre</b> <b>heating</b> temperature of 300 °C for maximizing propane conversion and acrylic acid selectivity. The latter aspect is related to the presence of both Brønsted acid and redox sites...|$|R
