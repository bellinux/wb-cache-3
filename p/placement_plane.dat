40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} self-calibration of a camera from an image sequence in the case where the camera 's internal parameters (most notably focal length) may change. The problem of camera self-calibration from a sequence of images {{has proven to be}} a difficult one in practice, due to the need ultimately to resort to non-linear methods, which have often proven to be unreliable. In a stratified approach to self-calibration, a projective reconstruction is obtained first and this is successively refined first to an affine and then to a Euclidean (or metric) reconstruction. It has been observed that the difficult step is to obtain the affine reconstruction, or equivalently to locate the plane at infinity in the projective coordinate frame. The problem is inherently non-linear and requires iterative methods that risk not finding the optimal solution. The present paper overcomes this difficulty by imposing cheirality constraints to limit the search for the plane at infinity to a 3 -dimensional cubic region of parameter space. It is then possible to carry out a dense search over this cube in reasonable time. For each hypothesised <b>placement</b> of the <b>plane</b> at infinity, the calibration problem is reduced to one of calibration of a nontranslating camera, for which fast non-iterative algorithms exist.

40|$|Disorders of the {{shoulder}} complex can be accompanied by changes in the movement pattern of the scapula. However, scapular motion is difficult to measure. A possible non-invasive method for dynamic three-dimensional kinematic measurement of the human scapula {{is the use of}} a marker cluster placed on the flat part of the acromion. A small light-weight acromion marker cluster (AMC) is presented in this study. In order to assess validity, kinematics obtained with the AMC were compared to simultaneous scapula locator (SL) recordings in a series of postures. The test/retest variability of replacement of the AMC, was also assessed. Measurement errors appeared to be sensitive for the plane of movement, the degree of humerus elevation, and replacement of the AMC. The AMC generally under-estimated scapula motion, compared to the SL. Some {{significant differences were found between}} the two methods, although the absolute differences were small (maximum mean difference 8. 4 ° in extreme position). In humerus forward flexion and abduction the maximum mean differences were 6 ° or lower. In conclusion, the AMC is a valid method of measuring scapular movement during arm elevation that could be used in shoulder pathologies. <b>Placement</b> and <b>planes</b> of movement should be carefully considered and elevation of the humerus should not exceed 100 °. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|In {{the design}} of complex power {{distribution}} networks (PDN) with multiple power islands, it is required that the PDN represents a low impedance as seen by the digital modules. This {{is to reduce the}} simultaneous switching noise (SSN), generated due to the switching activity of digital drivers. Typically this reduction in impedance is accomplished by placing decoupling capacitors between the power and ground planes of a package or board. However, the performance of the decoupling solution is a function of capacitor selection and its placement. In this paper, an automatic capacitor placement optimization method has been proposed. This method relies on a genetic algorithm to provide a stochastic search of the design space, while employing an efficient core PDN simulator based on the multi-layer finite difference method (M-FDM).

30|$|Correct {{selection}} of the femoral tunnel position is a critical step in ACL reconstruction. The effect of different placement of the femoral tunnel has been evaluated by many authors. A femoral tunnel placed at 11 o’clock in the intercondylar notch has been considered the standard and has been accepted as the correct tunnel location for all individuals [30, 31]. However, as the ACL does not function as a simple band of fibers with constant isometry, its structural complexity seems to be not completely restored by a reconstruction performed with this femoral placement. Moreover, 11 o’clock femoral placement seems to be insufficient to control complex rotatory loads [11]. According to biomechanical studies, oblique femoral tunnel <b>placement</b> in coronal <b>plane</b> results in better restoration of normal knee kinematics and improvement of rotator knee stability in comparison with a more vertical tunnel [10, 11] with no differences under combined rotary loads between double-bundle reconstruction and laterally placed single-bundle reconstruction [32].|$|R

40|$|Metal halide high {{intensity}} discharge (HID) lamps typically operate as multi-atmosphere thermal arcs in the steady state, {{but during the}} starting phase the lamps are moderate pressure glow discharges. This starting phase is of considerable interest {{because of the large}} required voltages inducing sputtering and other detrimental effects. The goal of this thesis was to investigate basic processes using rare gas mixtures so that optimum starting strategies can be developed for metal halide HID lamps. Breakdown measurements on a test lamp were conducted at various pulse repetition frequencies (0. 005 - 1000 Hz), voltage pulses (up to 2000 V), pressures (0. 5 – 110 Torr), and argon/xenon compositions, and with various ground planes. Photographs of discharges in argon, xenon, and a 10 % xenon in argon mixture were also taken at various pressures to provide additional insight. It was found that the mean breakdown time reflects the rate at which electrons are being created, and is dependent upon E/N (electric field) /(gas number density) and capacitive effects. Lower breakdown times are achieved by lowering pressure, increasing voltage and pulse repetition frequencies, and by closer <b>placement</b> of ground <b>planes...</b>|$|R

Although the inclination of the orbital plane may vary {{as much as}} 15 degrees {{over a period of}} about 50 years, the orbit altitude will always remain within a few hundred kilometers of geosynchronous altitude, GEO orbits with inclinations greater than 45 degrees exhibit remarkable instabilities ir the eccentricity due to gravitational resonance.

We approach this problem by using a system comprising of two digital infrared sensitive cameras and a high intensity infrared illuminator which was used to capture the coordinates of an infrared reflective tape attached to a coaxial biopsy needle having been inserted into a test phantom. Data was sent in real-time to a computer where the infrared needle position coordinates were recorded. A CT scan of the test phantom was then taken and the DICOM CT image coordinates of the needle were also recorded. The approach is to use a linear least-squares model to map points from each camera to a single point on each DICOM CT image resulting from the CT scan. Results show a promising mapping accuracy with limited data. The contribution of this paper is to show that a passive infrared imaging system using at least two cameras may be suitable for the needle estimation task in two dimensions which would allow real-time needle <b>placement</b> in any <b>plane.</b> ...|$|R

When drying occurs the water depth falls to zero exactly and the planes collapse to a zero inter-layer spacing.|$|R
40|$|Mob 1 is a {{component}} of both the mitotic exit network and Hippo pathway, being required for cytokinesis, control of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Cell division accuracy is crucial in maintaining cell ploidy and genomic stability and relies on the correct establishment of the cell division axis, which is {{under the control of}} the cell's environment and its intrinsic polarity. The ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila possesses a permanent anterior-posterior axis, left-right asymmetry and divides symmetrically. These unique features of Tetrahymena prompted us to investigate the role of Tetrahymena Mob 1. Unexpectedly, we found that Mob 1 accumulated in basal bodies at the posterior pole of the cell, and is the first molecular polarity marker so far described in Tetrahymena. In addition, Mob 1 depletion caused the abnormal establishment of the cell division plane, providing clear evidence that Mob 1 is important for its definition. Furthermore, cytokinesis was arrested and ciliogenesis delayed in Tetrahymena cells depleted of Mob 1. This is the first evidence for an involvement of Mob 1 in cilia biology. In conclusion, we show that Mob 1 is an important cell polarity marker that is crucial for correct division <b>plane</b> <b>placement,</b> for cytokinesis completion and for normal cilia growth rates...|$|R

Different 3 D visualization algorithms such as maximum intensity projection, shaded surface display and direct volume rendering support {{the analysis of the}} resulting volumes. Despite the available flexibility, this general approach leads to almost unreproducible and patient specific results. They depend completely on the applied algorithm and the parameter setting chosen in a wide range. Therefore, the results are inapplicable for inter-patient or inter-study comparisons. As a solution to this problem, we suggest to make the visualization fully independent of any user interaction. In consequence the main focus of the presented work lies on standardization and automation which guarantees comparable 3 D representations for the analysis of intracranial aneurysms.

In this preliminary study, two operators each performed 30 simulated computed tomography (CT) guided biopsies of targets within a phantom.

The mean axial angular error significantly decreased for both operators for the infrared guidance technique compared to the freehand method.

40|$|Includes {{digitized}} {{images in}} JPEG and TIFF formats. Experience teaches us {{to interpret the}} visual perception of an object through patterns of light and shadow. The images in this body of work contradict this normal experience, mixing "reality" with "illusion" thereby eliciting questions concerning the "naturally-occuring" and "artist-induced" images. Formal concerns in these works {{include the use of}} light on painted surfaces which allude to spacial planes. Color and painted shapes are employed to simulate deep space. Photographs, with their inherent characteristic of realism, are used to depict room-like spaces. This is accomplished by photographing a two foot wood box which has been painted in a configuration that lends itself to the intended illusion. Painted aluminum is used, with its quality of flatness, to represent voids and shadow planes in space. This thin metal also helps create the illusion that the works are part of the wall on which they hang. The <b>placement</b> of <b>planes</b> in these images attempts to stop a moment in time, fusing what is real at the moment the photograph is taken, with a phenomenon that is totally fabricated by the artist's manipulation of lines, light, paint, metal and film. This work was inspired by philosophies of the past as well as by contemporary artists. Among these influences are the oriental mystics, who fuse dualistic concepts such as form and emptiness. The highest stage of Buddhist experience is when one comes to the realization that things are devoid of form or that they are not final and irreducible realities. The questions crystallized in Paradoxical Planes are an extention of Cezanne's critical probings of his own art, in which he reassessed the painted surface. His concern, in general, was the relation of real space to illusionary space. More specifically, he probed into the complex interrelations between solid and void, figure and ground, line and plane, modeling (implied light and shadow) and modulating (patches of pure color or hue). The simple, regular geometric shapes found in these images are directly influenced by the minimal sculptors of the 1960 's. Artists such as Donald Judd and Carl Andre made large-scale minimal forms which were literal, rational, modular and mathematical. Robert Irwin, with his interest in psychological perception makes the content of his work the visual sensation of light and color. His explorations have played an important part in the development of this project. Contemporary photographers, such as Frederic Sommer and Jerry McMillan, have helped teach the use of the photograph as a tool to express concepts. This exhibit presents a paradox which is forced by the combination of naturally-occurring and artist-created planes causing the viewer to reinterpret his perceptions. Perhaps this experience is analagous to new life-situations which tend to be confusing and to cause ambivalence. Having to reinterpret these images may induce the removal of "sets" and allow the viewer to overcome preconception...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the accuracy of extramedullary and intramedullary tibial cutting guides used in indigenous and imported implants respectively, in positioning of the tibial components in megaprosthetic knee replacements. Methods A comparative study of the accuracy of extramedullary and intramedullary tibial cutting guides was carried out in 92 megaprosthetic knee replacements for distal femoral tumors. For the proximal tibia cut for tibial component placement, an extramedullary guide was used in 65 patients and an intramedullary guide was used in 27 patients. Tibial component alignment angles were measured in postoperative X-rays with the help of CAD software. Results There was more varus <b>placement</b> in coronal <b>plane</b> with extramedullary cutting guide (− 1. 18 +/− 2. 4 degrees) than the intramedullary guide (− 0. 34 +/− 2. 31 degrees) but this did not reach statistical significance. The goal of 90 +/− 2 degrees alignment of tibial component was achieved in 54 % of patients in the extramedullary group versus 67 % in the intramedullary group. In terms of sagittal plane alignment, extramedullary guide showed less accurate results (2. 09 +/− 2. 4 degrees) than intramedullary guide (0. 50 +/− 3. 80 degrees) for tibial component alignment, though 78 % of patients were aligned within the goal of 0 – 5 degrees of tibial slope angle in extramedullary group versus 63 % in intramedullary group. The mean error in the measurements due to rotation of the knee during taking the X-rays was less than 0. 1 degrees and distribution of the X-rays with the rotation of knee was similar in both the groups. Conclusions Overall, in megaprosthetic knee replacement intramedullary guides gave more accurate results in sagittal plane and exhibited similar variability as of extramedullary guides in coronal plane. </p...|$|R
40|$|Reconstruction after {{multilevel}} decompression of the cervical spine, {{especially in}} the weakened osteoporotic, neoplastic or infectious spine often requires circumferential stabilization and fusion. To avoid the additional posterior surgery in these cases while increasing rigidity of anterior-only screw-plate constructs, the authors introduce the concept of anterior transpedicular screw (ATPS) fixation. We demonstrated its morphological feasibility {{as well as its}} indications in a previous study in Part I of our project. Consequently, the objectives of the current study were to assess the ex vivo accuracy of placing ATPS into the cervical vertebra as well as the biomechanical performance of ATPS in comparison to traditional vertebral body screws (VBS) in terms of pull-out strength (POS). Twenty-three ATPS were inserted alternately to two screws into the pedicles and vertebral bodies, respectively, of six cadaveric specimens from C 3 –T 1. For insertion of ATPS, a manual fluoroscopically assisted technique was used. Pre- and post insertional CT-scans were used to assess accuracy of ATPS insertion in the axial and sagittal planes. A newly designed grading system and accuracy score were used to delineate accuracy of ATPS insertion. Following insertion of screws, 23 ATPS and 22 VBS were subjected to pull-out testing (POT). The bone mineral density (BMD) of each specimen was assessed prior to POT. Statistical analysis showed that the incidence of correctly placed screws and non-critical pedicles breaches in axial plane was 78. 3 %, and 95. 7 % in sagittal plane. Hence, according to our definition of “critical” pedicle breach that exposes neurovascular structures at risk, 21. 7 % (n =  5) of all ATPS inserted showed a critical pedicle breach in axial plane. Notably, no critical pedicle perforation occurred at the C 6 to T 1 levels. Pull-out testing of ATPS and VBS revealed that pull-out resistance of ATPS was 2. 5 -fold that of VBS. Mean POS of 23 ATPS with a mean BMD of 0. 566  g/cm 2 and a mean osseus screw purchase of 27. 2  mm was 467. 8  N. In comparison, POS of 22 VBS screws with a mean BMD of 0. 533  g/cm 2 and a mean osseus screw purchase of 16. 0  mm was 181. 6  N. The difference in ultimate pull-out strength between the ATPS and VBS group was significant (p <  0. 000001). Also, accuracy of ATPS <b>placement</b> in axial <b>plane</b> was shown to be significantly correlated with POS. In contrast, there was no correlation between screw-length, BMD, or level of insertion and the POS of ATPS or VBS. The study demonstrated that the use of ATPS might be a new technique worthy of further investigation. The use of ATPS shows the potential to increase construct rigidity in terms of screw-plate pull-out resistance. It might diminish construct failures during anterior-only reconstructions of the highly unstable decompressed cervical spine...|$|R
