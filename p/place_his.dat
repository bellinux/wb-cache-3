5|$|Upon {{orders from}} Empress Elizabeth, Saltykov moved on Prussia in a methodical advance {{beginning}} in June 1759. Some estimates <b>place</b> <b>his</b> army {{as high as}} 70,000 men; others suggest he had approximately 41,000 in June and July. Upon learning of this advance, Frederick ordered General Dohna to halt the Russian westward advance. Dohna had a force of 26,000 at his disposal, including several companies of cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Vainius first {{appears in}} written sources in 1324. In 1326, as Duke of Polatsk, {{he signed a}} treaty with the Livonian Order and Novgorod. Scholars <b>place</b> <b>his</b> death {{sometime}} between 1338 and 1342. Vainius' only known son, Liubko, died in 1342 during a battle with the Livonian Order.|$|E
5|$|Wiśniowiecki's indebted {{family was}} not able to provide him with a funeral his rank and fame deserved. In the end, he never {{received}} the large funeral and the temporary location of his body, the monastery of the Holy Cross at Łysa Góra, became his final resting <b>place.</b> <b>His</b> body was lost in the fire {{at the end of the}} 18th century, which also prevents a modern reexamination of the cause of his death.|$|E

5|$|Wulfred was {{the first}} {{archbishop}} to <b>place</b> <b>his</b> portrait on the pennies struck in his name which, unlike those of previous archbishops, never made reference to the ruling Mercian king. Wulfred also rebuilt some buildings at Christ Church, Canterbury, {{although it is not}} known whether these were support buildings, such as the dormitory and refractory, or if he rebuilt the cathedral itself.|$|E
5|$|After the Iberian king Pharasmanes I had his son Rhadamistus (r.51–55AD) invade Armenia to depose the Roman client king Mithridates, Vologeses I of Parthia (r. c.51–77AD) {{planned to}} invade and <b>place</b> <b>his</b> brother, the later Tiridates I of Armenia, on the throne. Rhadamistus was {{eventually}} driven from power, and, {{beginning with the}} reign of Tiridates, Parthia would retain firm control over Armenia—with brief interruptions—through the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. Even {{after the fall of}} the Parthian Empire, the Arsacid line lived on through the Armenian kings. However, not only did the Arsacid line continue through the Armenians, it as well continued through the Georgian kings with the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, and for many centuries afterwards in Caucasian Albania through the Arsacid Dynasty of Caucasian Albania.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Hyksos and the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to {{construct}} elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were probably in the Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the valley were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, notes in his tomb that he advised the king to <b>place</b> <b>his</b> tomb in the desolate valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but it is probably KV20 or KV38).|$|E

5|$|Djedkare {{seems to}} have been held in high esteem during the Sixth Dynasty. For example, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I chose to <b>place</b> <b>his</b> pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare. In addition, the South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his {{successor}} Pepi II, records rich offerings being made to Djedkare on behalf of the king. An estimated 92% of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate (c. 2160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period (c. 2055–1650 BC).|$|E
5|$|Edwin faced Penda and Cadwallon at the Battle of Hatfield in {{the autumn}} of 632 or 633 and was {{defeated}} and killed. For a time his body was (allegedly) hidden in Sherwood Forest at a location that became the village of Edwinstowe (trans. Edwin's resting <b>place),</b> <b>his</b> head being eventually buried at York {{and the rest of his}} body at Whitby. Of his two grown sons by Cwenburh of Mercia, Osfrith died at Hatfield, and Eadfrith was captured by Penda and killed some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|However, John I {{married a}} {{daughter}} of Sigismund I of Poland, Isabella, who in 1540 bore him a son. Already dying, the king took an oath from his barons to evade the treaty of Oradea, and his counselor, George Martinuzzi, had the infant John II Sigismund elected as king (15401571). Ferdinand I sent troops to take Buda, but they withdrew upon the advance of the Ottoman army. On August 29, 1541 Suleiman I summoned the Hungarian lords to his camp, and while the reception was taking <b>place,</b> <b>his</b> troops occupied {{the capital of the}} kingdom. At the same time the sultan assigned the territories of the kingdom east of the Tisa to Queen Isabella and her son in return for an annual tribute.|$|E

After being ripped off by a premium rate betting advice hotline, a desperate Homer turns to Lisa to pick a winner. She picks the Miami Dolphins, prompting Homer to call Moe's Tavern to <b>place</b> <b>his</b> $50 bet. In the end, the Dolphins win, and Homer and Lisa celebrate. Meanwhile, Marge takes Bart shopping for new clothes that the bullies taunt him for.|$|E
5|$|Mika Häkkinen, {{driving for}} McLaren, started from second {{position}} alongside Michael Schumacher. However, Häkkinen {{was forced to}} serve a ten-second stop-and-go penalty because he was judged to have jumped the start. Häkkinen climbed back up to fourth <b>place,</b> <b>his</b> final finishing position. Coulthard, who started third, moved into the lead until {{the first round of}} pit stops. Michael Schumacher and teammate Barrichello traded the leading during their second stops with the former retaining the lead. Michael Schumacher held off a challenge from Coulthard in the closing stages of the Grand Prix to secure victory.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of July 17–18, Major Bruce made a {{personal}} reconnaissance ahead of his troops through heavy flanking machine-gun fire. He pushed forward to the outpost lines through heavy artillery and machine-gun fire {{to keep in touch}} with all his company. On October 3–4 he made a personal reconnaissance on the left flank of his division through heavy shell fire and continual sniping and gained information which enabled him to well <b>place</b> <b>his</b> battalion and cover an exposed flank.|$|E

5|$|One {{consequence}} of the reassessment of sources is the reappearance of Troilus in his ancient form of andropais. Troilus takes this form in Giraudoux's The Trojan War Will Not Take <b>Place,</b> <b>his</b> first successful reappearance in the 20th century. Troilus is a fifteen-year-old boy whom Helen has noticed following her around. After turning down the opportunity to kiss her when she offers and when confronted by Paris, he eventually accepts the kiss {{at the end of}} the play just as Troy has committed to war. He is thus a symbol of the whole city's fatal fascination with Helen.|$|E
5|$|Scheer {{decided to}} reverse {{the course of the}} fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a {{maneuver}} that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As a result of their having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn. Hannover and the other five ships of the squadron therefore were located on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships {{to the rear of the}} line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to <b>place</b> <b>his</b> ships at the head of the line.|$|E

Along with his {{military}} decorations, he was honoured with a Gold Medal by the Aéro-Club de France, and a Bronze Medal and Diploma by the Aero Club of America. The town of Toogoolawah, Queensland, commemorated {{him in the}} name of its airport, and the national capital of Canberra remembered him with Dallas <b>Place.</b> <b>His</b> home town of Mount Morgan has dedicated a water reservoir in his honour; its Historical Society Museum holds his medals, uniform, and sword, as well the propeller from one of his planes.|$|E

5|$|The French fleet {{arrived at}} Delaware Bay on 8 July 1778, under Admiral d'Estaing, with whom General Washington planned to attack Newport, Rhode Island, {{the other major}} British base in the north. Lafayette and General Greene were sent with a 3,000-man force to {{participate}} in the attack. Lafayette wanted to control a joint Franco-American force but was rebuffed by the admiral. On 9 August, the American land force attacked the British without consulting d'Estaing. When the Americans asked the admiral to <b>place</b> <b>his</b> ships in Narragansett Bay, d'Estaing refused and, at sea, sought to defeat the British fleet. The fighting was inconclusive as a storm scattered and damaged both fleets.|$|E
5|$|The media {{objected to}} Aberhart's plan to <b>place</b> <b>his</b> government's {{future in the}} hands of the 10% of Albertans who were Social Credit members; the Calgary Herald called for an {{immediate}} election. To many Social Credit MLAs, Aberhart's greater offense was bypassing them, the people's elected representatives. This was especially irksome in view of social credit's political philosophy, which favoured technocratic rule and held that elected representatives' only legitimate function was channelling the public desire; by appealing directly to Social Credit members, Aberhart appeared to be denying the MLAs even this role. In the legislature, Conservative leader David Duggan called for Aberhart's resignation; in a move that Brennan reports shocked the assembly, his call was endorsed by Social Credit backbencher Albert Blue.|$|E
5|$|The new law {{was rapidly}} enforced.

Garmendia was accused of shooting Posadas and Otaegui of helping him to flee from police. Garmendia was shot during his interrogations and ended in a coma and, due to his physical condition, was unable to sign his confession, instead having to <b>place</b> <b>his</b> fingerprint on a confession previously written which implicated Otaegui. Though witnesses failed to identify Garamendi and doctors testified {{that he was in}} no fit state to validate the confession, together with Otaegui, he was found guilty of the charges.|$|E
