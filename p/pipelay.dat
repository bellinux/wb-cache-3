Besides that, DP nowadays {{is not only}} used in the oil industry, but also on various other types of ships. In addition, DP {{is not limited to}} maintaining a fixed position any more. One of the possibilities is sailing an exact track, useful for cablelay, <b>pipelay,</b> survey and other tasks.|$|E

50|$|A <b>pipelaying</b> ship is a {{maritime}} vessel used in {{the construction}} of subsea infrastructure. It serves to connect oil production platforms with refineries on shore. To accomplish this goal a typical <b>pipelaying</b> vessel carries a heavy lift crane, used to install pumps and valves, and equipment to lay pipe between subsea structures.|$|R

5000|$|The company spent {{its early}} days {{developing}} {{the concept of}} dynamically positioned (DP) subsea <b>pipelay.</b> Allseas acquired the former bulk carrier “Natalie Bolten” in 1985 and converted it for DP <b>pipelay</b> at the Boele shipyard in Bolnes, the Netherlands. The vessel was christened Lorelay in Rotterdam on 26 April 1986. Lorelay immediately entered service and successfully executed her first <b>pipelay</b> contract, the 8-inch, 1.8-km Helder A-B pipeline, for Unocal in the Dutch sector of the North Sea.|$|E

40|$|The {{planning}} {{and execution of}} offshore construction projects such as <b>pipelaying</b> traditionally rely to a great extend on the expertise of the offshore personnel. The state of practice that is facilitated by this expertise often leads to good solutions, but it has the following limitations: (1) the expertise resides with a few experienced {{people who are not}} always available, (2) communication between the contractor and the customer is based on opinions and past experiences, and not necessarily on objective information, (3) consideration and comparison of alternative solutions and their impact on cost and time is not straightforward, (4) estimation, {{planning and}} control under new conditions and different ones from the past are not always effective leading to either conservative or inadequate solutions. In this paper, simulation is used as a decision support, planning, control, and process improvement tool. The simulation model developed is applied to the loading of the barge at the coating yard, the transportation of the material to the <b>pipelaying</b> site, and the <b>pipelaying</b> activity performed by the <b>pipelaying</b> vessel. The model captures the expertise of the offshore personnel and addresses effectively the limitations listed above. An object-oriented environment is used to develop the simulation model that is proven to be very effective for the particular project for which it was developed and easily adjustable to any new <b>pipelaying</b> project...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} static, {{nonlinear}} three-dimensional deformation of <b>pipelaying</b> used in construction and installation of underwater pipelines is studied {{within the limits}} of small strain theory. The mathematical model consists of the pipeline model and geometric constraints imposed by the seabed and the lay vessel in stinger or J-type <b>pipelaying.</b> The pipeline is modeled as a thin-walled, slender, extensible or inextensible tubular beam-column. It is subject to gravity, lateral friction from the seabed, nonlinear three-dimensional deformation dependent hydrodynamic loads, torsion and distributed moments, varying axial tension, and internal and external static fluid forces. The problem is solved numerically by developing a nonlinear incremental finite element algorithm which features condensation and principles of contact mechanics. Condensation is used along with the geometric constraints to formulate a condensed problem which produces reaction forces. Strong nonlinearities present in the model are handled by an incremental finite element approach. The developed computer code is used to study stinger <b>pipelaying</b> for various stinger configurations, investigate the effect of water depth, and compare stinger to J-type <b>pipelaying</b> in deep water...|$|R
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of <b>pipelaying,</b> Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when <b>pipelaying</b> could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{firing line}} {{comprises}} the fixed <b>pipelay</b> ramp, enclosed {{in the central}} housing, running along the longitudinal centreline of the vessel. It is connected to an internal and external ramp, {{both of which have}} adjustable inclination to facilitate <b>pipelay</b> in varying water depths. A ramp extension unit is available for use in deep water or for severe seabed conditions.|$|E

50|$|Finally in June 2007 {{there was}} a one-foot-deep flood in the area after a major but {{temporary}} National Grid gas-pipeline-laying operation. Very wide paths of earth were exposed and compacted for the <b>pipelaying</b> further upstream during the works, encouraging sudden, fast drainage across acres of bare earth into the river after heavy storms, and the beck ran too full for the first time. In a similar situation at Peckham in 2003, some residents suggested {{that the process of}} laying a pipeline had encouraged flooding; however this was denied by the <b>pipelaying</b> company Weeks, and by the Council which had responsibility for overseeing the works. According to the Natural Gas Forum, the proper procedure when <b>pipelaying</b> is to erect barriers to prevent massive, sudden storm water runoff into streams, when swathes of bare earth are exposed. Compacted soil from large-scale works can lead to increased runoff and higher peak storm flows into streams. Therefore, all of the above flooding was apparently due to human agency; no evidence has been discovered so far of the existence of a floodplain here.|$|R
50|$|Lay methods {{consist of}} J-lay and S-lay {{and can be}} reel-lay or welded length by length. <b>Pipelaying</b> ships make use of dynamic {{positioning}} systems or anchor spreads to maintain the correct position and speed while laying pipe.|$|R

Solitaire’s S-lay capacity was increased to a holding force of 1,050 t in 2005, enabling her to lay the heaviest pipelines in unprecedented water depths. The same year Allseas launched the dynamically positioned support vessel Calamity Jane. The 225 m long dynamically positioned <b>pipelay</b> vessel Audacia became operational two years later.|$|E
