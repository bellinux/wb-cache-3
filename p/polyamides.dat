5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, <b>polyamides,</b> polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E

The interaction between <b>polyamide</b> materials and arc plasmas occurs particularly in the low voltage circuit breaker and aerospace fields.

40|$|Achieving {{a better}} {{understanding}} of transport and rejection mechanisms in RO and NF membranes requires more detailed information of the nanostructure of <b>polyamide</b> thin films. This study reports on two novel transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques for characterizing <b>polyamide</b> nanostructure. The first technique produces cross-sectional images of isolated <b>polyamide</b> thin films by removing the polysulfone support from regular TEM cross-sections. In the second technique called " projected area" TEM (PA-TEM), isolated <b>polyamide</b> thin films are placed with their surface perpendicular to the electron beam. The resulting images capture the thickness, morphology and mass density of the entire thin film. In combination, these new techniques provide information on <b>polyamide</b> nanostructure that is not evident using conventional methods. For the commercial RO membrane ESPA 3, the cross-sectional view of the isolated <b>polyamide</b> thin film shows a 30 - 60. nm thick base of nodular <b>polyamide</b> (presumably the separation barrier) that forms a relatively smooth interface with the polysulfone support. Above this, a more open structure of loose <b>polyamide</b> extends outward giving rise to the ridge-and-valley surface structure.
