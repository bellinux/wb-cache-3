40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{new method}} of {{implanting}} vascular access systems using the Arrow Percutaneous Sheath Introducer Kit is described. The surgeon who frequently inserts these systems may find this technique to {{be a useful}} alternative in those patients in whom cutdowns were unsuccessful or in whom the percutaneous technique with a <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath</b> {{is found to be}} difficult. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 13 : 329 - 330, 1989) A number of companies have developed totally im-plantable central venous access systems for the longterm delivery of parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, blood prod-ucts, and cancer chemotherapeutic agents. These devices also provide an easily accessible port for sampling blood. Importance, benefits, reliability, safety, and acceptance of these access systems have been thoroughly docu-mented. 1 - 6 Venous cannulation can be performed by a cutdown of the cephalic, external jugular, internal jugu-lar, or saphenous vein. 7 - 9 Another method of venous cannulation is by percutaneous puncture of the subcla-vian vein, and then introducing a <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath</b> 10 - 11 (Fig. 1). On occasion a problem is encountered using the <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath,</b> specifically kinking of the sheath on the under surface of the clavicle and tearing of the tip of the sheath by the costoclavicular ligament. An alterna-tive percutaneous implantation technique using an Ar...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} a “mini-perc ” technique of per-cutaneous nephrolithotomy using a 14 -Fr <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath</b> {{for the removal of}} pyelocaliceal stones, and to determine appropriate inclusion criteria. Materials and Methods: From July 1999 to June 2002, the medical records and radiographic images of 72 patients who underwent the “mini-perc ” technique of percutaneous nephrolithotomy with a 14 -Fr <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath,</b> were reviewed to determine clinical history, stone characteristics, immediate stone free rate, final stone free rate after additional procedures, complications, and hospital stay. We also analyzed the effect of the longest stone diameter, the cumulative longest diameter of stones, the cumulative stone burden, and the stone density on the immediate stone free rate using a Fisher exact test. Results: The only major complication, arterial bleeding, occurred in a patient with Child A liver cirrhosis and was successfully treated by embolization with coils and a gelatin sponge. The immediate stone free rate was 80. 6 %, which was sig-nificantly influenced by stone diameter but not stone density. The mean hospita...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSuccessful {{implantation}} of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) that {{is performed}} to avoid surgery {{in patients with}} atypical vasculature is still problematic. Acute angulations and significant tortuosity of the venous vasculature may influence both procedural success and periprocedural complications. We successfully implanted an ICD in a patient with deformed vasculature caused by tuberculosis-induced lung destruction by using a flexible coiled sheath instead of a friable <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath.</b> This report highlights an alternative maneuver that may be an option in patients who have an acute angle between the brachiocephalic vein and the superior vena cava...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel fully implantable wireless sensor system intended for long-term monitoring of hypertension patients, designed for implantation into the femoral artery with computed tomography angiography. It {{consists of a}} pressure sensor and a telemetric unit, which is wirelessly connected to an extracorporeal readout station for energy supply and data recording. The system measures intraarterial pressure at a sampling rate of 30 Hz and an accuracy of ± 1. 0 mmHg over a range of 30 - 300 mmHg, while consuming up to 300 µW. A special <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath</b> introducer set was developed to support the implantation procedure. The system delivered stable measurements in initial animal trials in sheep, with results being in good agreement with reference sensor systems...|$|E
40|$|Conference Theme: From Hemodialysis Unit to ICUWe {{report a}} {{hemodialysis}} patient {{who suffered from}} superior vena cava perforation after a cuffed tunneled catheter insertion using the right subclavian approach. A 59 -year-old lady suffered from end-stage renal failure due to unknown cause and was initiated on peritoneal dialysis. She was switched to hemodialysis via the right A-V fistula {{as a result of}} abdominal adhesions. Her right forearm A-V fistula was thrombosed 3 years after creation. The right internal jugular vein was thrombosed and there was a left carotid/jugular fistula as a result of previous traumatic puncture. She was therefore scheduled for a cuffed tunneled catheter insertion using the right subclavian approach. There was difficulty during the negotiation of the <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath</b> and kinking was noted. The procedure was aborted and CT thorax showed extravasation of contrast in the mediastinum. Perforation of the superior vena cava was diagnosed and DDAVP was given to control the bleeding. The cardiothoracic surgeons suggested for conservative anagement in view of the stable hemodynamics. Repeat CT scan 1 week later showed no further extravasation or hematoma formation. The right subclavian vein was attempted again after 2 weeks with a split catheter using a double guidewire technique (Retrocath) and the procedure was uneventful. Because of the angulation between the right subclavian vein and superior vena cava, cuffed tunneled catheter insertion using the subclavian approach is of higher technical difficulty. Attempts should be made to use the jugular vein for cuffed tunneled catheter insertion if possible. The risk of perforation or vascular injury is increased especially when the catheter is inserted using a <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath</b> that is nonflexible. We suggested that if the subclavian approach is used, one should attempt with a flexible split catheter using a double guidewire technique to minimize the chance of vascular injury.

40|$|A {{modified}} {{technique for}} {{placement of the}} venous outflow component (VOC) of the Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) device (Hemosphere Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) is described. The purpose of the technique {{is to improve the}} system's trackability and facilitate device insertion in patients with central venous occlusion. Device preparation requires placement of a 6 -mm × 4 -cm angioplasty balloon within the leading end of the VOC. The leading 2 cm of the balloon are placed just distal to the radiopaque marker of the VOC. The balloon is inflated to profile and locked in this position within the leading end of the VOC. The VOC and balloon combination is advanced over the wire through the 20 F <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath</b> provided by the manufacturer. The described technique was used to successfully implant the HeRO device in 12 patients with central venous occlusion. This technique is recommended for placement of the VOC of the HeRO device in patients with central venous occlusions...|$|E
40|$|Although highly underutilized by {{the medical}} device industry, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in the {{development}} of new technologies is gaining popularity as regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) begin to require additional proof of safety through scientific methods. Non-linear FEA allows engineers to realistically simulate the mechanical behavior of implants as seen in the in-vitro, or in some cases, the in-vivo configurations. The work presented in this report investigates how computational methods can be used to simulate the interaction of a St. Jude Medical silicone soft-tip as it passes through a <b>Peel-Away</b> <b>Sheath</b> (i. e. introducer). In this analysis the soft-tips were modeled as axisymmetric with hyperelastic material properties assigned to the soft-tips. An Ogden, second order hyperelastic material model was used to describe the non-linear stress-strain behavior of silicone soft-tips. The finite element program, ABAQUS/Standard was used to simulate the soft-tip/introducer interactions. The reaction forces obtained through these simulations represent the force required to push a lead through an introducer, and were then compared to experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Hypertension is an {{important}} risk factor for vascular diseases (arteriosclerosis), renal and heart insufficiency. In Germany, approximately 10 million people suffer from hypertension. 10 % of the people affected are difficult to medicate. Furthermore, 10 % of this group are candidates for long term monitoring. Therefore a fully implantable and telemetrically controlled blood pressure system is presented to realize a comfortable long term monitoring for these patients. The developed implant consists of a newly designed sensor chip integrated {{at the tip of}} a polyurethane tube (Ø 1. 05 mm) and a telemetric unit (Ø 17 mm). The dimensions of the system per mit a minimal invasive procedure. The telemetry and the sensor are connected via micro-cable. The implantation procedure follows the steps of Seldinger-technique with a specially de signed collagen based <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath</b> introducer set (PASIS) for secure insertion of the pressure sensor in the femoral artery (FA). The telemetry was fixed on the muscle fascia be neath the skin. A reference sensor (MIPM, Mammendorfer Institut für Physik und Medizin GmbH, Germany) was placed contra laterally. In vivo experiments for evaluation of implantation procedure and functionality of the implant were per formed in 6 sheep (weight 60 to 80 kg, 4 : acute testing, 2 : chronic testing) ...|$|E
40|$|Three incisions in {{the chest}} are {{necessary}} for implantation of the entirely subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD). The superior parasternal incision is a possible risk for infection and a potential source of discomfort. A less invasive alternative technique of implanting the S-ICD electrode [...] the two-incision technique [...] avoids the superior parasternal incision. The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the two-incision technique for implantation of the S-ICD. Consecutive patients who received an S-ICD between October 2010 and December 2011 were implanted using the two-incision technique, which positions the parasternal part of the S-ICD electrode using a standard 11 Fr <b>peel-away</b> <b>sheath.</b> All patients were routinely evaluated for at least 1 year for complications and device interrogation at the outpatient clinic. Thirty-nine patients (46 % male, mean age 44 ± 15 years) were implanted with a S-ICD using the two-incision technique. During mean follow-up of 18 months (range 14 - 27 months) no dislocations were observed, {{and there was no}} need for repositioning of either the ICD or the electrode. No serious infections occurred during follow-up except for 2 superficial wound infections of the pocket incision site. Device function was normal in all patients, and no inappropriate sensing occurred related to the implantation technique. The two-incision technique is a safe and efficacious alternative for S-ICD implantations and may help to reduce complications. The two-incision technique offers physicians a less invasive and simplified implantation procedure of the S-IC...|$|E
