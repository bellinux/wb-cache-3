50|$|Despite the {{probable}} {{and most likely}} reaction of the miners, {{in order to be}} eligible for an IMF loan to repay its debts the government was required to close more mines (142 which had been closed since 1997) and was <b>pending</b> <b>decision</b> on closing additional 112 mines. To limit losses in the unprofitable mining sector, then running at $370 million, the government made an announcement just before Christmas 1998 of its plan to close non-profitable mines. After closing about 100 mines and getting rid of 90,000 mining jobs in the course of 1997, including 20,000 in the Jiu Valley, implementing this new plan would result in firing additional 6,500 miners.|$|E

The Redcliffe-Maud report led to a reconsideration of the plans, especially with respect to Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, and a March 1970 White Paper proposed three unitary authorities for South Wales, based on Cardiff, Swansea and Newport.|$|R

The missile was to be banned under the provisions of START II, but that treaty was never ratified. The remaining ten silo-based missiles in Russia were deactivated around 2000. After 2000, the rail-based missiles were also gradually withdrawn from service, with the remaining 15 decommissioned in August 2005. The last SS-24 ICBM in Russia was eliminated in April 2008.|$|E

The subject of his pension is by far his most important worry during the entire two weeks described. His pension is about to be awarded, <b>pending</b> <b>decision</b> from the Minister about pension degree, and correspondingly, amount. The difference between first and third degree translate to him as the difference between not being able to afford anything that is not strictly needed, and being able to pursue his hobby (and the only other significant interest), stamp collecting.|$|E

5000|$|The {{point is}} now <b>pending</b> <b>decision</b> in the Federal Circuit, because that court has ordered en banc {{rehearing}} {{on that issue}} in the Lexmark case. [...] The reason that the issue {{has come to the}} fore is that the Supreme Court, in its recent copyright decision in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., held that a foreign sale authorized by the copyright owners exhausts U.S. copyright. The Supreme Court rested its decision mainly on common-law authority, quoting extensively from Coke's Institutes (Coke on Littleton), and saying that this stated the general rule from which any exception must be proved. Some have thought, therefore, that the same principle applies at least as forcefully in patent law as in copyright law, so that patent exhaustion should be international just as copyright exhaustion is.|$|E

[...] The meetings noted that tar sands knowledge had increased, discussed Canada's commitment to its environment {{and the benefits of}} the oil sands to America. In December 2011, AEG led a counter-boycott of Chiquita Bananas in response to the company signing on to an anti-oil sands campaign coordinated by California-based environmental advocacy group Forest Ethics. Chiquita later said that it would continue to use Canadian oil. Levi-Strauss and Timberland were also targeted by AEG in the boycott of the boycotters, but were later taken down from the page after the companies said they would not boycott Canadian oil.|$|E

50|$|The ground {{currently}} {{consists of}} a covered stand {{on one side of}} the pitch, with terracing on the other three. A stand was built in 1991, but replaced by the current structure in 2006. The stand (currently known as the 'New Stand' <b>pending</b> <b>decision</b> on a new name) was completed in 2006. It seats 7,000 people and also includes a press box and a special section for wheelchair users. Its 10 sections are each split horizontally with green, white and yellow colour seats (the colours of Offaly GAA), with the words '' (the Irish for Offaly) spelt out across the stand's white section. At the same time as the stand was being constructed, improvements were also made in the terracing on the opposite side of the pitch, allowing it to comfortably hold 8,000 people. Plans are ongoing to further develop the ground and provide floodlights, improved dressing rooms, toilet facilities and a TV camera room on the terrace side of the ground.|$|E
