5|$|Silver {{and gold}} have rather low {{chemical}} affinities for oxygen, lower than copper, {{and it is}} therefore expected that silver oxides are thermally quite unstable.

Silver(I) oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver, and decomposes to silver and oxygen above 160°C.

5|$|The common {{oxidation}} {{states of}} silver are (in order of commonness): +1 (the most stable state; for example, silver nitrate, AgNO3); +2 (highly oxidising; for example, silver(II) fluoride, AgF2); and even very rarely +3 (extreme oxidising; for example, potassium tetrafluoroargentate(III), KAgF4).

40|$|WO 200125508 A UPAB: 20010822 NOVELTY - In the {{electrochemical}} production of peroxodisulfuric acid (H 2 S 2 O 8) and <b>peroxodisulfates</b> by electrochemical oxidation of sulfuric acid, an electrode with a doped diamond layer {{is used as}} anode. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for: (a) {{the use of an}} electrode with a doped diamond layer in {{the electrochemical}} production of H 2 S 2 O 8 and peroxodisulfates; (b) optionally divided cells for the electrochemical production of H 2 S 2 O 8 and <b>peroxodisulfates,</b> with a housing, the specified electrode and a counterelectrode. USE - H 2 S 2 O 8 is used mainly in etching processes in the electronics industry and in the production of certain plastics, e. g. in polymerization of acrylonitrile. It is also used for treating waste liquor, oxidizing dyes and bleaching fibers and is a valuable intermediate for the electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide. ADVANTAGE - The efficiency of this process depends mainly on the electrode material, which must be resistant to corrosion and anodic dissolution and also have a high oxygen over-potential. The existing large-scale process uses large flat platinum electrodes at high sulfuric acid concentrations and high current density but they gradually dissolve, giving the need for costly cyclical removal of corrosion products. It also requires special, costly equipment. However, it is desirable to produce H 2 S 2 O 8 on site, as required, as its extreme reactivity makes storage difficult. Diamond coatings normally have inadequate adhesion to metal substrates and relatively low oxygen over-potential. Electrodes with a doped diamond coating avoid these drawbacks. The present process gives acceptable yields, even at low sulfuric acid concentrations, and is suitable for large-scale operation...|$|R

40|$|Chalcopyrite ore {{forms the}} {{significant}} fraction of copper deposits {{in the earth}} crust. However, {{it is also the}} most difficult to treat using conventional ferric leaching methods. Smelting and electro-refining are currently the methods used in treating chalcopyrite concentrate obtained from froth flotation. Due to the ever increasing environmental requirements on smelters by the Environmental Protection Agency, new smelters are scarce in the United States. The scarcity of smelters has led to the urgent need to find a novel leaching method for the abundant chalcopyrite deposits in the USA {{and the rest of the}} world. This chapter(one) of the dissertation, therefore, investigated the leaching of chalcopyrite ore at pH 2 using a newly discovered oxidant (<b>peroxodisulfate).</b> Our results show that chalcopyrite leaching using <b>peroxodisulfate</b> follows a surface reaction shrinking core model. The activation energy of chalcopyrite leaching using <b>peroxodisulfate</b> ion was calculated as 41. 1 kJ mol⁻¹. We also report that the leaching of chalcopyrite ore is affected by particle size and that stirring hurts leaching of chalcopyrite. Additionally, we found that <b>peroxodisulfate</b> can produce from sulfuric ions electrochemically. Hydrogen peroxide, permanganate, <b>peroxodisulfate</b> and ferric ions are all strong oxidants that have been researched in production pregnant leach solution (PLS) from chalcopyrite ore leaching. Because, solvent extraction is the next step in the recovery of copper from pregnant leach solutions (PLS). The questions, therefore, arises as to the fate of the organic extractant used in solvent extraction coming in contact with strong oxidant residual in the PLS. In chapter two of the dissertation, we studied the effect of strong oxidant residual in PLS on the degradation of organic extractants during solvent extraction of copper. Exposed organic extractants were analyzed using interfacial tension(IFT), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and CG LS. The results obtained from IFT and FTIR analysis, show no effect on the organic extractants exposed to sunlight and PLS containing the residual strong oxidant. Finally in chapter 3, the dissertation exams alternative water source for the flotation of chalcopyrite. Mineral flotation is a water-intensive process in mining. In order to sustain mining operations such flotation, which rely heavily on water, chapter 3 of the dissertation looks at using alternative water sources (in this case reclaimed wastewater) in the flotation of chalcopyrite ores; this effort is to limit the mining industries dependence on fresh ground water particularly in the Southwest of United States where water is a scarce commodity. The research studied the effect of reclaimed waste water on chalcopyrite flotation via contact angle and surface energy measurements. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and flotation tests were used to supplement the findings from contact angle and surface studies. We conclude here that the contact angle of a pure chalcopyrite surface was determined to be 75. 6 degrees. We also found that pure chalcopyrite mineral surface is slightly polar with surface energies γCuFeS 2 ^(LW) = 41. 4 mJ/m² (apolar), γCuFeS 2 ^(AB) = 2. 9 mJ/m² (polar).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{two aspects of}} <b>peroxodisulfate</b> {{reduction}} at Ag-electrodes are studied: On the one hand, the influence of <b>peroxodisulfate</b> on the double layer composition is investigated. On the other hand, the reduction of S 2 O 82 - serves as a model system for studying spatial pattern formation in systems with a negative differential resistance in the polarization curve. In particular {{the influence of the}} geometrical position of the reference electrode on pattern formation is examined. The system Ag/S 2 O 82 - (basic pH) and the subsystems were studied by using the SP-resonance shift technique (Surface Plasmons). Changes of the SP-resonance with potential are only detectable positive to a threshold potential. This threshold potential of the basic <b>peroxodisulfate</b> system was shifted 0. 35 V to more cathodic values in comparison to the corresponding basic sulfate system. An XPS-study showed that the SP-resonance changes of both systems are due to specifically adsobed OH- and an oxide like surface species O 2 -. The pzc ((point of zero charge) calculated from the XPS-data correlates with the threshold potential of the SP-study. An SEM-study of the <b>peroxodisulfate</b> system excluded surface roughening as source of the SP-resonance changes. The shift of the pzc (threshold potential) originates from the competition of the chemical oxidation of adsorbed OH- by S 2 O 82 - and the electrochemical reduction of formed OH. Both processes are very fast, whereas the desorption of specifically adsorbed OH- is much slower. For this reason an OH- coverage can build up at more cathodic values compared to the corresponding basic sulfate system, resulting also in a shift of the pzc to more cathodic values. The potential distribution in front of a rotating ring electrode was studied by using a potential microprobe. The reference electrode was placed {{in the sense of a}} classical Luggin capillary next to the working electrode. It was shown that such an arrangement will introduce a negative global coupling into the system which destabilizes homogeneous stationary states if the current-potential characteristics exhibits a negative differential resistance.

The addition of an external resistance introduces a positive global coupling which can compensate the negative global coupling. In such a case potential patterns could not be detected any more...|$|E
