In January 2006, the Pew Research Center found 62 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> said addressing Medicare’s financial problems should be {{a high priority for}} the government, but that still put it behind other priorities. Surveys suggest that there’s no public consensus behind any specific strategy to keep the program solvent.|$|E

A movement began, now known around the world as Women <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wall, headed by Anat Hoffman. Polls show that in Israel [...] "64 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secular <b>public,</b> 53 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional non-religious <b>public,</b> and 26 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional-religious <b>public</b> support <b>the</b> group, Women <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wall, and their quest to pray at the Kotel in their fashion.

A scientific poll conducted by Infratest Dimap for the public-service broadcaster ARD found that 61 {{percent of the people}} support the workers. Of 1,003 people surveyed, 47 percent said Deutsche Bahn was to blame for the strike, while only 25 percent fingered GDL. Nevertheless, the ARD poll found that public support for the union had slipped by five percentage points since mid-October. A second poll for the public opinion company Forsa for the newspaper Bild showed only 45 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> supported GDL.|$|E

He would pay compensation {{to two of the}} victims. The rape charges brought by A. would be dropped, as well as Katsav's charges of blackmail. This led to a public outcry, in particular from women's rights organizations. Opinion polls showed that 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> objected to the deal. A protest at Rabin Square in Tel Aviv drew a large crowd. The attorney general claimed the agreement would spare humiliation of the presidency.

25|$|Subsidies for {{the centers}} had reached NOK300 million by 1991. Two public {{evaluations}} with {{of the project}} concluded {{that it was a}} failure. The main finding was that the decision to establish the centers had been taken early in the process and that reports and later work were then carried out to find areas to serve, instead of establishing if there was a market for the amount of centers. According to the report from Nordlandsforskning, only Norsk Data gained from the project. The overcapacity and costs tied up 92 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> information technology budget, hindering other project which could have created value from being carried out. Lack of projects caused FUNN to not result in any advantages to the communities where it was located.|$|E

The American Bar Association gave her a unanimous [...] "well qualified" [...] assessment, its highest mark for professional qualification.

Wurst is the drag stage persona of Tom Neuwirth, who in 2007 {{finished second in the}} third season of Austrian talent show Starmania, behind the 2011 Austrian entry Nadine Beiler. Neuwirth went on to join the boy band Jetzt Anders! along with other contestants from Starmania in 2007, which disbanded later that year. Following this, Neuwirth, who uses masculine pronouns when referring to himself but feminine pronouns to describe Wurst, developed his new drag persona and appeared on ORF's talent show Die große Chance (The Big Opportunity) as Wurst in 2011, achieving sixth place. Wurst went on to compete in the Austrian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 with the song [...] "That's What I Am", qualifying for the super final and finishing second with 49 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> vote.|$|E

2500|$|The GFWC {{developed}} a national agenda for libraries across the country. Clubwomen believed that {{having access to}} books made people's lives better. Women’s clubs helped establish many public libraries by contributing their book collections, raising money for building construction {{through a variety of}} activities for years, acting as librarians, cataloguing early collections, enlisting male leaders for public funding, and other management activities. [...] After the public libraries were established, women’s clubs lobbied on behalf of the public libraries in state legislatures and also for funding from the Carnegie Library Endowment. According to the American Library Association (ALA) and GFWC, women’s clubs are estimated to have started between 75 and 80 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> libraries in the United States. In New York, Melvil Dewey found clubwomen in his state to [...] "be staunch allies".|$|E

2500|$|UFOs {{constitute}} a widespread international cultural {{phenomenon of the}} last 60 years. Gallup Polls rank UFOs {{near the top of}} lists for subjects of widespread recognition. In 1973, a survey found that 95 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> reported having heard of UFOs, whereas only 92 percent had heard of U.S. President Gerald Ford in a 1977 poll taken just nine months after he left the White House. A 1996 Gallup Poll reported that 71 percent of the United States population believed that the U.S. government was covering up information regarding UFOs. A 2002 Roper Poll for the Sci-Fi Channel found similar results, but with more people believing that UFOs are extraterrestrial craft. In that latest poll, 56 percent thought UFOs were real craft and 48 percent that aliens had visited the Earth. Again, about 70 percent felt the government was not sharing everything it knew about UFOs or extraterrestrial life. In the film Yellow Submarine, Ringo states that the yellow submarine that is following him [...] "must be one of them unidentified flying cupcakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} was first listed as {{endangered}} in 1967 under the Endangered Species Preservation Act, and was relisted on January 4, 1974, under the Endangered Species Act. In September 2006, South Dakota's ferret population {{was estimated to}} be around 420, with 250 (100 breeding adults consisting of 67 females and 33 males) in Eagle Butte, South Dakota which is 100,000 acres, less than 3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> grasslands in South Dakota, 70 miles East of Rapid City, South Dakota in the Buffalo Gap National Grassland bordering Badlands National Park, 130 ferrets northeast of Eagle Butte, SD on Cheyenne River Indian Reservation and about 40 ferrets on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. Arizona's Aubrey Valley ferret population was well over 100 and a second reintroduction site with around 50 animals is used. An August 2007 report in the journal Science counted a population of 223 in one area of Wyoming (the original number of reintroduced ferrets, most of which died, was 228), and an annual growth rate of 35% from 2003–2006 was estimated. This rate of recovery is much faster than for many endangered species, and the ferret seems to have prevailed over the previous problems of disease and prey shortage that hampered its improvement. As of 2007, the total wild population of black-footed ferrets in the U.S. was well over 650 individuals, plus 250 in captivity. In 2008, the IUCN reclassified the species as [...] "globally endangered", a substantial improvement since the 1996-assessment, when it was considered extinct in the wild, as the species was indeed only surviving in captivity.|$|E

In one instance, in New York City on 8 May, pro-administration construction workers rioted and attacked demonstrating students. Such violence, however, was an aberration.
