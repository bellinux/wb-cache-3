5|$|Ytterbium metal tarnishes {{slowly in}} air. Finely {{dispersed}} ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald-green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. <b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> film {{capacitors}} {{are made}} with a dielectric of the synthetic fluoropolymer <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE), a hydrophobic solid fluorocarbon. They are manufactured both as metallized and as film/foil types, although poor adherence to the film makes metallization difficult. PTFE is often known by the DuPont trademark Teflon.|$|E
25|$|PCBs readily {{penetrate}} skin, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and latex (natural rubber). PCB-resistant materials include Viton, polyethylene, {{polyvinyl acetate}} (PVA), <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE), butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, and Neoprene.|$|E
25|$|In chemistry, <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> is a {{synthetic}} fluoropolymer which finds numerous applications. PTFE {{is best known}} by the DuPont brand name Teflon. PTFE was accidentally invented by Roy Plunkett of Kinetic Chemicals in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Gore-Tex implants. In medical uses, Gore-Tex {{is known}} as EPTFE, or {{expanded}} <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> and, commercially as Advanta, UltraSoft, and SoftForm. The EPTFE is delivered to surgeons in strips that are 1/16inch (2.4 mm) and 3/16 (3.4mm) diameter tubes.|$|E
25|$|A {{fluoropolymer}} is a fluorocarbon based polymer {{with multiple}} strong carbon–fluorine bonds. It {{is characterized by}} a high resistance to solvents, acids, and bases. Fluoropolymers were discovered in 1938 by Dr. Roy Plunkett when he accidentally polymerized tetrafluoroethylene to form <b>polytetrafluoroethylene.</b>|$|E
25|$|The plastic films {{used as the}} {{dielectric}} for film capacitors are Polypropylene (PP), Polyester (PET), Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), and <b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> or Teflon (PTFE). Polypropylene film material with a market share of something about 50% and Polyester film with something about 40% are the most used film materials. The rest of something about 10% will be used by all other materials including PPS and paper with roughly 3%, each.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, a DuPont {{research}} {{manager in}} the Teflon business, Bill Gore, left the company because of its unwillingness to develop Teflon as wire-coating insulation. Gore's son Robert found a method for solving the wire-coating problem and the company W. L. Gore and Associates was born. In 1969, Robert Gore developed an expanded <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (ePTFE) membrane {{which led to the}} large Gore-Tex business in breathable rainwear. The company developed many other uses of PTFE.|$|E
25|$|Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (conjugate base perfluorooctanoate), {{also known}} as C8, is a {{synthetic}} perfluorinated carboxylic acid and fluorosurfactant. One industrial application is as a surfactant in the emulsion polymerization of fluoropolymers. It {{has been used in}} the manufacture of such prominent consumer goods as <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (commercially known as Teflon). PFOA has been manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities. It is also formed by the degradation of precursors such as some fluorotelomers.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (Teflon) was {{discovered}} by accident by a recently hired DuPont PhD, Roy J. Plunkett. While working with a cylinder of tetrafluoroethylene, {{he was unable to}} release the gas, although the weight had not changed. Scraping down the container, he found white flakes of a polymer new to the world. Tests showed the substance was resistant to corrosion from most substances and had better high temperature stability than any other plastic. By early 1941, a crash program was making commercial quantities.|$|E
25|$|Besides the above-described films ((Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate Polyester PET), Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), Polycarbonate (PP), Polystyrene (PS) and <b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE)), {{some other}} plastic {{materials}} {{may be used}} as the dielectric in film capacitors. Thermoplastic polymers such as Polyimide (PI), Polyamide (PA, better known as Nylon or Perlon), Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), Siloxane, Polysulfone (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact portable electronic devices.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few {{different}} dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.|$|E
500|$|The Frigidaire {{division}} of General Motors (GM) experimented with chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants {{in the late}} 1920s, and Kinetic Chemicals was formed as {{a joint venture between}} GM and DuPont in 1930 hoping to market Freon-12 (...) as one such refrigerant. It replaced earlier and more toxic compounds, increased demand for kitchen refrigerators, and became profitable; by 1949 DuPont had bought out Kinetic and marketed several other Freon compounds. <b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (Teflon) was serendipitously discovered in 1938 by Roy J. Plunkett while working on refrigerants at Kinetic, and its superlative chemical and thermal resistance lent it to accelerated commercialization and mass production by 1941.|$|E

2500|$|Because of fluorine's tight bonding {{as well as}} the {{toxicity}} of hydrogen fluoride, the element resisted many attempts to isolate it. In 1886, French chemist Henri Moissan, later a Nobel Prize winner, succeeded in making elemental fluorine by electrolyzing a mixture of potassium fluoride and hydrogen fluoride. Large-scale production and use of fluorine began during World War 2 as part of the Manhattan Project. Earlier in the century, the main fluorochemicals were commercialized by the DuPont company: [...] refrigerant gases (Freon) and <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> plastic (Teflon).|$|E
2500|$|In 1915 Corning Glassworks {{developed}} borosilicate glass, {{which was}} a boom {{to the war effort}} in the United States. [...] Though after the war, many laboratories turned back to imports, research into better glassware flourished. [...] Glassware became more immune to thermal shock while maintaining chemical inertness. [...] Further important technologies impacting the development of laboratory glassware included the development of <b>polytetrafluoroethylene,</b> and a drop in price to the point laboratory glassware is, in some cases, more economical to throw away than to re-use.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> film {{capacitors}} {{feature a}} very high temperature resistance up to 200nbsp&°C, and even further up to 260nbsp&°C, with a voltage derating. The dissipation factor 2 • 10 −4 [...] is quite small. The change in capacitance over the entire temperature range of +1% to -3% {{is a little bit}} higher than for polypropylene film capacitors. However, since the smallest available film thickness for PTFE films is 5.5nbsp&µm, approximately twice of the thickness of polypropylene films, the PTFE film capacitors are physically bulkier than PP film capacitors. It added that the film thickness on the surface is not constant, so that Teflon films are difficult to produce.|$|E
2500|$|As a salt, its {{dominant}} use is as an emulsifier for the {{emulsion polymerization}} of fluoropolymers such as <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE, or Teflon), polyvinylidene fluoride, and fluoroelastomers. For this use, 3M subsidiary Dyneon has a replacement emulsifer despite DuPont stating PFOA is an [...] "essential processing aid". PFOA {{is used in}} the production of Gore-Tex as it is PTFE-based. In PTFE processing, PFOA is in aqueous solution and forms micelles that contain tetrafluoroethylene and the growing polymer. PFOA can be used to stabilize fluoropolymer and fluoroelastomer suspensions before further industrial processing and in ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography it can act as an extraction agent. PFOA also finds uses in electronic products and as an industrial fluorosurfactant.|$|E
2500|$|Steel or {{aluminum}} cooking pans can be {{coated with}} a substance such as <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE, often referred to with the genericized trademark Teflonreg&) {{in order to minimize}} food sticking to the pan surface. [...] There are advantages and disadvantages to such a coating. [...] Coated pans are easier to clean than most non-coated pans, and require little or no additional oil or fat to prevent sticking, a feature that helps to produce more nutritious food. [...] On the other hand, some sticking is required to cause sucs to form, so a non-stick pan cannot be used where a pan sauce is desired. Non-stick coatings tend to degrade over time and are susceptible to damage. [...] In order to preserve the coating, it is important never to use metal implements, harsh scouring pads or chemical abrasives to clean the cooking surface.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{development}} of plastic materials by organic chemists during the Second World War, the capacitor industry began to replace paper with thinner polymer films. One very early development in film capacitors was described in British Patent 587,953 in 1944. The introduction of plastics in plastic film capacitors was approximately in the following historic order: polystyrene (PS) [...] in 1949, polyethylene terephthalate (PET/"polyester") and cellulose acetate (CA) in 1951, polycarbonate (PC/Lexan) in 1953, <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE/Teflon) in 1954, polyparylene in 1954, polypropylene (PP) in 1954, polyethylene (PE) in 1958, and polyphenylene sulphide (PPS) in 1967. By the mid-1960s there was {{a wide range of}} different plastic film capacitors offered by many, mostly European and US manufacturers. [...] German manufacturers such as WIMA, Roederstein, Siemens and Philips were trend-setters and leaders in a world market driven by consumer electronics.|$|E
2500|$|Surgery is {{curative}} of {{mitral valve}} regurgitation. [...] There are two surgical {{options for the}} treatment of MI: mitral valve replacement and mitral valve repair. Mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement where a repair is feasible as bioprosthetic replacement valves have a limited lifespan of 10 to 15 years, whereas synthetic replacement valves require ongoing use of blood thinners {{to reduce the risk of}} stroke. [...] There are two general categories of approaches to mitral valve repair: [...] Resection of the prolapsed valvular segment (sometimes referred to as the 'Carpentier' approach), and installation of artificial chordae to [...] "anchor" [...] the prolapsed segment to the papillary muscle (sometimes referred to as the 'David' approach). [...] With the resection approach, any prolapsing tissue is resected, in effect removing the hole through which the blood is leaking. [...] In the artificial chordae approach, ePTFE (expanded <b>polytetrafluoroethylene,</b> or Gore-Tex) sutures are used to replace the broken or stretched chordae tendonae, bringing the natural tissue back into the physiological position, thus restoring the natural anatomy of the valve. [...] With both techniques, an annuloplasty ring is typically secured to the annulus, or opening of the mitral valve, to provide additional structural support. [...] In some cases, the [...] "double orifice" [...] (or 'Alfieri') technique for mitral valve repair, the opening of the mitral valve is sewn closed in the middle, leaving the two ends still able to open. This ensures that the mitral valve closes when the left ventricle pumps blood, yet allows the mitral valve to open at the two ends to fill [...] the left ventricle with blood before it pumps. [...] In general, mitral valve surgery [...] requires [...] "open-heart" [...] surgery in which the heart is arrested and the patient is placed on a heart-lung machine (cardiopulmonary bypass). [...] This allows the complex surgery to proceed in a still environment.|$|E
