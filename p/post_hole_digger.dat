5000|$|A {{post office}} called Grubville {{has been in}} {{operation}} since 1853. The community was named after the occupation of a local [...] "grubber" [...] (i.e. <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> <b>digger).</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} auger type post hole diggers. These are {{generally}} easier to use, {{and they can}} be used to a much greater depth, as the hole can be dug as deep as {{the entire length of the}} shaft. More importantly, they form a much neater hole, with a well-defined circumference. However, the very fact that the person doing the digging is guaranteed a perfect hole with an auger <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> <b>digger</b> is also its greatest weakness: any given auger style <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> <b>digger</b> can only dig one size hole—a hole with the same diameter as the auger's screw.|$|E
50|$|Commonly {{referred}} to as <b>Post</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>Diggers</b> and Earth Augers, Tractor PTO Augers are implements {{used in conjunction with}} a tractor's Power Take Off drive, and a tractor's 3 point hitch.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Traditional underpinning,' {{the mass}} {{concrete}} underpinning method is nearly 100 years in age, and the protocol has not changed. This underpinning method strengthens an existing structure's foundation by digging boxes by hand underneath and sequentially pouring concrete in a strategic order. The final result {{is basically a}} foundation built underneath the existing foundation. This underpinning method is generally applied when the existing foundation is at a shallow depth, however, the method still works very well even at fifty feet (fifteen meters) deep. The method has not changed since its inception with its use of utilitarian tools such as shovels and <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> <b>diggers.</b> Heavy machinery is not called for in this method due to the tight nature of the boxes being dug. There are several advantages to using this method of underpinning including {{the simplicity of the}} engineering, the low cost of labor to produce the result, and the continuity of the structure's uses during construction.|$|R

50|$|Compact utility {{tractors}} require special, smaller implements than full-sized agricultural tractors. Very common implements {{include the}} box blade, the grader blade, the landscape rake, the <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> <b>digger</b> (or post hole auger), the rotary cutter (slasher or a brush hog), a mid- or rear-mount finish mower, a broadcast seeder, a subsoiler and the rototiller (rotary tiller). In northern climates, a rear-mounted snow blower is very common; some smaller CUT models {{are available with}} front-mounted snow blowers powered by mid-PTO shafts. Implement brands outnumbere tractor brands, so CUT owners have {{a wide selection of}} implements.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of post hole diggers. The pictured type is jabbed into {{the ground in the}} open position until the blades are buried. At that point the handles are pulled apart to close the tool and grab the chunk of soil loosened. They are then pulled out of the ground with the chunk of soil. The process is repeated until the hole is deep enough, or until the hole is so deep and narrow that the handles can no longer be pulled apart fully. This is one of the weaknesses of this kind of <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> <b>digger.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} clearly {{stratified}} with well preserved <b>post</b> <b>holes,</b> stone hearths, and storage pits. Several <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> {{arranged in a}} circle or oval suggest the existence of more houses and structures.|$|R

5000|$|Most of the 168 <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> held wooden <b>posts,</b> {{although}} Cunnington {{found evidence}} that a pair of standing stones may have been placed between {{the second and third}} <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> rings. Excavations in 2006 indicated that there were at least five standing stones on the site, arranged in a [...] "cove". The deepest <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> measured up to 2 m - and are believed to have held posts which reached as high as 7.5 m above ground. Those posts would have weighed up to 5 tons, and their arrangement was {{similar to that of the}} bluestones at Stonehenge. The positions of the postholes are currently marked with modern concrete posts - a simple and informative method of displaying the site.|$|R

50|$|An auger {{used for}} digging <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> is called an 'earth auger', 'handheld power earth drill', 'soil auger', or 'mechanized <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> digger'. This kind of auger {{can be a}} {{manually}} turned, handheld device, or powered by an electric motor or internal-combustion engine, possibly attached to a tractor (being provided with power by the tractor engine's power take-off as shown). Handheld augers {{can also be used}} for making holes for garden planting.|$|R
50|$|Three {{parallel}} rows of <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> {{indicated a}} rectangular structure 23.5 m by 5 m, probably a timber hall {{similar to the}} Neolithic long house found at Balbridie. Smaller <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> and stake holes define eight to twelve round or oval structures, possibly round houses, as well as six gully-defined structures with numerous stake-holes. A large oval feature, approximately 1.8 m by 1.2 m, contained heavily retired pottery shards and is thought {{likely to have been}} a kiln. Possible ritualistic landscape features include a massive post-pit and <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> or pits forming arcs. At the west edge of the site, adjacent to Station Brae, part of a probable palisade was found. Medieval finds included a trackway, ditches, pits and remains of numerous structures including kilns and a 4 m diameter wattle and daub walled granary.|$|R
50|$|The dig site {{consists}} {{of large numbers}} of pits and <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> whose associated material has been subdivided typologically into five phases.|$|R
50|$|Four of {{the halls}} are simple, {{rectangular}} areas which {{are defined by}} their single row of <b>post</b> <b>holes.</b> Another, Hall No. 2, was {{more complex than the}} others, having an internal division and double post-holes along the length. No. 7 was also different because it was built from a sleeper beam and larger <b>post</b> <b>holes,</b> while Hall No. 5 cannot be clearly defined because it lay in area that had seen multiple features rebuilt on top of it.|$|R
50|$|Excavations {{carried out}} under Denis Grant King, from 1959 onwards, turned over some good {{examples}} of Iron Age drystone walling, and found remains of a much earlier structure that existed at the north east entrance, indicated by drystone revetments within the northern rampart. In a second stage the entrance was remodelled and widened. At the north west entrance, four staggered <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> were uncovered {{as well as a}} cylindrical cavity 0.66m deep, interpreted as a gate <b>post</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|R

50|$|There is some {{evidence}} to support the treaty hypothesis, based on the grave finds of the period. For example, the excavation of one of the cemeteries, at Rookery Hill at Bishopstone, East Sussex, yielded late Roman or insular Roman metalwork including a Quoit Brooch Style buckle, which would indicate settlement here to the early 5th century.Subsequent excavations revealed a considerable area of Saxon buildings. Of the 22 buildings excavated three were sunken huts, 17 are rectangular founded on individual <b>post</b> <b>holes,</b> one is represented by <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> between which are beam slots, and one by eight single large posts.|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} of phases A and B (8200-7500 BC, calibrated) is characterised by circular wattle and daub structures, with <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> {{cut into the}} bedrock. Some deep pits may have served as wells.|$|R

25|$|Previous {{work has}} been largely on the bateyes rather than the spaces between where ethnohistoric sources suggest houses may have stood. Careful {{excavation}} in these places may reveal <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> and hut foundations, as well as refuse disposal areas.|$|R
50|$|Post church (Norwegian: stolpekirke) is a {{term for}} a church {{building}} which predates the stave churches and differ in that the corner posts do not reside on a sill but instead have posts dug into the earth. Posts are the vertical, roof-bearing timbers that {{were placed in the}} excavated <b>post</b> <b>holes.</b> <b>Posts</b> were often placed in trenches filled with stone, but were still susceptible to decay.|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} summarizes {{the results of}} the archaeological excavations carried out between December 2004 and March 2005 in an archaeological settlement El Morrillo, Matanzas, Cuba. The community who lived in this settlement was one engaged in agricultural and ceramic practices. The historical references on the construction methods of houses practiced by the aboriginal groups which peopled the Antilles during the conquest are analyzed. Initial considerations about the presence of a housing structure are offered due to the discovery of various <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> excavated in the structural rock. This discovery is the first report of <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> excavated in the structural rock in Cuba. Equally these finds are compared with others in the Caribbean area...|$|R
60|$|As I said, I looked around, {{and behind}} me found a heavy spade the {{gardener}} had {{at one time}} or another used for digging <b>post</b> <b>holes.</b> It was a strong and sharp implement, and I took it up with a good deal of satisfaction.|$|R
