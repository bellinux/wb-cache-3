5|$|Words {{with three}} or more syllables, {{if they are not}} compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are {{nonetheless}} adapted to Khmer stress patterns. <b>Primary</b> <b>stress</b> falls on the final syllable, with secondary stress on every second syllable from the end. Thus in a three-syllable word, the first syllable has secondary stress; in a four-syllable word, the second syllable has secondary stress; in a five-syllable word, the first and third syllables have secondary stress, and so on. Long polysyllables are not often used in conversation.|$|E
25|$|Words of one, two, {{or three}} {{syllable}}s have <b>primary</b> <b>stress</b> {{on the first}} syllable. In words of more than three syllables, the first syllable receives a <b>primary</b> <b>stress</b> while every syllable after receives a secondary stress, unless there was an enclitic present, which normally took the <b>primary</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|E
25|$|In disyllabic words {{a strong}} {{penultimate}} syllable receives <b>primary</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|E

The results of this investigation are presented and compared with similar results obtained with porous sintered metal compacts. A much wider range of permeabilities is obtainable with the wire cloth than with the porous metal compacts considered and the ultimate tensile strength {{in the direction of}} the <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> for porous materials produced from three mesh sizes of wire cloth are from two to three times the ultimate tensile strengths of the porous metal compacts...|$|R
50|$|According to Shorto (1960), /ə/ {{does not}} occur alone in <b>primary</b> <b>stressed</b> syllable, but only in an {{unstressed}} syllable or as the second member of a diphthong. There are also {{a large number of}} diphthongs, including /eo/, /eə/, /aə/, /ɔə/, /oə/, /uə/, and /iə/.|$|R
25|$|The Sama-Bajau {{languages}} {{were once}} classified under the Central Philippine languages of the Malayo-Polynesian geographic {{group of the}} Austronesian language family. But due to marked differences with neighbouring languages, they were moved to a separate branch altogether from all other Philippine languages. For example, Sinama pronunciation is quite distinct from other nearby Central Philippine languages like Tausūg and Tagalog. Instead of the <b>primary</b> <b>stress</b> being usually on the final syllable; the <b>primary</b> <b>stress</b> occurs on the second-to-the-last syllable of the word in Sinama. This placement of the <b>primary</b> <b>stress</b> is similar to Manobo and other languages of the predominantly animistic ethnic groups of Mindanao, the Lumad peoples.|$|E
25|$|The {{placement}} of <b>primary</b> <b>stress</b> is lexical in Ilocano. This results in minimal pairs such as /ˈkaː.yo/ (wood) and /ka.ˈyo/ (you (plural or polite)) or /ˈkiː.ta/ (class, type, kind) and /ki.ˈta/ (see). In written Ilokano the reader {{must rely on}} context, thus ⟨kayo⟩ and ⟨kita⟩. <b>Primary</b> <b>stress</b> can fall only on either the penult or the ultima of the root, {{as seen in the}} previous examples.|$|E

50|$|<b>Primary</b> word <b>stress</b> in Lardil {{falls on}} the initial syllable, and <b>primary</b> phrase <b>stress</b> on the final word in the phrase. These stress rules have some exceptions, notably {{compounds}} containing tangka ‘man’ as a head noun modified by a demonstrative or another nominal; these expressions, and other compound phrases, have phrase-initial stress.|$|R
25|$|The first {{syllable}} of {{any word}} {{is always the}} <b>primary</b> <b>stressed</b> syllable in Skolt Sami as Skolt is a fixed-stress language. In words with two or more syllables, the final syllable is quite lightly stressed (tertiary stress) and the remaining syllable, if any, are stressed more heavily than the final syllable, but less than the first syllable (secondary stress).|$|R
25|$|Enclitics {{were also}} used often in Timucua. Unlike suffixes and prefixes, they were not {{required}} to fill a specific slot, and enclitics usually bore the <b>primary</b> <b>stress</b> of a word.|$|E
25|$|As <b>primary</b> <b>stress</b> {{can fall}} {{only on the}} penult or the ultima, suffixation causes a shift in stress one {{syllable}} to the right. The vowel of open penults that result lengthen as a consequence.|$|E
25|$|Descriptive {{adjectives}} {{follow the}} noun. When they occur they also typically receive the <b>primary</b> <b>stress</b> of the phrase, causing the noun {{to lose some}} phonation features. Note {{the loss of the}} breathy feature on the word /beʰnː/ in the following example.|$|E
5000|$|A simple rule is {{that the}} {{insertion}} occurs at a syllable boundary, usually just before the <b>primary</b> <b>stressed</b> syllable. [...] Thus, one hears abso-fuckin'-lutely rather than *ab-fuckin'-solutely. This rule is insufficient to describe examples such as un-fuckin'-believable, however, so modifications to this rule are proposed such as morpheme boundaries taking precedence over stress. Counterexamples to this exception do exist: unbe-fuckin'-lievable.|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} vessel {{is one of}} a large number of plant components for which stress analyses must be performed. A {{pressure vessel}} experiences mainly two types of <b>stresses,</b> <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> and secondary <b>stresses.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>stresses</b> are because of pressure inside pressure vessel and secondary stresses are because of thermal loading. Thermal loading is considerable in a pressure vessel which handles hot fluid. Typically liquid metal reactors (LMR) have thermo-mechanical loadings. Analytically, induced stresses are calculated using pressure vessel theory or ASME codes. In this project induced stresses are calculated using ANSYS coupled field analysis for thermo-mechanical loading. The results are then compared with analytical results. This work demonstrates usage of commercial FEA tool over analytical approach. Analytical solutions such as ASME and Japanese Code give empirical relationships to calculate thermal stress. Use of FEA tools is not very popular in pressure vessel industries. FEA of this kind of loading requires coupled field analysis. In the work ANSYS is used to perform coupled field analysis...|$|R

25|$|Lexical stress, {{coupled with}} glottalization, is a {{distinctive}} feature in Tagalog. <b>Primary</b> <b>stress</b> normally occurs {{on either the}} final or the penultimate syllable of a word.

25|$|Stress is phonemic in Kapampangan. <b>Primary</b> <b>stress</b> {{occurs on}} either the last or the {{next-to-last}} syllable of a word. Vowel lengthening accompanies primary or secondary stress except when stress occurs {{at the end of}} a word. Stress shift can occur and it may shift to the right or the left to differentiate between nominal or verbal use, as in the following examples.|$|E
25|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>stress</b> {{may fall}} {{on any of}} the three final syllables of a word, but mostly on the last two. There is a partial {{correlation}} between the position of the stress and the final vowel; for example, the final syllable is usually stressed when it contains a nasal phoneme, a diphthong, or a close vowel. The orthography of Portuguese takes advantage of this correlation to minimize the number of diacritics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Masonry is {{a complex}} {{multicomponent}} composite consisting of dissimilar materials (brick / stone and mortar). Masonry deformation process under loading depends on the mechanical characteristics of the basic composite materials, {{as well as of}} the parameters of the elements defining binding between brick and mortar being the interface elements. Traditional methods of masonry modeling are based on the use of generalized ("effective") mechanical properties of the composite as a continuant homogeneous continuant medium. This paper presents an overview and analysis of continuant masonry models adequately reflecting the process of elastic, and in some cases elastic-plastic masonry deformation within the composition of stone structural elements. The paper provides analysis of the experimental research results of masonry behaviour in a biaxial <b>stress</b> state at <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> of opposite signs; identifies masonry destruction mechanisms complying with the conditions of stress state. The work demonstrates the key role played by interface elements in the formation of masonry destruction processes. Based on destruction mechanisms deduced from experiments, there was developed a discrete model of masonry. A system of masonry strength criteria was proposed corresponding to the biaxial stress state conditions at <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> of opposite signs. For purposes of studying the elastic-plastic deformation and destruction of masonry...|$|R

30|$|We {{therefore}} subdivided phase II {{into three}} subphases {{on the basis}} of the stress ratio: phases IIa, IIb, and IIc, which have high (Φ[*]=[*]~ 0.8), intermediate (Φ[*]=[*]~ 0.6), and low (Φ[*]=[*]~ 0.3) stress ratios, respectively (Fig.  7). Phase IIa underwent an axial tension with σ 1 [*]≈[*]σ 2 (=σv)[*]>[*]σ 3, where σv is the overburden pressure, whereas phase IIc underwent an axial compression with σ 1 [*]>[*]σ 2 (=σv)[*]≈[*]σ 3. Therefore, the increase in Φ represents the increase in σhmax during phase II. We interpreted that stresses F, D, and C must be the <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> of phases IIa, IIb, and IIc, respectively, to ensure a consistent relationship between σv and σhmax.|$|R
