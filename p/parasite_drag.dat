40|$|A parasitological {{study of}} Ponto-Caspian gobies, {{including}} the monkey goby Neogobius fluviatilis, racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus and tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris, carried out {{over four years}} in the lower Vistula River is described. These fish species represent one of the most impressive invasions of European inland waters, connected with the spontaneous, east-to-west intracontinental movement observed in the last two decades. The parasite community consisted of 24 taxa. Typical for racer goby were: Trichodina domerguei, Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, Gyrodactylus proterorhini and glochidia of unionids. The list of parasites typical for monkey goby is supplemented with: Tylodelphys clavata (met.) and Eimeria sp., while the glochidia were rarely detected in this fish host. Holostephanus spp., Apatemon gracilis, Diplostomum gobiorum and glochidia predominated in parasite fauna of tubenose goby. Unlike the other species tested, P. semilunaris was poorly infected with T. domerguei and G. proterorhini. Parasites commonly distributed through native fishes in the observed area prevailed in gobies. Species rare in natives were also numerously represented. In this way, alien fish reinforce populations of those parasites in invaded waters. <b>Parasites</b> <b>dragged</b> to the colonized area (G. proterorhini, Holostephanus spp., A. gracilis and D. gobiorum) complement the community.

40|$|A {{flight test}} method is {{described}} from which propulsive efficiency {{as well as}} <b>parasite</b> and induced <b>drag</b> coefficients can be directly determined using relatively simple instrumentation and analysis techniques. The method uses information contained in the transient response in airspeed for a small power change in level flight {{in addition to the}} usual measurement of power required for level flight. Measurements of pitch angle and longitudinal and normal acceleration are eliminated. The theoretical basis for the method, the analytical techniques used, and the results of application of the method to flight test data are presented...|$|R
40|$|This note {{draws upon}} {{ecological}} models {{to describe the}} structure and equilibrium conditions of a generalized economic canopy consisting of three interactive economies assumed to be in competitive epiphytic, parasitic, and host relationships to each other. The maintained hypothesis is that generally (a) <b>parasites</b> are a <b>drag</b> on their hosts, (b) epiphytes interfere with normal functioning of both parasites and hosts, and (c) hosts must support their own performance {{as well as the}} survival of epiphytes and parasites. The results show that hosts must perform twice as better to support the other competitors, and question the notion that individual economies fend for themselves. The challenge is firmly grounded in ample real-life evidence; for example, primary sectors have historically supported economic growth of nations, especially {{in the early stages of}} development. In some cases, primary sectors transform themselves and other sectors, as in the lumber industry giving birth to Nokia, and thereby transforming both Finland and the world. In other cases the emergence of tertiary sectors consisting mainly of governments (parasites) has diminished the performance of other sectors and along with them economic growth. The world may be flatter today than it was even a decade ago, but how economies perform remain constrained and/or promoted by individual intra-actions as well as by the interactive dynamics between and among economies. structure economic canopy, specific competition, equilibrium conditions...|$|R
5000|$|It can {{be shown}} that two main drivers of maximum {{lift-to-drag}} ratio for a fixed wing aircraft are wingspan and total wetted area. One method for estimating the zero-lift drag coefficient of an aircraft is the equivalent skin-friction method. For a well designed aircraft, zero-lift drag (or <b>parasite</b> <b>drag)</b> is mostly made up of skin friction drag plus {{a small percentage of}} pressure drag caused by flow separation.

5000|$|Cyclorotor blades require support {{structure}} for their positioning {{parallel to the}} rotor axis of rotation. This structure, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "spokes," [...] adds to the <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> and weight of the rotor. Cyclorotor blades are also centrifugally loaded in bending (as opposed to the axial loading on propellers), which requires blades with an extremely high strength to weight ratio or intermediate blade support spokes.

5000|$|For {{outright}} performance, {{they used}} as small a wing as reasonable, thereby lowering <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> (at {{the expense of}} greater lift-induced drag). Normally this would make the plane have [...] "impossibly high" [...] landing speeds, but this was offset {{by the use of}} a huge travelling flap and leading edge slats for high low-speed lift. When the flaps were extended, the upper portion of the ailerons would remain in place while the lower portion extended rearward, essentially increasing the wing area.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of lift and thrust generation by flying animals are studied {{by considering the}} distribution of vorticity in the wake. As wake generation is not continuous, the momentum jet theory, which has previously been used, is not satisfactory, and the vortex theory is a more realistic model. The vorticity shed by the wings {{in the course of}} each powered stroke deforms into a small-cored vortex ring; the wake is a chain of such rings. The momentum of each ring sustains and propels the animal; induced power is calculated as the rate of increase of wake kinetic energy. A further advantage of the vortex theory is that lift and induced drag coefficients are not required; estimated instantaneous values of these coefficients are generally too large for steady state aerodynamic theory to be appropriate to natural flapping flight. The vortex theory is applied to hovering of insects and to avian forward flight. A simple expression for induced power in hovering is found. Induced power is always greater than simple momentum jet estimates, and the dis-crepancy becomes substantial as body mass increases. In hovering the wake is composed of a stack of horizontal, coaxial, circular vortex rings. In forward flight of birds the rings are elliptic; they are neither horizontal nor coaxial because the momentum of each ring balances the vector sum of <b>parasite</b> and profile <b>drag</b> and the bird's weight. Total power consumption as a function of flight velocity is calculated and compared for several species. Power reduction {{is one of the major}} factors influencing the choice of flight style. A large body of data is used to obtain an approximate scaling between stroke period and the body mass for birds. Together with relations between other morphological parameters, this is used to estimate the variation of flight speed and power with body mass for birds, and on this basis deviations from allometric scaling can be related to flight proficiency and to the use of such strategies as the bounding flight of small passerines.

50|$|With other {{parameters}} remaining the same, as the lift {{generated by a}} body increases, so does the lift-induced drag. This means that as the wing's angle of attack increases the lift coefficient increases (up to a limit called the stall point) so too does the lift-induced drag. At the onset of stall, lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag, but viscous pressure drag, a component of <b>parasite</b> <b>drag,</b> increases due {{to the formation of}} turbulent unattached flow {{on the surface of the}} body.|$|E

40|$|Signatures are on file in the Graduate School. Applying bird-inspired flight {{planning}} and control techniques to small robotic aircraft can greatly improve flight performance. This paper discusses {{a method for}} improving cruise performance of an uninhabited glider by harvesting energy from short period stochastic phenomena (i. e. gusts). Receding horizon control is used to plan a sequence of control inputs that maximizes an energy-based reward function over a time horizon, using only local knowledge of atmospheric conditions. Parameters of the receding horizon controller and parameters in the reward function are tuned using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting controller is tested using Monte Carlo simulations of flight through Dryden gust fields: results show significant improvement over constant speed flight. Robustness of the receding horizon control approach to changes in aircraft parameters (<b>parasite</b> <b>drag)</b> is also evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations: increasing <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> results in gracefully degrading performance over the nominal condition while decreasing <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> results in increasing performance...|$|E
40|$|Level-flight {{performance}} {{tests were conducted}} on a typical light general aviation single-engine retractable aircraft with partially and fully extended partial-span single-slotted flaps in both gear-up and gear-extended configurations. A parabolic variation in the aircraft equivalent <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> area with flap deflection was observed for both configurations. A linear relation was discovered between the aircraft equivalent <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> area and {{the square of the}} flap deflection angle for both configurations. This result suggests that level-flight {{performance tests}} in the stowed and fully extended flap configurations will yield adequate data for estimating performance for intermediate flap deflections. A similar linear relation was confirmed for an NACA 23012 airfoil equipped with a single-slotted flat using classical NACA wind-tunnel data. The flight tests showed that the aircraft equivalent <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> area increased by a factor of 1. 16 at 10, by 1. 81 at 20, and by 3. 14 at a full flap deflection of 32 in the gear-up configuration.

The allometric equation based on waterfowl/raptors underestimates the frontal area compared to the passerine equation presented here. Consequently, revising the actual frontal areas of small birds will concomitantly change {{the values of the}} <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient.

An investigation was made of the influence of various factors and design parameters on the takeoff performance of a hypothetical large flying boat by means of takeoff calculations. The parameters varied in the calculations were size of hull (load coefficient), wing setting, trim, deflection of flap, wing loading, aspect ratio, and <b>parasite</b> <b>drag.</b> The takeoff times and distances were calculated to the stalling speeds and the performance above these speeds was studied separately to determine piloting technique for optimum takeoff.

40|$|The {{practical}} application of real-time performance optimization is addressed (using a wide-body transport simulation) based on real-time measurements and calculation of incremental drag from forced response maneuvers. Various controller combinations can be envisioned although {{this study used}} symmetric outboard aileron and stabilizer.

Thrust is estimated from a representative engine model as a function of measured variables. The lift and drag equations are then used to calculate lift and drag coefficients. An expression for drag coefficient, which is a function of <b>parasite</b> <b>drag,</b> induced drag, and aileron drag, is solved from forced excitation response data.

It was found that, for the range of pitch angles − 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg− 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg, the skids added 80 % to the drag of the bare fuselage, whereas the tailplane increased the drag by 20 %.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{effect of the}} furled avian tail on the <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> of a bird's body was investigated on mounted, frozen European starling Sturnus vulgaris in a wind tunnel at flight speeds between 6 and 14 m s(- 1). Removal of tail rectrices and dorsal and ventral covert feathers {{at the base of}} the tail increased the total <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> of the body and tail by between 25 and 55 %. Flow visualization and measurements of dynamic pressure in the tail boundary layer showed that in the intact bird a separation bubble forms on the ventral side of the body, and reattaches to the ventral side of the tail. This bubble is a consequence of the morphology of the body, with a rapid contraction posterior to the pelvis and hind legs. The tail and the covert feathers at its base act as a combined splitter plate and wedge to control vortex shedding and body wake development, and thereby are important to minimize drag. This hitherto unsuspected mechanism is central to understanding the morphology of the avian body, and may have had a significant influence on the evolution of avian tail morphology by pre-adapting the tail for radiation and specialization as an aerodynamic lifting structure and as an organ of communication in sexual selection...|$|E

40|$|Gliding flight {{performance}} and wake topology {{of a common}} swift (Apus apus L.) were examined in a wind tunnel at speeds between 7 and 11 m s(- 1). The tunnel was tilted to simulate descending flight at different sink speeds. The swift varied its wingspan, wing area and tail span over the speed range. Wingspan decreased linearly with speed, whereas tail span decreased in a nonlinear manner. For each airspeed, the minimum glide angle was found. The corresponding sink speeds showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a minimum sink speed at 8. 1 m s(- 1) and a speed of best glide at 9. 4 m s(- 1). Lift-to-drag ratio was calculated for each airspeed and tilt angle combinations and the maximum for each speed showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a maximum of 12. 5 at an airspeed of 9. 5 m s(- 1). Wake was sampled in the transverse plane using stereo digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The main structures of the wake were a pair of trailing wingtip vortices {{and a pair of}} trailing tail vortices. Circulation of these was measured and a model was constructed that showed good weight support. <b>Parasite</b> <b>drag</b> was estimated from the wake defect measured in the wake behind the body. <b>Parasite</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient ranged from 0. 30 to 0. 22 over the range of airspeeds.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} rotor performance, trailing-edge {{deflections}} and actuation requirement {{of a helicopter}} rotor with trailing-edge flap for primary flight control. The swashplateless design is implemented by modifying a two-bladed teetering rotor of an ultralight helicopter {{through the use of}} plain flaps on the blades, and by replacing the pitch link. A comprehensive rotorcraft analysis based on UMARC is carried out to obtain the results for both the swashplateless and a conventional baseline rotor configuration. The predictions show the swashplateless configuration achieves better performance than the conventional rotor, because of the reduction of <b>parasite</b> <b>drag</b> resulting from eliminating the swashplate mechanical system. The optimal selection of blade pitch index angle, flap location, length, and chord ratio reduces flap deflections and actuation requirements, with virtually no effect on rotor performance...|$|E
40|$|Frogs swim by kicking water {{backwards}} with a synchronised {{extension of}} their hind limbs (Gray, 1968).

The sensitivity trends for range and final climb altitude were very similar. The sensitivity trends for stored energy were reversed from those for range, except for decreasing microwave beam density.

The results indicate that hub fairings with a circular-arc upper surface and a flat lower surface yield maximum hub drag reduction; and clearance between the hub fairing and pylon induces high mutual-interference drag and diminishes the drag-reduction benefit obtained using a hub fairing with a flat lower surface.
