500|$|Several of {{the scenes}} {{were based on the}} actor's real-life talents as well as improvised. When Michael tells Pam to [...] "write this down", Jenna Fischer's {{response}} to the camera was improvised. [...] "I thought it was funny that I didn't have a <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> but Michael was telling me to take notes," [...] she explained in her MySpace blog, [...] "so I just looked to the camera and showed my lack of pen and paper." [...] Jim's impression of Stanley in this episode was inspired by John Krasinski's actual talent of doing impressions on the set.|$|E
500|$|In a {{multiple}} fight situation the linesmen will normally break up fights together, one fight {{at a time}} using the same procedures for a single fight. The linesmen will {{communicate with each other}} which fight to break up. In {{a multiple}} fight situation the referee will stand in an area of the ice where he/she can have a full view of all the players and will write down—on a <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> commonly known as a [...] "riot pad"—the numbers of the players that are involved in the fights, watching for situations that warrant additional penalties, such as players removing opponents' helmets, players participating in a second fight, players leaving a bench to participate in a fight, or third players into a fight. The referee will not normally break up a fight unless the linesmen need assistance, or a fight is occurring where a player has gained a significant advantage over the other player, leading to concerns of significant injury.|$|E

2500|$|The note demanded $118,000, {{the rounded}} amount of John Ramsey's bonus that year. Fitzgerald {{said that the}} note was not written by a {{kidnapper}} or a [...] "real criminal", but someone who had written the note on a <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> used by Patsy Ramsey in their home. The note was unusually long, most ransom notes are 50 to 60 words. It took the experts 21 minutes or more to copy the ransom note and it noted {{that it would take}} more time to think about what to write. The pen and paper were not left out, but returned to their rightful place by the note's author. Many lines from the letter were taken from Speed, [...] Dirty Harry and other films.|$|E

Throughout the summer, regular workshops are held to discuss community building, urban improvement, sustainable agriculture, and {{a wide variety of}} other related topics. Activities are designed to engage participants in discourse centered around particular themes. Educators are often recruited to lead these activities, which can include brainstorming, group discussion and journal writing. Flip charts, or large <b>pads</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> mounted on easels, have become notoriously ubiquitous within the organization as a tool for these group discussions.|$|R

6000|$|I {{proceed to}} show that the Homeric corslet did not avail against a spear at close quarters, but could turn an arrow point (once), and could {{sometimes}} turn a spear which had perforated a shield. So far, and not further, the Homeric corslet was serviceable. But if a warrior's breast or back was not covered by the shield, and received a thrust at close quarters, the corslet was pierced more easily than the <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> which was said to have been used as secret armour in a duel by the Master of Sinclair (1708). [Footnote: Proceedings in Court Marshal held upon John, Master of Sinclair. Sir Walter Scott. Roxburghe Club. (Date of event, 1708.)] It is desirable to prove this feebleness of the corslet, because the poet often says that a man was smitten with the spear in breast or back when unprotected by the shield, without mentioning the corslet, whence it is argued by the critics that corslets were not worn when the original lays were fashioned, and that they have only been sporadically introduced, in an after age when the corslet was universal, by [...] "modernising" [...] later rhapsodists aiming at the up-to-date.|$|E

25|$|The game of Battleship {{is thought}} to have its origins in the French game L'Attaque played during World War I, {{although}} parallels have also been drawn to E. I. Horseman's 1890 game Baslinda, and the game {{is said to have been}} played by Russian officers before World War I. The first commercial version of the game was Salvo, published in 1931 in the United States by the Starex company. Other versions of the game were printed in the 1930s and 1940s, including the Strathmore Company's Combat: The Battleship Game, Milton Bradley's Broadsides: A Game of Naval Strategy and Maurice L. Freedman's Warfare Naval Combat. Strategy Games Co. produced a version called Wings which pictured planes flying over the Los Angeles Coliseum. All of these early editions of the game consisted <b>of</b> pre-printed <b>pads</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|R
50|$|Whitaker's first {{interest}} in art came around age four {{as he watched}} his father sculpt and paint. When his father bought him a <b>pad</b> <b>of</b> blank <b>paper,</b> he began to fill up the pages with scribbles and stick figures, and soon had filled reams <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> He continued his enjoyment in art as he began school. His interest began to expand as he attended grade school, when he began acting classes, which he continued into college. He attended the University of Oklahoma, and later California Institute of the Arts (Cal-Arts). After attending Cal-Arts, he immediately began working at Warner Bros. Animation on Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toons, soon moving onto feature films as well.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1990, Landers {{began to}} use writing as a visual media and {{exhibited}} a body of hand-written work titled Art, Life and God, featuring an alter-ego named Chris Hamson, an amalgam of Landers and his artist friends. Written on yellow legal <b>pads</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> partly in screenplay format and partly as exemplar writing in which Hamson is the “author/artist”, the work gives voice {{to the inside of}} the artist’s head as it takes the viewer into the world of a young struggling artist in New York City. With each scene Landers weaves a tightly knit world where fact and fiction are blurred, and the intensely personal is obscured by the persona of Chris Hamson. Landers has said, “When I saw the magnetism of the writing, it became the material with which I could work.” With its roots planted firmly in the performative, which has remained at the core of his artistic practice ever since, Landers chose to make his life, and the actual act of making the work, the subject of his work. Much of this body of work is compiled in an artist book titled Art, Life and God, published in 2009 by Glenn Horowitz Bookseller.|$|R

40|$|Sebum {{production}} was measured on 2 symmetrically placed {{areas on the}} flanks of rats over alternating periods of 18 and 6 hr for 4 days, by absorbing the lipid on <b>pads</b> <b>of</b> cigarette <b>paper</b> {{held in place by}} a specially designed harness. Castrated rats receiving testosterone produced about twice as much sebum as untreated littermate controls. Once daily application of ethanol to one flank significantly reduced sebum production, in comparison with the other flank in testosterone-treated but not in untreated rats. Daily application of 5 mg cyproterone acetate in ethanol to one flank in a third group of rats significantly reduced sebum production in comparison with that of the other flank treated with vehicle only. The effects became significant within 24 hr. It seems likely that the sebaceous glands received the topically applied materials by way of the pilo-sebaceous orifices rather than by transepidermal absorption. The results demonstrate that one action of cyproterone acetate is at the target site and suggest that the anti-androgen may be effective when applied topically. The method could prove useful in assessing the local action on sebaceous activity of topically applied substances...|$|R

40|$|Estradiol in ethanol {{was applied}} once daily to one flank of intact male rats and sebum {{production}} on both flanks was measured over periods of 18 h alternating with 6 h by absorbing the lipid on <b>pads</b> <b>of</b> cigarette <b>paper</b> {{held in place}} by a harness, starting on the 15 th day. Sebum production was very significantly less on the treated flanks than on the contralateral flanks that received only vehicle, indicating an unequivocal local effect of the estradiol. At the same time, the values on the contralateral flanks were significantly below those of littermate rats which received vehicle only, indicating that the estrogen had been systemically absorbed to produce a distal action. The estradiol also significantly reduced plasma testosterone and the relative weights of the seminal vesicles, ventral prostate, and preputial glands, which demonstrated that part of the general action of the estrogen could have been by suppression of endogenous androgen production. In short-term experiments, in which measurements were started concurrently with treatment, the inhibitory action of estradiol, in contrast to that of cyproterone acetate, was not detected until the 4 th day. Indeed, it appeared probable that the estrogen actually stimulated sebum secretion over the first 2 days, suggesting that it had a biphasic effect...|$|R
