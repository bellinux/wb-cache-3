50|$|The Society of Ornamental Turners {{was founded}} in 1948 with the object to encourage, develop and promote the study and {{practice}} of the art and science of ornamental turning. Its members meet quarterly in London to display examples of their work, share their experiences and attend a lecture or demonstration. Seminars and outings to places of interest are also arranged. A bulletin containing articles on all aspects of ornamental turning and news of the society is published half-yearly in March and September and a newsletter in July and December. The society maintains a website: http://the-sot.com which contains much information about this pastime together with a gallery of pictures of ornamentally turned objects. Competitions are held annually for ornamental turning, <b>plain</b> <b>turning,</b> making equipment, displays at meetings, contributions to the bulletin and for advancing {{the knowledge of the}} art.|$|E

5000|$|Ornamental turning {{is a type}} of turning, a {{craft that}} {{involves}} cutting of a work mounted in a lathe. The work can be made of any material that is suitable for being cut in this way, such as wood, bone, ivory or metal. <b>Plain</b> <b>turning</b> is work executed on a lathe where a transverse section through any part of the work comprises a plain circle. Ornamental turning, also called Complex turning, is executed on a lathe with attachments which convert that plain circular section to variants of outline; these range from a simple series of cuts taken at intervals around the work (so producing grooves or bumps on the surface) to non-circular movements whereby the whole of the circular shape is removed to give a completely different form. Such shapes are achieved by various means, the principal ones being: ...|$|E

40|$|Analyzing wear {{mechanisms}} and developments of surface layers in WC/Co-cemented carbide cutting inserts {{is of great}} importance for metal-cutting manufacturing. By knowing relevant processes within the surface layers of cutting tools during machining the choice of machining parameters can be influenced to get less wear and high tool life of the cutting tool. Tool wear obviously influences tool life and surface integrity of the workpiece (residual stresses, surface quality, work hardening, etc.), so the choice of optimised process parameters is of great relevance. Vapour-deposited coatings on WC/Co-cemented carbide cutting inserts are known to improve machining performance and tool life, but the mechanisms behind these improvements are not fully understood. The interaction between commercial TiN-coated and uncoated WC/Co-cemented carbide cutting inserts and a normalised SAE 1045 steel workpiece was investigated during a dry <b>plain</b> <b>turning</b> operation with constant material removal under varied machining parameters. Tool wear was assessed by light-optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and EDX analysis. The state of surface layer was investigated by metallographic sectioning. Microstructural changes and material transfer due to tribological processes in the cutting zone were examined by SEM and EDX analyses...|$|E

40|$|High {{usage of}} {{hardened}} steel in the automotive, gear, bearing, tool and die making industries, {{makes it a}} highly suitable material for industrial production and research. This study was undertaken to investigate the performance of coated ceramic insert with different edge preparations in terms of cutting force and surface roughness. <b>Plain</b> <b>turning</b> experiments were carried out under dry cutting condition at two different cutting speeds and feed rates with a constant depth of cut. The workpiece material is ASSAB DF- 3 hardened steel with a 55 ± 1 HRC hardness. Results showed that insert edge preparation had a direct influence on the radial and feed forces {{but not on the}} tangential force. The use of T-land edge preparation results in the lowest radial and feed forces. In terms of surface finish, the use of honed with finishing wiper insert results in obtaining the lowest surface roughness values. Feed rate had a significant effect on surface roughness whereby by increasing feed rate, the surface roughness value also increased, whereas the effect of cutting speed was found to be insignificant. Increasing cutting speed resulted in lower feed and tangential forces however by increasing feed rate all cutting forces increased...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of MQL {{application}} on the tool wear, surface roughness and chip formation in turning Aluminum alloy 6061 is investigated. Experiments were carried out by <b>plain</b> <b>turning</b> of an Aluminum bar with varying depth of cut, cutting speeds (spindle speed) and cutting environments (Dry, Wet and MQL). A newly designed, cost efficient and portable MQL setup was developed for this study. For each experimental trial, five passes were carried out {{in order to promote}} the formation of tool wear. After each pass, the tool surface was examined under a microscope and the surface roughness was measured using a stylus based surface tester. The extent of tool wear from each pass is measured by using ImageJ software. Chips were collected after the five passes and were physically examined. The newly designed MQL delivery system was successful in delivering a fine mist of lubricant at the cutting point. MQL lubrication provided lower surface roughness and tool wear values compared to wet and dry conditions due to effective temperature reduction and improved lubrication penetration of cutting zones, as well as better chip flushing. Chip formed under MQL conditions had reduced chip thickness due to reduced temperatures. MQL was found to have the greatest positive impact on tool wear and surface roughness parameters based on ANOVA results...|$|E

50|$|After 1934 Prokofiev coordinated a {{new project}} - USSR-3. At 157,000 cubic meters volume and nearly 130 meters tall in launch configuration, hydrogen-filled USSR-3 {{would have been the}} second largest Soviet balloon after the failed USSR-2. Launching a balloon of this size from Russian <b>plains</b> <b>turned</b> out to be a futile race against weather, as even a slight wind {{prevented}} safe deployment of the gigantic gas bag. American balloonists solved the wind challenge by launching from deep canyons (Stratobowl) or mining pits (Crosby, Minnesota) while Soviet Air Forces relied on the single airfield in Moscow suburbs. To alleviate the problem, Prokofiev designed the double launch sequence. Prior to launch, the balloon was pulled down to the gondola with temporary ropes wound around permanent suspension cables, halving the balloon's height. These ropes were designed to untangle and release the full length of suspension cables shortly after launch. The first test of Prokofiev's invention on a small 900 cubic meters balloon ended in the death of test pilot. Prokofiev prepared a second attempt (on a larger aircraft) and safely tested it himself. Later experience demonstrated that the system remained unsafe.|$|R
