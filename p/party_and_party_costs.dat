Scholars have long touted the importance of political <b>parties</b> <b>and</b> stable <b>party</b> system for new democracies, which {{are in the process}} of consolidating their regimes. Robert Dix writes that ?institutionalization of <b>parties</b> <b>and</b> <b>party</b> systems is crucial in the maintenance of the tenuous new democracies. ? (1992, p. 490). Recently, anti-system politicians have been on the rise, political parties have been heavily attacked and associated with ?old politics? <b>and</b> <b>party</b> fragmentation has increased. Scholars have asked whether or not you can have democracy without political parties. This paper focuses on how important parties are to functioning democracies, and also highlights the importance of stable party systems to new democracies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the place of}} political <b>parties</b> <b>and</b> <b>party</b> systems in providing democracy for the more global world of the twenty-first century. It argues that recent intense globalisation has by no means rendered poilitical <b>parties</b> <b>and</b> <b>party</b> systems irrelevant. However, political parties have lost substantial democratic impact by failing {{to move on with}} today's more global times. Parties could regain considerable stature as democratic forces if they altered a number of practices in line with emergent polycentric governance of a more global world. The paper advances a number of suggestions that could concurrently address the general stagnancy of political <b>parties</b> <b>and</b> the overall underdevelopment of global democracy...|$|R

Dr Reilly notes that recent initiatives for political engineering have occurred in the developing world and have favoured a centripetal rather than consociational approach. As many of these countries are new democracies with ethnically plural societies, they face the difficult task of consolidating democracy {{at the same time as}} managing the politicisation of ethnicity...|$|R
