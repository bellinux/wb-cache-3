40|$|The {{intradermal}} injection into rabbits {{of various}} phagocytosible materials {{is known to}} induce <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocyte</b> infiltration, protein exudation and microvascular haemorrhage. The injection of rabbit plasma, in which complement is activated with zymosan, also induces <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocyte</b> infiltration. We investigated {{the effect of this}} soluble, non-ingestible stimulus to <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocyte</b> accumulation on vascular integrity. Vascular permeability, measured with 125 I-human serum albumin, was markedly but only transiently increased 1 hr after zymosan-activated plasma injection. In contrast, haemorrhage or red blood cell extravasation, measured with 59 Fe-labelled red cells, developed only 4 hr after zymosan-activated plasma injection and continued for at least 10 hr. A direct correlation was found between the number of infiltrating polymorphonuclear leucocytes as measured with 51 Cr-labelled leucocytes, and the degree of haemorrhage. Histological sections confirmed these changes. Plasma that was heat-inactivated (56 degrees C, 30 min) or made functionally C 5 -deficient prior to zymosan activation, failed to induce haemorrhage and caused no, or only mild, leucocyte infiltration. It is postulated that the C 5 ades arg in zymosan-activated plasma not only induces <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocyte</b> infiltration but also, directly or indirectly, causes microvascular damage...|$|E

Enhancement of adherence occurred at optimal concentrations of 100 - 1, 000 IU/ml. There was synergism between alpha and gamma interferons, but not between two subtypes of alpha interferon, on augmentation of adherence, indicating that alpha and gamma interferons act on different receptors on the <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocyte.</b> Heat treatment at 65 Â°C for 30 min abolished the effect of interferon on adherence...|$|E

The results show that total leucocyte counts were depressed in children with kwashiorkor, and lymphopenia was not infrequent. NBT reduction was normal. Abnormal <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocyte</b> chemotaxis and bactericidal activity, though frequently found in children with kwashiorkor, was shown {{to be dependent on}} infection and not on protein depletion per se. Therefore, apart from some impairment of leucocyte mobilization in the presence of infection, the qualtiy of polymorphonuclear function, as determined by the above techniques, appears to be normal in kwashiorkor...|$|E

Fc gamma R {{expression on}} fresh <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> in whole blood samples and in blood samples incubated {{with or without}} interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) for 48 hours was also studied. The percentage of Fc gamma RIII positive <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> in cord blood (73. 3 %) was significantly lower than that in adult controls (95. 9 %). The mean fluorescence intensity of Fc gamma RIII was significantly increased on cord <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> by the incubation with IFN-gamma. Fresh cord <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> expressed {{only a small amount}} of Fc gamma RI as adult <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes.</b> The percentage of Fc gamma RI positive <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> induced with IFN-gamma was significantly higher in cord blood (62. 3 %) than in adult controls (30. 3 %). It is possible that decreased expression of Fc gamma RIII is a factor in the susceptibility of newborns to infection. High expression of Fc gamma RI stimulated with IFN-gamma in neonates could have a compensatory role against decreased immunological function...|$|R

Whereas the production of superoxide anion (O-. 2) in Crohn's disease patients was almost normal, <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> of untreated Crohn's disease patients showed a significantly deficient production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). In the medically treated Crohn's disease patients, a significant negative correlation was found between H 2 O 2 production by <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> and disease activity. These findings suggest an intrinsic cellular defect in the neutrophils of Crohn's disease patients which, together with the decreased locomotor function of these cells in vivo, might contribute to the pathogenesis of the chronic inflammation and granuloma formation in this disease...|$|R
40|$|Semiquantitative {{analysis}} of lactoferrin deficiency in neutrophil <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> in various haematological and non-haematological disease {{was carried out}} by scoring <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> stained for lactoferrin by the immunoperoxidase method. The staining patterns for lactoferrin were classified into four types (0 -III) based on the intensity of reaction, and the sum of the ratings of 100 <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> was considered as "lactoferrin score" with a possible range of 0 - 300. As a result, significantly low lactoferrin-scores were frequently observed in acute leukaemias and the acute phase of chronic leukaemias. Of 35 cases with leukaemias, lactoferrin-negative <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> (type 0) were observed in the following cases: eight cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia (8 / 14), a case of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (1 / 10) in blast crisis, one of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (1 / 1), one of acute monocytic leukaemia (1 / 2), and a case of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (1 / 2) in a transitional phase to an acute myelomonocytic leukaemia. In two cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia, in which the majority of <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> were negative for lactoferrin, ultrastructural cytochemical study revealed total lack of specific granules in these <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes.</b> This suggests that lactoferrin is localised in the specific granules of neutrophils as has been postulated previously by others...|$|R

40|$|The time {{course of}} <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocyte</b> {{oxidative}} metabolism following membrane stimulation by four different agents was examined using {{the techniques of}} luminol- and lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence. After addition of opsonized zymosan, phorbol myristate acetate or digitonin to polymorphonuclear leucocytes there was a lag period of between 35 and 55 sec {{before the onset of}} chemiluminiscence. In contrast, after addition of the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), the lag period before chemiluminescence was less than 19 sec. Luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was reduced by superoxide dismutase and almost abolished by sodium azide. The inhibitory effect of the latter was less marked when using FMLP. Lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence was inhibited by superoxide dismutase and enhanced by sodium azide. Cytochalasin B reduced zymosan and digitonin stimulated chemiluminescence but increased FMLP stimulated chemiluminescence.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{capacity of}} the glutathione redox cycle and the concentrations of selenium in serum, red blood cells or whole blood, and <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> was evaluated in nine patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and eight healthy controls receiving daily supplementation with 250 micrograms selenomethionine for six months. Serum and whole blood concentrations of selenium and {{the activity of the}} selenium dependent enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were low in the serum, red blood cells, and <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> of patients with RA before selenium supplementation. During supplementation serum and whole blood concentrations of selenium and the activity of GSH-Px in serum and red blood cells of patients with RA and serum GSH-Px in controls increased. Selenium and GSH-Px in <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> were unaffected in patients with RA in contrast with the controls where both were augmented. Glutathione reductase activity in the red blood cells and <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> of patients with RA was low but increased during selenium supplementation. Whole blood concentrations of glutathione were slightly lower in patients with RA than controls and no difference in the content in <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> was found between the groups. The activity in red blood cells of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase was high in patients with RA, indicating sufficient function of the hexose monophosphate pathway. The reduced antioxidant activity of the glutathione redox cycle in patients with severe RA was mainly due to the low availability of selenium. This was further supported by the response to selenium supplementation in serum and red blood cells. In the <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes,</b> however, no biochemical effects of selenium supplementation were seen. This lack of antioxidative response could play a pathogenetic part in inflammation in patients with RA...|$|R

We examined modulation of expression of adhesion molecules (CD 11 b and CD 62 L) on <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> and how this expression is related to serum cytokine concentrations. In 18 patients with Kawasaki disease and 15 control subjects, adhesion molecule expression was determined by two-colour immunofluorescence staining of blood leucocytes and flow cytometry. Eight cytokines and chemokines were also measured. In patients with Kawasaki disease, mean fluorescence intensity for CD 11 b before giving intravenous immunoglobulin {{was significantly higher than}} in normal subjects (P < 0 Â· 005). After intravenous immunoglobulin, mean fluorescence intensity for CD 11 b decreased significantly. With coronary artery lesions present, mean CD 11 b fluorescence intensity was significantly higher than without coronary artery lesions (P= 0 Â· 005 before intravenous immunoglobulin; P = 0 Â· 024 after intravenous immunoglobulin). No differences were seen in CD 62 L expression on <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> between patients with Kawasaki disease and normal subjects. CD 11 b expression on <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> correlated positively with serum interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, percentage of neutrophils among white cells and C-reactive protein. <b>Polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> from patients with Kawasaki disease showed increased CD 11 b expression, which was associated with increased serum cytokines and appeared to be related to coronary artery lesions...|$|R

40|$|A {{considerable}} number of spermatozoa are used in each sow in routine artificial insemination. However, {{within a few hours}} after insemination, many spermatozoa are phagocytosed by <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes.</b> Some aspects of sperm transport in the female genital tract in the sow have been thoroughly investigated, whereas {{little is known about the}} mechanisms involved in the phagocytosis of spermatozoa, or about which spermatozoa (fresh, capacitated or dead) are the most susceptible to ingestion by <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes.</b> In this study, phagocytosis was investigated by use of an in vitro phagocytosis assay. <b>Polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> were challenged with either untreated, cold-shocked or frozen-thawed spermatozoa, or with spermatozoa that had been treated to induce capacitation in vitro. The influence of serum on phagocytosis was also investigated. Treatment of the semen to induce capacitation in vitro considerably reduced the phagocytosis of spermatozoa, whereas crude treatments like cold-shock or freezing and thawing reduced phagocytosis only in the first 15 - 30 min of incubation with <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes.</b> Viable spermatozoa were phagocytosed mainly through a pathway that was independent of complement or other serum components (for example, antibodies).

These findings suggest that SASP and its metabolites play an important role in the inhibition of respiratory bursts. As the potent products of the respiratory burst by <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> are thought to be important inflammatory mediators, suppression of toxic reactive oxygen species generation by these agents may partly explain the therapeutic efficacy of SASP in ulcerative colitis, which is characterised by an acute mucosal inflammation dominated by <b>polymorphonuclear</b> <b>leucocytes</b> accumulation...|$|R
