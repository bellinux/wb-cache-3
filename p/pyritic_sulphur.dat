30|$|The R-squared {{value for}} <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> is 0.0076 for coals and 0.3254 for coal-shales (Figs.  5 i and 6 i). This is in-line {{with the study}} {{reported}} on coal by Singh and Demirbilek (1987). The evaluation of the <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> indicated a positive correlation coefficient for both the coals and coal-shales. This means that as the <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> increases, the oxidation potential of coals and coal-shales {{is more likely to}} increase in general. The scatter plots show that the corresponding spontaneous combustion liability values display a wide variation. The value for coals have a very weak effect size, while coal-shales have a moderate effect size. The linear regression analysis was quite similar to those obtained from the total sulphur content data.|$|E
30|$|In addition, it is {{reported}} that General Electric Company (GE) invented a method of microwave desulfurization for coal, where the coal is pulverized into a particle size between 150 and 590  μm, mixed with caustic sodium solution, dehydrated to some extent and exposed to microwave irradiation for 30 – 60  s under the atmosphere of nitrogen. The <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> and organic sulphur in coal convert into water-soluble sulphide and are removed by washing. In the laboratory test, double irradiations, washings and repeated steps can remove 90  % of the <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> and 50  %– 70  % of the organic sulphur. The heating value of coal hardly varies. The process for each microwave treatment is: the coal is mixed with caustic alkali, dried, exposed to microwave irradiation, washed by water and acid respectively.|$|E

The value for coals {{have a strong}} effect size, while the value for coal-shales have a moderate effect size. The evaluation of the sulphate sulphur indicated a negative correlation for the coals and a positive correlation for the coal-shales. This means that as sulphate sulphur increases for the coals, the spontaneous combustion liability decreases, while for the coal-shales as the <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> increases, the oxidation potential {{is more likely to}} increase in general. This is in-line with the study reported on coal by Singh and Demirbilek (1987).

30|$|After {{analyzing}} {{the data in}} Table  2, it becomes apparent that the water vapour inhibits the combustion reaction. Hence, the yield of the desulphurized coal and tar of organic coal decomposition increases with an increasing amount of the water vapour in the oxidant. As {{the amount of water}} vapour in the oxidant increases, the density and kinematic viscosity of decomposition tar of COM are observed to be decreased. The sulphur content in tar is slightly reduced, which indicates a minor effect of water vapour on the reactions where <b>pyritic</b> lignite <b>sulphur</b> converses. Therefore, for the purpose of maximum production of tar from the oxidative treatment of lignite, the further researches were carried out at the content of water vapour 70  vol%.|$|R

Working with these coals gave a better insight to the oxydesulphurisation reactions for <b>pyritic</b> and organic <b>sulphur.</b> Effect of air and oxygen pressure in a fixed time interval on sulphur removal was studied by series of experimental runs at various temperatures. Heating value recoveries were significant. Increase in oxygen content is reported {{as a measure of}} carbon loss. The coal samples were analyzed according to British standard methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the sulphur removal was enhanced with the increase in air pressure, particularly up to 100 bars, with only a small decrease in calorific value at a particular temperature.

40|$|The {{acceleration}} of coal self-heating {{has long been}} attributed {{to the presence of}} reactive pyrite. However, a definitive means of quantifying this effect has been lacking, particularly from the low ambient temperatures experienced at mine sites. A recently developed moist coal adiabatic oven test has been used to investigate the influence of reactive pyrite on self-heating of a high volatile bituminous coal containing sulphur concentrations from 0. 62 % to 17. 95 %. A relationship exists between the amount of <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> in the coal and the time taken to reach thermal runaway. However, simply measuring the <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> concentration of a coal is not sufficient to quantify the accelerated self-heating effect, as it is the form of the pyrite that determines the pyrite reactivity.

The seven coal samples originated from South-east, North-central and North-east of Nigeria {{where there are}} proven economic deposits of this mineral. Moisture content, bulk density, percentage ash and loss of mass on ignition of all the coal samples were determined. The ultimate analysis of the raw coal, the corresponding coal ash as well as sulphur content of all samples were carried out {{with the aid of}} X-ray fluorescence technique (XRF). The major elements were Fe, Ca and S while the minor metals were K, Sc, Zn, Ni, Ti and Zr. Other metals including Ga, Cu, Mn, Cr and V were found in traces. The Nickel/Vanadium ratio which is a means of providing information on the source rock depositional environment ranged between 8. 8 - 32. 9. Three different source rock depositional environments were deduced for the coals from their nickel/vanadium ratios, while the calculated values of V/(V+Ni) suggested that they were all formed under oxic condition.

40|$|Soft brown coals of {{the open}} coal fields of Kolubara and Kostolac are the main {{domestic}} energy sources of Serbia. This paper {{presents the results of}} investigations on rapid devolatilization of these two coals which have covered kinetics of devolatilization (based on total volatile yield), forms of sulphur and petrographic analysis of coal and char. Experiments of devolatilization were performed in inert gas (N 2) at atmospheric pressure and in batch-type hot-wire screen reactor. The mass-loss values of both coals at selected final reaction temperatures (300 - 900 °C) and retention times (3 - 28 s) were obtained. Anthony and Howard's kinetic model was applied over two temperature ranges (300 - 500 and 700 - 900 °C). The types of sulphur as monosulphide, sulphate, <b>pyritic,</b> and organic <b>sulphur</b> were determined for chars and original coals. Strong transformation of pyrite was evident even at low temperatures (300 °C). Devolatilization of all types of sulphur has started over 600 and at 900 °C the content of sulphur in char remained only 66 % of total sulphur in original coal. Microscopic investigations were carried out on samples prepared for reflected light measurements. The petrographic analysis included: the ratio of unchanged and changed coal, maceral types, the share of cenosferes, isotropic mixed carbonized grains, mixed grains, small fragments, clay, and pyrite.

A number of petrological investigations were carried out, including lithotype, quantitative maceral and mineral analyses, proximate and ultimate analyses, X-ray, and optical and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). We also examined the mineral matter from above, below, and within the coal layers. The proportions of sulphur in total (St), pyritic (Sp), organic (So) and sulfate(Ss) forms were also determined. The investigated coals have high sulphur contents, commonly above 7 wt%, and can range from about 4 wt% to more than 11 wt%. The average sulphur proportions are 7. 5 wt% (4. 1 - 13. 5 wt%) total sulphur, 1. 6 wt% (0. 6 - 3. 2 wt%) <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur,</b> 4. 2 wt% (1. 8 - 6. 0 wt%) organic sulphur, and 1. 7 wt% (0. 3 - 2. 9 wt%) sulphate sulphur. Pyrite and gypsum are the major sulphur-bearing minerals. The syngenetic pyrite occurs mainly as isolated or clustered framboidal bodies and well-shaped euhedral crystals along stratification bands among humodetrinite and humotelinite. Epigenetic massive and infilled cell lumens of pyrite have also been observed. Well shaped prismatic crystals of gypsum were found as lenses, fine crusts, or fillings in cross bedding marks and cracks in the coal. Total sulphur slightly decreases from the base {{to the top of}} the coal bed. The highest content of total, sulphate, and <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> near clay coal layers has been established.

30|$|One of {{the methods}} of sulphur removal from the coal is its {{desulphurization}} via oxidative method (Hayvanovych and Pyshyev 2003; Pyshyev et al. 2004, 2007, 2012). The process lies in processing the feedstock by the air–steam mixture, at that the <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> that is {{the main part of}} the total sulphur in the coal is selectively converted. The main products are solid low-sulphuric fuel; tar formed during organic thermal decomposition; desulphurization gases with high sulphur content (compared with gases of heat-and-power stations) that makes it possible to utilize or treat them by known methods (Grunvald 1992; Javorskyi 2010); sulphur, sulphuric acid, etc. The suggested process may be the first stage of two-staged burning of the coal at heat-and-power stations (Hayvanovych and Pyshyev 2003).|$|E
30|$|In case of lignite desulphurization, RDPS and TSC depend {{substantially}} on temperature, whose optimum values {{should be}} considered 425 – 450  °C.

Relatively high degrees of lignite sulphur are reached while heating raw material without air. All these data are useful to confirm the assumption suggested that in the course of lignite desulphurization, the main sulphur conversions take place as a result of <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> reaction with high reaction organic mass and/or the products of its destruction and gasification (Pyshyev et al. 2012).

The flotation behavior of pyrite and other gangue particles using the sodium cyanide and the Ferrooxidans is compared by applying the general first-order flotation model.

An approximately linear relationship exists only between δv and moisture, and δv and total sulphur, and not between other parameters.

30|$|The process {{implementation}} without oxidant feed (OFR =  0) causes sufficiently {{high degree}} of sulphur conversion. It is confirmed by the proposal that the conversion reactions of sulphurous compounds of lignite take place mainly due to {{the participation of the}} reactive part of COM in them. If small quantity of oxidant (OFR =  0.6  m 3 /(h kg)) is fed in the reaction zone, the process intensification of sulphurous compound conversion occurs (Fig.  4). It indicates that air oxygen takes insignificant part in the reactions of <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> conversion. The increase of OFR from 0.6 to 4.8  m 3 /(h kg) leads to insignificant decrease of sulphur removal and conversion degrees, since OFR rise intensifies gasification and thermal destruction of organic matrix, that causes the reduction of the number of the reactive parts of COM.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{microwave heating}} can induce the pyrite embedded in coal to react with the active substances around and prompt the pyrite convert into pyrrhotite and troilite which are soluble in acid solutions. Weng and Wang (1992)has found that 97  % inorganic sulfur in coal {{can be removed}} by acid washing after the microwave irradiation for 10  min under the conditions of 1.5  kW microwave power, 2.45  GHz frequency. Similarly, in Jorjani’ study (2004), it is indicated that after exposed to microwave irradiation under the optimum test conditions, the bond energy between C–S and Fe–S in coal is weakened, which makes the bond more liable to break down by hydrogen peroxide acid washing. And {{it can be concluded}} that it is the <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> that is removed primarily based on the FTIR analysis and the variation of peak before and after irradiation.|$|E
40|$|Anoxic hypersaline basins {{have been}} found in two {{different}} tectonic environments in the eastern Mediterranean. Within the Tyro area (the western Strabo Trench) there are three pull apart basins: the Tyro Basin, presently filled with anoxic hypersaline bottomwater, and the Poseidon and Kretheus Basins, thought to have been anoxic and filled with hypersaline water in the past. The Mediterranean Ridge shows a "cobblestone topography" (Camerlenghi, 1990). The Bannock Basin is the largest depression found within this area and is divided into nine sub-basins. Tectonic deformations of Messinian evaporites are thought to be the major processes involved in the formation of these anoxic hypersaline basins. The interstitial water chemistry of sediments from these basins have been studied. The fact that the Poseidon and Kretheus Basins have been filled with hypersaline bottomwater is reflected by an increase of the CI and Na concentration in the pore waters downcore. These brines are thought to have been {{similar to that of the}} Tyro Basin. A diffusionadvection model has been applied to the CI profiles. From time calculations it was possible to estimate the time elapsed since hypersaline conditions in the Poseidon and Kretheus Basins changed into normal saline conditions. A renewal time between 2000 - 3000 years was found. Organic matter reaching the sediments is decomposed by sulphate reducing bacteria. Despite the high salinity (260 % 0) in the Tyro and Bannock Basins, sulphate reduction rates are higher than in the sediments from the Poseidon and Kretheus Basins. These higher sulphate reduction rates could be related to a better "preservation" of the organic matter in the anoxic brine. The release of inorganic metabolites, such as ammonium, alkalinity, phosphate and sulphide leads to the formation of authigenic minerals in these sediments such as dolomite, gypsum and sulphides. The sulphur chemistry in the anoxic hypersaline sediments from the Tyro and Bannock Basins have been studied in detail. Despite the difference in major element chemistry of the brines (De Lange et aI., 1990 a) their sulphur chemistry in the sediments is very similar. The following sulphur species have been determined and quantified: elemental sulphur, Acid Volatile Sulphur (AVS), organic polysulphides, humic sulphur (0. 5 M NaOH extractable) and <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur.</b> <b>Pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> was found to be the main phase of the inorganic reduced sulphur (50 - 80 % of the total sulphur pool) and was at the same level (250 pmoles per gram dry weight) in both cores. Remarkably, humic sulphur was found to account for 17 to 28 % of the total sulphur pool in the Tyro Basin and for 10 - 43 % in the Bannock Basin. Sulphur isotope data show negative 634 S values for both <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> (- 16 to - 40 % 0) and humic sulphur (- 16 to - 30 % 0). Pyritic and humic sulphur are thought to be mainly formed at the interface of oxic seawater and anoxic hypersaline bottom water. At this interface material is captured due to the large density difference. Higher amounts of particulate and dissolved organic carbon have been observed at these interfaces as well as sulphate reduction and sulphide oxidation processes.

Fixed carbon was obtained by subtracting the sum of the percentage of ash, moisture and volatile matter from 100 (ASTM, D 3176 - 15). The carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and total sulphur content were determined using a LECO TruSpec CHN and C and S analyzer according to the International Standard Organisation Standards (ISO 12902 : 2001). Oxygen content was calculated by subtracting the sum of the percentage of moisture, ash, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur from 100.

30|$|Desulfurization of coal by {{magnetic}} separation {{is an effective}} pre-combustion physical desulfurization technique characterized by low energy consumption, simple process, cost-effectiveness, environment-friendliness etc. The more significant the magnetic difference is, the better the separation result will be. Although there exists difference in magnetism between coal matrix and coal-bearing series pyrite, the difference of magnetic susceptibility between them is not significant.

The magnetic susceptibility of coal-bearing series pyrite can be raised significantly through thermal treatment (Kawatra and Eisele 2001). The problem brought about by the traditional thermal treatment is that the coal matrix is also heated while the pyrite is being heated. The selective heating characteristic of microwaves can effectively solve the problem and avoid the loss of coal matrix. Uslu and Atalay (2003) and Waters et al.

40|$|The {{presence}} of sulphur in coal possesses important environmetal problems in its usage. The sulphur dioxide (S 02) emissions produced during coal combustion {{account for a}} significant proportion of the total global output of anthropogenic SO 2. The extent of sulphur separation depends on several variables such as the form of sulphur in coal, intimacy of contact between minerals and the products of devolatilization. The total sulphur in coal varies in the range of 0. 2 - 11 wt %, although in most cases it is beetwen 1 and 3 wt %. Sulphur occurs in a variety of both inorganic and organic forms. Inorganic sulphur is found mainly as iron pyrite, marcasite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopirite and as sulphates (rarely exceeds w = 0, 1 %). Organic sulphur is found in aromatic rings and aliphatic functionalities usually as mercaptans, aliphatic and aryl sulfides, disulfides and thiophenes. Organic and <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> quantities depend on coal rank. Higher rank coals tend to have a high proportion of labile sulphur. All the organic sulphur is bivalent and it is spread throughout the organic coal matrix. Sulphur occurs in all the macerals and most minerals. Vitrinite contains the major part of organic sulphur and metals. Elemental sulphur is produced during coal weathering. The depolymerization methods as pyrolysis and hydrogenation are very drastic methods wich change the structure of the coal and the sulphur groups. In the case of pyrolysis, high levels of desulphurization, in chars and additional production of liquid hydrocarbon can be achieved. Thiophenes and sulphides were the major sulphur components of tars from coal pyrolysis. Hyrdogen sulphide and the lower mercaptans and sulphides were found in the volatile matters. Hydrogen sulphide and thiophenes are practically the only sulphur products of coal hydrogenation. H 2 S is produced in char hydrodesulphurization. A number of options are available for reducing sulphur emissions including the utilisation of coals with low sulphur concentrations (typically < 1 wt %), the removal of cleaning prior to utilisation. The methods for the removal of sulphur from coal can be divided into: physical, chemical and microbiological. The mineral sulphur components can be removed or reduced by commercial methods of coal washing, flotation and agglomeration. A number of chemical desulphurization for the removal of, both, pyritic and organic sulphur have been advocated. The chemical desulphurization methods however, have two major drawbacks. Namely, they are often expensive and they destroy the caking properties of coal. Certain microorganisms have been used to consume or convert selectively most of the <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> {{as well as some of}} the organic sulphur in coal.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{was to investigate the}} effect of microwave treatment on the conversion of pyrite in coal in order to enhance its magnetic properties and to aid subsequent desulphurisation by magnetic separation. Key areas of this investigation include:- a review of the fundamental theoretical aspects of heating in an applied microwave field, a detailed literature survey of the potential applications of microwave heating to aid coal desulphurisation, a study of the transformation mechanisms of pyrite by microwave and conventional heating methods, a comprehensive review of the influence of heterogeneity on the dielectric properties of coals and the effect of high power microwave heating on the decomposition of pyrite in a high sulphur coal. A detailed survey of the literature has shown that although a significant amount of work has been reported on the microwave heating of coal, little information is available which examines the mechanism through which different coals heat in an applied microwave field. A study is therefore presented in this thesis which quantifies, for the first time, the structural ordering of carbon in a range of coals of various ranks and the relationship with their dielectric properties. The results show a clear relationship between the structural ordering of carbon in coal and dielectric loss factor. Essentially, as the structural ordering increases, the level of free charge (per unit volume) increases together with electron mobility which results in an increase in dielectric loss factor. The transformation of pyrite to form the more magnetic pyrrhotite and other related decomposition products by conventional radiant heating {{has been the focus of}} much research. However, little attention has been given to the effect of microwave heating on the mechanisms of pyrite transformation in inert and oxygen-containing atmospheres. The study presented in this thesis investigates the effect of temperature, particle size and heat treatment time to establish how these affect the transformation process and the subsequent nature of the final product. This study showed that exposure of pyrite to both conventional and microwave heating methods enhanced its magnetic properties as a result phase alterations at the particle surface. Conventionally heated pyrite samples showed the highest magnetic susceptibility increases, speculated to be due difficulties surrounding the temperature control and measurement of the microwave heated samples. From a review of the literature in this field of research and by SEM observations made for each sample test in this work a general pyrite transformation model as a result of microwave exposure is proposed. The effect of microwave radiation on the conversion of in-situ coal derived pyrite was also investigated. The study presented here extends previous work by others by assessing quantitatively the influence of higher applied microwave power levels on the conversion of pyrite in coal. Samples of run-of-mine high <b>pyritic</b> <b>sulphur</b> content (~ 12 %wt) Kentucky coal were microwave pre-treated at varying exposure times using 8 kW and 15 kW of microwave power operating at a frequency of 2. 45 GHz. This work included initial material characterisation which consisted of TGA, optical microscopy and dielectric property measurement, followed by SEM/EDAX characterisation of both microwave treated and untreated sample specimens. This is the first time that microwave treated coal, embedded in a carnauba wax mounting medium, has been observed by this method with focus on the thermal alterations of the pyrite phase. It was demonstrated that with sufficient power and residence time, the conversion of pyrite to the more magnetic pyrrhotite is achievable using microwave irradiation. The amount of pyrrhotite formed as a result of microwave exposure varies with microwave residence time and forward power level. Comparisons of change in the iron sulphide species in the coal was made between microwave treated and untreated material. Using a multimode microwave cavity it was found that significant amounts of pyrrhotite were formed in 20 s when using 15 kW of microwave power. Treatment at lower power levels in this type of cavity was found to be less effective. The overall effect of treatment on the coal proximate character was minimal.
