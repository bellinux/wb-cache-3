Two only will suffice, as they are {{at the same time the}} most important and the most flagrantly abused. The first of these (which forms the fifth article of the agreement) proclaims that [...] "No Power which exercises sovereign rights in the said regions shall be allowed to grant therein either monopoly or privilege of any kind in commercial matters." [...] No words could be clearer than that, but the Belgian representatives, conscious that such a clause must disarm all opposition, went out of their way to accentuate it. [...] "No <b>privileged</b> <b>situation</b> can be created in this respect," [...] they said. [...] "The way remains open without any restriction to free competition in the sphere of commerce." [...] It would be interesting now to send a British or German trading expedition up the Congo in search of that free competition which has been so explicitly promised, and to see how it would fare between the monopolist Government and the monopolist companies who have divided the land between them. We have travelled some distance since Prince Bismarck at the last sitting of the Conference declared that the result was [...] "to secure to the commerce of all nations free access to the centre of the African Continent." ...|$|E

The technique proposed by the authors uses a laparoscope with an operative channel like the flexible endoscope used in NOTES. All operative times are carried out through the umbilical trocar as in LESS, and assisted by a minilaparoscopy grasper. This new technic combines, and results from, the rationalization of technical particularities and synergy of these three approaches, seeking to join their advantages and minimize their disadvantages...|$|R

40|$|The technology-centred {{approach}} to e-government, focused on fostering web-based procedures in themselves, seems unable to fully achieve the expected performances, {{even in the}} most advanced contexts. Can the Italian case be useful to ponder over this issue? Except for some circumscribed and <b>privileged</b> <b>situations,</b> Italy cannot be described as a centre of excellence, with regards to e-business practice. Nevertheless, the recent Italian legislative debate about the matter can be studied as a source of an alternative vision of e-government issues - even though the related laws have not been implemented as they should. Some recent Italian laws, in fact, focus on how Public Administration (PA) should be organized in order to assist citizens, namely: (a) when citizens ask for information from the PA, (b) when they need to access PA documents, (c) when they report problems or claims, and (d) when they perform procedures. This legislation is not focused on e-government in itself, but rather on the relationship between citizens and the different PA bodies, and on organizational, back-office issues connected with the purpose of achieving citizen satisfaction. Web-based applications are considered within this wider vision: in other words, according to this approach, e-government tends to be fostered by a cultural and organizational innovation within the PA, more than vice versa. It is not a goal in itself, but {{it is part of a}} more general endeavor to improve the overall performance of the PA, measured from the citizens’ perspective. According to this novel legislative approach, the crucial question is not “How should we implement e-government services?” but “Who should deal with e-government within the PA?”. The organizational answer that the Italian law is seeking to provide is: “within each PA body, e-government should be designed and managed by a single Department dedicated to a wider purpose: taking care of the whole range of interactions with citizens (traditional face-to-face interactions included). To be successful, this Department must have a strong role (and actual power) in back-office innovation. ” Field studies are being conducted to assess the soundness of such an approach, and the tentative outcomes are discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|In {{relation}} to the academic profession in New Zealand, this thesis examines the theory that professional occupations unionize because of a deterioration in their class situation. The class situation of academic staff is defined according to two indices: market situation (including salary levels, promotion prospects and job security) and work situation (including issues of autonomy and collegiality). Factors which supported the <b>privileged</b> class <b>situation</b> of academics, as well as historical details about how academics have won organisational advantages are also discussed. The evidence shows that the class situation of academics has clearly deteriorated. Salaries have dropped in absolute terms and in {{relation to}} average New Zealand incomes. Promotion prospects also appear to have deteriorated, and tenure or job security appears to be threatened. Since 1982, a secondary labour market of part-time, untenured teaching assistants expanded disproportionately. Organisational advantages have also been eroded. In the late 1980 s and ear 1 y 1990 s, the State appears to be undermining the control over university life gained by the academic profession in the 1960 s and 1970 s. This situation, and recent evidence that points to a tighter relationship between the universities and {{the market in the}} near future, suggests that the academic profession could lose control over what is taught and researched in the universities. Despite these trends, the academic profession still retains significant economic and organisational advantages. This is born out in a series of in-depth interviews of academic staff at the University of Canterbury where there appears to be general satisfaction with economic and organisational features of work (other N. Z. universities may be different). The prevention of further erosion of conditions appears to be the main rationale for the widespread support of unionism at this university. Other factors which may limit the deterioration of the class situation of professionals are discussed in the final chapter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hemophilia A is a {{bleeding}} disorder caused by deficiency in coagulation factor VIII. Recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) {{is an alternative}} to plasma-derived FVIII {{for the treatment of}} hemophilia A. However, commercial manufacturing of rFVIII products is inefficient and costly and is associated to high prices and product shortage, even in economically <b>privileged</b> countries. This <b>situation</b> may be solved by adopting more efficient production methods. Here, we evaluated the potential of transient transfection in producing rFVIII in serum-free suspension HEK 293 cell cultures and investigated the effects of different DNA concentration (0. 4, 0. 6 and 0. 8 μg/ 10 6 cells) and repeated transfections done at 34 ° and 37 °C. Results We observed a decrease in cell growth when high DNA concentrations were used, but no significant differences in transfection efficiency and in the biological activity of the rFVIII were noticed. The best condition for rFVIII production was obtained with repeated transfections at 34 °C using 0. 4 μg DNA/ 10 6 cells through which almost 50 IU of active rFVIII was produced six days post-transfection. Conclusion Serum-free suspension transient transfection is thus a viable option for high-yield-rFVIII production. Work is in progress to further optimize the process and validate its scalability. </p...|$|R

As crianças neles representadas eram, na sua maioria, brancas e possuíam vida {{familiar}} estruturada (pai, mãe) e condição social privilegiada. As fotos das crianças, em algumas circunstâncias, eram produzidas em estúdios fotográficos e destacavam a beleza e felicidade. Seus trajes e adereços ajudavam a compor a imagem de criança bem nascida e feliz. O universo da fotografia na infância está articulado a outras preocupações constantes quando se fala de criança: saúde, educação, religiosidade, lazer e moda. As fotos institucionais como, por exemplo, dos parques infantis assumem características diferentes daquelas explicitadas anteriormente. Nesse caso, as crianças eram fotografadas coletivamente como propaganda das atividades desenvolvidas pelas instituições. Considerando a fotografia como produção social, e evitando, portanto, concebê-la como reflexo do real, o artigo procura articular textos e imagens, bem como refletir sobre diferentes possibilidades do mundo infantil.
