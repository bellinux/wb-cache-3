40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was the effect of 1. 5 %, 3 % and 4. 5 % pre-gelatinized wheat starch (based on the total weight of cake batter) on {{improving}} the qualitative properties of shortened cake batter. Specific volume and viscosity of the shortened cake batter were measured for controls, 1. 5 %, 3 % and 4. 5 % gelatinized starch; some important properties such as texture and sensory evaluation were examined. By increasing pre-gelatinized wheat starch used in the batter, a significant difference was observed in the rheological properties of the batter. Cake batter properties were found improved compared to the control samples. The sample with 3 % <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> had a lower viscosity than other treatments. The treatment with 4. 5 % <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> had the lowest specific volume compared to other treatments.

40|$|High volume {{fractions}} of dried broccoli particles (up to 20 % v/v) were incorporated in a starch dough. The concentration of <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> was varied between 10 and 30 %. The addition of 20 % v/v dried broccoli powder, causes {{a significant increase}} in the shear modulus. For pure starch, the modulus increased with increasing <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> concentration, whereas the shear modulus of starch containing broccoli particles decreased with increasing <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> concentration. From viscosity measurements in the dilute regime, the swelling of the broccoli particles was determined. When dispersed in water the dried broccoli particles can swell to up to 7. 6 times, and this swelling capacity has a significant effect in the rheological behavior of starch dough systems. When volume fractions up to 20 % (v/v) are incorporated, the system acts as a cellular material, instead of a gelled matrix with dispersed particles. This observation was confirmed with confocal scanning laser microscopy...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to develop lactose-free orodispersible tablets with {{loratadine}} for patients with lactose intolerance. Materials and methods: Seven compositions (F 1 -F 7) of 10 mg loratadine were prepared in form of orally disintegrating tablets, by direct compression, using croscarmellose sodium and <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> in various concentrations as superdisintegrants, diluted with microcrystalline cellulose and combined with mannitol and maltodextrin as binder agents. The tablets had been studied in terms of their pharmacotechnical characteristics, by determining: the weight uniformity of the tablets, their friability, breaking strength and disintegration time, drug content and the dissolution profile of loratadine. The statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism Software Inc. As dependent variables, both the hardness of the tablets and their disintegration ability differ between batches due to their compositional differences (as independent variables). DDSolver were used for modeling the kinetic of the dissolution processes by fitting the dissolution profiles with time-dependent equations (Zero-order, First-order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas, Peppas-Sahlin). Results: All proposed formulas shows rapid disintegration, in less than 15 seconds, and the dissolution loratadine spans a period of about 10 minutes. Akaike index as well as R 2 adjusted parameter have demonstrated that the studied dissolution profiles are the best fitted by Zero-order kinetic. Conclusion: In conclusion, association of croscarmellose sodium (7. 5 %) with <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> (6 %) as superdisintegrants and mannitol as the binder agent (35 %), positively influences the dissolution properties of loratadine from orally fast dispersible tablets...|$|E

The blends were formed under alkaline condition (0. 1 M NaOH) with 3 : 1, 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 starch: zein (w/w) ratios. The 3 : 1 starch-zein blends showed best stability or compatibility. Blends made with starch complexed with stearic acid had better stability than those with uncomplexed starch. Most of the blends were not freezethaw stable except for 3 : 1 starch (complexed with stearic acid) -zein blend. The blends with better stability had higher apparent viscosity, and a microstructure showing uniform mix of starch – zein as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The likely reason for the compatibility of starch and zein is the change in surface activity of zein, possibly due to deamidation, in 0. 1 M NaOH as shown by the negative zeta potential values.

40|$|Starches of {{enhanced}} cold-water {{swelling capacity}} {{can be used}} in instant and convenience foods like puddings, pie fillings, gravies, soups and sauces. Since traditionally produced <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starches</b> have poor properties due to loss of granular integrity, efforts have been made to develop granular cold-water swelling starches. This can generally be achieved by heating starch in the presence of aqueous alcohol, during which the native double helical order is transformed into single helical order. Presumably, this happens by complex formation between both amylose and amylopectin with the alcohol. Amylose is essential for retaining granular integrity. Removal of the residual alcohol from the single helix cavity is alleged to render cold-water swelling starch. This study aimed at further understanding the conversion of native into granular cold-water swelling starch. First, a laboratory scale aqueous ethanol procedure was successfully used to gradually convert native maize starch to granular cold-water swelling starch by varying ethanol concentration and treatment temperature. Swelling power increased concomitant with starches showing an increased level of VH-type crystallinity. A waxy maize starch was included as well to study the role of amylopectin in the formation of V-type crystals. Removal of alcohol by high temperature drying resulted in a VA-type X-ray diffraction pattern. However, this transition was reversible and it was shown that high temperature drying is not necessary to confer upon starch its cold-water swelling characteristics. Finally, beyond-state-of-the-art time-temperature resolved X-ray measurements during the conversion of native to cold-water swelling starch provided insights in the structural transitions taking place. status: publishe...|$|R

The endotherms were mainly of non-reversing nature, with a small contribution from the reversing component. Starch melting is a plasticizer-assisted disruption of crystals and other structures such as starch-lipid complexes and granules.

Effect of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide, a cationic surfactant, on rheology, fluid loss and biocide has been studied in a polymer-based drilling fluid. Inhibitive polymer mud was formulated using XC polymer, shale inhibitors like KCl, K 2 SO 4 and CaCO 3 as bridging agent. Rheology and other properties were studied using Fann VG meter, API filter press, mud balance, roller oven apparatus. Dissolved oxygen meter was used to check the microbicidal property of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide. Addition of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide increased fluid retention capacity of the fluid even at very low concentration 0.1 %(w/v) without affecting the mud properties.

Three different soybean flours were used for fortification: toasted soy flour (TSF), isolated soy protein (ISP) and defatted soy flour (DSF). The soy flours were dispersed in water, and the pH of the dispersions adjusted to 6. 5 and 4. 5. Both boiled and unboiled dispersions were used. Fortification of garri with soy flour to a protein content of 15 % w/w affected the texture of garri agglomerates.

The aim of the present work was to characterize the effect of LBG, cross-linked, hydroxypropylated maize <b>starch</b> (Mhdp) and <b>pre-gelatinized</b> rice <b>starch</b> (gRS) on Ca, Fe and Zn availability during a gastric and intestinal in vitro digestion assay in relation to their physicochemical properties in solution (apparent viscosity, solubility, molar mass (M) and conformational properties) through the simulated digestion process. LEG gave the highest decrease in Ca and Fe gastric (17. 96 % and 17. 6 % respectively) and intestinal (19. 5 % and 13. 5 %) solubility with respect to the reference without thickeners. Ca (11. 1 % +/- 1. 1), Fe (2. 77 % +/- 0. 3) and Zn (7. 78 % +/- 0. 6) dialyzability was also lower than for the reference (23. 4 % +/- 2. 9; 19. 65 % +/- 3. 53 and 27. 74 % +/- 33 respectively). LBG solubility remained stable during gastric digestion, decreasing significantly from a range of 65 - 69 % to 61. 1 % after intestinal digestion. LBG viscosity remained stable during the digestion process, being these findings attributable to its resistance to enzymes. On the other hand, the addition to Mhdp or gRS slightly affected Ca and Fe solubility or Ca dialyzability, decreasing after gastric digestion and then increasing after intestinal digestion with respect to the reference. These results correlated to the changes in their viscosity enhancing properties, which increased during gastric digestion and decreased after intestinal digestion, being attributable to their digestion by pancreatic enzymes. Gastric digestion resulted in an increase in M for the modified starches (more pronounced for gRS). The increase in mineral solubility and dialyzability after intestinal digestion with respect to the gastric stage was explained by the degradation of starches by intestinal enzymes, which resulted in a decrease in apparent shear viscosity (from 1. 2 to 1 Pa s, measured in a shear rate range 0. 00 - 50 s(- 1)) and an increase in solubility (from 3 to 6 % to approximately 70 %) after intestinal digestion. In conclusion, LBG could be more effective than Mhdp and gRS as thickener, providing higher viscosity and resistance to digestive process. However, its negative effect on mineral solubility and dialyzability should be taken into account. On the contrary, Mhdp and gRS showed to be degraded after intestinal digestion.

40|$|Whey {{proteins}} (WP) {{are widely}} used {{in a variety of}} food formulations and constitute a significant share of the dairy ingredients market. In this research WP functionalities were modified using a novel reactive supercritical fluid extrusion (SCFX) process. High pressure extrusion of WP under different pH conditions and in the presence of mineral salts, combined with a delicate control of heat, shear, and internal environments created by introduction of supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO 2), was used to texturize and develop unique functional properties in commercially available whey protein concentrate (WPC). A feed formulation comprising (w/w) 94 % WPC- 80, 6 % <b>pre-gelatinized</b> corn <b>starch,</b> 0. 6 % (WP-starch basis) NaCl, and 0. 6 % (WP-starch basis) CaCl 2 was texturized in a high-pressure extruder at 90 degree C and 60 % (dry feed basis) moisture in the pH range of 2. 89 to 8. 16 with 1 % (dry feed basis) SC-CO 2 injected as a blowing agent. The average specific mechanical energy (SME) input for the process was 57 Wh/ kg. The resulting texturized WPC (tWPC) extrudates were dried, ground into powder, reconstituted in deionized water and evaluated for their rheological and physicochemical properties. The rheological behavior of tWPC was found to be strongly dependent on the pH and SC-CO 2 levels used during extrusion. The highest apparent viscosity (nu = 2. 06 Pas) and elastic modulus (G'= 10 kPa) values were observed in the tWPC produced at extremely acidic condition (pH 2. 89) with SC-CO 2 injection and were significantly higher than those exhibited by the unextruded control (nu = 0. 008 Pas, and G'= 0. 04 Pa). A 20 % (w/w) tWPC dispersion exhibited a highly viscous and creamy texture with particle size in the micron-range (mean diameter ~ 5 mu-m) which could serve as a thickening/gelling agent or as a fat substitute in food formulations over a wide range of temperatures. The soluble protein content and free sulfhydryl groups of the tWPC decreased by approximately 20 % and 16 % relative to the unextruded control. The tWPC was completely soluble in the presence of urea (8 M) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (0. 5 %) without a reducing agent, indicating that the non-covalent interactions (hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds) were mainly responsible for the structural formation of the tWPC. A homogeneous gel-like emulsion of creamy consistency was also successfully produced by incorporation of corn oil with tWPC dispersion in water serving as the continuous aqueous phase. Only 4 % (w/w) tWPC was needed to emulsify 80 % corn oil and it showed a higher thermal stability upon heating to 85 degree C. It also showed excellent emulsifying properties (emulsion activity index, EAI, = 431 m exp(- 2) g exp(- 1), emulsion stability index, ESI, = 13, 500 h) compared to the commercial WPC- 80 (EAI = 112 m exp(- 2) g exp(- 1), ESI = 32 h). Emulsions prepared with such small amounts of tWPC showed an enhanced adsorption of proteins at the oil-water interface which prevented flocculation and coalescence of the oil droplets, and an increase in the viscosity of the continuous phase which prevented creaming by trapping the oil droplets within the gel matrix. These attributes helped generate very stable oil-in-water emulsions of important utility in food formulations and should be useful in new product development...|$|R

In accelerated stability study, various tests were performed including hardness, disintegration, chemical assay and in-vitro dissolution test. After preparation of tablets, the physical and chemical parameters of tablets at zero period of time were tested, and were found within their specification. After test the tablets were kept in the stability chamber for six months. After three and six months the physical and chemical parameters of tablets were also tested. According to the results, the formulations containing the magnesium stearate and stearic acid degraded {{with the passage of time}} but the formulation containing the combination of <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> and magnesium stearate were more stable as compared to the formulations containing the lubricants as magnesium stearate and stearic acid.

40|$|The present {{work has}} the {{objective}} to produce briquettes by using fine charcoal from coconut wastes {{as raw material}} and evaluate the briquette quality. Coconut piths were collected at the city of Touros, in Rio Grande do Norte state. After a 2 - month air drying, coconut pith was carbonized and hereafter ground in a hammer mill. The resulting charcoal powder was sieved and the fraction less than 40 mesh was used to produce briquettes according to an entirely randomized designed experiment involving 12 treatments and 3 replications. Starch and clay were employed as binders. The treatments were divided into 3 groups, each group corresponding to a proportion of clay, respectively 12, 15 and 18 %, based on the total dry weight of the briquette. Within each group, the proportions of starch were 6, 8, 10 and 12 %. The carbon powder was mixed with finely ground clay was added and then the <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> in water at 80 °C. The mass for each treatment was mixed until homogeneous, separating quantities of 17 grams of mass for each repetition. The briquettes were produced in a laboratory press (pressure of 1500 psi and pressing time of 4 minutes). The briquettes were dried in an oven at 60 °C until constant weight. After drying, the properties of briquettes were evaluated: bulk density, high calorific value, immediate chemical composition (moisture content, fixed carbon, volatile matter and ash) and compressive strength. Best treatments for trading products were 12 / 12 e 12 / 15...|$|E
40|$|Different {{methods are}} {{available}} for obtaining oat fractions with elevated soluble fibre content. Separation of flour particles based on their size and density gives fractions with maximum around 20 % of ?-glucan, whereas higher B-glucan contents can be obtained via various extraction processes. Any of these approaches yields vast amounts of endosperm-rich low B-glucan flour as a side product. The addition of extra value into this side fraction would have {{a huge impact on}} the feasibility of whole oat fractionation process. The composition of low ?-glucan oat flour provides no nutritional superiority over other cereal products. Instead, due to high lipid content it has some technological limitations such as a high tendency to stick in elevators, barrels and transporters. Also, when such flour is mixed in water, it will readily form large clumps, which make it difficult to form homogeneous mixtures. Due to these limitations, oat endosperm flour is typically used in low value products such as animal feed. The purpose of our work was to introduce new technological functionality into low B-glucan oat flour and simultaneously overcome negative aspects associated to this fraction. This was achieved by hydrothermal treatment yielding partially damaged starch (Kiiliäinen et al, 2004). Several desired changes were observed due to this treatment and the hydrothermally treated flour hydrates easily already at room temperature. Concurrently with the starch damage a relocalisation of oat lipids was also noticed, resulting in re-duced extractability of the lipids. These changes provide the basics for the use of hydrothermally treated oat flour in baking and ready made food applications where it can offer a cost effective replacement for other water binding agents such as <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> products.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{research}} of applicability of gluten-free flours from cereal crops and from by-products of cereal crop processing - ground crumbs sifted out in a process of flake production from rice, corn and millet during the production of biscuit semi-finished products. Taking into account that viscosity is an important technological characteristic of foam-like biscuit dough, as it determines foam strength and dispersed medium stability, the influence of gluten-free flours on the structural and rheological properties of biscuit dough was studied. It is determined that the substitution of wheat flour for cereal flours leads to viscosity reduction of the dough as a consequence of absence of gluten-forming proteins in them. A comparative analysis of changes in viscous properties of biscuit dough based on flour from flakes crumb while warming it up to 60 °C with dough based on cereal flours and dough based on wheat flour was held. It is shown that the presence of partially gelatinized starch granules in flour from flake crumb, as a result of technological peculiarities of their extraction, promotes greater demonstration of thickening properties already at the initial stage of baking than in cereal flours. This leads to an increase of dough viscosity and formation of desired rheological characteristics, which provide the porous structure of finished products. To provide the high quality of gluten-free biscuit semi-finished products, the recipe composition of gluten-free biscuit semi-finished product, based on flour mixture from millet flakes crumb, corn and rice flour, was optimized by using the method of mathematical design of experiments.  The porosity indicator was chosen as the criteria for the evaluation of influence of proportion of gluten-free flours on the quality of biscuit semi-finished products. The response surfaces of dependency of biscuit porosity from mass ratio of recipe components in the composite mixture were obtained. It was confirmed experimentally that the use of <b>pre-gelatinized</b> acetylated modified <b>starches</b> during the production of gluten-free biscuit semi-finished products, facilitates the stabilization of the structural and rheological properties of foam structure - viscosity growth of biscuit dough because of foam-stabilizing property, which is particular to them. It was demonstrated that the obtained gluten-free biscuit semi-finished products based on flour composite mixtures with addition of modified starches, had high quality indicators. Based on the results of the research conducted, the recipe was formulated, technological parameters of production of new types of gluten-free biscuit semi-finished products were determined. Ke...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the action of {{glucoamylase}} {{in the process of}} bioconversion of native starch in combination with amilolytic enzymes, that {{have a positive effect on}} the bioconversion of the <b>pre-gelatinized</b> <b>starch.</b> It was found that the use a composition of thermostable bacterial glucoamylase with α-amylase as catalyst, in contrast to the gelatinized starch, a positive effect is not observed. It was revealed a positive impact of composition the glucoamylase (Asp. niger) and pullulanase (Bac. licheniformis) with the dose of 0. 4 – 0. 5 units of ASPU/g DS of starch on the process. The studies revealed that the optimum рН of the reaction medium for the enzyme composition as well as of for glucoamylase at the action on native starch is in the range of 3. 0 – 3. 5, in contrast to the 4. 0 to 4. 5 for gelatinized starch. The results showed that the optimum рН decrease for the action of glucoamylase in the process of bioconversion of native starch to 3. 3 and 3. 5 may be due to the synergistic action of glucoamylase and НСl. Pullulanase (Bac. licheniformis) retains the optimum рН (4, 2) for gelatinized starch at independent action on native starch is partially inactivated while lowering рН. At a dose of 10 ASPU/g DS of starch under specified conditions pullulanase cleaves not more than 1 % DS of starch at forming glucose (~ 45 %), maltose (~ 13 %), maltotriose (~ 12 %) and HMS (~ 30 %). That indicates to the ability of the test pullulanase in addition to the α- 1, 6 -glycosidic linkages to break down starch and α- 1, 4 links. On the basis of the obtained data it is revealed that the use of the glucoamylase composition with α-amylase and/or pullulanase for low-temperature bioconversion of native starch, unlike gelatinized is ineffective. </p...|$|E
