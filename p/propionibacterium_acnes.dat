5|$|Genetics {{is thought}} to be the primary cause of acne in 80% of cases. The role of diet and {{cigarette}} smoking is unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part. During puberty, in both sexes, acne is often brought on by an increase in hormones such as testosterone. A frequent factor is excessive growth of the bacterium <b>Propionibacterium</b> <b>acnes,</b> which is normally present on the skin.|$|E
5|$|The toner {{contains}} glycolic acid, an exfoliant, and witch hazel, an astringent.

Benzoyl peroxide has been used since 1934 to kill <b>Propionibacterium</b> <b>acnes,</b> the bacterium that causes acne. Several over-the-counter acne treatments contain it, including Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Doctor's Dermatologic Formula, Neutrogena Advanced Systems, PanOxyl and Stridex.|$|E
5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages are thought to occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by <b>Propionibacterium</b> <b>acnes</b> (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.|$|E

5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria <b>Propionibacterium</b> <b>acnes.</b> This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E
5|$|Compounds from T. felleus {{have been}} {{extracted}} and researched for potential medical uses. Tylopilan is a beta-glucan that was {{isolated from the}} fruit bodies in 1988 and shown in laboratory tests to have cytotoxic properties and to stimulate non-specific immunological response. In particular, it enhances phagocytosis, {{the process by which}} macrophages and granulocytes engulf and digest foreign bacteria. In experiments on mice with tumour cells, it appeared to have antitumour effects when administered in combination with a preparation of <b>Propionibacterium</b> <b>acnes</b> in a 1994 Polish study. Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme pancreatic lipase; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested. A compound present in the mushroom, N-γ-glutamyl boletine, has mild antibacterial activity.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} that the anaerobic bacterial species <b>Propionibacterium</b> <b>acnes</b> (P. acnes) contributes {{to the development of}} acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of P. acnes associated with normal skin, and moderate or severe inflammatory acne. It is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. Infection with the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne. It is unclear whether eradication of the mite improves acne.|$|E

40|$|Background: Acne vulgaris {{is one of}} {{the most}} common skin {{disorders}} in youth especially during the puberty. Objective: This in vitro study was performed to determine the antibiotic resistance and sensitivity in acne vulgaris. Materials and Methods: Samples were collected from normal skin and nodulocystic and pustular skin lesions of one hundred youngsters (64 girls, 36 boys) among college students in the age range of 18 - 24 years old. The specimens were cultured individually on blood agar and Muller-Hinton media. The cultures were then incubated under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 2 to 7 days. Bacteria were identified and their resistance to common antibiotics was evaluated according to the standard procedures. Results: In aerobic culture of pustular and nodulocystic skin lesions, Staphylococcus aureus was present in 41 &#x 0025; of subjects, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 53 &#x 0025; and Micrococcus spp in 45 &#x 0025; of subjucts. In anaerobic bacterial culture of pustular and nodulocystic skin lesions, Staphylococcus aureus was present in 39 &#x 0025;, <b>Propionibacterium</b> <b>acne</b> in 33 &#x 0025; and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 21 &#x 0025; of subjects.

In this study, we investigated whether P. acnes activates the inflammasome in human sebaceous glands in vivo and in vitro. We found that IL- 1 β expression was upregulated in sebaceous glands of acne lesions. After stimulation of human sebocytes with P. acnes, the activation of caspase- 1 and secretion of IL- 1 β were enhanced significantly. Moreover, knocking down the expression of NLRP 3 abolished P. acnes-induced IL- 1 β production in sebocytes. The activation of the NLRP 3 inflammasome by P. acnes was dependent on protease activity and reactive oxygen species generation. Finally, we found that NALP 3 -deficient mice display an impaired inflammatory response to P. acnes. These results suggest that human sebocytes are important immunocompetent cells that induce the NLRP 3 inflammasome, and that P. acnes-induced IL- 1 β activation in sebaceous glands may have a role in combating skin infections and in acne pathogenesis...|$|R

Aims: The present study was conducted to investigate the in vitro anti-acne activity of two Unani single drugs Darchini (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Bl.) and Tukhm Khashkhash (Papaver somniferum L. seeds). Materials and Methods: The antibacterial activity of aqueous, ethanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts of both drugs were investigated against two acne causing bacteria, i. e., <b>Propionibacterium</b> <b>acne</b> and Staphylococcus epidermidis using well diffusion method. Results: The result showed that both drugs were active against the two bacteria.

Despite improved shunts and surgical techniques there are still complications. This retrospective study focuses on diagnoses and treatment of shunt malfunction and infections. Cost/benefit of using an adjustable shunt was assessed. Two adjustable cerebrospinal fluid shunts and their compatible antisiphon devices were compared in-vitro. In 21 of 46 children the standard shunt was changed to an adjustable one due to over-drainage. Adjustment of the shunt was performed in 73 % of the children thereby avoiding surgery in several cases. This was a financial advantage. Ascites or an abdominal pseudocyst without infection was detected in eight children due to resorption difficulties. A ventriculo-atrial shunt was inserted for a period of time. In three children it could successfully be reverted to a ventriculo-peritoneal. In six children papilloedema was the only sign of shunt dysfunction. At revision the intracranial pressure ranged from 25 to 52 cm H 2 O. Fundoscopic examination in children older than 8 years may detect symptomless shunt malfunction. During a 13 -year period 39 shunt infections were diagnosed. Skin bacteria were found in 80 %.

40|$|Summary. Acne vulgaris, {{a common}} skin {{disorder}} speculated {{in the age}} group of 15 - 25 years begins with increased production of sebum followed by the attack of <b>Propionibacterium</b> <b>acne</b> (Kathryn et al). Most of the synthetic anti-acne drugs tend to exhibit mild to severe side effects along with peeling and darkening of skin, ultimately leading to social withdrawal. Hence, there arises a need to develop a safe and effective anti-acne formulation that would cure and also prevent recurrence of acne. Considering the fact that roots of R. cordifolia (Rubiaceae) are rich in anthraquinones characterized for their anti-inflammatory as well as wound healing property, (Singh, 2004) a gel formulation of anthraquinone rich fraction was developed and evaluated for its anti-acne potential using Cup plate diffusion method. A gel formulation containing 0. 1 % of anthraquinone rich fraction exhibited optimum anti-acne activity against P. acne, S. epidermidis, M. furfur (zone of inhibition- 28. 9, 20. 4, 24. 6 mm respectively) when compared with standard i. e. Clindamycin gel (zone of inhibition- 36. 7, 35. 3, 32. 7 mm respectively). Thus anthraquinone rich fraction in a gel formulation is proved to have a better potential in treating acne. Industrial relevance. Rubia cordifolia, often known as Common Madder, Indian Madder or Manjistha is highly recommended in skin diseases associated with edema and oozing (Yuangang Zu et al, 2010). The root powder was found to work well with ghee, for the medicament of acne. Used externally as a paste by itself or with honey, it heals inflammation and gives the skin an even tone and smoothness. Since the roots are claimed to be rich in anthraquinones, in this research work anthraquinone rich fraction from the roots R. cordifolia were extracted and formulated into an herbal gel and evaluated for its anti-acne activity. Topical gels are very useful as palliative products and prove to be economical and safe; hence it was decided to formulate a simple yet effective anti-acne gel of anthraquinone rich fraction of R. cordifolia with a carbomer as a best gelling agent. </p...|$|R
