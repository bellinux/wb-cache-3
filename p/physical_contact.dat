The <b>physical</b> <b>contacts</b> identified by the five methods are comprehensively benchmarked against dif-ferent reference sets that provide evidence for true <b>physical</b> <b>contacts.</b> Our results show that raw purification data can indeed be exploited to determine high-confidence <b>physical</b> pro-tein <b>contacts</b> within protein complexes. In particular, our new method outperforms competing approaches at discovering <b>physical</b> <b>contacts</b> involving proteins that have been screened multiple times in purification exper-iments. It also excels in the analysis of recent protein purification screens of molecular chaperones and pro-tein kinases. In contrast to previous findings, we ob-serve that <b>physical</b> <b>contacts</b> inferred from purification experiments of protein complexes can be qualitatively comparable to binary protein interactions measured by experimental high-throughput assays such as yeast two-hybrid. This suggests that computationally derived <b>physical</b> <b>contacts</b> might complement binary protein in-teraction assays and guide large-scale interactome mapping projects by prioritizing putative physical con-tacts for further experimental screens.

30|$|Here we {{analyze the}} interplay between digital {{networks}} and real-world <b>physical</b> <b>contacts</b> by analyzing multi-channel data from more than 500 university students. First, we show that the frequency of interaction on social networks and by phone calls is not trivially correlated with <b>physical</b> <b>contacts,</b> indicating a fundamental difference between these networks. Secondly, we discuss how, depending on the physical distance of the proximity contacts (which {{is related to the}} strength of the social tie between the actors [11]), communication networks show varying levels of structural similarity with proximity networks. As a result, we find that the physical distance in proximity interactions provides information {{about the nature of the}} contacts, that is, short-range interactions resemble the communication networks more closely [11]. Finally, we quantify the behavioral differences of central individuals with respect to the communication and proximity networks. By measuring the intensity and regularity of physical engagement with the entire population, we reveal that students central in the digital communication networks exhibit high relative activity during evenings and in the weekend, and are less predictable compared to the population average.|$|R

The generality of the behavior change was investigated by integrating three untrained subjects with the trained subjects in a setting free of adult-imposed contingencies and {{through a series of}} follow-up observations. Three trained subjects evidenced collateral increases in the generalization setting on at least one other behavior when training in smiling was conducted. One trained subject showed generalization session increases for each behavior when training was conducted to increase that behavior. All three untrained subjects demonstrated increased rates of smiling and sharing when interventions were conducted to increase those behaviors with the trained subjects. There was no appreciable generalization of verbal complimenting by either the trained or the untrained subjects.

The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit. Several studies have indicated intentional use of ground vibrations as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the Cape mole rat.

40|$|Motivation: Several {{methods have}} {{recently}} been developed to analyse large-scale sets of physical interactions between proteins in terms of <b>physical</b> <b>contacts</b> between the constituent domains, often {{with a view to}} predicting new pairwise interactions. Our aim is to combine genomic interaction data, in which domain–domain contacts are not explicitly reported, with the domain-level structure of individual proteins, in order to learn about the structure of interacting protein pairs. Our approach is driven by the need to assess the evidence for <b>physical</b> <b>contacts</b> between domains in a statistically rigorous way. Results: We develop a statistical approach that assigns p-values to pairs of domain superfamilies, measuring the strength of evidence within a set of protein interactions that domains from these superfamilies form contacts. A set of p-values is calculated for SCOP superfamily pairs, based on a pooled data set of interactions from yeast. These p-values can be used to predict which domains come into contact in an interacting protein pair. This predictive scheme is tested against protein complexes in the Protein Quaternary Structure (PQS) database, and is used to predict domain–domain contacts within 705 interacting protein pairs taken from our pooled data set.

Relationships between changes in CK concentrations and number of <b>physical</b> <b>contacts</b> and high-speed running markers, derived from performance analysis and global positioning system (GPS) data, were assessed. Results Moderate and moderate-large effect-size correlations were identified between contact statistics from performance analysis and changes in CK at 16 and 40 h post-match in forwards and backs, respectively (e. g. backs; total impacts vs. ΔCK (r[*]=[*] 0. 638, p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and Δ% CK (r[*]=[*] 0. 454, p[*]<[*] 0. 05) 40 h post-match). Furthermore, moderate effect-size correlations were found between measures of high-speed running and sprinting, and changes in CK at 16 and 40 h post-match within the backs (e. g. high-speed running distance vs. ΔCK (r[*]=[*] 0. 434, p[*]=[*] 0. 056) and Δ% CK (r[*]=[*] 0. 437, p[*]=[*] 0. 054) 40 hrs post-match).
