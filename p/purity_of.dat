5|$|In 215 Caracalla {{introduced}} the antoninianus, a coin intended {{to serve as}} a double denarius. This new currency, however, had a silver <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1antoninianus to 1.5denarii. This in effect made the antoninianus equal to about 1.5denarii. The reduced silver <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content, making the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the denarii worse than it had been before.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled, usually of high purity. For example, the lowest <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> gold {{recorded}} thus far for Aphilas is 90 percent. Early issues were often very close to their theoretical weights, and some were even over.) However, {{the weight of the}} coins tended to decrease over time (though not continuously or uniformly). This may have reflected a desire to conform to the Diocletian monetary reform of 301, when the aureus was decreased from 1/60 of a pound to 1/72. Despite decreases in weight, the <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the gold was largely maintained, even by later kings. The relative abundance of Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be found indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold.|$|E

3000|$|In reality, raw {{natural gas}} is not a binary mixture, but {{contains}} traces of N_ 2, C_ 2 H_ 6 and H_ 2. [...] The presence of H_ 2 S in a CO_ 2 -CH_ 4 system lowers the temperature at which solids are formed. In that case, significantly higher <b>purities</b> <b>of</b> methane in the gas phase can be reached while operating in the vapor-liquid regime (see also “Equipment”). Furthermore, at temperatures below the solid boundary, multi-component mixtures have a vapour–liquid–solid region instead of a vapour–solid region. This makes operation of CRS possible in this region, {{as long as the}} solid fraction does not become dominant. By operating CRS in the vapour–liquid–solid region, much higher <b>purities</b> <b>of</b> methane on the gas phase can be achieved, compared to operation of CRS in the vapour–liquid region.|$|R

This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E

40|$|In China, Poacynum hendersonii is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} substitute for Apoacynum venetum L (Luobuma), which is a famous traditional Chinese medicine. Quercetin- 3 - 0 -sophoroside and isoquercitrin are two major flavonoids in Poacynum hendersonii leaves. In this work, a suitable method was established for the large-scale preparation of quercetin- 3 - 0 -sophoroside (QOS) and isoquercitrin (ISO) from Poacynum hendersonii leaves using macroporous resin combined with Sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography. The adsorption/desorption capacities and desorption ratios of six macroporous resins were evaluated using static experiments. The HPD- 300 resin had the best adsorption performance because it had the largest surface area, and was selected for further study. Compared with pseudo -first-order and intraparticle diffusion kinetics models, the pseudo -second-order model could better fit the adsorption kinetics of both QOS and ISO on the HPD- 300 resin. In addition, the adsorption isotherms of the two compounds on the HPD- 300 resin were fitted well to the Langmuir model. Under optimal conditions, the <b>purities</b> <b>of</b> QOS and ISO in the product were increased from 2. 16 % and 1. 26 % to 21. 34 % and 10. 70 % with recovery yields of 82. 1 % and 77. 3 %, respectively. Subsequently, Sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography was employed for improving the <b>purities</b> <b>of</b> the two compounds. After separation by Sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography, the <b>purities</b> <b>of</b> QOS and ISO achieved 93. 5 % and 95. 6 %, respectively. (c) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
