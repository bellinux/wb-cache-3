The vast majority of citations are based on Olshevsky's list, and all subjective determinations (such as junior synonymy or non-dinosaurian status) are based on The Dinosauria, except where they conflict with <b>primary</b> <b>literature.</b> These exceptions are noted.|$|E

25|$|Ajita Kesakambali is {{credited}} as {{the forerunner of}} the Charvakas, while Brihaspati is usually {{referred to as the}} founder of Charvaka or Lokāyata philosophy. Much of the <b>primary</b> <b>literature</b> of Charvaka, the Barhaspatya sutras (ca. 600 BCE), are missing or lost.

25|$|The {{tenets of}} the Charvaka atheistic doctrines {{can be traced to}} the {{relatively}} later composed layers of the Rigveda, while substantial discussions on the Charvaka is found in post-Vedic literature. The <b>primary</b> <b>literature</b> of Charvaka, such as the Brhaspati Sutra is missing or lost. Its theories and development has been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras (such as the Arthashastra), sutras and the epics (the Mahabharata and Ramayana) of Hinduism as well as from the dialogues of Gautama Buddha and Jain literature.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, executive functioning is not {{a unitary}} concept. Many {{studies have been conducted}} in an attempt to pinpoint the exact regions of the brain that lead to executive dysfunction, producing a vast amount of often conflicting information indicating wide and inconsistent distribution of such functions. A common assumption is that disrupted executive control processes are associated with pathology in prefrontal brain regions. This is supported to some extent by the <b>primary</b> <b>literature,</b> which shows both pre-frontal activation and communication between the pre-frontal cortex and other areas associated with executive functions such as the basal ganglia and cerebellum.|$|E

2500|$|Lippa called Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why [...] "an {{excellent}} {{review of}} scientific research on the causes and correlates of sexual orientation" [...] and [...] "fair-minded, and easy-to-read". Payne credited LeVay with critically examining all theories of sexual orientation. Jones called Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why [...] "the latest and most effective among the growing corpus of books and articles arguing for an exclusively biological explanation of sexual orientation", and writing that it showed LeVay's [...] "brilliance", [...] "scientific acumen", and [...] "exceptional capacity for the integration of an enormous array of scientific findings." [...] Jones credited LeVay with [...] "sophistication in outlining the nature of sexual orientation". However, he argued that LeVay's book had subtle problems readers {{not familiar with the}} <b>primary</b> <b>literature</b> might not notice. He described LeVay's claim that if one of a pair of monozygotic twins is gay, the other is roughly fifty per cent likely to be gay as well as incorrect, writing that the actual odds were much smaller, and that research that LeVay himself cites shows as much. Jones noted that discovering such mistakes undermined his confidence in LeVay's work in general. He accused LeVay of having a tendency to employ [...] "creative" [...] arguments to explain away findings inconsistent with his theory, consistently criticizing the methodology only of studies that disagreed with him, and of wrongly implying that sexual orientation must be caused either only by biological factors or only by environmental factors, failing to suggest ways in which the two factors could interact. Jones rejected LeVay's claim that {{there is no evidence of}} environmental factors influencing sexual orientation, writing that [...] "examples abound" [...] of significant sociocultural influence. Jones also argued that LeVay sometimes employed studies with dubiously representative samples despite his awareness of the problems involved in doing so.|$|E
