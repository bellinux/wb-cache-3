40|$|In the past, an Anderson Greenwood (AG) <b>pilot</b> <b>operated</b> relief <b>valve</b> {{was used}} to protect the E- 1 rocket engine test facility. It {{was found that the}} AG valve is {{destroyed}} and discharges internal parts at a great velocity on opening. This is a major safety and cost issue. The solution is a relief valve to match present Anderson Greenwood pilot valve A 8 z B dimensions. The valve is to use a precise buckling pin obeying Euler s Law to act as the pressure sensor and actuator. The valve must not self destruct on opening...|$|R

5000|$|Like other {{pressure}} relief <b>valves</b> (PRV), <b>pilot</b> <b>operated</b> relief <b>valves</b> (PORV) {{are used for}} emergency relief during overpressure events (e.g., a tank gets too hot and the expanding fluid increases the pressure to dangerous levels). The difference between PORV and conventional PRV is that pilot valves use system pressure to seal the valve. A PRV typically uses a spring to hold the disc or piston on seat. The essential parts of a PORV are a pilot valve (or control pilot), a main valve, a pilot tube, the dome, a disc or piston, and a seat. The volume above the piston is called the dome.|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle hypergolic primary {{reaction}} control system (PRCS) thrusters continue to fail-leak or fail-off {{at a rate}} of approximately 1. 5 per flight, attributed primarily to metal nitrate formation in the nitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4) <b>pilot</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> (POV's). The failures have continued despite ground support equipment (GSE) and subsystem operational improvements. As a result, the Johnson Space Center (JSC) White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) performed a study to characterize the contamination in the N 204 valves. This study prompted {{the development and implementation of}} a highly successful flushing technique using deionized (DI) water and gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) to remove the contamination while minimizing Teflon seat damage. Following flushing a comprehensive acceptance test is performed before the thruster is deemed recovered. Between the time WSTF was certified to process flight thrusters (March 1992) and September 1993, a 68 percent thruster recovery rate was achieved. The contamination flushed from these thrusters was analyzed and has provided insight into the corrosion process, which is reported in this publication. Additionally, the long-term performance of 24 flushed thrusters installed in the WSTF Fleet Leader Shuttle {{reaction control}} subsystem (RCS) test articles is being assessed. WSTF continues to flush flight and test article thrusters and compile data to investigate metal nitrate formation characteristics in leaking and nonleaking valves...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> (POVs) {{are used}} to control the flow of hypergolic {{propellants}} monomethylhydrazine (fuel) and nitrogen tetroxide (oxidizer) to the Shuttle orbiter Primary Reaction Control Subsystem (PRCS) thrusters. The POV incorporates a two-stage design: a solenoid-actuated pilot stage, which in turn controls a pressure-actuated main stage. Isolation of propellant supply from the thruster chamber is accomplished {{in part by a}} captive polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) pilot seal retained inside a Custom 455. 1 stainless steel cavity. Extrusion of the pilot seal restricts the flow of fuel around the pilot poppet, thus impeding or preventing the main valve stage from opening. It can also prevent the main stage from staying open with adequate force margin, particularly if there is gas in the main stage actuation cavity. During thruster operation on-orbit, fuel valve pilot seal extrusion is commonly indicated by low or erratic chamber pressure or failure of the thruster to fire upon command (Fail-Off). During ground turnaround, pilot seal extrusion is commonly indicated by slow gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) main valve opening times (greater than 38 ms) or slow water main valve opening response times (greater than 33 ms). Poppet lift tests and visual inspection can also detect pilot seal extrusion during ground servicing; however, direct metrology on the pilot seat assembly provides the most quantitative and accurate means of identifying extrusion. Minimizing PRCS fuel valve pilot seal extrusion has become an important issue in the effort to improve PRCS reliability and reduce associated life cycle costs...|$|R
50|$|ADS {{consists}} {{in the case}} of Boiling water reactors of a series of valves which open to vent steam several feet under the surface of a large pool of liquid water (known as the wetwell or torus) in pressure suppression type containments, or directly into the primary containment structure in other types of containments, such as large-dry or ice-condenser containments. The actuation of these valves depressurizes the reactor vessel and allows lower pressure coolant injection systems to function, which have very large capacities in comparison to high pressure systems. Some depressurization systems are automatic in function but can be inhibited, some are manual and operators may activate if necessary. In Pressurized water reactors with large dry or ice condenser containments, the valves of the system are called <b>Pilot</b> <b>operated</b> release <b>valves.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>operated</b> surge relief <b>valves</b> are {{typically}} {{used to protect}} pipelines that move low viscosity products like gasoline or diesel. This style of valve is installed downstream of the pump/valve that creates the surge. The valve is controlled by an external, normally closed pilot valve. The pilot will be set to the desired set point of the system, with a sense line that runs up stream of the valve. When the upstream process conditions start to exceed the pilot set point, the valve begins to open and relieve the excess pressure until the correct pressure is met causing the valve to close.|$|R

40|$|Pump-controlled {{hydraulic}} circuits {{are more}} efficient than valve-controlled circuits, as they eliminate the energy losses due to flow throttling in valves and require less cooling effort. Presently existing pump-controlled solutions for single rod cylinders encounter an undesirable performance during certain operating conditions. This paper investigates the performance issues in common pump-controlled circuits for the single rod actuators. Detailed analysis is conducted that identifies these regions in a load-velocity plane and the factors affecting them. The findings are validated by experimental results. A new design is then proposed that employs a limited throttling <b>valve</b> alongside two <b>pilot</b> <b>operated</b> check <b>valves</b> for differential flow compensation to improve the performance. The valve is of the flow control type and is chosen to have a throttling effect over critical regions; it has the least throttling over other operating regions, thus maintaining efficiency. Experimental work demonstrates improved performance in a full operating range of the actuator as compared to a circuit that uses only the pilot-operated check valves. This circuit is energy efficient and capable of recuperating energy...|$|R
40|$|Counterbalance valves {{are widely}} used in {{hydraulic}} deck machinery to balance the overrunning loads. However, as is well known, counterbalance circuit designed with poor choice of counterbalance valve tends to introduce instability to the system. This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a <b>pilot</b> <b>operated</b> counterbalance <b>valve</b> which can <b>operate</b> at a flow rate about 2000 L/min. A linearized stability analysis of such a hydraulic circuit which consists of a slip in cartridge, a pilot counterbalance valve and a hydraulic winch is presented. Pole-zero plots are employed to reveal {{the effect of the}} volume of control cavity, the hydraulic resistance on pilot line and counterbalance valve pilot area ratio on the stability of the system. The analysis results indicate that such a system will be unstable within the normal range of each parameter. An alternative approach that guarantees system stability by adding an accumulator on the pilot line is put forward. The approach stabilizes the pilot pressure by reducing the hydro-stiffness of pilot control cavity, thus the system can reach its stability condition. Finally, a numerical optimization method is putted forward, with the optimized parameters, the dynamic performance of considered system become better...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{understand}} the working performance of the special <b>pilot</b> <b>operated</b> directional <b>valve,</b> flow field simulation based on CFD and dynamic response simulation in MatLAB Simulink are adopted in the study of this paper. 3 D flow field model of the valve with three kinds of the notch separately is build up using Pro/E, Gambit is used to generate quality computational grid, and the numerical simulation is performed by using the commercial code ‘Fluent’. The mathematic model based on physical equations for the valve is also established in Matlab Simulink, the dynamic responses are analyzed for the valve with three different notch types separately. The results show that the minimum pressure positions in flow fields are on the valve body near the notches. The value of the minimum pressure with K notches is the highest among three kind notch types. The minimum pressures will decrease greatly along with the flow rate increased. The efflux angles for the valve with three kind notch types separately are different, so are the steady flow forces. The valve with V notches responses quickest, but the ram moves quickest with U notch valve. The research in the paper contributes to {{a deeper understanding of the}} flow and dynamic response characteristics. The research method combining CFD simulation and MatLAB Simulink is available and will derive more precise results...|$|R
40|$|Following {{incidents}} at Pickering, Wolsung and Bruce NGS, involving {{instability of}} bleed condenser re-lief valves, Darlington station decided {{to replace the}} spring loaded RVs by new <b>pilot</b> <b>operated</b> SEBIM tandem <b>valves.</b> This paper is presenting the approach taken, the design and the testing of the new so-lution, {{as well as some}} of the computer modeling work performed in connection with this project. The SEBIM tandems, following successful testing in France, will bee installed in Darlington Unit 2, this spring. The new valves can perform with absence of instability and prevent a LOCA incident due to their design, which includes a protection and a redundant valve in series. Theoretical studies (Ref. 1) as well as the Pickering, Wolsung and Bruce incidents outlined the prob-lems associated with bleed condenser (BC) relief valve operation in some of the CANDU reactors. In all cases, the opening of the spring loaded valves, designed to provide overpressure protection for the BC vessel as well as for the primary heat transport system (PHT), was due to a liquid relief valve (LRV...|$|R
