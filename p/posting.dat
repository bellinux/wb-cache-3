5|$|Under {{the current}} process, when the NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner of a <b>posting,</b> it also sets the <b>posting</b> fee, {{which is now}} capped at a maximum of $20million. Once the MLB Commissioner announces the <b>posting</b> and the fee, the player has 30days to sign with an MLB team. Unlike the past system, in which only the team that won the bidding process had {{negotiating}} rights, the current system allows the posted player to negotiate with any MLB team {{willing to pay the}} <b>posting</b> fee. As in the previous process, if the player signs with an MLB team during the negotiating window, the signing team will pay the <b>posting</b> fee; otherwise, his rights revert to his NPB team. Also mirroring the past system, an unsuccessfully posted player can request a <b>posting</b> in a later year, with the process repeated.|$|E
5|$|Competitors in {{athletics}} events could {{qualify for the}} next round of competition in two ways. Qualifying by right was <b>posting</b> a high result in their own heat, and qualifying by result was <b>posting</b> a high result in overall standings.

5|$|Of the 55Japanese-born {{players who}} have played in MLB, 15 have entered the league using the <b>posting</b> system. Since the system's {{creation}} in 1998, the 22players that have used it have experienced a range of success. Of these 22, eleven were immediately signed to Major League contracts and one player who drew no bids on his first <b>posting</b> was signed to a Major League contract on his second <b>posting.</b> These contracts range from $1.4million to $155million. Of the remaining nine, three were signed to Minor League contracts, two were unable to reach a contract agreement and five were unsuccessful in drawing bids from any Major League clubs (one player failed to draw bids during two separate postings). The following tables outline each <b>posting</b> and its outcome.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 2012–13 <b>posting</b> season, MLB {{approached}} NPB seeking to change the way MLB teams bid for the right to negotiate with NPB players. Instead of using a silent auction in which teams bid blindly, MLB would prefer its teams to participate in a traditional, open auction where the bids are known and teams can knowingly outbid each other. Such a change would likely lower the price of the transfer fees paid to NPB teams. MLB and the players' unions agree that they'd prefer to see the players receive more money for the transfer rather than the teams. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey also believed that these talks provided the JPBPA an opportunity to voice their concerns about the <b>posting</b> system and attempt to gain more leverage for themselves during the <b>posting</b> process. The new agreement, as noted, was announced on December 16, 2013, with most of the changes desired by MLB and players from both leagues.|$|E

The first three attracted high bids of $13.125million, $51.1million, and $51.7million respectively. Tanaka was the first player posted under the current procedure; he was posted for the maximum $20million allowed under the new rules. However, since its implementation the <b>posting</b> system has been criticized by the media and baseball insiders from both countries.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the <b>posting</b> as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as high {{commissioner}} in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a <b>posting</b> to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the position would not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his <b>posting</b> to Sierra Leone. The country {{was in the middle of}} a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May—six weeks into Penfold's tenure—President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under one roof.|$|E
