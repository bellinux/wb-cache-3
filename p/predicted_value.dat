5|$|Ununennium is {{predicted}} to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C: thus {{it may be a}} liquid at room temperature. It is not known whether this continues the trend of decreasing melting points down the group, as francium's melting point is known so poorly, having been variously been stated to be around 23°C or 27°C, with both values very close to the caesium value (28.5°C), possibly due to the extreme heat generated by francium's radioactive decay. The boiling point of ununennium is expected to be around 630°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group, following the downward periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been variously predicted to be between 3 and 4g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density down the group, using the <b>predicted</b> <b>value</b> for francium between 2.8 and 3.0g·cm−3.|$|E

25|$|The {{fortification}} {{program was}} estimated to raise a person’s folic acid intake level by 70–130µg/day; however, an increase of almost double that amount was actually observed. This could be {{from the fact that}} many foods are over fortified by 160–175% the <b>predicted</b> <b>value.</b> In addition, much of the elder population take supplements that adds 400µg to their daily folic acid intake. This is a concern because 70–80% of the population have detectable levels of unmetabolized folic acid in their blood and high intakes can accelerate the growth of preneoplastic lesions. It is still unknown the amount of folic acid supplementation that might cause harm.|$|E

Methods: Forced spirometry was performed, {{in accordance with the}} Brazilian Thoracic Society guidelines, in 643 nonsmoking adult Caucasians. The <b>predicted</b> <b>values</b> obtained by Brazilian researchers in 1992 and those obtained by four groups of foreign researchers were compared with the new Brazilian <b>predicted</b> <b>values</b> obtained in 2006.

25|$|Significance {{testing has}} been the favored {{statistical}} tool in some experimental social sciences (over 90% of articles in the Journal of Applied Psychology during the early 1990s). Other fields have favored the estimation of parameters (e.g., effect size). Significance testing {{is used as a}} substitute for the traditional comparison of <b>predicted</b> <b>value</b> and experimental result {{at the core of the}} scientific method. When theory is only capable of predicting the sign of a relationship, a directional (one-sided) hypothesis test can be configured so that only a statistically significant result supports theory. This form of theory appraisal is the most heavily criticized application of hypothesis testing.|$|E
25|$|At first, the {{predictions}} of Einstein's formula were seemingly refuted {{by a series of}} experiments by Svedberg in 1906 and 1907, which gave displacements of the particles as 4 to 6 times the <b>predicted</b> <b>value,</b> and by Henri in 1908 who found displacements 3 times greater than Einstein's formula predicted. But Einstein's predictions were finally confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by Chaudesaigues in 1908 and Perrin in 1909. The confirmation of Einstein's theory constituted empirical progress for the kinetic theory of heat. In essence, Einstein showed that the motion can be predicted directly from the kinetic model of thermal equilibrium. The importance of the theory lay in the fact that it confirmed the kinetic theory's account of the second law of thermodynamics as being an essentially statistical law.|$|E
25|$|The {{physics of}} the quark–gluon plasma is governed by a theory called quantum chromodynamics, but this theory is mathematically {{intractable}} in problems involving the quark–gluon plasma. In an article appearing in 2005, Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators showed that the AdS/CFT correspondence {{could be used to}} understand some aspects of the quark–gluon plasma by describing it in the language of string theory. By applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, Sơn and his collaborators were able to describe the quark gluon plasma in terms of black holes in five-dimensional spacetime. The calculation showed that the ratio of two quantities associated with the quark–gluon plasma, the shear viscosity and volume density of entropy, should be approximately equal to a certain universal constant. In 2008, the <b>predicted</b> <b>value</b> of this ratio for the quark–gluon plasma was confirmed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
