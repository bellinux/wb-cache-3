50|$|The carrier is an RF signal, {{typically}} of microwave frequencies, {{which is}} usually (but not always) modulated to allow the system to capture the required data. In simple ranging radars, the carrier will be pulse modulated and in continuous wave systems, such as Doppler radar, modulation may not be required. Most systems use <b>pulse</b> <b>modulation,</b> with or without other supplementary modulating signals. Note that with <b>pulse</b> <b>modulation,</b> the carrier is simply switched on and off {{in sync with the}} pulses; the modulating waveform does not actually exist in the transmitted signal and the envelope of the pulse waveform is extracted from the demodulated carrier in the receiver. Although obvious when described, this point is often missed when pulse transmissions are first studied, leading to misunderstandings {{about the nature of the}} signal.|$|E

50|$|Moving {{surfaces}} cause amplitude, Doppler frequency, and <b>pulse</b> <b>modulation</b> of the return. The {{amplitude modulation}} comes from moving surfaces of different reflectivity and angle of reflection. Doppler shifting of the returned signals {{is a function}} of the radar carrier frequency, as well as the speed of the radar source and target, with positive Doppler shift from surfaces moving toward the illuminator and negative shift of surfaces moving away from it. Moving surfaces impose a pulse width modulation.|$|E

Young suggested using <b>pulse</b> <b>modulation,</b> with the height possibly determined from the lapsed time between transmitted and received pulses.

50|$|Early radio-based {{detection}} in the Netherlands was along {{two independent}} lines: one a microwave {{system at the}} firm Philips {{and the other a}} VHF system at a laboratory of the Armed Forces. The Philips Company in Eindhoven, Netherlands, operated Natuurkundig Laboratorium (NatLab) for fundamental research related to its products. NatLab researcher Klaas Posthumus developed a magnetron split into four elements. In developing a communication system using this magnetron, C.H.J.A. Staal was testing the transmission by using parabolic transmitting and receiving antennas set side-by-side, both aimed at a large plate some distance away. To overcome frequency instability of the magnetron, <b>pulse</b> <b>modulation</b> was used. It was found that the plate reflected a strong signal.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{high-end}} hobby systems using Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM) features {{have come}} on the market that provide a digital bit-stream signal to the receiving device instead of analog type <b>pulse</b> <b>modulation.</b> Advantages include bit error checking capabilities of the data stream (good for signal integrity checking) and fail-safe options including motor (if the model has a motor) throttle down and similar automatic actions based on signal loss. However, those systems that use pulse code modulation generally induce more lag due to lesser frames sent per second as bandwidth is needed for error checking bits. PCM devices can only detect errors and thus hold the last verified position or go into failsafe mode. They cannot correct transmission errors.|$|E

Segment length is limited to 100 meters. Multiple segments can be combined to form longer networks. In this case it is necessary to assure that every slave is only two repeaters 'away' from the network master.

Lacking success with microwaves, Hershberger visited the NRL (where he had earlier worked) and saw a demonstration of their pulsed set. Back at the SCL, he and Robert H.

50|$|RF signal {{generators}} {{are capable of}} producing CW (continuous wave) tones. The output frequency can usually be tuned anywhere in their frequency range. Many models offer various types of analog modulation, either as standard equipment or as an optional capability to the base unit. This could include AM, FM, ΦM (phase modulation) and <b>pulse</b> <b>modulation.</b> Another common feature is a built-in attenuator which {{makes it possible to}} vary the signal’s output power. Depending on the manufacturer and model, output powers can range from -135 to +30 dBm. A wide range of output power is desirable, since different applications require different amounts of signal power. For example, if a signal has to travel through a very long cable out to an antenna, a high output signal may be needed to overcome the losses through the cable and still have sufficient power at the antenna. But when testing receiver sensitivity, a low signal level is required to see how the receiver behaves under low signal-to-noise conditions.|$|E

During the coasting period, automatic visual recognition of landmarks on the lunar surface is {{used to determine the}} lander's precise location and to ensure correct positioning {{at the beginning of the}} final descent. Heading towards the south pole, the lander enters the final powered descent phase. Using its cluster of thrusters, the lander decelerates and descends.

Finer thrust levels are achieved using the ATV engines in <b>pulse</b> <b>modulation,</b> as shown in this [...] At an altitude of few kilometres, the Hazard Detection and Avoidance system (HDA) is able to see the primary landing site and to evaluate it. If the primary site is deemed unsafe, due to the presence of surface hazards (like steep slopes, craters, boulders, shadows, etc.), the HDA has the opportunity to command re-targetings to a secondary landing site. When a safe landing site is found, the lander performs a soft touch down using its legs.|$|E
