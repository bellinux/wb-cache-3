5|$|Stowe's house, {{which was}} {{located on the}} bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats {{shuffling}} tourists from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and <b>peek</b> <b>into</b> the windows of the home. One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of each round each player is dealt ten cards, with the two remaining cards (the so-called Skat) being put face {{down in the middle of}} the table. Dealing follows this pattern: deal three cards each, then deal the Skat, then four cards each, then three cards again (“three–Skat–four–three”). In four-player rounds, the dealer does not receive any cards and skips actual play of the round. He or she may <b>peek</b> <b>into</b> the hand of one other player (if allowed to do so) but never into the Skat.|$|E

500|$|Ron Powers of the Chicago Sun Times {{called the}} {{documentary}} [...] "highly recommended viewing", and described it as: [...] "...both {{as an example}} of skeptical, unimpressed (but never vicious) journalism, and as a <b>peek</b> <b>into</b> the future of television...a clever, ironic and eventually devastating documentary". [...] Electronic Arts Intermix described Lord of the Universe as [...] "a forceful expose on the sixteen-year-old Guru Maharaj Ji and the national gathering of his followers at the Houston Astrodome". [...] Michael Blowen of The Boston Globe wrote that the documentary [...] "captures the absurdity of Millennium '73", and that [...] "The desperation of flower people alienated from politics is both touching and hilarious as they offer hope for eternal life to other converts." ...|$|E

At least not in the United States." [...] The song has a [...] "totally unexpected ending for a song told as a flashback." [...] The album ends with [...] "Nature Feels", a reinterpretation of MGMT's [...] "Electric Feel". The song exhibits Ocean as an [...] "openly fun character", opening the song with the line [...] "I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden." [...] According to Pitchfork, no matter the mood, Ocean is always [...] "quick to add fine particulars that make his songs his songs". Pitchfork called [...] "Nature Feel" [...] an [...] "MGMT-sampling Garden of Eden fuck ode".|$|E

On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 5 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Omar Burgess of HipHopDX classified the album as [...] "Pop-tinged Horrorcore {{of the highest}} order", praising its [...] "catchy hooks, accessible production and subject matter" [...] as well as [...] "Hopsin's raw technical ability" [...] with regards to lyricism and wordplay. In the end Burgess said, [...] "When he [...] strikes the perfect balance between shock value, raw emotion and his immense skill set, that moment may yield a classic album." [...] Sheldon Pierce of XXL called Knock Madness [...] "a stepping stone album, one that can only produce even better music in the future", and noted that the album did well to [...] "serve as a <b>peek</b> <b>into</b> the wildly entertaining thought process of one of hip-hop's most misunderstood characters." ...|$|E

500|$|The season {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics. Ramsey Isler of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "There {{was a time when}} [...] was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared", but added, [...] "That's not to say that FG hasn't been good at all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, [...] "Road to the Multiverse", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline". He listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag", [...] "Jerome Is the New Black", [...] "Go Stewie Go", [...] "Peter-assment" [...] and [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as the worst episodes of the season. Isler praised the [...] "tail end of the season", however, citing [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as [...] "one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, [...] "The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or not, because they are simply funny." [...] Rizzo commented on the DVD release: [...] "Fans of Family Guy, or any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, have to be concerned that the very reason the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries that give you a <b>peek</b> <b>into</b> the show's creation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mira's death left Baciu in near-complete {{isolation}} from the Romanian-speaking public. As he later noted: [...] "I literally {{have no one to}} whom I would read the things I write.

[...] He honored her memory with a 1979 semi-autobiographical novel, eponymously titled Mira. A new volume of his memoirs saw print in Honolulu in 1980, as Praful de pe tobă ("The Dust on the Drum").

If some viewers chose to read that into the dialogue, etc., that's their point of view, but certainly not ours. Writer Theodore Sturgeon was trying to reveal Spock's inner human in a struggle with what his culture, his upbringing and his half-human/half-Vulcan heritage had instilled in him about emotion and controlling it in an out-of-control situation. It also was a <b>peek</b> <b>into</b> the Vulcan culture {{that no one had}} seen before. That's ALL we were doing. I've heard this nonsense (especially about Kirk/Spock) for years. There is no basis to it. I hope this answer is helpful to you" ...|$|E
