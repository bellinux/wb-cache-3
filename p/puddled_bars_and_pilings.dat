5000|$|In {{the fully}} {{developed}} process (of Hall), this metal was placed into the hearth of the puddling furnace {{where it was}} melted. The hearth was lined with oxidizing agents such as haematite and iron oxide. The mixture was subjected to a strong current of air and stirred with long <b>bars,</b> called <b>puddling</b> <b>bars</b> or rabbles, through working doors. The air, the stirring, and the [...] "boiling" [...] action of the metal helped the oxidizing agents to oxidize the impurities and carbon out of the pig iron. As the impurities oxidize, they formed a molten slag or drifted off as gas while the retaining iron solidified into spongy wrought iron that floated {{to the top of}} the puddle and were fished out of the melt as puddle balls using <b>puddle</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species may}} have {{originated}} in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, but has spread around the world. It tunnels into underwater piers <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> <b>and</b> is {{a major cause of}} damage and destruction to submarine timber structures and the hulls of wooden boats.|$|R
50|$|Mytilopsis leucophaeata {{is found}} in {{brackish}} water, at salinities ranging from 0.5 psu to about 12 psu, although its upper salinity limit is usually about 5-6 psu. It attaches to hard substrates, including oyster and true mussel shells and cages for them, rocks, boats, <b>and</b> <b>pilings,</b> <b>and</b> also to ropes.|$|R
5000|$|The bloom {{was passed}} through rollers <b>and</b> to produce <b>bars.</b> The bars of wrought iron were of poor quality, called muck <b>bars</b> or <b>puddle</b> <b>bars.</b> [...] To improve their quality, the bars were cut up, piled and tied {{together}} by wires, {{a process known}} as faggoting or piling. [...] They were then reheated and rolled again in merchant rolls. The process could be repeated several times to produce wrought iron of desired quality. Wrought iron that has been rolled multiple times is called merchant bar or merchant iron.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} months of 1888 and 1889, Richardson worked under {{government}} contract moving scows of rock <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> for the construction work on jetties {{at the mouth of}} Yaquina Bay.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} common on rocks, shells, <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> in {{protected}} bays, {{but it also}} lives in sheltered places on the open coast, occurring from the low intertidal zone to subtidal waters.|$|R
5000|$|The native {{range of}} Mycale grandis is Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and India. It {{has spread to}} Mexico and to Hawaii where it is {{considered}} an invasive species. It {{is part of the}} fouling community and is found on man made structures such as harbour walls, wharves <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> <b>and</b> in disturbed habitats such as freshly dredged channels and lagoons.|$|R
50|$|The timber {{is light}} to mid reddish-brown and fine grained. It {{is used for}} {{building}} bridges <b>and</b> <b>pilings,</b> for making coffins, boxes, crates, furniture and plywood. It also makes a good firewood that burns steadily.|$|R
50|$|Stylochidae is {{a family}} of Turbellarian Flatworms. It {{includes}} the species Stylochus zebra, which usually lives in shells occupied by the hermit crab Pagurus pollicaris, though it can sometimes be found free living on rocks <b>and</b> <b>pilings.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1913, the Rincon Sea Level Road opened between Santa Barbara and Ventura. Portions of {{the road}} through this area were causeways {{constructed}} on wood planks <b>and</b> <b>pilings,</b> as the area was only passable before at low tide.|$|R
2500|$|On Tuesday, January 8, 1918, Nestor was towing a {{pile driver}} on the Cowlitz River when a serious {{accident}} occurred. [...] Nestor {{was on the}} way upstream, with the driver to be used to replace dolphins <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> at lumber camps.|$|R
50|$|Urticina lofotensis {{is found}} in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific coast of North America. It occurs between low water mark and a depth of about 15 m. It is found on rocks <b>and</b> <b>pilings,</b> in crevices <b>and</b> gullies and favours exposed {{habitats}} with fast moving water.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} found in the Gulf of Mexico. It prefers inshore {{shallows}} especially near rocks <b>and</b> <b>pilings.</b> According to a New York Times article (May 15, 2016), written by Jonathan Balcombe, the frillfin goby displays amazing feats of memory and strategy to survive in tide pools at low tide.|$|R
50|$|Small waves were {{expected}} in Southern California, and receding was reported at Long Beach. Minor damage was reported on some coastal areas. The tsunami damaged navigation buoys at Ventura. Additionally, a boat was torn loose from its mooring and minor erosion occurred within Ventura Harbor. Damage to docks <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> {{in the area}} was moderate.|$|R
50|$|Either {{white cast}} iron or refined iron is then placed in hearth of the furnace, {{a process known as}} charging. For wet puddling, scrap iron and/or iron oxide is also charged. This mixture is then heated until the top melts, {{allowing}} for the oxides to begin mixing; this usually takes 30 minutes. This mixture is subjected to a strong current of air and stirred by long bars with hooks on one end, called <b>puddling</b> <b>bars</b> or rabbles, through doors in the furnace. This helps the oxygen from the oxides to react with impurities in the pig iron, notably silicon, manganese (to form slag) and to some degree sulfur and phosphorus, which form gases that escape with the exhaust of the furnace.|$|R
50|$|Echinaster spinulosus {{is found}} in the western Atlantic from Cape Hatteras and the Gulf Coast southwards to Venezuela, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Its typical {{habitats}} include sandy bottoms, seagrass meadows (Zostera spp.), oyster beds, stony flats <b>and</b> <b>pilings.</b> It is a common species and is found at depths between 10 and 20 m.|$|R
40|$|Although Parablennius {{has been}} known to occur in the Hawaiian Islands (Oahu) since about 1971 - 1972, it was not {{possible}} until recently to identify the species. The presence of adults on the fouling of buoys <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> at Oahu, <b>and</b> larvae in the plankton, are the only records of P. thysanius east of the Philippines...|$|R
50|$|Rhizophora mucronata has {{multiple}} uses. It {{is used to}} help prevent coastal erosion and in restoration of mangrove habitats. The timber is used for firewood and {{in the construction of}} buildings, as poles <b>and</b> <b>pilings,</b> <b>and</b> in making fish traps. The fruits can be cooked and eaten or the juice extracted to make wine, and the young shoots can be consumed as a vegetable. The bark is used in tanning and a dye can be extracted from both bark and leaves. Various parts of the plant are used in folk medicine.|$|R
50|$|The type {{location}} of Aplidium solidum is Pemba Island, Tanzania {{and it is}} also found in Australian waters. It occurs on the west coast of North America from British Columbia south to California where it is common on rocks, especially among the holdfasts of kelp forests, <b>and</b> <b>pilings.</b> It occurs in the intertidal zone and at depths down to 40 metres.|$|R
5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land. They inhabit the splash zone on rocky shores, jetties <b>and</b> <b>pilings,</b> may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.|$|R
2500|$|In 1940, Commodore Edward Turner built a {{large house}} on a barge <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> near Crawfish Eddie's and named it the Quarterdeck Club. When it opened in November, {{membership}} cost $150 by invitation only and the club {{became one of the}} most popular spots in Miami.

40|$|Copyright Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. Foraging by {{predatory fish}} {{is thought to}} be one of the primary {{ecological}} processes affecting the abundances of plants and animals in subtidal habitats. The importance of this process was assessed on the subtidal surfaces of urban structures (pontoons <b>and</b> <b>pilings)</b> that represent major coastal habitats for marine organisms. Fish feed with greater intensity on epibiota attached to <b>pilings</b> than pontoons <b>and</b> it was hypothesised that greater predation on pilings explained why the structure of epibiotic assemblages differs between these habitats. I predicted that the structure of epibiotic assemblages would develop differently between <b>pilings</b> <b>and</b> pontoons in the presence of fish (plates open to predation) but not in the absence of fish (plates inside exclusion cages). Results revealed large differences in abundance between <b>pilings</b> <b>and</b> pontoons that were largely independent of the caged and uncaged plates. Predation may be intense (as it appeared on pilings) but unimportant because it does not explain observed abundances of prey (epibiota between <b>pilings</b> <b>and</b> pontoons). S. D.

50|$|In 1848, Henry Potter Burt founded Burt, Boulton Holdings Ltd. in England, {{a company}} that {{specialized}} in treating timber against rot from moisture. The company used substances, such as creosote derived from coal tar, to prolong lumber's useful life, supplying railway ties <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> for wharves <b>and</b> foundations throughout Europe and the British Empire. Within eleven years Burt, Boulton was exporting to North America and acquired a sawmill in Quebec's Eastern Townships.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, severe rain {{caused a}} {{landslide}} that washed out the earth under {{the east and}} south sides of the property, leaving the swimming pool unsupported. Neutra had insisted on the house being secured to bedrock, so the structure itself was not in danger. Concrete retaining walls <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> drilled down to bedrock were built, and earth was back-filled to support the pool and hillside. The result was a slightly larger backyard garden area.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} deteriorated {{after the}} light was automated in 1926, and was demolished in 1953. A skeletal tower was erected on the original pilings to hold the light. A new skeletal tower was built on new <b>pilings</b> in 1985, <b>and</b> the old tower <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> removed. This new tower was destroyed by Hurricane Charley in 2004. The lantern from the old lighthouse eventually ended up mounted on a private lighthouse in Key Largo.|$|R
50|$|The Port of Brookings Harbor {{was damaged}} by tidal surges from a tsunami on March 11, 2011. The largest surge was {{estimated}} to be nearly 8 ft. Boats were damaged, sunk, set adrift, and swept out to sea after many docks were torn away <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> broken. The tsunami was caused by the 9.0 MW TÅhoku earthquake offshore of the east coast of Honshu Island, Japan. The damage was estimated at $25 million to $30 million.|$|R
50|$|The steam {{schooner}} the SS Tongass {{arrived and}} dropped overboard tons of lumber <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> {{in front of}} the town, despite Raatikainen's lack of funds. DeArmond was the one that had to request that the captain of the Tongass defer the payment. A sawmill and other supplies were loaded on rafts and dragged ashore. The SS Tongass would be the only steamer into Pelican {{for the next few years}} with supplies but not on regular basis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thermomechanical {{processing}} (TMP) involves both thermal {{and mechanical}} treatments that define both product shape and microstructure/properties. Since the industrial revolution, machines of augmented power, size and precision have {{given rise to}} TMP that challenged explanation of the crystal mechanisms. In wrought iron, lamellar ferrite exhibited high transverse crack resistance due to fine slag stringers that as flux facilitated welding of <b>puddled</b> <b>bars</b> in forging of shafts or rolling of plates for bell-welding into pressure tight pipes; the substructure developed in the iron as working continued below 900 ËC strengthened it. Patenting of high C steel wire led to an optimum cold-drawn structure for outstanding strength and toughness. Hot forming technology, combined with the refining potential for austenite decomposition gave rise to controlled rolling for enhanced ferrite nucleation, ausforming to refine martensite and intercritical rolling to deform the ferrite or to spheroidize the carbides. Cold rolling and annealing have been scheduled to impart suitable strength, grain size, substructure and texture...|$|R
5000|$|The larvae of most genera are xylophagous, boring tunnels in spongy, damp wood in an {{advanced}} state of decomposition; thus {{they have little}} economic importance, {{with the exception of}} one species, the [...] "wharf borer" [...] (Nacerdes melanura), that is ever known to attain pest status, as its larvae bore into wet wood in coastal areas; larvae can also bore into wood located in the tidal zone so at times are submerged by seawater, and can damage docks, wharves, <b>and</b> <b>pilings.</b> Larvae of the genera Oedemera and Stenostoma develop in dead stems of herbaceous plants.|$|R
50|$|Wood (<b>and</b> other) <b>pilings</b> {{are used}} for {{supports}} in structures raised above water, for docks, piers, jettys, bridges, oil platforms, and lighthouses. These must be treated specially to avoid corrosion.|$|R
50|$|Many {{locations}} and areas {{need to be}} protected by walls <b>and</b> sheet <b>pilings</b> during floods. A number of districts become waterlogged if the Elbe overflows across some of its former floodplains.|$|R
50|$|In August 1976, The Yancey {{purchased}} a secondhand GE 65-ton switcher, numbered 3. Number 1 was then {{sold to the}} Sigri Great Lakes Carbon facility in Morganton, North Carolina as an industrial switcher. To increase revenue, the railroad began storing boxcars (mostly National Railway Utilization cars lettered for the Pickens Railroad) {{on the line from}} Micaville to Bowditch. More flooding in 1977 damaged sections of the track in spots as well as weakened the piers <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> on the bridge over the North Toe River. This resulted in the loss of much of the Yancey's remaining freight customers.|$|R
50|$|The first Saltair, {{completed}} in 1893, was jointly {{owned by a}} corporation associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Salt Lake & Los Angeles Railway (later renamed as the Salt Lake, Garfield and Western Railway), which was constructed {{for the express purpose}} of serving the resort. Saltair was not the first resort built on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, but was the most successful ever built. It was designed by well-known Utah architect Richard K.A. Kletting and rested on over 2,000 posts <b>and</b> <b>pilings,</b> many of which remain and are still visible over 110 years later.|$|R
50|$|Though boating {{and fishing}} are {{popular in the}} area, {{there is only one}} boat launch with two {{seasonal}} docks and no marina in the city. At one point there were two boathouses on the waterfront, Mukilteo Boat House and McConnell's Boathouse, but both have been demolished and replaced with a condominium apartment building and a hotel respectively. The Lighthouse Park area <b>and</b> <b>pilings</b> near the ferry dock and hotel are popular places for local divers, due to the diversity of sea life and presence of squid. There are two public fishing piers, one {{on each side of the}} Ivar's restaurant.|$|R
