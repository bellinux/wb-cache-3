40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the proposals under {{discussion in the}} Brazilian Congress concerning the direct elections for Mercosur Parliament (<b>Parlasur),</b> originally planned to be held on 2014. The proposed rules are investigated {{in order to find}} out which changes may impact the profile of the new representation to be elected and the consequences by either strengthening or weakening the institutional role of Brazilian representation in <b>Parlasur.</b> Pending electoral legislation for <b>Parlasur</b> may represent the most important experiment in political reform in the country in recent years - changing the open list of candidates to the closed list (with strict party nomination), prohibiting party coalitions, establishing exclusive public financing of campaigns, besides rules targeting gender equality. Notwithstanding, if members of congress do not strengthen reform to provide a more robust institutional framework, Brazilian representation in <b>Parlasur</b> will be weakened rather than strengthened...|$|E
40|$|The Mercosur Parliament (<b>Parlasur),</b> {{created in}} December 2006, is often {{considered}} an important institutional achievement. Although Parliamentâ€™s functions and competences are not large, {{it should be}} formed by directly elected representatives. Its Constitutive Protocol affirms the necessity of reinforcing and deepening the integration process. According to the document, {{it is essential to}} have an efficient and balanced institutional structure, which would contribute to the production of effective norms in an atmosphere of security and stability. Official speeches from Executive and Legislative authorities of member states tend to go in the same direction, asserting the democratic role of the assembly. Consequently, expectations about the performance of <b>Parlasur</b> are high among non-state actors involved with the integration process: some seem to believe that this new institution could conduct more vigorously the discussions to the political and social spheres, which would allow Mercosur to transcend the commercial aspects and strengthen the integration framework. If we accept the idea that the more institutionalized the legislature is, the more it will influence the political system, the institutionalization level of <b>Parlasur</b> can indicate at what extend these prospects are valid. This paper has therefore a double objective. First, it aims at analyzing the limited institutionalization of the assembly in terms of autonomy, complexity, universalization and socialization. Second, it searches to explain the gap between discourses about <b>Parlasur</b> and its current actions. The qualitative research intends to confront public declarations with minutes and verbatim reports of plenary sessions as well as with interviews conducted with members of the Parliament and national civil servants. The conclusions will hopefully help to understand the place of <b>Parlasur</b> within the rhetorical integration of Mercosur and its concrete possibilities of influencing regionalism and democracy in Latin America...|$|E
40|$|The MERCOSUR Parliament {{was created}} in order to {{facilitate}} the integration process of this organization and provide a balanced institutional framework to ensure a climate of greater certainty and predictability. However, these objectives have not been fulfilled for the most part given that the work produced by the Parliament, the commissions and its observatory bodies has been insignificant. Many of these problems will continue until Member Parliaments are no longer elected by direct vote and <b>Parlasur</b> becomes known by most of the citizens it represents.   </p...|$|E

40|$|Spillover’ {{refers to}} the inner {{dynamics}} whereby {{the members of a}} regional scheme feel compelled to either enlarging the scope or increasing the level of their mutual commitments or both. It is promoted by actions crystallized into institutions, whose performance creates demand for further action and incremental institution-building. In the case of the EU, the institutions commonly acknowledged as greatest ‘spillover promoters’ are the Commission, the Court, and the European Parliament; in Mercosur there are no functional equivalents to the two former institutions yet, but a common Parliament (<b>Parlasur)</b> has been established and is often purported as a potential engine of integration. This paper addresses its structure and performance in order to assess whether it has produced, or may produce, some kind of spillover by either fostering new regional dynamics or cajoling national governments into upgrading their commitments to the region...|$|E
