5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed with her head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that <b>peers</b> <b>out</b> at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E
500|$|Sleipnir is {{generally}} considered as appearing in a sequence of events described in book I of Gesta Danorum. In book I, the young Hadingus encounters [...] "a certain man of great age who had lost an eye" [...] who allies him with Liserus. Hadingus and Liserus set out to wage war on Lokerus, ruler of Kurland. Meeting defeat, the old man takes Hadingus with him onto his horse as they flee to the old man's house, and the two drink an invigorating drought. The old man sings a prophecy, and takes Hadingus back to where he found him on his horse. During the ride back, Hadingus trembles beneath the old man's mantle, and <b>peers</b> <b>out</b> of its holes. Hadingus realizes that he is flying through the air: [...] "and he saw that before {{the steps of the}} horse lay the sea; but was told not to steal a glimpse of the forbidden thing, and therefore turned his amazed eyes from the dread spectacle of the roads that he journeyed." [...] Additionally, in book II, Biarco mentions Odin and Sleipnir: [...] "If I may look on the awful husband of Frigg, howsoever he be covered in his white shield, and guide his tall steed, he shall in no way go safe out of Leire; it is lawful to lay low in war the war-waging god." ...|$|E
500|$|As an Irishwoman, Streep acted {{opposite}} Michael Gambon and Catherine McCormack in Pat O'Connor's Dancing at Lughnasa (1998), {{which was}} {{entered into the}} Venice Film Festival in its year of release. [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked that [...] "Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career, but the way she simply <b>peers</b> <b>out</b> a window in Dancing at Lughnasa ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze". Later that year, Streep played a cancer sufferer caught in a difficult family situation, playing the mother of Renée Zellweger and wife of William Hurt in One True Thing. The film gained positive reviews. Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle declared: [...] "After 'One True Thing', critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined. She is so instinctive and natural – so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration – that she's able {{to give us a}} woman who's at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable." [...] Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan noted that Streep's role [...] "is one of the least self-consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career" [...] but that she [...] "adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [...] one of her most moving".|$|E

[...] He occasionally painted depictions of Italy, including his well-known [...] "En gondol" [...] ("A Gondola") from 1859, a view looking out from the dark interior of a covered gondola. [...] A young woman at the left-hand side of the canvas <b>peers</b> <b>out</b> from the dark; a gondolier on the right-hand side of the central archway leans in towards the center of the painting, bathed in light.

These cartoons are The Honey-Mousers (1956), Cheese It, the Cat! (1957), and Mice Follies (1960). Human caricatures of Ralph and Ed are pitted against Bugs Bunny in the 1956 Warner cartoon Half-Fare Hare. And in another cartoon, A Bird in a Bonnet (1958), when Sylvester falls into an open manhole, inside a voice like Ed Norton's says, [...] "Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hey, look at this, Ralph, a pussycat."

2500|$|Several {{aspects of}} Kiki's {{behavior}} and appearance {{have been the}} focus of commentary. One major theme is Kiki's transition into adulthood. While being raised by loving parents who support her independence, [...] Kiki is faced with problems common in adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself. The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling noted a scene during Kiki's first night away from home, staying with the bakers: [...] Early in the morning, she quickly steps out of her room into the outhouses and <b>peers</b> <b>out</b> to see the husband, Fukuo, stretching his muscles. After he leaves the scene, Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her while gasping for air. [...] "The scene does absolutely nothing to advance the plot and the humor in it is low...but...it wordlessly — and eloquently — expresses Kiki's youth, vulnerability, and isolation." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{conception}} of democracy {{to which the}} Marxist adheres is that same mystical democracy that was evolved at the first French Revolution; it will sanction no analysis of the popular wisdom.

Even {{a large proportion of the}} adults will not do--it must be all. The mysterious spirit that thus <b>peers</b> <b>out</b> and vanishes again at each election is the People, not any particular person, but the quintessence, and it is supposed to be infallible; it is supposed to be not only morally but intellectually omniscient. It will not even countenance the individuality of elected persons, they are to be mere tools, delegates, from this diffused, intangible Oracle, the Ultimate Wisdom....|$|E
