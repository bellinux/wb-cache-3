In these devices, the high kinetic inductance of junctions and the thin film thickness (50 nm) pose special challenges in optimizing the field coupling.

To explore the technique for achieving a high field sensitivity, single-layer devices with a directly connected <b>pickup</b> <b>loop</b> and flip-chip devices with an inductively coupled flux transformer using a two-level coupling approach were fabricated and tested.

Many properties of the high-{Tc} superconductors are determined by their order parameter, which is a wavefunction describing the superconducting condensate. The symmetry of the order parameter in cuprates {{has been the subject of}} intensive investigation, leading to conflicting sets of results.

The first part of this thesis is an experimental study of the symmetry of the order parameter in YBa{sub 2 }C u{sub 3 }O{sub 7 {minus}{delta}}. A new class of phase sensitive experiments is described that involve Josephson tunneling along the c-axis of twinned crystals of YBa{sub 2 }Cu{sub 3 }O{sub 7 {minus}{delta}}. These experiments showed that an s-wave component must reverse sign across the twin boundary, providing direct evidence for a mixed, s+d symmetry of the order parameter in YBa{sub 2 }Cu{sub 3 }O{sub 7 {minus}{delta}}, and thereby reconciling two conflicting sets of previous findings and establishing the dominant d-wave pairing symmetry.

A new search of neutron EDM, to be conducted at the spallation neutron source (SNS) at ORNL, is designed to improve the present experimental limit of ∼ 10 − 26 e·cm by two orders of magnitude. The experiment is based on the magnetic-resonance technique in which polarized neutrons precess at the Larmor frequency when placed in a static magnetic field; a non-zero EDM would be evident as a difference in precession frequency when a strong external electric field is applied parallel vs. anti-parallel to the magnetic field. In addition to its role as neutron spin-analyzer via the spin-dependent n+ 3 He nuclear capture reaction, polarized helium- 3 (which has negligible EDM) will serve as co-magnetometer to correct for drifts in the magnetic field. In one of the two methods that will be built into the apparatus, the helium- 3 precession signal is read out by SQUID-based gradiometers. We present a design study of a SQUID system suitable for the neutron EDM apparatus, and discuss using very long leads between the <b>pickup</b> <b>loop</b> and the SQUID.

40|$|Damped free {{oscillations}} of the magnetization {{have been}} clearly observed {{at the completion}} of 180 ° flux reversal along both the easy and the hard axis in Ni-Fe thin films. The flux component perpendicular to the applied pulse field was observed using a single turn <b>pickup</b> <b>loop</b> around the film. The frequency of the oscillation was studied as a function of applied pulse field and compared with the results obtained by ferromagnetic resonance. The frequency of the damped free oscillation agreed quite well with that obtained by resonance when the frequency was measured after the oscillation had damped to small amplitude. The damping constant obtained from the decay of the oscillation agreed quite well with that obtained from the half-power line-width of the resonance curve. The Landau-Lifshitz equation proposed for the coherent rotation, using the value of the damping constant obtained by resonance, could describe the initial part of the magnetization reversal and the damped free oscillation in the films with low angular dispersion. Agreement between the experimental and the calculated transverse flux change for the entire waveform could not be obtained by using the value of damping constant obtained by resonance. The agreement was better at both higher applied field or lower anisotropy dispersion. The effect of eddy currents was negligible on the flux reversal but appeared as a slight increase of the damping constant obtained by resonance experiment. </p...|$|E
