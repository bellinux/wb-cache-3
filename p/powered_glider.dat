25|$|The prototype, {{registered}} N2RY, {{serial number}} 001, {{was completed in}} 1976. The type was certified on 29 July 1983 under separate type certificates for both FAR Part 23 and Part 26 as a light aircraft and also as a <b>powered</b> <b>glider,</b> for day visual flight rules flight only. The aircraft is also certified for aerobatics. Production was planned, but the elder Ryan died on 11 September 1982 at age 84 and no aircraft beyond the one prototype were produced. In March 2011 the prototype ST-100 was still owned by Ryson Aviation of San Diego.|$|E

2500|$|... 19 September 1903 Scientific American {{reported}} Whitehead made <b>powered</b> <b>glider</b> {{flights in}} a triplane machine towed by an assistant pulling a rope: [...] "By {{running with the}} machine against the wind after the motor had been started, the aeroplane was made to skim along above the ground at heights of from 3 to 16 feet for a distance, without the operator touching, of about 350 yards. It was possible to have traveled a much longer distance, without the operator touching terra firma, but for the operator's desire {{not to get too}} far above it. Although the motor was not developing its full power, owing to the speed not exceeding 1,000 R.P.M., it developed sufficient to move the machine against the wind." [...] The article said a [...] two-cycle motor powered a two-bladed [...] diameter tractor propeller. The engine shown in the article was exhibited by Whitehead at the Second Annual Exhibit of the Aero Club of America in December 1906.|$|E

5000|$|The 45 lb PBS TJ-100 {{turbine engine}} [...] {{requires}} a two-minute cooldown before retracting into the fuselage. The prototype was tested by Bob Carlton, an experienced jet <b>powered</b> <b>glider</b> pilot who flies an aerobatic routine in a Super Salto jet <b>powered</b> <b>glider</b> {{with the same}} engine.

50|$|After World War II, he {{at first}} built bicycles, mini-cars and {{motorised}} tricycles, developed the Mü-13E Bergfalke design in Tyrol, then in 1951 in Dachau founded Scheibe Flugzeugbau, originally in a barracks {{at the former}} Telefunken plant. The first Bergfalke was produced the same year, and the company also produced the Spatz single-seater. Beginning in 1957, Scheibe turned to pioneering the development of <b>powered</b> <b>gliders.</b> By his 80th birthday, Scheibe Flugzeugbau had produced some 2,200 aircraft. Scheibe continued {{to be actively involved}} in the company to an advanced age, focussing on further development of single- and two-seater <b>powered</b> <b>gliders.</b> There were usually between 50 and 60 employees.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} not certified. Under the CAR 5 {{regulations}} then {{in place in}} the USA for gliders, a certified auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>glider</b> could be flown with a non-certified engine and propeller. The engine is instead described on the Dragonfly type certificate.|$|R

50|$|After his {{retirement}} Ryan formed {{a new company}} with his son Jerome to develop and market the Ryan ST-100 Cloudster, a motor glider the elder Ryan had designed.

50|$|<b>Powered</b> <b>gliders</b> use {{electric}} motors, {{internal combustion}} engines or even jet engines to provide propulsion for a glider {{to get in}} the air. The power systems are normally only used for short periods to launch thermal soarers, motor runs of 30 seconds are typical with timer or height limiting onboard electronics cutting power automatically during competitions.|$|R

5000|$|In 1973 Heckmann flew {{alone in}} a Scheibe Falke (<b>powered</b> <b>glider)</b> from Rotenburg an der Wümme (between Bremen and Hamburg) to Perth in West Australia.

50|$|Designed by Francesco Di Martino, the Zigolo {{is based}} on the {{unpowered}} Sandlin Goat primary glider. The design priority was to produce a motor-glider which would be inexpensive to build, transport and store. It is marketed as a <b>powered</b> <b>glider</b> but qualifies in the UK as an SSDR (single-seat, deregulated) microlight. Kit build time is quoted as less than 100 hrs. It can be dismantled for transport and reassembled for flight within an hour.|$|E
50|$|On some variable-pitch propellers, {{the blades}} can be rotated {{parallel}} to the airflow to reduce drag {{in case of an}} engine failure. This is called feathering, a term borrowed from rowing. On single-engined aircraft, whether a <b>powered</b> <b>glider</b> or turbine-powered aircraft, the effect is to increase the gliding distance. On a multi-engine aircraft, feathering the propeller on a failed engine helps the aircraft maintain altitude with the reduced power from the remaining engines.|$|E

50|$|The Waco CG-15 was an American {{military}} glider, {{which was}} {{developed from the}} CG-4. Although outwardly similar to its predecessor and carrying {{the same number of}} passengers, a number of changes in the design, including shortened wings and a more streamlined nose enabled it to travel faster. 1,000 were ordered and 473 were delivered before production ceased. Two were transferred to the Navy for testing as the XLR2W-1. One unit was converted into an XPG-3 <b>powered</b> <b>glider</b> which used two Jacobs R-755-9 radial engines.|$|E
50|$|A motor glider is a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft {{that can be}} flown with or without engine power. The FAI Gliding Commission Sporting Code definition is: a fixed-wing aerodyne equipped with a means of propulsion (MoP), capable of sustained soaring flight without thrust from the means of propulsion. In the US, a <b>powered</b> <b>glider</b> may be certificated {{for up to two}} occupants, up to 850 kg maximum weight, and with a maximum ratio of weight to wing span squared of 3 kg/m2. Similar requirements exist in European JAA/EASA regulations, at a maximum weight of 750 kg.|$|E
