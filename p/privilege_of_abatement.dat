In this paper we introduce a quota system that may reduce the adverse effects of market power, and thereby result in a distribution <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> across countries that is closer to a cost-effective outcome. However, this system leads to a non-optimal distribution <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> across periods.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} policy instruments aiming at the control of environmental problems. If there is a complex relationship between economic activities and environmental effects, the use of indirect economic measures such as environmental taxes may be inefficient compared with direct abatement measures. Moreover, an optimal tax can not be assessed if the level <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> efforts is sub-optimal. This calls for an integrated approach {{to the analysis of}} environmental policy, including cost-benefit analysis <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> measures. It is shown that cost-benefit evaluations <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> should include a shadow price on environmental qualities that is likely to increase over time. The effect of this increase may outweigh the effect of discounting, thus making environmental benefits <b>of</b> present <b>abatement</b> measures in the far future count even with a high discount rate...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} a large body of {{research}} attempting to identify the correlates <b>of</b> tax <b>abatements,</b> the question <b>of</b> why cities abate taxes at widely differing rates-or indeed, not at all despite state enabling legislation allowing them-has never been completely answered. Based on an examination <b>of</b> tax <b>abatement</b> data representing the history <b>of</b> <b>abatements</b> in Michigan, the article concludes that abatement patterns can be best understood when past abatement behaviors {{and the nature of the}} local employment base are included in the analysis. In the case of the number <b>of</b> <b>abatements</b> granted, it appears that both these forces-along with the general economy, governmental structural and process factors-are important in understanding abatement behavior. When the total value <b>of</b> <b>abatements</b> is considered, industrial mix appears most critical. Once municipalities start giving tax abatements they continue to do so. And, having concentrations of transportation-related industries and food/consumer products are traits that appear to lead to that initial push for abatements.

40|$|Cooperation {{with respect}} to {{international}} environmental problems is often hampered {{by the fact that}} some countries incur net losses from cooperation. Moreover, uncertainty of damage due to variations in pollution loads is usually ignored in analyses of international environmental cooperation. This paper analyses the allocation <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen emissions among the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea as well as the corresponding distribution of the net benefits <b>of</b> <b>abatement.</b> The paper develops a simple model that accounts for uncertainty in the degradation of water quality and, hence in abatement impacts, due to the diffusion of nitrogen pollutants in the drainage basins to the coastal waters because of coastal and marine transports of the deposited nitrogen and variation in background depositions. The empirical analysis shows that no country incurs negative net benefits. Moreover, we find that the allocation <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> and the distribution of net benefits among countries change significantly for higher risk aversion. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model this paper analyses the impact of trade restrictions on regional rates of return on capital, marginal costs <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> and optimal climate policy. It will be shown that regional differences both in marginal costs <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> and in marginal productivity of capital are driven by market imperfection. With restrictions on international trade, the industrialized countries of the North exhibit higher marginal costs <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> and a lower marginal productivity of capital than the developing nations of the South. Free trade not only in carbon emission rights but also in capital increases conventional welfare but stimulates carbon dioxide emissions to grow, - an effect that is not completely offset by efficiency gains in abatement. Nevertheless, depending upon the choice of the discount rate some kind of an insensitivity result is observed.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the cost structure <b>of</b> emissions <b>abatement</b> through {{different types of}} Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. Alternative models for abatement costs are specified and estimated using CDM project-specific data. Empirical results indicate that there exist economies of scale in emission abatement through the CDM projects, and that the marginal cost <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> significantly varies across different types of projects. The distribution of various CDM project types corresponds to the relative attractiveness of the types, {{in terms of the}} structure of the estimated marginal cost function. Thus, empirical results suggest that the CDM market operates efficiently and sends the right signals to the investors, which further explains the shying away from costly carbon sequestration projects funded by many international development agencies, such as the World Bank. Contrary to the hypothesis that that the marginal costs <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> through CDM decrease over time due to experience or learning by doing, empirical results show non-decreasing marginal cost <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> over time. This finding suggests that there may be other incentives to invest in certain types of CDM projects in specific locations, thus implying location-specificity of various investment opportunities.
