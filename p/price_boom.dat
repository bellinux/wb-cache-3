40|$|Do {{housing and}} equity booms {{significantly}} raise {{the probability of}} extremely bad outcomes at the margin? This study addresses this question {{for a group of}} 8 East Asian countries. The main findings are the following: (i) Asset <b>price</b> <b>booms</b> in housing and equity markets, either separately or jointly but especially in housing, significantly raise the probability at the margin that (a) the real output gap will be in the left tail of its distribution, in which output is significantly below trend, and (b) the price-level gap will be in the right tail of its distribution, in which the price level is significantly above trend. At the margin, the risk of the occurrence of these particular tail events due to asset <b>price</b> <b>booms</b> is largely asymmetric and does not apply to the tails of good outcomes; and (ii) Expected real output and price level outcomes that are either obtained without conditioning on asset <b>price</b> <b>booms</b> or are obtained conditional on asset <b>price</b> <b>booms</b> using the normal approximation underestimate the risk of tail events and lead to less pessimistic but misleading inferences.

40|$|This study {{provides}} empirical {{evidence for the}} proposition that asset <b>price</b> <b>booms</b> matter {{because they tend to}} bring about the worst output, price, and inflation outcomes in the case of eight East Asian countries, namely, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. The main findings are: (i) asset <b>price</b> <b>booms</b> in housing and equity markets, especially in housing, significantly lower the conditional mean of real output growth and raise those of the price-level gap and inflation, and also raise the conditional variance of all three variables; and (ii) expected real output and price-level outcomes that are obtained without conditioning on asset <b>price</b> <b>booms,</b> or are obtained conditionally on asset <b>price</b> <b>booms</b> using the normal distribution, both underestimate the risk of the worst outcomes occurring and lead to less pessimistic but misleading inferences. These findings are not premised on the ability of central bankers to be able to identify correctly asset bubbles ex ante. One possible implication for monetary policy is that central bankers ought to be wary about the occurrence of any large increase in asset prices and consider an approach that is ex ante more compatible with risk management.

5000|$|The remark has {{continued}} to spark debate as {{to the extent of}} Keating's responsibility for the depth of the Recession. Former Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane has said that policymakers did not [...] "set out to have a recession in order to reduce inflation. The recession happened because of the unwinding of the excesses of the 1980s, the international recession of the early 1990s and the high interest rates". High interest rates were employed to slow the asset <b>price</b> <b>boom</b> of 1988-89. Treasurer Keating, the Reserve Bank and Treasury itself generally agreed on the need for high interest rates in 1989 and the pace of their reduction.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s {{private housing}} was {{developed}} in Docklands which with some minor exceptions {{were the first to}} be built in the area. Soon many people from outside the area saw the opportunity of buying a house close to the city at what appeared to be cheap prices. On many of the developments local council tenants were given first opportunities to buy at discounted prices but this led to a number of abuses. Then again in the later 1990s London had a huge house <b>price</b> <b>boom.</b> By encouraging the development of attractive waterside apartments along the River Thames and the old docks, the LDDC brought new, middle class residents into the area, closely followed by shops, restaurants and bars.|$|E
40|$|While {{historical}} market busts {{and financial}} crises are usually preceded by asset <b>price</b> <b>booms,</b> booms {{may not necessarily}} be predictive of busts or crises, given the rarity of these adverse events in history. This paper therefore aims to study the ability of asset <b>price</b> <b>booms</b> in the stock and the housing market to predict asset market busts as well as financial crises. This paper replicates Goetzmann’s 2015 study of global stock market bubbles, showing that the probability of a bust conditional on a boom is only slightly higher than the unconditional probability. Based on empirical evidence drawn from global market data, this paper also extends the conclusion from the stock market to the housing market, as well as from asset price busts to macroeconomic financial crises. In other words, stock and housing <b>price</b> <b>booms</b> are not strong indicators of impending busts or financial crises...|$|R

The vast expanse of the former Soviet Union, particularly that of Russia, contains a huge variety of metals, such as gold, iron, lead, titanium, uranium, and zinc. These metals are mined, but inefficiently due to the control of a few state-sponsored giants that make participation difficult for many international mining companies. Nevertheless, profits are high due to a commodity <b>price</b> <b>boom</b> in 2003/2004 caused largely by increased demand in China. Oil is Southwest Asia's most important natural resource. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait are rich in oil reserves and have benefited from recent oil price escalations.|$|E

50|$|The {{indices are}} {{calculated}} from data on repeat sales of single-family homes, an approach developed by economists Case, Shiller and Allan Weiss {{who served as}} the CEO from the company's inception to the Fiserv sale. Case developed a method for comparing repeat sales of the same homes in an effort to study home pricing trends. He was using data from house sales in Boston in the early 1980s, which was going through a housing <b>price</b> <b>boom.</b> While Case argued that such a boom was ultimately unsustainable, he had not considered it a bubble, a commonly used term to describe similar market trends. Case sat down with Shiller, who was researching behavioral finance and economic bubbles, and together formed a repeat-sales index using home sales prices data from other cities across the country. In 1991, while Weiss was in graduate school he formed an informal working relationship with Shiller. Weiss proposed to Case and Shiller to form a company, Case Shiller Weiss, to produce the index periodically with the intent of selling the information to the markets. Fiserv, an information management company, bought Case Shiller Weiss in 2002 and, together with Standard & Poor's, developed tradable indices based on the data for the markets which are now commonly called the Case-Shiller index. CoreLogic acquired the Case Shiller Weiss business from Fiserv in April 2013.|$|E
