40|$|Cybersecurity {{tends to}} be viewed as a highly dynamic, {{continually}} evolving technology race between attacker and defender. However, economic theory suggests that in many cases doing "nothing" is the optimal strategy when substantial fixed adjustment costs are present. Indeed, the authors' anecdotal experience as chief information security officers indicates that uncertain costs that might be incurred by rapid adoption of security updates substantially delay the application of recommended security controls, so the industry does appear to understand this economic aspect quite well. From a policy perspective, the inherently discontinuous adjustment path taken by firms can cause difficulties in determining the most effective <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>remit</b> and the effectiveness of any enacted policies ex post. This article summarizes this type of policy issue in relation to the contemporary cybersecurity agenda...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{significant}} advancements in the theorising of relational space through conceptual frameworks which recognise the polymorphic organisation of sociospatial relations (e. g. Territory, Place, Scale and Network). Less understood, however, are the methodological challenges inherent in ?thinking space relationally?. In particular, how can such conceptual vocabularies be sustained through the contingent practices of doing research? In this article, we address these concerns empirically through {{an analysis of the}} sociospatial responsibilities of local government actors across Wales, as new modes of spatial planning require them to think and act across administrative boundaries and policy areas. We introduce the notion of ?patch? as a means for eliciting conceptually open and grounded accounts of relational space as situated within personal/professional interests, cultures and ideologies. We identify different ways in which patch is relationally located, and how understandings of its boundaries and coherences relate to <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>remits.</b> Yet while invoking different kinds of material and imagined spatiality, patch remains largely defined by the responsibilities and resources tied to local government boundaries. Institutional configurations continue to inform the way different spaces are discursively organised and practised. We conclude by reflecting on the need for accounts of relational space to be open to its everyday material groundings in relations of fixity and flow. Gesturing towards recent studies which display complementary concerns, we consider where attentiveness to patch and other ?meaningful? spatial frames has the potential to develop geographical analyses in new directionsPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|PhD (Public Management and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{phenomenon}} of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, which encapsulates the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, has been in existence long before the political transformation {{that took place in}} South Africa in 1994. However, the ushering in of the new dispensation saw the integration of the existing <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> In addition, it inevitably heralded the introduction of the new <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> and national guidelines across all sectors of the South African <b>public</b> institutions. <b>Public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, as an integral stage of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, emerged as indispensable towards effective and efficient public service. The basic education, as a public institution, could also not be exempted from such inevitability of heightened <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation. The introduction of the new education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> included the developmental appraisal system (DAS), the whole school evaluation (WSE), the integrated quality management systems (IQMS) and the discipline and safety national guidelines (DSNG). This, consequently, bears testament to what became an inevitable transformation process in South African basic education. Using the DAS, the WSE, the IQMS and the DSNG as points of departure and Empangeni education district as a reference area, the focus of this study has been the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, the internal organisational arrangements and structures for <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation process together with its inherent challenges and an improved model aimed at alleviating or even eradicating such <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation challenges. The theoretical models, both descriptive and prescriptive, suggest that the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process, which entails namely: <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> agenda, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> formulation, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> adoption, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation and <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> evaluation, is premised on the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> models. Of all the above-listed <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process stages, <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation stands out as the pinnacle around which the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process revolves. The <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation stage, therefore, suggests a point where the influence, the impact and the successes or failures of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process unfold. In light of this inextricable link of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation stage to the general <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> process that is influenced by models, the effective <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation is, subsequently, embracive of attributes and lessons derived from the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> models. Some of these attributes and lessons, inter alia, include; the mutual participation by all actors involved, rather than dominance by an elite group (derived from the elite/mass model), the identification of institutional structures responsible for the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation (derived from the institutional model) and the accommodation of the implementation review as well as feedback (all indicative of the systems model). The literature review and the empirical data analyses show convergent views that suggest that the effective <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation is directly proportional to the extent of internal organisational arrangements and structures {{as well as to the}} basic functionality of schools as centres for the implementation process. This implies that where internal institutional arrangements and structures are evident and functional, the implementation of <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> is bound to be effective and efficient, while the contrary also holds. Given Empangeni education district being the focal point of the study, it has emerged that the use of personnel from other units and the absence of a district unit designated to solely oversee the coordination, the implementation and the evaluation of the education related <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> inhibit the potential of adequately achieving the intended objectives of the education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> implemented. In case of schools as the institutional centres for <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, empirical data analyses have established an inter-connection between the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation and the schools‟ basic functionality. Consequently, it is in functional schools (i. e. schools where the school management teams and school governing bodies are visible, effective and work collaboratively), where <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation thrives and is effective. The contextualisation of the empirical research analyses to the study focus area, Empangeni Education District (EED), established that its current implementation model faces <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation challenges. The most evident challenges, inter alia, include: * the inadequate advocacy of the education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> to be implemented; * the two or three days, currently accepted as a capacity building period by those expected to implement education related <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> are not proportional to the volume of work to be covered and it suggests an inadequate time-frame for capacity development in the EED's current model; * the material and mechanisms used to perform functional work do not accommodate all role-players (also called actors in this study) according to their demographical needs, like language, which renders them inept to perform to their optimum level; * the primary structure of the current EED's <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation model is a top-down directional structure which underscores the top-down cascading model; * current communication technology employed, do not take advantage of the 21 century‟s information computer technology in order to make the work environment more user-friendly, efficient and effective; * the simultaneous implementation of education related <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> poses a challenge to internal organisational arrangements, such as <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation (PPI) structures and personnel, for effective implementation of such policies; and * the evident inadequate continuous and deliberate monitoring of implemented education related <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> Conclusions and inferences drawn from this study suggest that the EED's current <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation model is inadequate to deal with the identified challenges. Finally, this study proposes a strengthened EED <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> model, which accommodates recommendations to EED's <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation challenges. Inherently, the proposed strengthened <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> implementation model is not limited to dealing with the identified challenges only, but it radically embraces the introduction of systems and internal organisational structures that promote inclusive, collaborative and traceable implementation of education related <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> Doctora...|$|R

Harmonising the concept of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception in Indonesia with the NYC/model law concepts [...] 7. Conclusion and recommendations. The <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception under Article V (2) (b) of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (NYC) is the most controversial ground for challenging {{enforcement of}} foreign arbitral awards. The great uncertainty as to the ambit of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception has led to inconsistent approach adopted by the courts which created problems for parties wishing to enforce foreign arbitration awards. [...] This thesis explores the complexity and inconsistent application of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception in Indonesia. It critically analyses the tendency of the Indonesian judiciary system towards the judicial application of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> in determining the enforceability of foreign arbitral awards after the ratification of the NYC, considering the distinctive feature of the Indonesian legal system and approaches that have been taken by the courts of other countries. Occasionally, reference is also made to statutory provisions in arbitration from other countries to indicate approaches that have been taken elsewhere in regard to the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception. This thesis examines whether current decisions of the Indonesian Supreme Court and the District Courts are in compliance with the pro-enforcement policy of the NYC, which demands a narrow approach to the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception. It also examines the extent of judicial review of foreign arbitral awards by the Indonesian courts, particularly concerning the standards for applying judicial discretion to refuse or allow enforcement under the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception. [...] A proposition presented in this thesis is that the concept of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> in Indonesia lacks a strong international character and, for this reason, it has a tendency to be interpreted in domestic terms instead of international <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> under the NYC. Another central proposition is that domestic concept of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> in the Indonesian arbitration law is influenced by Indonesian pluralistic legal traditions and cultures. Therefore, a harmonisation of the concept of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> in Indonesia with the concept of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> under the NYC and the Model Law needs to be addressed. [...] Despite the changes brought by new Indonesian arbitration law reform, the central position of the narrow approach to the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception has yet to achieve full recognition. If this situation is related to the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in Indonesia, {{it can be seen that}} the finality and enforceability of the awards will hardly be achieved until the underlying issue concerning a restrictive concept of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> is addressed. It is argued that a failure to adopt a narrow approach to the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception can be related to the enforceability of foreign arbitral awards in Indonesia. [...] The recommendations throughout this thesis promote the Indonesian judiciary system to shift away from a 'domestic' concept of <b>public</b> <b>policy.</b> They encourage the Indonesian judiciary and Arbitration legal framework to strongly adopt the concept of internationalism in establishing the judicial approach to <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception. In doing so, this thesis also contributes to harmonizing the judicial application of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> through establishing the concept of 'international' <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> that is based on the narrow approach to the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> exception and the presumption of favouring enforcement of international arbitral awards.
