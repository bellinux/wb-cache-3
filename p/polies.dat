40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship of family size, birth order, socioeconomic status, and parent-child relationships to young children's intellectual development. Seventy-four children, 39 boys and 35 girls, with a mean age of 4 years- 8 months, and their parents (mothers and fathers), selected from 9 preschool programs and daycare centers in Corvallis, Oregon, acted as subjects for this study. Ninety-five percent of the families came from upper or upper-middle socioeconomic classes. All the families were intact, consisting of children and their biological parents, representing one-, two, and three-child families. The children in this study were either first-, second- or third-born children. Family socioeconomic status was determined via Hollingshead's Four Factor Index of Social Status. Information on family size and birth order was obtained through a Demographic Questionnaire. Parent-child relationship was assessed via the Parent Attitude Research Instrument-Short Form. Children's intellectual level was measured with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised. Zajonc and Markus' Confluence Theory, Page and Grandon's Admixture Theory, and Falbo and <b>Polies</b> Parent-Child Relationships Theory were utilized as the basis for investigating the relative contributions of family size, birth order, socioeconomic status, mother-child relationship, and father-child relationship to children's intellectual development. The regression procedure was used in data analyses. The. 05 probability level was used as the criterion for statistical significance. Findings revealed that the variables of socioeconomic status and quality of father-child relationships contributed significantly to children's intellectual development. The higher the socioeconomic status of the family, and the more supportive the father-child relationships, the higher the children's intellectual development scores. Birth order and family size made no contributions to children's intellectual development. These findings, therefore, provided support for Page and Grandon's Admixture Theory and Falbo and <b>Polies</b> Parent-Child Relationships Theory, but not for Zajonc and Markus' Confluence Theory...|$|E

40|$|Flat and {{piercing}} tips made {{of polished}} rock and bone {{are typical of}} the Late Neolithic in the Western Alps. Most of them, realised in tenaceous rocks (serpentinite and amphibolite), come from the internal valleys of the Alps in Switzerland (Valais), Italy (Val D’Aosta, Western Piedmont) and France (Savoy). Production sites have been identified at Bessans (Savoie) and Roreto (Piedmont), whereas unfinished tips are known on several sites of the Western Alps. Contextual examination allows it to be demonstrated that production occurred on the outcrops, or in their immediate neighbourhood. According to the archaeological facts, the operative process is simple: flat blanks (thin plates) were shaped out by retouching, then polished. The obtaining of the blanks and the manufacturing process are difficult to understand on the archaeological artefacts, so an experimental approach was necessary; this was done in 2003. The results allow us to argue that only one «chaîne opératoire» was used. In summary: the blanks are obtained from small massive blocks; these blocks offer a small but discernible schistosity; the use of heat is not required; obtaining blanks is the decisive step of the «chaîne opératoire»: their regular thinness conditions the regularity of the tip and the working time required for shaping; shaping is quite quick (half an hour to one hour), executed by retouching with a stone hammer, followed by more or less covering polishing. All the shapes and the dimensions known in archaeological contexts can be reproduced with no real variation in the difficulties. The levels of know-how appear in the symmetry of the tip and the straightness of the lateral edges. Manufacturing of the tips in polished rock does not require highly developed know-how {{for people who are}} familiar with working tenaceous rocks for axeheads. However, obtaining the best results calls obligatorily for the use of rocks from autochthonous or sub-autochthonous outcrops. Thirault Eric.

In this thesis study, it has been aimed to make an information security policy that can be applied in universities in order to protect personal data, and to contribute to the creation of information security culture by evaluating the matters relating to the protection of personal data within the framework of a comprehensive information security model and the legal conditions. In this study, upon determining the regulations related to the protection of sensitive information assets in the Turkish Law Legislation, these regulations have been evaluated within the scope of the legal regulations made under the European Union (EU) information security policies and in the framework of a theoretical information security model. In addition, by applying a questionnaire through interviews with the computer centers, the directorate of personnel affairs and the libraries of 15 universities in Ankara; the adequacy of the information security policies of universities has been examined and their compatibility with the existing legal regulations has been investigated.

40|$|In {{approaching}} {{the study of}} Alpine axeheads, we {{did not wish to}} follow previous researchers in privileging regional studies over broader reviews, and so we adopted a global, pan-European approach, examining all large Alpine axeheads across Europe. And since it would be a colossal task to document all of the many thousands of Alpine axeheads that have been found across Europe, we decided to limit our researches -following the ethnographic criteria used in our work in New Guinea- to axeheads that are, or had been, over 13. 5 cm long. After ten years of desk- and museum- based work, our inventory of such axeheads currently stands at 1 764 examples, whose distribution stretches across Europe from Ireland, Brittany and Portugal in the west, to Bulgaria and Turkey in the east, and from Denmark in the north to Sicily in the south. The network over which Alpine axeheads circulated thus extended over 3 000 kilometres as the crow flies, between the Atlantic and the Black Sea. For the 5 th millennium BC, the typological classification of these tools allows us to distinguish 15 different types. In studying the length/thickness ratio of complete examples, these types fall into a chronological sequence, informed by a factor analysis of axehead hoards (from both funerary and non-funerary contexts) and excluding those of Puy type (which have been influenced by copper axeheads and constitute a late introduction with the Chasséen, {{towards the end of the}} 5 th millennium). According to this sequence: - the Bégude hoard is the earliest, being deposited at the beginning of the 5 th millennium; - the next hoards are the group deposited around the middle of the 5 th millennium in the Morbihan region of Brittany. Of these, those from Mané er Hroëck and Tumiac are the earliest, followed by Bernon, and finally Saint Michel and Petit Rohu; - the series ends with the hoards of Büssleben, Mönchpfiffel, Gonsenheim, Altenstadt, Le Pecq et Abbeville, deposited during the second half of the 5 th millennium and at the beginning of the 4 th millennium. The 'intuitive' typology and the initial chronological seriation that we had proposed in previous publications (based on typological associations in hoards and on axeheads from dated contexts) has been confirmed by this new work, with minor alterations. The mapping of the various axehead types at the scale of western Europe is a step that is key to understanding the dating and circulation of the large axeheads from their sources of raw material in the Alps to the maritime fringes of Europe. Globally, as we have noted previously, there is a striking symmetry, around the middle of the 5 th millennium, between a western Europe where jade was the 'must have' material, and an eastern Europe in which this role was played by copper and gold. The two poles of this pattern lie at Carnac and the Gulf of Morbihan in the west and Varna in the east. The distribution maps allow us to follow and to confirm our chronological propositions : - The Bégude type of axehead, which is sometimes associated with regularly-shaped disc-rings of serpentinite or of jadeitite, is found over the entire area of influence of Cardial pottery styles to the west of the Alps. In opposition to this southern distribution, there is the northern distribution pattern of axeheads of Altenstadt/Greenlaw type. - Axeheads with expanded blades, even though some of them had been shaped in the quarries of Monte Viso, show an extraordinary concentration around the Gulf of Morbihan. These are the highly polished 'Carnac type' axeheads. - Finally the Puy type, the latest of the Alpine types, covers most of Continental Europe and heralds the decline in Alpine axehead production and the progressive return to the use of Alpine rock for making workaday axeheads and other woodworking tools. For certain axehead types -in particular, Altenstadt/Greenlaw- one notes the absence of roughouts in the quarrying sites of the Alps and Liguria. This is due to the fact that we are dealing with axeheads that were repolished on their arrival in the Paris Basin, using Alpine and Italian axehead types (in particular those of Durrington and Puymirol). This phenomenon, which occured in the southeastern part of the Paris Basin, seems to be identical to that which saw the transformation of polished Alpine axeheads on their arrival in the Morbihan, with the production of the 'Carnac' types of axehead. The intention could have been to produce styles of axehead that were incapable of being imitated and that were reserved for the elites. The incoming Alpine axeheads would have been regarded as magnificent exotic raw material, lacking in form or looking too much like the standard versions as used by neighbouring communities. At the other end of Europe, the same phenomenon of repolishing can be observed in Bulgaria with the Varna type (trapezoidal) and the thinned-down Durrington/Chelles type. Plutôt que de vouloir privilégier, comme par le passé, des études régionales de toutes les haches alpines - car le travail serait colossal à l'échelle de l'Europe avec certainement plus d'une dizaine de milliers de haches <b>polies</b> -, nous avons introduit l'idée d'une étude systématique, mais qui porterait essentiellement sur les grandes haches, la coupure (selon des critères ethnographiques observés en Nouvelle-Guinée) étant établie à 13, 5 cm. Après dix années de travail en bibliographie et en musées, notre inventaire compte aujourd'hui 1 764 haches, réparties entre l'Irlande, la Bretagne et le Portugal à l'ouest, la Bulgarie et la Turquie à l'est, le Danemark au nord, la Sicile au sud. L'extension des réseaux de circulation des haches en roches alpines atteint donc 3 000 km à vol d'oiseau entre l'Atlantique et la Mer Noire. Pour le Ve millénaire, le classement typologique de ces outils polis permet de distinguer 15 types différents. En étudiant le rapport longueur/largeur des exemplaires complets, ces types s'organisent en chronologie lorsque l'on travaille en analyse factorielle sur les dépôts de haches (dépôts funéraires et assemblages enfouis sans rapport avec un espace funéraire), en excluant le type Puy (une imitation de hache en cuivre, d'introduction récente avec le Chasséen, vers la fin du Ve millénaire) : - Bégude est le dépôt le plus ancien (début du Ve millénaire); - suit le groupe des dépôts du Morbihan avec Mané er Hroëck et Tumiac, puis Bernon, enfin Saint-Michel et Petit Rohu (vers le milieu du Ve millénaire) - la série s'achève avec Büssleben, Mönchpfiffel, Gonsenheim, Altenstadt, Le Pecq et Abbeville pendant la 2 e moitié du Ve millénaire et le début du IVe. La typologie " intuitive " et les premières sériations chronologiques que nous avions autrefois proposées (en nous fondant sur les associations typologiques dans les dépôts et sur les haches en contexte daté) se trouvent ainsi confirmées, à des nuances près. La cartographie des types à l'échelle de l'Europe occidentale est une étape clé de la datation et de l'observation de la circulation des grandes haches, depuis les exploitations alpines jusqu'aux marges maritimes de l'Europe. Globalement, comme nous l'avions déjà fait remarquer, la symétrie est frappante vers le milieu du Ve millénaire, entre une Europe occidentale du jade qui s'oppose à une Europe orientale du cuivre et de l'or, avec les deux pôles que sont Carnac et le Morbihan à l'ouest, Varna à l'est. De surcroît, les cartes de répartition permettent de suivre et de confirmer les propositions chronologiques. Le type Bégude, parfois associé à des anneaux-disque réguliers en serpentinite ou en jadéitite, couvre toute l'aire d'influence des styles de la céramique cardiale, à l'ouest des Alpes. À cette distribution méridionale s'oppose la répartition d'Altenstadt/Greenlaw, un modèle septentrional. Les haches à tranchant élargi, bien que mises en forme dans les carrières du Mont Viso pour certaines d'entre elles, montrent une concentration exceptionnelle autour du golfe du Morbihan (types " carnacéens " surpolis). Enfin le type Puy, le plus tardif, couvre la majeure partie de l'Europe continentale et annonce le déclin des productions alpines, avec un retour progressif à la hache considérée comme outil d'abattage. Pour certains types (Altenstadt/Greenlaw en particulier), il faut noter l'absence d'ébauches dans les exploitations des Alpes et de Ligurie : en fait, il s'agirait de haches qui ont été repolies à leur arrivée en Bassin parisien, en utilisant des modèles alpins et italiens (Durrington et Puymirol en particulier). Ce phénomène, qui intervient dans le sud-est du Bassin parisien, semble identique à celui qui a vu la transformation des lames <b>polies</b> alpines à leur arrivée en Morbihan avec la production des haches " carnacéennes ". L'idée pouvait être de produire des modèles inimitables et réservés aux élites, les haches alpines à leur arrivée étant considérées comme de magnifiques matières premières exotiques, mais informes ou trop marquées par les standards formels des voisins. À l'autre bout de l'Europe, le même phénomène de repolissage peut être observé en Bulgarie avec les types Varna (trapézoïdal) et Durrington/Chelles amincis par repolissage...|$|E

These polysaccharides {{were isolated}} from cell extracts and purified by methanol precipitation, chloroform extraction of extraneous material, and deproteinization with trichloroacetic acid. The crucial step used {{for separation of}} <b>Poly</b> I and <b>Poly</b> II from both nocardias was differential solubility. From dried preparations containing both polysaccharides, <b>Poly</b> I was solubilized at pH 10, whereas <b>Poly</b> II remained insoluble and was subsequently solubilized at pH 5. <b>Poly</b> I Na and <b>Poly</b> I Nb are apparently the same.

40|$|Previously, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that PMOS capacitors with heavily boron-doped polycrystalline SiGeC gates are less susceptible to boron penetration than those with <b>poly</b> Si gates [1]. Boron appears to accumulate in the <b>poly</b> SiGeC layers during anneals, reducing boron outdiffusion from the gate despite high boron levels in the <b>poly</b> SiGeC at the gate/oxide interface.
