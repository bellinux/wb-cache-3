40|$|Germanium carbide films, GexC 1 -x {{have been}} {{produced}} by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) from acetylene-germane mixtures at substrate temperatures of 475 C to 550 C and {C 2 H 2 }/{GeH 4 + C 2 H 2 } ratios of 0 % to 75 %. Optical and structural measurements of these germanium carbide films are reported {{as a function of}} the acetylene-germane ratio. We found a decrease of the value of the refractive index and a shift of the profile of the absorption coefficient relative to the values of pc-Ge as the acetylene gas fraction increases. X-ray difffraction (XRD) measurements show strong polycrystalline germanium peaks for low carbon content, but the intensity of the peaks decreases significantly as the acetylene gas fraction increases. The GexC 1 -x films thus appear to be cermet-like compounds of germanium and carbon. The optical absorption properties of these films suggest their use as absorber layers for <b>photothermal</b> <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> conversion...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} the study of black molybdenum, a new cermet consisting of small Mo particles embedded in MoO₂. As with most two-phase materials, the optical properties of black molybdenum are significantly different from those of either constituent, and can be adjusted within wide limits through modifications of composition and microstructure due to variations of the fabrication process parameters. The subject of this work is to understand the exact relationships, to allow reproducible production of films with chosen optical properties. Theoretical interpretation of the optical properties of two-phase materials has in the past been hampered by insufficient microstructural characterization. Recent theoretical work by others has lifted the requirements of detailed microstructural knowledge, leaving only two required parameters for characterization of cermet reflectance: the optical properties of the constituent phases and their volume fractions in the cermet. Better characterization is obtained when structural considerations, such as film topology, surface texture and the presence of a possible amorphous phase, are taken into account. We adopted this approach to the study of black molybdenum, and accomplished satisfactory agreement between theoretical and observed reflectances. Black molybdenum films were prepared using two separate chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, involving deposition from either Mo(CO) ₆ or MoO₂Cl₂. We found the influence of composition through a comparison of films with different Mo:MoO₂ ratios, while the influence of structure on film reflectance was determined by comparing films from these two deposition techniques. During this investigation we produced black molybdenum films which display a spectrally selective profile [...] low visible reflectance combined with high infrared reflectance, and which may be applied to <b>photothermal</b> <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> conversion. The versatility of CVD in adjusting film composition and structure resulted in another film of interest in photothermal conversion [...] black tungsten, a tungsten-tungsten oxide composite material. The black molybdenum and black tungsten systems studied here establish the utility of CVD for the production of high temperature thin film optical devices...|$|E

40|$|Cermet films {{can show}} a {{spectral}} selectivity {{which makes them}} well suited for efficient <b>photothermal</b> conversion of <b>solar</b> <b>energy.</b> Sufficiently fine-grained materials can be theoretically understood from effective medium theories. Two formulations apply depending on the microstructure topology; the Maxwell Garnett theory is valid for metallic particles embedded in an insulating host, whereas the Bruggeman theory holds for a random mixture of metallic and insulating particles. We discuss extensions to treat size dependent electron scattering, shape and orientation effects, {{and the role of}} local aggregation. The theories are applied to several types of cermets : discontinuous metal films, gas evaporated coatings, coevaporated and cosputtered layers, electrodeposited films, and electrolytically and integrally coloured anodic aluminium oxide coatings. Successes and failures of the theoretical models are discussed and remaining uncertainties are pointed out. One general conclusion is that effective medium theories are very useful for understanding the optical properties both qualitatively and quantitatively. Another general result is that lack of sufficiently accurate sample characterization is still hampering further progress for several types of technologically interesting cermets...|$|R

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by The Electrochemical Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] sulfides (CuxS) are compound semiconductor materials that exhibit considerable variations of optical and electrical properties. Copper sulfide thin films can be used in many applications, such as solar control coatings, <b>solar</b> cells, <b>photothermal</b> conversion of <b>solar</b> <b>energy,</b> electroconductive coatings, and microwave shielding coatings. In this paper, chemical bath deposition growth of copper sulfide thin films were monitored for the first time using an in-situ quartz crystal microbalance as a function of time, temperature, concentrations of reactants, and pH. The reaction activation energy was determined based on initial growth rates. The high activation energy, 68 [kJ/mol], indicates that the rate limiting step of the deposition is the chemical reaction rather than mass transport. The structure, morphology, composition and optical absorption of the films were studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy respectively. These properties were found to depend strongly on the deposition conditions. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved...|$|R
