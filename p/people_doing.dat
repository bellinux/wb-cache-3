5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as they always have, <b>people</b> <b>doing</b> this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E
5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies {{that could lead to}} a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in <b>people</b> <b>doing</b> the work they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.|$|E

25|$|The role of {{pelvic floor}} {{exercises}} and anal sphincter exercises in FI is poorly determined. While {{there may be}} some benefit they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators. These exercises aim to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (mainly levator ani). The anal sphincters are not technically part of the pelvic floor muscle group, but the EAS is a voluntary, striated muscle which therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner. It has not been established whether pelvic floor exercises can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by the <b>people</b> <b>doing</b> them. This kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, for which there is a sound evidence base for effectiveness. More rarely are they used in FI. The effect of anal sphincter exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength, speed or endurance of voluntary contraction (EAS).|$|E

The second {{iteration}} of {{the theory}} built on the analysis of collective action, and showed how this {{was linked to the}} mechanisms through which people make their activities meaningful and build commitments to them. Here, investments of social structural and social cognitive resources are expressed as emergent contributions to social action through a set of generative mechanisms: coherence (what <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to make sense of objects, agency, and contexts); cognitive participation (what <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to initiate and be enrolled into delivering an ensemble of practices); collective action (what <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to enact those practices); and reflexive monitoring (what <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to appraise the consequences of their contributions).

The reviewer for the Manchester Guardian considered Radford to have played his part [...] "with unusual subtlety", and thought that among the remainder of the cast [...] "there are so many excellent performances that it would be unfair to pick out two or three names for special praise".

He explained that with the increasing number of characters and complex relationships in the series, having different pairings and building new emotional relationships was important, and stated that [...] "whether it's a quiet moment or in action, we [...] deepen the audience's love and concern, and hopes for these characters." [...] A year later he reiterated the producer's intention to create a tradition moving forward of [...] "finding new combinations and new conflicts" [...] between different sets of characters, given [...] "a lot of procedurals [...] the same <b>people</b> <b>doing</b> the same thing for five years and the character don't evolve or change at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Labour {{suffered}} a historic {{defeat in the}} local elections and European elections, finishing third place behind the Conservatives and the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). Voter apathy {{was evident in the}} historically low turnout of around 33%. In Scotland, voter turnout was only 28%. In the local elections, Labour finished third place behind the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats; Labour lost control of the four councils it had held prior to the election. The vote was widely considered to be a reaction to the expenses scandal; the share of the votes for all the major parties fell; Labour was down 1%, the Conservative share was down 5%. The minor parties, including the Green party and UKIP, were considered to have benefited from the public backlash against the major parties. Brown said that the results were [...] "a painful defeat for Labour", and that [...] "too many good <b>people</b> <b>doing</b> so much good for their communities and their constituencies have lost through no fault of their own".|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Zack Handlen for The A.V. Club gave the episode an overall score of C-, saying that at points the episode just got {{annoying}} especially when Troi was describing Armus' feelings. He thought that Yar's death scene was out of place in the episode and that overall Armus was unthreatening, saying [...] "Murdering Yar should make Armus seem much more dangerous, but he's just so whiny and petulant and bland that he could've killed half a dozen cast members without leaving an impression." [...] Keith DeCandido for Tor.com thought that Yar's death was [...] "pointless", but thought that it was in a manner suitable for a security officer in Star Trek. He also felt that it was one of Troi's better episodes, but that Armus [...] "fails in every possible way as a villain, and thatâ€™s entirely on the backs of the <b>people</b> <b>doing</b> the visual effects and the voice casting." ...|$|E
500|$|Reports {{arose in}} the media that the ticket sales for the tour were falling, leading Arthur Fogel, Chairman of Live Nation's Global Touring division, to brand them as [...] "ridiculous". He {{clarified}} to Billboard that the about 80% of the tickets were sold in North America and Europe, and {{they were still in}} the process of releasing future dates for numerous venues. The 29 shows in North America had grossed around US $26 million, with an average of almost $900,000 per show. Fogel also addressed concerns that Live Nation had lost $30 million from Gaga's tour, saying that if a similar situation really happened, then the company would have cancelled the concerts. [...] "I just don't know how this shit gets any traction without <b>people</b> <b>doing</b> their homework... Just a complete fool would say something like that and it could only come from somebody who has an agenda, because it makes absolutely no sense, on any level", Fogel concluded. A total of 800,000 tickets have been sold for the tour, as reported by Billboard.|$|E
500|$|The season {{shifts to}} the later 10 pm timeslot, {{allowing}} it {{to take on a}} darker, more mature tone than previous seasons. According to Tancharoen, [...] "The whole tagline for this year is Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. After Dark'." [...] The timeslot gave the series the opportunity to present an increased level of violence and partial nudity, as well as take more risks and present edgier themes. Following the third-season finale, Tancharoen stated that the fourth season would explore the guilt Daisy Johnson has over Lincoln Campbell's death. Executive producer Jeffrey Bell noted the writers tried to continue the tradition of [...] "finding new combinations and new conflicts" [...] between different sets of characters, given [...] "a lot of procedurals [...] the same <b>people</b> <b>doing</b> the same thing for five years". Pairings that would be explored included Coulson and Mack, continuing from the end of season three, who have a mutual respect for one another due to their relationships with Johnson, and Leo Fitz and Holden Radcliffe, who work together. The Fitz-Simmons relationship was also explored more, examining the new challenges it presented for the two [...] "working together, loving each other and living together." ...|$|E

500|$|Philip Pan's investigation, {{and other}} {{inconsistencies}} highlighted by Falun Gong organisations, led some journalists and other observers {{to entertain the}} possibility that the self-immolation was not as straightforward as the Chinese official media accounts suggested. In the National Review, Ann Noonan of the Laogai Research Foundation suggested that it was [...] "hardly a far-fetched hypothesis" [...] that the government staged the incident or allowed it to proceed to discredit Falun Gong, as the government vowed to crush the practice before the eightieth anniversary celebrations of the Communist Party in July. Clive Ansley, a Vancouver-based rights lawyer who lived in China during the self-immolation, suggested that a dramatic response by Falun Gong would have been understandable, but ultimately concluded that the event was staged: [...] "You've got Falun Gong people in this country, they've been oppressed over and over again, they are not allowed to speak, they are not allowed to assert any of their rights as citizens, the level of frustration must be terribly, terribly high..
