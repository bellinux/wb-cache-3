In 1681, the Saxon pastor Georg Samuel Doerfel set forth his proofs that comets are heavenly bodies moving in parabolas of which the Sun is the focus. Then Isaac Newton, in his Principia Mathematica of 1687, proved that an object moving {{under the influence of}} his inverse square law of universal gravitation must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the conic sections, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet's path through the sky to a <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit,</b> using the comet of 1680 as an example.|$|E

We deepen and complete the analysis in the planar case for homogeneous singular potentials. We characterize all <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> connecting two minimal central configurations as free-time Morse minimizers (in a given homotopy class of paths). These may occur for at most one value of the homogeneity exponent. In addition, we link this threshold of existence of parabolic trajectories with the absence of collisions for all the minimizers of fixed-ends problems. Also the existence of action minimizing periodic trajectories with nontrivial homotopy type can be related with the same threshold. Comment: 28 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

50|$|Another {{hypothetical}} {{situation in}} which parabolas might arise, according to the theories of physics described in the 17th and 18th centuries by Sir Isaac Newton, is in two-body orbits; for example {{the path of a}} small planetoid or other object {{under the influence of the}} gravitation of the Sun. Parabolic orbits do not occur in nature; simple orbits most commonly resemble hyperbolas or ellipses. The <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> is the degenerate intermediate case between those two types of ideal orbit. An object following a <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> would travel at the exact escape velocity of the object it orbits; objects in elliptical or hyperbolic orbits travel at less or greater than escape velocity, respectively. Long-period comets travel close to the Sun's escape velocity while they are moving through the inner solar system, so their paths are near parabolic.|$|E
