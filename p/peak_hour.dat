5|$|To promote public transportation, NJT and PATH {{would offer}} more {{frequent}} <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> train services to Newark, Hoboken and Jersey City on the Hudson Waterfront, and Manhattan.

5|$|Currently, Delhi Metro {{has about}} 220 trains of four, six and eight coaches totalling 1,290 coaches. It is further {{planning}} to add 421 more coaches {{on the existing}} route before the completion of phase 3. During the financial year 2015, DMRC on an average pressed 1,083 coaches in an hour (during <b>peak</b> <b>hour),</b> in 2012–13, the number was 819. On an average trains make 2,880 trips per day.|$|E

30|$|Morning and {{afternoon}} <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> {{are associated with}} an increased number of pedestrian transgressions [14]. Nevertheless, while Edquist, Hughes [7] observed more transgressions in afternoon <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> Metaxatos and Sriraj [1] demonstrated that transgressions in different times of the day correspond to pedestrian traffic volumes particularly high in the morning and more widely distributed in the evening <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R
5|$|From Illawarra Junction, four tracks {{head south}} through Erskineville and St Peters to Sydenham station. The 'main' pair of tracks {{are used by}} Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line and South Coast Line trains and the 'local' pair by Bankstown Line and <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> Airport, Inner West & South Line trains. At Sydenham, the Bankstown railway line {{branches}} off, but trains from the Airport, Inner West & South Line continue along the Illawarra line until Wolli Creek, where a junction to the East Hills line exists. South of Wolli Creek station, a crossover allows trains from the 'main' pair of tracks to switch to the 'local' pair. This is used by <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> all-stations Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line trains. The four track section ends at Hurstville. The line then continues as two tracks south towards Sutherland, crossing the Georges River via the Como railway bridge between Oatley and Como. At Sutherland the Cronulla line branches in an easterly direction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the longer}} term, Network Rail has {{forecast}} that by 2031 {{there will be}} 900 more passengers attempting to travel on the route between Herne Hill and Blackfriars during the busiest <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> every weekday than can be accommodated on the trains. It is anticipated that eight-car trains with higher capacity (similar to the Class 378 trains used on inner London metro routes) will eventually be required to address this shortfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{off-peak}} District Hounslow branch {{shuttle to}} South Acton was discontinued on 29 April 1935 {{and replaced by}} an Acton Town to South Acton shuttle. This shuttle was withdrawn on 28 February 1959, and the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> District line through service to Hounslow was withdrawn on 9 October 1964. In the 1970s the Hounslow branch became the Heathrow branch when it was extended to serve Heathrow Airport, first on 19 July 1975 to serve Hatton Cross and then on 16 December 1977 when Heathrow Central opened.|$|E

25|$|The Jurong East Modification Project entailed the {{construction}} of a new platform and the addition of a fourth track to Jurong East Station to reduce waiting times and crowding at the station during <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> The modification project was completed on 27 May 2011. The track and platform was initially opened during morning <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> only, but since December 2011, they also operate during the evening <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R
5|$|Widening of the Kwinana Freeway with {{an extra}} {{southbound}} lane between Roe Highway and Armadale Road began in mid-2014. The project aims to increase the freeway's reliability, efficiency, and safety, as the current two-lane configuration is subject to {{a large proportion of}} heavy vehicles and severe <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> congestion. The project also involves the realignment of ramps at Berrigan Drive and Armadale Road, construction of noise barriers and noise walls where required, and installation of components for intelligent transport systems – optic fibre communications, vehicle detection devices, and closed circuit cameras.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the {{southern}} regions of Perth to easier central business district access {{changed the nature of}} the metropolitan area, prompting dramatic population growth south of the river. This led to increased traffic on the bridge, causing regular traffic jams in <b>peak</b> <b>hour.</b> Over the years, governments suggested various ideas to reduce the traffic using the bridge, including introducing congestion pricing similar to that used in Singapore, charging vehicles to enter the central business district during peak periods. The government also encouraged voluntary car sharing. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, and by the 1990s, the bridge had become the city's worst traffic bottleneck, despite the addition of an extra traffic lane, bringing the total number of lanes to seven.|$|E
5|$|City {{planning}} staff {{estimate that}} the peak ridership of the one-stop extension to be 7,300 in the <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> and peak direction, {{about half of the}} 15,000 peak ridership considered the low end to justify a subway. With the original three-stop extension, the peak ridership estimate was 9,500 to 14,000; however, that estimate was reduced to 7,300 because of competition from the proposed SmartTrack and by the elimination of two of the three original stops. Mayor John Tory and Scarborough Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker say a peak ridership of 7,300 would still be acceptable as it is still greater than the 6,000 peak at terminal station Kipling. However, a Toronto Star article points out there is only one station within 6 kilometres of Scarborough Town Centre but more stations are within 6 kilometres of other terminal stations to boost ridership. The SSE would carry an estimate 31,000 riders per day as compared to 66,355 riders from Kipling to Jane (five stations) and 96,660 riders from Finch to York Mills (four stations). The SSE performs better in ridership only against the terminal of the underperforming Line 4 Sheppard line.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the end of}} 2016, two-car trains started being {{deployed}} on both directions of the West Loop during the weekday <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> due to {{the increasing number of}} commuters living in new HDB flats located near Thanggam, Kupang and Farmway LRT Stations. Before this, two-car trains were only deployed towards the direction of Cheng Lim during morning <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> and towards the direction of Renjong during evening <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R
30|$|This {{intersection}} is signalized {{and operates}} {{at a fixed}} cycle length of 200  s. The phasing scheme is similar to Fig.  2. The queue length at the intersection along the flyover usually remains within 200  m. Sometimes, on rare occasions, it extends beyond 300  m and impacts the through movements on the expressway. During morning <b>peak</b> <b>hours,</b> the heavy traffic movements are {{in the direction of}} the central business district of Mumbai (i.e., south of the intersection) and the reverse trend prevails during afternoon <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> Hence, the westbound left-turn movements and eastbound right-turn movements are heavy during morning <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> On the other hand, the northbound right-turn and left-turn movements are heavy during afternoon <b>peak</b> <b>hours.</b> The heavy movements during morning <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> are served by two different phases, but in the afternoon, heavy movements are served by one phase. Moreover, any impact to the northbound right-turn and left-turn movements can affect the through movement on the expressway. Therefore, the period of afternoon <b>peak</b> <b>hours</b> is considered as critical in evaluating the proposed layout.|$|R

5|$|Metrorail begins {{service at}} 5 am Monday through Friday, 7 am on Saturdays, and 8 am Sundays; it ends service at 11:30 pm Monday through Thursday, 1:00 am Friday and Saturday, and 11:00 pm on Sundays, {{although}} the last trains leave the end stations inbound {{about half an}} hour before these times. Trains run more frequently during rush hours on all lines, with scheduled <b>peak</b> <b>hour</b> headways of 4 minutes on the Red Line and 9 minutes on all other lines. Headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and all weekend. The midday six-minute headways are based on a combination of two Metrorail lines (Orange/Blue and Yellow/Green) as each route can run every 12 minutes; {{in the case of the}} Red Line, every other train bound for Glenmont terminates at Silver Spring instead. Night and weekend service varies between 8 and 24 minutes, with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes.|$|E
