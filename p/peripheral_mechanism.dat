40|$|Strychnin and {{adrenalin}} when {{injected into}} cardiectomized frogs are efficiently distributed {{all over the}} animal body and when administered in sufficient quantities produce the usual reactions of these alkaloids. The experiments with strychnin prove positively that the paralysing effect of this poison is due to its direct action upon the nerve cells of the cord, and not, as Verworn assumes, to a paralysing action upon the heart. When morphin is injected into cardiectomized frogs the effects are much greater and incomparably more rapid than when administered to a normal frog. The normal circulation probably contains substances derived from some organs capable of modifying and retarding the specific effects of morphin. The distribution of solutions in animals deprived of their circulatory apparatus takes place through the tissue spaces, which present {{a more or less}} well connected system of communications throughout the entire animal body, especially through its peripheral parts. This mode of distribution is designated as the <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In contrast to the centralizing cardiovascular apparatus, the <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanism</b> permits a greater autonomous action of organs and a more localising effect of injections.

Despite signif-icant advancements in the medical management of this challenging disorder, clinical data have revealed a proportion of patients who do not adequately respond to pharmacologic intervention and remain symptomatic.

40|$|Immune {{regulation}} {{is necessary to}} control inflammatory responses and to prevent autoimmune diseases. Therefore, mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance have evolved to ensure that T cells recognize antigens as self- or non-self-antigens. The thymus is crucially important for central tolerance induction to self-antigens via negative selection of T cells. However, if T cells escape negative selection in the thymus and enter the periphery, <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are active to warrant immune tolerance. Secondary lymphoid organs, as well as tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells, {{play an important role}} in peripheral tolerance. In chronic inflammatory diseases, tertiary lymphoid organs are sometimes formed that may also be involved in the induction of peripheral tolerance. This review discusses the main processes that are involved in immune regulation and tolerance, and focuses on the contribution of NF-κB signalling to these processes. This narrative review is based on peer-reviewed publications listed on PubMed up to December 2014. The focus of our literature search was on studies investigating the role of (non) canonical NF-κB signalling in central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of tolerance.

However, the underlying <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of IL- 31 -induced itch in the skin remain unclear. Therefore, {{the present study investigated}} the <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanisms</b> underlying IL- 31 -induced itch in mice. IL- 31 -induced itch-related response was inhibited by anti-allergic drugs (tranilast and azelastine), but not by an H 1 histamine receptor antagonist (terfenadine). Furthermore, a 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitor (zileuton), but not a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin), and a leuko­triene B 4 (LTB 4) receptor antagonist (CMHVA) attenuated the action of IL- 31. IL- 31 receptor-immunoreactivity was observed in the epidermis and primary sensory neurones. IL- 31 receptor mRNA was expressed in mouse keratinocytes and dorsal root ganglia neurones.

Obesity {{is the result of}} interactions among the environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and human behavior. Even modest weight reduction in obese patients provides beneficial health outcomes. For effective weight reduction, a drug should either increase energy expenditure or decrease energy intake without causing serious adverse effects. To overcome lack of efficacy and central nervous system related side effects, exploitation of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanism</b> of anti-obesity action is needed. Inhibition of pathological angiogenesis in adipose tissue is one such <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanism</b> that has attracted the attention of researchers in this area. Although originally developed as anti-cancer agents, methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP 2) inhibitors induce significant and sustained weight reduction.

Clinical variables such as age, gender, severity of liver disease and	degree	of	viremia	could	influence	the	severity of platelet reduction. The goal of this study is to determine the prevalent mechanism of thrombocytopenia {{in patients}} with chronic hepatitis C and the clinical predictors of its severity. Methods: Eighty-one patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia were included. The viral inhibition on the bone marrow (central mechanism) was studied by performing bone marrow biopsy from the iliac crest. The presence of antiplatelet antibodies by ELISA assessed the <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The clinical predictors included in the analysis were: age, gender, ALT level, liver fibrosis stage	 and	HCV	RNA. Results: Coexistence of a central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanism</b> was found in the vast majority (93. 3 %) of patients with severe thrombocytopenia (< 100, 000 /µL) and in most patients (61. 53 %) with moderate thrombocytopenia (100, 000 - 125, 000 /µL). In patients with less severe thrombocytopenia (126, 000 - 149, 000 /µL), autoimmune destruction was the sole mechanism (85 %).

40|$|The {{apoptotic}} deletion of thymocytes that express self-reactive antigen receptors is {{the basis}} of central (thymic) self-tolerance. However, it is clear that some autoreactive T cells escape deletion in the thymus and exist as mature lymphocytes in the periphery. Therefore, <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of tolerance are also crucial, and failure of these <b>peripheral</b> <b>mechanisms</b> leads to autoimmunity. Clonal deletion, clonal anergy and immunoregulation and/or suppression have been suggested as mechanisms by which 'inappropriate' T-lymphocyte responses may be controlled in the periphery. Peripheral clonal deletion, which involves the apoptotic elimination of lymphocytes, is critical for T-cell homeostasis during normal immune responses, and is recognized as an important process by which self-tolerance is maintained. Transplantation of foreign tissue into an adult host represents a special case of 'inappropriate' T-cell reactivity that is subject to the same central and <b>peripheral</b> tolerance <b>mechanisms</b> that control reactivity against self. In this case, the unusually high frequency of naive T cells able to recognize and respond against non-self-allogeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens leads to an exceptionally large pool of pathogenic effector lymphocytes that must be controlled if graft rejection is to be avoided. A great deal of effort has been directed toward understanding the role of clonal anergy and/or active immunoregulation in the induction of peripheral transplantation tolerance but, until recently, relatively little progress had been made towards defining the potential contribution of clonal deletion.
