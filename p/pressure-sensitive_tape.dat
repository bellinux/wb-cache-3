Repairs made with water-based adhesives such as animal glue {{can be removed}} in a water bath, by local application of moisture, or with poultices or steam. Synthetic adhesives and <b>pressure-sensitive</b> (self-adhering) <b>tapes</b> usually have to be dissolved or softened with an organic solvent {{before they can be}} removed.

40|$|A simple, {{reliable}} and cost-effective fluidic channel, fabricated by using double-sided <b>pressure-sensitive</b> <b>tapes,</b> is demonstrated here. A laser-cutting method {{is applied to}} engrave structures in sheets of the tapes. After peeling off the tape liners, the structures could be easily integrated at room temperature with label-free optical waveguide biochips without further modifications or additional processing steps. It is shown that the well-defined and controllable height of the channels is advantageous for stopped-flow measurements of analyte binding. The easy fabrication of a fully transparent integrated sensor unit – tape cuvette system is also demonstrated for parallel microscopic investigations. The transparent unit was used to on-line monitor the surface adhesion of Salmonella cells on poly-l-lysine-coated biochip surfaces, followed by the straightforward microscopic visualization of the adhered bacterial cells. The material of the double sided tape is stable in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, its material is biocompatible, making it ideal for biological applications. Excellent, stable and reversible bonding of the microstructured tapes to biocompatible plastic and glass is also demonstrated. The simplicity of the fabrication at ambient temperatures makes the developed processes appealing for lab-on-a-chip applications, particularly if the bonded biochips are precious...|$|R
