40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to analyse the effects of stand structure on biomass allocation and on the accurancy of estimation models for volume and aboveground biomass of Italian stone pine (Pinus pinea L.). Although the species is widely distributed on Mediterranean coasts, few studies on forest biomass estimation have focused on pinewoods. The research was carried out in the Castelfusano&# 8217;s pinewood (Rome) and concerned the two most common structural types: (a) 50 years-old pinewood originated by broadcast seeding; and (b) 62 years-old pinewood originated by <b>partial</b> <b>seeding</b> alternating worked strips to firm strips. Some 83 sample trees were selected for stem volume estimation and a subset of 32 trees used to quantify the total epigeous biomass, the wooden biomass compartment, including stem and big branches (diameter &# 62; 3 cm) and the photosynthetic biomass, including thin branches (diameter &# 60; 3 cm) and needles. Collected data were used to elaborate allometric relations for stem volume, total biomass and specific relations for both compartments, based on one (d 2) or two (d 2 h) indipendent variables, for both structural types. Furthermore, pinewood specific biomass expansion factors (BEF) - indexes used to estimate carbon stocks starting from stem biomass data - were obtained. The achieved estimation models were subjected to both parallelism and coincidence tests, showing significant effects of stand structure on the accurancy of the allometric relations. The effects of stand structure and reliability of tree height curves on the accurancy of estimation models for volume and aboveground biomass and on biomass allocation in different compartments are analysed and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Seed predation, an omnipresent {{phenomenon}} in tropical rain forests, {{is an important}} determinant of plant recruitment and forest regeneration. Although seed predation destroys large amounts of the seed crop of numerous tropical species, in many cases individual seed damage is only partial. The extent to which <b>partial</b> <b>seed</b> predation affects the recruitment of new individuals in the population depends on the type and magnitude of alteration of the germination behavior of the damaged seeds. We analyzed the germination dynamics of 11 tropical woody species subject to increasing levels of simulated seed predation (0 – 10 % seed mass removal). Germination response to seed damage varied considerably among species but could be grouped into four distinct types: (1) complete inability to germinate under damage ≥ 1 %, (2) no effect on germination dynamics, (3) reduced germination with increasing damage, and (4) reduced final germination but faster germination with increasing damage. We conclude that <b>partial</b> <b>seed</b> predation is often nonlethal and argue that different responses to predation may represent different proximal mechanisms for coping with partial damage, with potential to shape, in the long run, morphological and physiological adaptations in tropical, large-seeded spe...|$|R

Hairy vetch was incorporated into soil on May 18 and rice seedling was transplanted on May 26. The growths of hairy vetch before overwintering were investigated on November 11.

Results of the investigation showed no difference between two seeding methods. Although the seeding time was 21 days late in PTS, the biomass of hairy vetch and rice yield were equivalent to those of BBRH seeding, so we conclude that PTS could improve overwintering survival of hairy vetch in rice cropping system.

The response of plants under uniform conditions upholds the merger of the reputed Hawaiian endemic P. cyanosperma with P. pilosa. All Portulaca taxa in Hawaii are autogamous, and in most instances large numbers of seeds are set even when the flowers are totally undisturbed.

The cultivars were the only taxa observed to attract pollinators, but P. molokiniensis, which was not studied in nature, appears to have adaptations for biotic pollination. Most of the portulac as studied have capsular fruit that require about 13 - 17 days to mature, but in P. sclerocarpa the fruits are thick-walled and indehiscent and require about 28 days for maturation.

All tested genotypes suffered severe damage to whole heads and stems at plant minimum temperatures less than − 8 °C. In 2003, 2004 and 2005, frost events reaching a plant minimum temperature of approximately − 6. 5 ºC did not result in the complete loss of grain yield.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Washington State UniversityTwo major {{aspects of}} Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) crystal growth for room {{temperature}} radiation detection application namely tellurium rich second phase defects and single crystal yield have been addressed. Various approaches were considered towards the minimization of these defects both during growth and post growth thermal treatment in cadmium environment. Since {{the issue of}} retrograde solubility in CdZnTe ternary alloy system causes tellurium precipitation, different cooling mechanisms were also devised to achieve minimal secondary phases. Some important and encouraging results were obtained relative to the size and distribution of secondary phases upon differently cooling the crystals after growth. Thermomigration of tellurium were also observed while post processing samples in a temperature gradient, in (Cd,Zn) atmosphere. Results indicated orders of magnitude reduction on secondary phases {{at the expense of}} sample resistivity. Apart from the issue of secondary phases, CdZnTe also suffers from low single crystal yield. Since grain boundaries are known to hinder the transport properties of charge carriers, it is necessary to have large single crystal volumes with good uniformity for better charge collection efficiency. In our crystal growth facility, single crystal volumes up to 25 x 25 x 20 mm 3 have been grown using unseeded vertical Bridgman technique. However reproducibility has been a major issue as far as single crystal yield is concerned. In order to consistently produce large volume detector grade material, seeding was attempted in vertical Bridgman set up. Certain important requirements for successful <b>seeded</b> growth are <b>partial</b> melting of the seed from top, proper melt mixing before starting growth and maintaining a convex interface shape to promote outward grain growth.

40|$|Abstract: The word seed or {{seeds are}} used for all {{propagating}} materials. The seed is considered as most important input in agriculture. It is cheaper than other inputs like irrigation, fertilizer & plant protection measures. Quality of seed is maintained by including various practices, like proper winnowing, drying, bagging, and storage etc. The quality seed availability at proper time determines the agriculture growth. It is a well known fact that up to 85 % of the seeds used by farmer is farm saved seeds i. e. the seed protected and conserved by the farmer from his own harvest for future use. This seed is not of proper quality and does not kept in the proper storage condition. Due to these reasons, the germination of seed is affected adversely which eventually reduces the production and productivity of the crop. It is therefore necessary {{to improve the quality}} of farm saved seed. The present study was conducted in Indore block of Indore district, M. P.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although hash {{functions}} are nothing new, {{these are not}} limited to cryptographic purposes. One important field is data fingerprinting. Here, the purpose is to generate a digest which serves as a fingerprint (or a license plate) that uniquely identifies a file. More recently, fuzzy fingerprinting schemes — which will scrap the avalanche effect in favour of detecting local changes — has hit the spotlight. The main purpose of this project is to find ways to classify text tables, and discover where potential changes or inconsitencies have happened. METHODS: Large parts of this report can be considered applied discrete mathematics — and finite fields and combinatorics have played an important part. Rabin’s fingerprinting scheme was tested extensively and compared against existing cryptographic algorithms, CRC and FNV. Moreover, a self-designed fuzzy hashing algorithm with the preliminary name No-Frills Hash has been created and tested against Nilsimsa and Spamsum. NFHash is based on Mersenne primes, and uses a sliding window to create a fuzzy hash. Futhermore, the usefullness of lookup tables (with <b>partial</b> <b>seeds)</b> were also explored. The fuzzy hashing algorithm has also been combined with a k-NN classifier to get an overview over it’s ability to classify files. In addition to NFHash, Bloom filters combined with Merkle Trees have been {{the most important part of}} this report. This combination will allow a user to see where a change was made, despite the fact that hash {{functions are}} one-way. Large parts of this project has dealt with the study of other open-source libraries and applications, such as Cassandra and SSDeep — as well as how bitcoins work. Optimizations have played a crucial role as well; different approaches to a problem might lead to the same solution, but resource consumption can be very different. RESULTS: The results have shown that the Merkle Tree-based approach can track changes to a table very quickly and efficiently, due to it being conservative when it comes to CPU resources. Moreover, the self-designed algorithm NFHash also does well in terms of file classification when it is coupled with a k-NN classifyer. CONCLUSION: Hash functions refers to a very diverse set of algorithms, and not just algorithms that serve a limited purpose. Fuzzy Fingerprinting Schemes can still be considered to be at their infant stage, but a lot has still happened the last ten years. This project has introduced two new ways to create and compare hashes that can be compared to similar, yet not necessarily identical files — or to detect if (and to what extent) a file was changed. Note that the algorithms presented here should be considered prototypes, and still might need some large scale testing to sort out potential flaw...|$|R

Thousand-grain weight (TGW) was evaluated by measuring the weight of 50 randomly-selected, fully-filled grains; this method was performed in triplicate and the values were averaged to yield a single mean. Grain length (GL), grain width (GW), grain thickness (GT) and length/width ratio were measured in 200 randomly selected fully filled grains with and without hull using a digimatic caliper (Mitutoyo Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Moisture content of the grain was measured using a Grain Moisture Meter (GMK- 303), and values were again averaged over 3 replications.|$|R
40|$|Priming {{offers an}} {{effective}} means to raise seed performance in fresh seeds of sweet corn (Zea mays L.) hybrid carrying mutated shrunken- 2 (sh- 2) genes. However, primed sh- 2 seeds generally have poorer longevity than non-primed seeds. The effects and mechanisms of priming on sh- 2 seed longevity remain unclear. This study evaluates the effects of partial vacuum storage on longevity and free radical processing systems of primed sh- 2 seeds. Priming was achieved by mixing the seeds with moist vermiculite and incubation at 15 or 20 degreesC for 36 h, followed by air-drying to the original moisture level. Primed seeds were vacuum-packed and stored at 25 degreesC for up to 12 months. Priming improved seedling emergence, reduced lipid peroxidation and enhanced antioxidative systems prior to storage. The longevity of 20 degreesC-primed seeds was decreased considerably in comparison with non-primed seeds when they were stored under non-vacuum conditions for 12 months. In contrast, 15 degreesC-primed seeds showed higher viability and vigor than non-primed control seeds when they were stored under non-vacuum conditions. Partial vacuum storage proved useful in extending the longevity of 15 degreesC-primed seeds for up to 12 months. The improved longevity {{was related to the}} decreased free radicals-mediated peroxidative responses. <b>Partial</b> vacuum improved <b>seed</b> vigor (e. g., the emergence percentage, the shortened mean emergence time and the increased seedling growth) were related to the reduced free radical-mediated peroxidation.

40|$|The primary {{somatosensory}} cortex (SI) plays {{a critical role}} in somatosensation as well as in action performance and social cognition. Although the SI has been a major target of experimental and clinical research using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to date information on the effect of TMS over the SI on its resting-state functional connectivity is very scant. Here, we explored whether continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a repetitive TMS protocol, administered over the SI can change the functional connectivity of the brain at rest, as measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). In a randomized order on two different days we administered active TMS or sham TMS over the left SI. TMS was delivered off-line before scanning by means of cTBS. The target area was selected previously and individually for each subject as the part of the SI activated both when the participant executes and observes actions. Three analytical approaches, both theory driven (<b>partial</b> correlations and <b>seed</b> based whole brain regression) and more data driven (Independent Component Analysis), indicated a reduction in functional connectivity between the stimulated part of the SI and several brain regions functionally associated with the SI including the dorsal premotor cortex, the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings highlight the impact of cTBS delivered over the SI on its functional connectivity at rest. Our data may have implications for experimental and therapeutic applications of cTBS over the SI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Dry seeds treated with constant white light, red light or blue light during 8 days and subsequently incubated in dark had final germination and duration of germination reduced, {{and the distribution of}} germination changed from highly asymmetric to symmetric respectively. Imbibing seeds incubated under constant blue or white light had final germination strongly reduced seven days after sowing (7. 3 % and 50. 1 % of the germination under dark) with significant differences between them. After transferral to dark, true complete recovery of germination of seeds treated with white light was observed 19 days after sowing, but only <b>partial</b> recovery in <b>seeds</b> treated with blue light. Results of dry and imbibed seeds are consistent with no activity of phytochromes, as expected in negatively photoblastic seeds. Results of dry seeds are seemingly contradictory because total germination data imply the inactivity of red and blue light photoreceptors, the opposite being implied by duration and shape of germination. A tentative hypothetical solution for the contradiction is presented. Results of imbibed seeds are fully consistent with cryptochromes but not with phototropins mediation of responses to light of seed germination in ‘Seaton Park’. The ecological and adaptive significance of such responses are discussed in the framework of light attenuation in soil and the requirement and ability of subterranean clover ‘Seaton Park’ to bury seeds...|$|R
40|$|Helium (He) nanodroplets {{irradiated}} by intense near-infrared laser pulses form a nanoplasma by avalanche-like electron impact ionizations even {{at lower}} laser intensities where He {{is not directly}} field ionized, provided that the droplets contain a few dopant atoms which provide seed electrons for the electron impact ionization avalanche. In this theoretical paper on calcium and xenon doped He droplets we elucidate the mechanism which induces ionization avalanches, termed ignition. We find that the <b>partial</b> loss of <b>seed</b> electrons from the activated droplets starkly assists ignition, as the Coulomb barrier for ionization of helium is lowered by the electric field of the dopant cations, and this deshielding of the cation charges enhances their electric field. In addition, the dopant ions assist the acceleration of the seed electrons (slingshot effect) by the laser field, supporting electron impact ionizations of He and also causing electron loss by catapulting electrons away. The dopants' ability to lower the Coulomb barriers at He {{as well as the}} slingshot effect decrease with the spatial expansion of the dopant, causing a dependence of the dopants' ignition capability on the dopant mass. Here, we develop criteria (impact count functions) to assess the ignition capability of dopants, based on (i) the spatial overlap of the seed electron cloud with the He atoms and (ii) the overlap of their kinetic energy distribution with the distribution of Coulomb barrier heights at He. The relatively long time delays between the instants of dopant ionization and ignition (incubation times) for calcium doped droplets are determined to a large extent by {{the time it takes to}} deshield the dopant ions...|$|R
30|$|Although annual Sorghum spp. has putatively {{increased}} in abundance across the northern Australian landscape due to contemporary fire regimes (Scott et al. 2009), {{it is important}} to understand what combination of fire season and frequency leads to optimal Sorghum spp. seed production for breeding Gouldian finches. It is also important to understand if fire regimes outside this optimal range can cause severe enough reduction in seed set to impact breeding finches. Determining the effect of fire on the availability of annual grass seed during the dry season is integral to informing fire management practices for conserving threatened breeding grass finches and many other granivorous species in tropical savannas. This study examines the effect of fire, including fire frequency, time since the last fire, and the seasonal timing of fire, on the density and fecundity of Sorghum stipoideum (Ewart & White) C.A. Gardn. & C.E. Hubb at Gouldian finch breeding sites in the east Kimberley, Western Australia. We hypothesize that very frequent fires (e.g., > 1 fire every 2 yr; Russell-Smith et al. 2013) will reduce the density of Sorghum spp. plants and abundance of seeds available to breeding Gouldian finches (Mott and Andrew 1985). We predict that early dry season fires will result in greater seed and plant density than high intensity late dry season fires due to <b>partial</b> loss of <b>seed</b> banks (Scott et al. 2010). We predict that seed production density will increase with increasing time since fire up to a certain threshold, then decline (Russell-Smith et al. 2003). Based on the abundance of annual Sorghum spp. at Gouldian finch breeding sites (Brazill-Boast et al. 2011), we also predict that seed density will be sufficient under most current fire regimes for breeding birds foraging for grass seeds.|$|R

The general objective of this thesis was to understand precisely how the mating system {{in combination with the}} cultivation practices affect the genetic structure and diversity of C. lanatus oleaginous type and its evolution in time. The genetic diversity and structure of 15 fields of C. lanatus oleaginous type in Côte d’Ivoire was characterized with the use of microsatellite markers. The reproduction biology of the C. lanatus oleaginous type was also studied, with an emphasis on the mating system and the magnitude of inbreeding depression. The outcrossing rate turned out to be high (0. 76), and no sign of inbreeding depression was found. Then each factor among the natural evolutionary forces (outcrossing rate, inbreeding depression) and cultivation practices (size of the fields, <b>partial</b> exchange of <b>seeds</b> between farmers, mode of selection of the seeds, reduction of the number fields) was analyzed, and its potential impact on the genetic diversity was quantified by means of Monte Carlo techniques. Eventually, the different evolutive forces were analyzed in a more inclusive approach in which the interplay between these forces was investigated. Based on the previously-mentioned experimental results, constraints on each evolution factors were derived. The analysis suggested that the outcrossing rate was likely to vary among the fields, and that the degree of genetic differentiation was likely to originate from a non-random selection of the seeds for the next crop cycles. This work also demonstrated the capabilities of a Monte Carlo based approach to quantify the risk of genetic erosion in traditionally cultivated crops.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Phaseolus coccineus L. plants require insects or {{hummingbirds}} {{to pollinate}} their flowers and set pods. The number of pods {{that can be}} produced by a plant is set {{by the number of}} flowers while the number of seeds is set by the number of ovules within the flowers (Stephenson, 1981). The arrest of the development of the <b>seed</b> after its <b>partial</b> differentiation, - <b>seed</b> abortion-, also determines the number of seeds per plant. The objective of this work is to determine the percentage of seed abortion per plant of two Mexican native varieties of Phaseolus coccineus L. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two varieties (accessions no. 8446 and 8448) were selected from the Mexican bean collection of the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias (INIFAP). Seeds harvested in November 2014, were sown in pots on April 5, 2015 and seedlings were transplanted outdoors on April 20, distant 2 meter apart. The plants were of indeterminate growth, climbing type. There were a natural occurrence of bees, bumblebees, and hummingbirds pollinators during the flowering period. The experiment was a complete randomized design, with two treatments (varieties), five replications (one plant per replication) and five sampling dates (Oct. 14, Nov. 4, Nov. 25, Dec. 9, and Dec. 16). At each sampling date, the mature pods per plant were harvested and opened. The following data were registered: a) the number of normal seeds per pod; b) the number of aborted seeds per pod including early abortions detected with the stereoscopic microscope. The sum of (a) and (b) = c, which represented the potential number of seeds per POD in each sampling date. It was evident at this point that practically all the pods in a variety had the same potential number of seeds. Therefore, the potential number of seeds per PLANT in each sampling date represented by Y = c*n, where n represents the number of pods per plant in each sampling date. Following when applicable, the similar procedure for seed abortion: Z = total number of aborted seeds per plant in each sampling date. The percentage of seed abortion (Z/Y) * 100 (total number of aborted seeds per plant in each sampling date/potential number of seeds per plant in each sampling date) ...|$|R

Jacq. in Hawai'i is {{afflicted with}} a severe yellowing disorder with symptoms which include the production of pendulous, chlorotic witches' brooms, a decrease in leaf size combined with the distortion of leaf lamina, the suppression of flowering, and progressive defoliation leading to the eventual death of afflicted plants. The disease was first reported in 1984 occurring in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park {{on the island of}} Hawai'i and has since been observed on the islands of Kauai, Maui, and Oahu. Field studies initiated in 1988 and continued over a three year period indicate a slow rate of spread of the disease based upon visual symptom expression. Viruslike particles 16 nm in diameter and 700 nm in length and double-stranded RNA of molecular weight 3 X 106 daltons were isolated from diseased plants but were absent from healthy plants. DNA complementary to dsRNA was cloned in E. coli and shown to be of non-host origin. Leaves from symptomatic and symptomless plants collected from field sites on Hawai'i, Maui, and Kauai were tested with a probe prepared from the highly conserved 165 ribosomal gene of Western X MLO, which has been shown to reliably detect MLOs {{from a wide range of}} hosts. On all the islands sampled, 80 % of the symptomatic plants and 33 % of the symptomless plants growing near diseased plants tested positively with this probe. Leaves and roots of healthy plants grown from seed collected from symptomless D. viscosa did not react with this probe. Pleiomorphic bodies resembling MLOs were observed in phloem tissues of diseased plants using DAPI staining and transmission electron microscopy. Such structures were not observed in healthy plants grown from <b>seed.</b> <b>Partial</b> alleviation of symptoms on diseased plants was noted following stem injections of oxytetracycline at 100 µg/ml. Attempts to transmit MLOs between D. viscosa and Catharanthus roseus by Cuscuta sandwichiana and C. campestris were not successful. The evidence suggests a complex etiology for the yellows disease of Dodonaea viscosa in Hawai'i which includes both viral and mycoplasmal agents...|$|R
40|$|Phytophthora {{root and}} stem rot (PRR), {{caused by the}} oomycete Phytophthora sojae, is an {{economically}} important soybean disease in the North Central Region of the United States, including Iowa. Management of PRR includes the use of specific resistance (Rps genes), <b>partial</b> resistance, and <b>seed</b> treatment fungicides. We had three objectives specific to PRR in Iowa; (i) to determine the within field population diversity of P. sojae in fields {{with a history of}} PRR, (ii) to screen 32 PI lines identified with unique resistance to P. sojae with isolates from Iowa and determine their value for future breeding efforts and (iii) to determine if seed treatment fungicides in combination with partial resistant cultivars of soybean would be a useful management tool against PRR.;Previous surveys in Iowa recovered 12 races of the pathogen between 1966 and 2004. These surveys collected a single isolate from each site. We proposed multiple races could be identified from a single site, based on evidence from Ohio, Arkansas and Australia surveys. Three fields in Iowa with a history of PRR were extensively sampled. Soil samples were baited using leaf disc and seedling baiting methods. A total of 36 isolates of P. sojae were collected. Of those, 32 were identified to race or pathotype. We found multiple races and pathotypes in two fields sampled. Eleven races and 13 pathotypes are reported new to Iowa.;Rps genes generally are defeated by P. sojae populations between 8 and 15 years after deployment. Due to the pathogen 2 ̆ 7 s ability to defeat Rps genes, new sources of resistance need to be discovered and incorporated into commercial soybean lines. As part of a collaborative study with the North Central Soybean Research program, we screened 32 previously identified plant introduction (PI) lines against isolates of P. sojae collected in Iowa to identify potential resistance beneficial to Iowa soybean growers. We screened the PIs in four fields {{as well as in the}} greenhouse using four layer tests with multiple combinations of isolates. We found six PI lines (PI 398693, PI 399079, PI 408029, PI 424487 B, PI 567374, and PI 407974 B) with possible new sources of resistance to be incorporated into Iowa soybeans.;Partial resistance does not become active until the VC growth stage of the soybean, causing the seed and seedling to be susceptible to disease at planting and early stages of growth. Application of fungicide seed treatments, including the active ingredients metalaxyl and mefenoxam, are suggested in areas of strong disease pressure and favorable environmental conditions for disease development. We evaluated the use of fungicide seed treatments in combination with partial resistance as a potential effective management tool, as part of a collaborative study of the North Central Soybean Research Program. Three fields with a history of PRR were identified and field trials were conducted over two years in a split plot design, with the main plot including cultivar of soybean (2 susceptible; Sloan and Williams, 2 reportedly partial resistant; Stine 2402 and S 27 -T 7, and 2 with Rps genes; Archer with Rps 1 k and 6 and 2834 RR with Rps 1 k). The subplot included three seed treatments; a control untreated, Apron XLRTM and Apron XLRTM plus Apron MaxxRTM. Evaluations included initial stand counts, disease incidence taken twice in the growing season, final stand counts and yields. Disease pressure was low due to unfavorable environmental conditions for P. sojae development. As results of these conditions, we are unable to make any conclusions to the effectiveness of using fungicide seed treatments in combination with partial resistance as an effective management tool...|$|R
