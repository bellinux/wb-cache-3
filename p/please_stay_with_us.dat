'I told WEAN that if they wanted a show {{with a lot of}} flash and sizzle, they didn't want me,' said Wilson. 'I told them I wanted to do a guest-oriented program that would treat the callers with respect.' [...] “Chuck Wilson on Sports” broke twenty wire stories in its first three years and was first to correctly report the postponement of the Hearns-Hagler fight. “At the time I went on the air (to break the news that the fight in Detroit would be postponed), the promoter (Bob Arum) was in Detroit saying that the fight was still on. That night, Goody and Pat Petronelli (Hagler’s handlers) called me and said ‘Chuck, <b>please</b> <b>stay</b> in touch <b>with</b> <b>us</b> tonight. You guys know what’s going on more than we do.’ “If you hustle, {{you get a lot of}} breaks like that, said Wilson.” [...] The Providence Journal wrote “Wilson has slowly and surely developed a first-class show in Providence. And it’s not just that he routinely has quality guests on, that he’s given local callers a chance to talk with the likes of John Wooden, Al McGuire, Red Barber, Ted Williams, Marvelous Marvin Hagler…or that “Chuck Wilson on Sports” has broken some big stories in this market…or that it’s a program involved in the business of sports reporting, not merely in conversing with callers....It’s that the show has established its niche without having to resort to gimmicks. No laugh tracks. No screaming. No making fun of callers” [...] The Boston Globe wrote: “Wilson was a pioneer in having quality guests from other media: The (Boston) Globe’s Bob Ryan, football guru Mel Kiper Jr., ESPN’s Peter Gammons, and local Providence writers were regulars”. [...] The Providence Journal wrote “Wilson’s logical, even-handed approach and sharp interviewing technique have served him well…Last fall (1984), it claimed more adult male listeners during its time period than any other program in the market.” ...|$|R
