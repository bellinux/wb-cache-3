5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another <b>party</b> <b>may</b> conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial <b>party</b> <b>may</b> have {{counted as}} many as nine cardinals. but only six can be {{actually}} identified as its members: Ottaviano of S. Cecilia, Giovanni of SS. Silvestro e Martino, Guido of S. Maria in Trastevere, Imar of Tusculum, Raymond of S. Maria in Via Lata and Simeone of S. Maria in Domnica Guglielmo of S. Pietro in Vincoli was probably the seventh one. Perhaps Cardinal Cinzio of S. Adriano also belonged to this faction. The remaining ten cardinals were neutral.|$|E
5|$|The Sainte-Laguë {{method is}} used for allocating {{parliamentary}} seats to parties. As a result, the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to the nationwide percentage of votes. Still, a party with {{a high number of}} votes in only one constituency can win a seat there even if the nationwide percentage is low. This has happened several times in Norwegian history. Conversely, if a party's initial representation in Parliament is proportionally less than its share of votes, the <b>party</b> <b>may</b> seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that the nationwide percentage is above the election threshold, at 4 percent. In 2005, nineteen seats were allocated via the leveling system.|$|E

5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each <b>party</b> <b>may</b> agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E
5|$|The First Punic War {{began in}} 264 BC when {{settlements}} on Sicily began {{to appeal to}} the two powers between which they lay– Rome and Carthage– in order to solve internal conflicts. The willingness of both Rome and Carthage to become embroiled on the soil of a third <b>party</b> <b>may</b> indicate a willingness to test each other's power without wishing to enter a full war of annihilation; certainly there was considerable disagreement within Rome about whether to prosecute the war at all. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on, such as the Battle of Agrigentum, but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. For the Romans, naval warfare was a relatively unexplored concept. Before the First Punic War in 264 BC there was no Roman navy to speak of, as all previous Roman wars had been fought on land in Italy. The new war in Sicily against Carthage, a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train sailors.|$|E
5|$|The Progress Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards the Progress Party and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the Progress Party is the only populist party in Norway, with all the other parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism could actually be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the Progress <b>Party</b> <b>may.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tales of Vesperia is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{set in a}} fantasy world featuring three-dimensional environments and characters. The game's environments are split into two types. On the field map, the main characters navigate reduced-scale environments. A compass and mini-map are displayed, along with towns, other named locations, and enemy icons. Striking an enemy icon triggers a battle, while interacting with a town causes the party to enter it. In battle and towns or similar locations, characters move around environments built on a lifelike scale relative to the human characters. In these areas, the <b>party</b> <b>may</b> interact with non-player characters (NPCs). Within these environments, items such as crates came be moved by the currently-assigned character. After {{a certain point in}} the game, an item called the Sorcerer's Ring is given to the party, enabling them to shoot bolts of energy. These bolts can be used to activate switches, move objects, and attack enemies from a distance. Save points can be found in dungeons and towns. Items such as equipment and weapons are purchased with Gald, the in-game currency. While in environments, players can trigger optional character conversations called Skits. In Skits, characters are represented by head-and-shoulder portraits, and the conversations can range from dramatic to comedic.|$|E
