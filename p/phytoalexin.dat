40|$|Indole <b>phytoalexins</b> from crucifers {{have been}} shown to exhibit {{significant}} anti-cancer, chemopreventive, and antiproliferative activity. <b>Phytoalexins</b> are natural low molecular antimicrobial compounds that are synthesized and accumulated in plants after their exposure to pathogenic microorganisms.

40|$|<b>Phytoalexins</b> are low {{molecular}} weight antimicrobial compounds that are produced by plants {{as a response to}} biotic and abiotic stresses. As such they take part in an intricate defense system which enables plants to control invading microorganisms. In the 1950 s, research on <b>phytoalexins</b> started with progress in their biochemistry and bio-organic chemistry, resulting in the determination of their structure, their biological activity, as well as mechanisms of their synthesis and catabolism by microorganisms. Elucidation of the biosynthesis of numerous <b>phytoalexins</b> also permitted the use of molecular biology tools for the exploration of the genes encoding enzymes of their synthesis pathways and their regulators. This has led to potential applications for increasing plant resistance to diseases. <b>Phytoalexins</b> display an enormous diversity belonging to various chemical families such as for instance, phenolics, terpenoids, furanoacetylenes, steroid glycoalkaloids, sulfur-containing compounds and indoles.

50|$|Phytoalexins {{produced}} in plants act as toxins to the attacking organism.

Mutants incapable of <b>phytoalexin</b> production exhibit more extensive pathogen colonization as compared to wild type.
