Cambodia Poverty Assessment 2013", the World Bank concludes: [...] "Over {{the seven}} years from 2004 through 2011, Cambodian economic growth was tremendous, ranking amid {{the best in the}} world. Moreover, household consumption increased by nearly 40 percent. And this growth was pro-poor—not only reducing inequality, but also proportionally boosting poor people's consumption further and faster than that of the non-poor. As a result, the poverty rate dropped from 52.2 to 20.5 percent, surpassing all expectations and far exceeding the country's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) <b>poverty</b> <b>target.</b> However, the majority of these people escaped poverty only slightly: they remain highly vulnerable—even to small shocks—which could quickly bring them back into poverty.".|$|E
40|$|Minister Burton {{launches}} {{public consultation}} on the Review of the National <b>Poverty</b> <b>Target.</b> The Minister for Social Protection today launched a public consultation process to be undertaken by her Department {{as part of}} the review of the national <b>poverty</b> <b>target.</b> The purpose of the review is to enable the Government to adopt appropriate and achievable national poverty targets to meet Ireland’s contribution to Europe 2020 and the commitments in the programme for government. The review is to be completed by November 2011. Minister Burton said: ‘I am inviting the public to have its say on the review of the national <b>poverty</b> <b>target.</b> It is vital that there is widespread public support for the national <b>poverty</b> <b>target,</b> so that all elements of society are engaged in the common aim of reducing and eliminating poverty. I am particularly keen to hear the views of people experiencing poverty and the groups that work with people in poverty. ’ The Minister continued: ‘While Ireland {{is in the midst of}} a major economic and fiscal crisis, it is important that we keep in mind the importance of protecting the most vulnerable in society. The national <b>poverty</b> <b>target</b> provides a key reference point in developing economic and social policies. The national <b>poverty</b> <b>target</b> is also the means by which we contribute to the new European <b>poverty</b> <b>target,</b> which aims to lift at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and exclusion by 2020. ’ A key element of the consultation is to ascertain the views of people experiencing poverty from across the country. In order to do this a series of four workshops in local community venues will take place where people can have their say on the current poverty targets and how a new <b>poverty</b> <b>target</b> can be achieved. These workshops will take place in September next at local venues in Cork, Donegal, Dublin and Galway. In addition an online survey will be carried out in order to ascertain the views of the public on the current <b>poverty</b> <b>target</b> and how this target can be strengthened in the future. The survey will be hosted on 'www. socialinclusion. ie'. It will remain open until 30 th September to allow interested parties as much time as is possible to respond. Further consultations include a workshop with technical experts from government departments, agencies, social partners, and research organisations, and bilateral meetings with the social partners, including the community and voluntary pillar. The review will also be a key theme at the 9 th annual Social Inclusion Forum taking place on November 9 th next in the F 2 Centre, Fatima, Dublin 8. This event will be attended by up to 200 community and voluntary representatives. A consultation paper has been prepared providing further information on the review itself, how poverty is defined and measured, the policy context of the review and progress made towards the national <b>poverty</b> <b>target.</b> This paper is available on 'www. socialinclusion. ie'. A report of the consultation process will inform the final report of the review to be presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. The review is being undertaken by the Department of Social Protection. Ends Note to Editors: For information, the national <b>poverty</b> <b>target,</b> as set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007 - 2016, is to reduce the rate of consistent poverty to between 2 - 4 per cent by 2012 and to eliminate it by 2016, from a baseline rate of 7 per cent in 2005. The latest (2009) figures show a consistent poverty rate of 5. 5 per cent. This is an increase on the 2008 rate of 4. 2 per cent.

40|$|The current welfare-to-work {{reform in}} Britain is {{activating}} lone parents with older children and marks a step-change {{in the treatment}} of lone parents. While there has been some support for using age of child as selection criterion for the activation of lone parents, {{it is not clear whether}} this equates to selecting by ‘ability to work’ if interpreted as ability to obtain a job. The commitment of the current government to evidence-based-policy-making and the large amount of research available in this area form the justification for carrying out a policy appraisal of this aspect of the current welfare-to-work reform. The potential and likelihood to make substantial progress towards the lone parent employment and the child <b>poverty</b> <b>target</b> of the selection criteria will be assessed and compared to alternative approaches. Five selection models are identified in the international policy review: selection by age of child, transition status, employability or by caseworkers and finally, a voluntary model. The analysis is based on a critical discussion of the available evidence, an international policy review and secondary analysis of the Families and Children Study. I argue that the current approach of selecting lone parents by the age of child is unlikely to result in substantial progress towards the lone parent employment target and instead likely to create a substantial group of long-term unemployed lone parents. Alternative approaches, such as using different selection criteria that take into account the employability of lone parents are more likely to make progress towards the employment and child <b>poverty</b> <b>target...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Poverty</b> <b>targeting</b> {{programs}} can in principle be assessed as projects using {{the tools of}} either cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis. In practice where quantitative assessments have been made they are principally a form of cost-effectiveness calculations based on costs per unit of benefit received by the poor. Many poverty programs appear high cost due to the targeting problems of undercoverage (as some of the poor are excluded) and leakage (as some beneficiaries are not poor). Problems also arise {{for a number of}} reasons including lack of funding, difficulties in identifying who the poor are, technical errors of design and weak governance. This paper discusses conceptual issues and draws on empirical evidence from five country surveys commissioned by the ADB Institute.

40|$|This paper compares for 13 Latin American {{countries}} the poverty and inequality impacts of cash transfer {{programs that are}} given to all children and the elderly (that is, "categorical" transfers), to programs of equal budget that are confined to the poor within each population group (that is, "poverty targeted" transfers). The analysis finds that both the incidence of poverty {{and the depth of}} the poverty gap are important factors affecting the relative effectiveness of categorical versus <b>poverty</b> <b>targeted</b> transfers. The comparison of transfers to children and the elderly also supports the view that choosing carefully categories of beneficiaries is almost as important as targeting the poor for achieving a high poverty and inequality impact. Overall, the findings suggest that although in the Latin American context <b>poverty</b> <b>targeting</b> tends to deliver higher poverty impacts, there are circumstances under which categorical targeting confined to geographical regions (sometimes called "geographic targeting") may be a valid option to consider.

This emphasis led to the establishment by the United Nations of the so-called International Development Targets for poverty reduction. The achievement of a target requires policies, and policies are most effective within an overall, coherent strategy.

It also concludes that the government is on course to just hit its target measuring incomes after housing costs (AHC). However, there are uncertainties in making these forecasts, not least because the government uses a survey of around 30, 000 households to estimate child poverty in a population roughly a thousand times as large.

METHODS: In an explorative study, a discrete choice experiment was carried out to determine the relative importance of different criteria in identifying priority interventions in Ghana. Thirty respondents chose between 12 pairs of scenarios that described interventions in terms of medical and non-medical criteria. Subsequently, a composite league table was constructed to rank order a set of interventions by mapping interventions on those criteria and considering the relative weights of different criteria. RESULTS: Interventions that are cost-effective, reduce <b>poverty,</b> <b>target</b> severe diseases, or target the young had a higher probability of being chosen than others. The composite league table showed that high priority interventions in Ghana are prevention of mother to child transmission in HIV/AIDS control, and treatment of pneumonia and diarrhoea in childhood. Low priority interventions are certain interventions to control blood pressure, tobacco and alcohol abuse. The composite league table lead to a different and more differentiated rank ordering of interventions compared to pure efficiency ratings. CONCLUSION: This explorative study has introduced a multi-criteria approach to priority setting. It has shown the feasibility of accounting for efficiency, equity and other societal concerns in prioritization decisions, and its potentially large impact on priority setting...|$|E

As a theoretical framework, we extend the poverty-targeting model of Besley and Kanbur (1988) by considering multiple donors and possible strategic interactions among them. To test theoretical predictions, we employ detailed data on grant aid allocation of eleven major aid donor countries and on aid disbursement of six international institutions including the IBRD, IDA, and UN organizations. Four main empirical results emerged. First, both in the late- 1990 s and the early- 2000 s, grant allocations from Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, and UK are consistent with the necessary conditions of optimal <b>poverty</b> <b>targeting.</b> Second, we found that there is a negative population scale effect for aid allocation, suggesting that strategic motives may also exist.

40|$|An April 2015 World Bank {{report on}} the Millennium Development Goal <b>poverty</b> <b>target</b> has {{revealed}} that extreme poverty has been decreasing in all {{regions of the world}} with the exception of Africa. This study extends the implications of Thomas Piketty 2 ̆ 019 s celebrated literature from developed countries to the nexus between developed nations and African countries by building on responses from Rogoff (2014) and Stiglitz (2014), post Washington Consensus paradigms and underpinnings from Solow-Swan and Boyce-Fofack-Ndikumana. The central argument presented is that the inequality problem {{is at the heart of}} rational asymmetric development between rich and poor countries. Piketty has shown that inequality increases when the return on capital is higher than the growth rate, because the poor cannot catch-up with the rich. We argue that when the return on political economy (or capitalism-fuelled illicit capital flight) is higher than the growth rate in African countries, inequality in development increases and Africa may not catch-up with the developed world. As an ideal solution, Piketty has proposed progressive income taxation based on automatic exchange of bank information. The ideal analogy proposed in tackling the spirit of African poverty is a comprehensive commitment to fighting illicit capital flight based on this. Hence, contrary to theoretical underpinnings of exogenous growth models, catch-up may not be so apparent. Implications for the corresponding upward bias in endogenous development and catch-up literature are discussed...|$|E

Among the core targets identified to monitor the progress toward the vision 2021 objectives is that of attaining a poverty headcount of 14 percent by 2021. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to answer the following question: given Bangladesh's performance in poverty reduction over the last decades, can the author expect the proportion of the country's population living in poverty to be 14 percent by 2022 ?

Our poverty projections based on the last three Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES) surveys suggest that Bangladesh will achieve its Millennium Development Goal, or MDG goal of halving its poverty headcount to 28. 5 percent by 2015 significantly ahead of schedule. Attaining the vision 2021 <b>poverty</b> <b>target</b> of 14 percent by 2021, however, is less certain as it requires a Gross Domestic Product, or GDP growth of at least 8 percent, or more than 2 percentage points higher than that observed in recent years...|$|E
40|$|Kenya has {{ascribed}} to the Millennium Declaration and {{is already in the}} process of mobilising resources and instituting measures to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). A MDGs status report on Kenya indicates that progress has been made towards achieving the goal of universal primary education. However, the Government will need to scale-up its efforts beyond the current momentum, if the other goals are to be realised by 2015. A preliminary conclusion is that the resource requirements are not extremely large to reach the MDGs in Kenya. If the resources are effectively used and targeted to MDG sectors they could have a substantial impact on whether Kenya would reach the MDGs or not. Some targets seem to be easier to reach than others. The target of 100 percent completion in primary school can be achieved with some additional resources targeted to the primary sector. However, a substantial increase of resources is needed at secondary and tertiary level of education to reach other goals set by the Kenyan government. Even if higher investment in all MDGsectors is needed the water sector seems to be requiring a substantial increase compared to what have been invested in the past. With regard to poverty our results show that annual average real GDP growth rate of around 8 percent would be enough to meet the <b>poverty</b> <b>target</b> of reducing the number of poor by half.
