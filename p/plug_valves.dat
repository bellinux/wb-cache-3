5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> are valves with {{cylindrical}} or conically tapered [...] "plugs" [...] {{which can}} be rotated inside the valve body to control flow through the valve. The plugs in <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> have one or more hollow passageways going sideways through the plug, so that fluid can flow through the plug when the valve is open. <b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> are simple and often economical.|$|E
50|$|Slightly conically tapered metal (often brass) <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> {{are often}} used as simple {{shut-off}} valves in household natural gas lines.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} for a plug valve {{to have more than}} two ports. In a 3-way plug valve, flow from one port could be directed to either the second or third port. A 3-way plug valve could also be designed to shift flow between ports 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 1 and 3, and possibly even connect all three ports together. The flow-directing possibilities in multi-port <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> are similar to the possibilities in corresponding multi-port ball valves or corresponding multi-port valves with a rotor. An additional possibility in <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> is to have one port {{on one side of the}} plug valve and two ports on the other side, with two diagonal and parallel fluid pathways inside the plug. In this case the plug can be rotated 180° to connect the port on the one side to either of the two ports on the other side.|$|E

5000|$|When using Schlenk systems, {{including}} flasks, the use {{of grease}} is often necessary at stopcock valves and ground glass joints to provide a gas tight seal and prevent glass pieces from fusing. In contrast, teflon <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> may have a trace of oil as a lubricant but generally no grease. In the following text any [...] "connection" [...] {{is assumed to be}} rendered mostly air free through a series of vac-refill cycles.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} Schlenk bombs {{can perform}} {{many of the}} functions of a standard Schlenk flask. Even when the opening is used to fit a bomb to a manifold, the plug can still be removed to add or remove material from the bomb. In some situations, however, Schlenk bombs are less convenient than standard Schlenk flasks: they lack an accessible ground glass joint to attach additional apparatus; the opening provided by <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> {{can be difficult to}} access with a spatula, and it can be much simpler to work with a septum designed to fit a ground glass joint than with a Teflon plug.|$|E
50|$|A bonnet {{acts as a}} {{cover on}} the valve body. It is {{commonly}} semi-permanently screwed into the valve body or bolted onto it. During manufacture of the valve, the internal parts are put into the body and then the bonnet is attached to hold everything together inside. To access internal parts of a valve, a user would take off the bonnet, usually for maintenance. Many valves do not have bonnets; for example, <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> usually do not have bonnets. Many ball valves do not have bonnets since the valve body is put together in a different style, such as being screwed together at {{the middle of the}} valve body.|$|E

50|$|This {{pressure}} {{is transferred to}} the valve stem, which is connected to either the <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> (see <b>plug</b> <b>valve),</b> butterfly valve etc. Larger forces are required in high pressure or high flow pipelines to allow the valve to overcome these forces, {{and allow it to}} move the valves moving parts to control the material flowing inside.|$|R
50|$|When {{the plug}} is conically tapered, the stem/handle is {{typically}} {{attached to the}} larger diameter end of the plug. <b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> usually do not have bonnets but often have {{the end of the}} plug with the handle exposed or mostly exposed to the outside. In such cases, there is usually not much of a stem. The stem and handle often come in one piece, often a simple, approximately L-shaped handle attached {{to the end of the}} plug. The other end of the plug is often exposed to the outside of the valve too, but with a mechanism that retains the plug in the body.|$|E
5000|$|For {{laboratory}} glassware, items {{sometimes have}} <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> with conically-tapered inserts called stopcocks (sometimes {{referred to as}} [...] "plugs" [...] by laypeople) with different bores. The valve bodies are usually made of glass, while the plugs are made of glass or Teflon. One also can find valves with Teflon spindle (for example one way valves or angled valves) When the plug is made of glass, the handle and plug are fused together in one piece out of glass. When both valve body and plug are made of glass, a suitable grease (e.g. silicone grease or Ramsay grease) is usually used to give a good seal, {{as well as to}} prevent the valve from seizing and subsequently cracking.|$|E
50|$|In 1855, John Ramsbottom, later {{locomotive}} {{superintendent of}} the LNWR, described {{a new form of}} safety valve intended to improve reliability and especially to be tamper-resistant. A pair of <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> were used, held down by a common spring-loaded lever between them with a single central spring. This lever was characteristically extended rearwards, often reaching into the cab on early locomotives. Rather than discouraging the use of the spring lever by the fireman, Ramsbottom's valve encouraged this. Rocking the lever freed up the valves alternately and checked that neither was sticking in its seat. Even if the fireman held the lever down and increased the force on the rear valve, there was a corresponding reduction of force on the forward valve.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} common general type of <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> is a 2-port valve with two positions: open to allow flow, and shut (closed) to stop flow. Ports are {{openings in the}} valve body through which fluid can enter or leave. The plug {{in this kind of}} valve has one passageway going through it. The ports are typically at opposite ends of the body; therefore, the plug is rotated a fourth of a full turn to change from open to shut positions. This makes this kind of <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> a quarter-turn valve. There is often a mechanism limiting motion of the handle to a quarter turn, but not in glass stopcocks.|$|R
50|$|Valves {{are used}} to {{redirect}} flows through pipes. Two types of valves used in laboratory glassware are the stopcock valve and the threaded <b>plug</b> <b>valve.</b> These and other terms used below are defined in detail since they are bound to conflict with different sources.|$|R
50|$|The proper {{construction}} of this claim {{was that it}} covered an automatic valve in combination with a contrivance consisting of a pinhole and pin, by which the valve may be raised from its seat, so as to leave the valve hole permanently open, or by which the valve may be rigidly closed upon its seat, making a closed or <b>plug</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|Threaded <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} {{significantly}} in air-sensitive chemistry {{as well as}} when a vessel must be closed completely {{as in the case}} of Schlenk bombs. The construction of a threaded plug valve involves a plug with a threaded cap which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of female glass. Screwing the plug in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or plastic, near the plug's base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. Screwing the plug valve all the way in engages the plug's tip with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal. This seal separates the region beyond the bevel and the O-rings already mentioned.|$|E
5000|$|Stopcocks used in {{laboratory}} glassware are typically forms of conically tapered <b>plug</b> <b>valves.</b> When fused with the glassware, the valve bodies {{are made of}} glass. Otherwise, they can be made of an inert plastic such as Teflon. The plugs can be made of a similar plastic or glass. When the plug is made of glass, the handle and plug are fused together in one piece out of glass. When glass is used for both the stopcock body and the plug, the contacting surfaces between them are special ground glass surfaces (see Laboratory glassware) often with stopcock grease in between. Special glass stopcocks are made for vacuum applications, such as in use with vacuum manifolds. Stopcock grease is always used in high vacuum applications to make the stopcock air-tight. Also if the plug valve is [...] "locked" [...] from being in the open or closed position for an extended amount of time lubricant can be added through the greaser with the valve in service.|$|E
50|$|A disc or {{valve member}} is a movable {{obstruction}} inside the stationary body that adjustably restricts {{flow through the}} valve. Although traditionally disc-shaped, discs come in various shapes. Depending {{on the type of}} valve, a disc can move linearly inside a valve, or rotate on the stem (as in a butterfly valve), or rotate on a hinge or trunnion (as in a check valve). A ball is a round valve member with one or more paths between ports passing through it. By rotating the ball, flow can be directed between different ports. Ball valves use spherical rotors with a cylindrical hole drilled as a fluid passage. <b>Plug</b> <b>valves</b> use cylindrical or conically tapered rotors called plugs. Other round shapes for rotors are possible as well in rotor valves, as long as the rotor can be turned inside the valve body. However, not all round or spherical discs are rotors; for example, a ball check valve uses the ball to block reverse flow, but is not a rotor because operating the valve does not involve rotation of the ball.|$|E
50|$|These operate by {{the varying}} {{viscosity}} of liquids and gases and {{are designed for}} situations, such as fire truck hoses, {{where there is a}} large flow and a large quantity of air to be vented rapidly. A conical <b>plug</b> <b>valve</b> is spring-loaded. Flow around this valve acts against spring pressure. Flow of liquid is sufficient to hold the valve against the spring, flow of air is not.|$|R
40|$|<b>Plug</b> check <b>valves</b> are {{frequently}} used in high pressure systems where parallel pump operations are envisaged, {{in order to}} prevent flow recirculation through the out-of-service pump. Serious operational problems are sometimes encountered with these valves during pump changeovers. Full equations of the dynamic behaviour of the <b>plug</b> check <b>valves</b> are derived and results are obtained for their performance in a typical power plant system. Criteria for the design of the <b>plug</b> check <b>valves</b> are also developed.

50|$|Vas-occlusive {{contraception}} {{is a form}} of {{male contraception}} that blocks sperm transport in the vas deferens, the tubes that carry sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts. Various vas-occlusive contraceptive methods have been researched for human-use, with interest in both reversible and irreversible methods, with the purpose of finding a suitable alternative to vasectomy and possible hormonal contraceptive treatments that are currently being researched. Potential methods include clips, <b>plugs,</b> <b>valves,</b> and other devices.|$|R
50|$|Many valves are {{controlled}} manually with a handle {{attached to the}} stem. If the handle is turned ninety degrees between operating positions, the valve is called a quarter-turn valve. Butterfly, ball valves, and <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> are often quarter-turn valves. If the handle is circular with the stem as the axis of rotation {{in the center of}} the circle, then the handle is called a handwheel. Valves can also be controlled by actuators attached to the stem. They can be electromechanical actuators such as an electric motor or solenoid, pneumatic actuators which {{are controlled}} by air pressure, or hydraulic actuators which are controlled by the pressure of a liquid such as oil or water. Actuators can be used for the purposes of automatic control such as in washing machine cycles, remote control such as the use of a centralised control room, or because manual control is too difficult such as when the valve is very large. Pneumatic actuators and hydraulic actuators need pressurised air or liquid lines to supply the actuator: an inlet line and an outlet line. Pilot valves are valves which are used to control other valves. Pilot valves in the actuator lines control the supply of air or liquid going to the actuators.|$|E
40|$|The term "valve " {{applies to}} a variety of devices for {{controlling}} the flow of liquid. Various valves allow for on-off control, modulation of the flow rate through the system, and prevention of back flow. They can also be used for pressure relief or as a safety device. In general, valves can vary from simple manual on-off devices to sophisticated control equipment which act as metering instruments and deliver predetermined amounts of water to the system.

40|$|Abstract- Data on {{pressure}} drop were obtained in stainless steel, sanitary fittings and valves during laminar and turbulent flow of aqueous solutions of sucrose and xanthan gum, which were selected as model fluids.

Friction losses were measured in fully and partially open butterfly and <b>plug</b> <b>valves,</b> bends and unions. Values of loss coefficients (kf) were calculated and correlated {{as a function}} of the generalized Reynolds number by the two-k method. The model adjustment was satisfactory and was better in the laminar flow range (0. 976 ≤ r 2 ≤ 0. 999) than in the turbulent flow range (0. 774 ≤ r 2 ≤ 0. 989). In order to test the adequacy of the results for predicting loss coefficients during flow of real fluids, experiments were conducted with coffee extract. Comparison between experimental and predicted loss coefficients showed very good agreement...|$|E
40|$|This {{development}} {{program is a}} joint effort among the Northeast Gas Association (formerly New York Gas Group), Foster-Miller, Inc., and the US Department of Energy (DOE) through the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). The DOE's contribution to this project is $ 572, 525 {{out of a total}} of $ 772, 525. The present report summarizes the accomplishments of the project during its third three-month period (from April 2003 through June 2003). The project was initiated with delay in February 2003 due to contractual issues that emerged between NGA and Foster-Miller, Inc. The two organizations are working diligently to maintain the program's pace and expect to complete it in time. The efforts of the project focused during this period in finalizing the assessment of the tether technology, which is intended to be used as the means of communication between robot and operator. Results indicate that the tether is a viable option under certain pipeline operating conditions, but not all. Concerns also exist regarding the abrasion resistance of the tether, this issue being the last studied. Substantial work was also conducted on the design of the robotic platform, which has progressed very well. Finally, work on the MFL sensor, able to negotiate all pipeline obstacles (including <b>plug</b> <b>valves),</b> was initiated by PII following the successful completion of the subcontract negotiations between Foster-Miller and PII.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the vapor pressure and concentration measurement of newly discovered environmentally friendly refrigerants 1, 1 -difluoroethane (R 152 a) and 1, 1, 1, 3, 3 -Pentafluorbutane (R 365 mfc), besides their mixture. The experimental procedure {{used in this}} work was a VLE recirculation type apparatus in which the liquid phase is circulating around the equilibrium cell. Â Special attention was given to enable a highly accurate vapor pressure measurement up to maximum pressure of 25 bar. The liquid sampling method was perfected {{through the use of}} quick <b>plug</b> <b>valves</b> at the circulation loop of the VLE apparatus. This approach has a great effect in solving the problems of changing the volume of the fluids inside the equilibrium cell, since the sampling unit needs a minimum amount of fluid to be sampled. Moreover a new method for measuring the concentration of this mixture through using a vibrating tube densitometer apparatus (DMA-HPM) has been realized. This apparatus was able to supply data in the temperature range of - 10 to 200 Â°C and pressure of 0 to 1400 bar, with an uncertainty of 0. 1 %. Â The experimental data was validated using the Volume Translated Peng Robinson Equation of State and high precision fundamental equations of state by McLinden from National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST). Other models such as Modified Huron Vidal, Wong Sandler, Lee Kesler and Hoffman Florin have been verified. Amongst all the models, McLinden et. al model achieved vapor pressure deviations of less than 0. 073 % for R 365 mfc. The concentration deviations reached - 3. 1 %,- 9. 8 % for a composition of 33. 6 % R 152 a and 44. 1 % R 365 mfc respectively. The deviations of VTPR and VTPR-MHV 2 have led to similar results data in the pure fluids and the mixture respectively. ...|$|E
