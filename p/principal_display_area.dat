40|$|Introduction: The Guidelines for the {{implementation}} of Article 11 of the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) require that cigarette health warning labels should include pictures and take up 50 % or more of the <b>principal</b> <b>display</b> <b>area.</b> This study examined how the association between large pictorial warnings, those covering ≥ 50 % of the front and back of the package, and the prevalence of cigarette smoking varies by educational attainment. Methods: We pooled individual-level tobacco use data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) in 18 countries between 2008 and 2013 and linked them with warning label requirements during the same period from the MPOWER database and reports regarding warnings. The respondents’ self-reported exposure to warnings was examined according to education. Logistic regressions were further employed to analyze education-specific associations between large pictorial warnings and smoking prevalence, and whether such association differed by education was examined using an interaction test. Results: At the time of the survey, eight out of 18 countries had imposed graphic warning labels that covered ≥ 50 % of the package. These warnings were associated with a 10. 0 % (OR = 0. 89; 95 % CI: 0. 81, 0. 97; p ≤ 0. 01) lower cigarette smoking prevalence among adults with less than a secondary education or no formal education, but not among respondents with at least a secondary education. Less educated respondents were also less likely to be exposed to warnings in all 18 countries. The association between strong warnings and lower smoking prevalence among less educated respondents could be greater if their exposure to warnings increases. Conclusions: Prominent pictorial warning labels can potentially reduce health disparities resulting from smoking across different education levels...|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} compliance of waterpipe product {{packaging and}} labelling with the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control’s Article 11. We evaluated samples collected at a trade fair against ten domains: health warning location, size, use of pictorials, use of colour, and packaging information on constituents and emissions. We also evaluated waterpipe accessories (e. g., charcoal) for misleading claims. Ten of 15 tobacco products had health warnings on their <b>principal</b> <b>display</b> <b>areas,</b> covering a median of 22. 4 per cent (interquartile range 19. 4 – 27. 4 per cent) of those areas. Three had pictorial, in-colour health warnings. We judged all packaging information on constituents and emissions to be misleading. Eight of 13 charcoal products displayed environmentally friendly descriptors and/or claims of reduced harm that we judged to be misleading. Increased compliance with waterpipe tobacco regulation is warranted. An improved policy framework for waterpipe tobacco should also consider regulation of accessories such as charcoal products...|$|R
40|$|First paragraph: The United Kingdom (UK) Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015 and Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 require {{cigarettes}} (factory-made {{and rolling}} tobacco) {{to be sold}} in standardised packs with a drab brown colour and pictorial health warnings covering at least 65 % of the <b>principal</b> <b>display</b> <b>areas</b> [1]. Tobacco companies and retailers were given from 20 th May 2016 to 20 th May 2017 {{to comply with the}} legislation. Research from Australia, the first country to introduce standardised packaging, has explored several factors which may mitigate the impact of this measure, including illicit tobacco use [2], pricing [3], and product development [4, 5]. No studies, however, have measured compliance among retailers. Given the value of such research in gauging the effectiveness of retailer-related tobacco policy [6], we examined independent and convenience (small) retailer compliance with standardised packaging legislation in the UK. Small retailers are an important group for investigation as reportedly half of their consumers purchase tobacco and over two-thirds consider tobacco necessary to maintain footfall [7]...|$|R
40|$|Introduction As {{a result}} of the Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations and Tobacco Products Directive, all packs of {{cigarettes}} (factory-made and hand-rolled) in the United Kingdom must be drab brown, display pictorial warnings on the <b>principal</b> <b>display</b> <b>areas,</b> and contain no less than 20 cigarettes or 30 grams of tobacco. The legislation was phased in between May 2016 and May 2017. Our objective was to monitor pack, brand and product changes pre- and post-implementation.   Methods Our surveillance of the cigarette market involved a review of the trade press, a monthly monitor of online supermarkets, and regular visits to stores, from May 2015 to June 2017.   Results Pre-standardised packaging there were changes to the pack graphics (e. g. redesigned packs and limited-editions) and pack structure (e. g. re-sealable inner foil), and the issue of a number of re-usable tins. Post-standardised packaging, changes included newer cigarette pack sizes for some brand variants (e. g. 23 and 24 packs). Changes to the branding pre-standardised packaging included brand extensions, and post-standardised packaging included brand and/or variant name change, often with the inclusion of colour descriptors, and brand migrations. Product changes pre-standardised packaging included the introduction of novel filters (e. g. filters with two flavour-changing capsules, tube filters, firmer filters, and filters with granular additives). There was non-compliance with the legislation, with slim packs, which are not permitted, on sale after standardised packaging was implemented.   Conclusions Our findings highlight the need to monitor developments in markets introducing standardised packaging, and have policy implications for countries considering this measure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Visualization is {{very useful}} for various {{large-scale}} computing fields. One {{of the authors}} has reported a hierarchical data visualization technique, and applied it to various large-scale computing data including large-scale Web sites, but also for data mining results, Web search queries, network intrusion detection results, and distributed processes. This paper presents the new hierarchical data visualization technique, HeiankyoView, which can be also applied to various large-scale computing fields. It places data items of input data while it packs the items {{as many as possible}} in small <b>display</b> <b>areas,</b> and aligns the items along X-axis and Y-axis of the <b>display</b> <b>area.</b> The technique represents nodes of hierarchical data as a set of rectangles, which are parallel to X-axis and Y-axis. Here the technique orthogonally divides the <b>display</b> <b>area</b> by extension lines of edges of previously placed rectangles. By referring the grid-like subspaces of the <b>display</b> <b>area,</b> the technique quickly finds the adequate positions to place remaining rectangles. 1...|$|R
