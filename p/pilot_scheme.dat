5|$|Figures from WRAP {{revealed}} {{the most efficient}} method of collecting food waste to be separate collections, followed by mixed green and food waste on a weekly basis. A mixed fortnightly collection was shown {{to be the worst}} performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable waste. A widespread <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme</b> for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E

In 2007, turnout at the polling stations ranged from 26% in Orton Longueville to 55% in Central ward. At the previous election, voters were required to provide a signature before being issued with a ballot paper. This <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme</b> trialled new procedures which are now included in the Electoral Administration Act 2006.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} seven Chinese <b>pilot</b> carbon <b>schemes</b> {{that will be}} {{implemented}} in late 2013, and relates the most critical and relevant lessons from the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) to the Chinese circumstances. This paper reviews the key policy designs of the <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes,</b> and discusses the unique Chinese policies and market environment that would differentiate the Chinese schemes from the EU ETS. In terms of expected emission abatement, this paper estimates that, compared to business as usual (BAU) level, Guangdong, Hubei and Shanghai are expected to mitigate the highest amount of CO 2 emissions. In terms of carbon price, this paper expects the schemes of Guangdong and Hubei to have the highest carbon price while the price in Beijing and Tianjin will be the lowest. By reviewing EU’s experience, this paper proposes recommendations on 1) avoiding allowances over-­‐supply and windfall profits, 2) maintaining market stability, 3) bottom-­‐level allocation, 4) use of allowance reserve and provision, and 5) sector selection and allocation. The paper finds that the unique designs of the Chinese <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes</b> indicate a lower likelihood of price crash than EU ETS. With regard to these special designs, {{and the size of}} the Chinese <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes,</b> the paper concludes that the Chinese <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes</b> have a significant global implication in terms of promoting a global-­‐wide ETS, reforming existing ETS and setting examples for developing countries...|$|R

50|$|The general {{response}} to the DNH’s proposals was that the recording of all archaeological finds was important and that a consistent voluntary scheme to record finds should be established. As a result, in December 1996, the DNH announced that funding would be provided for two years for a programme of six <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes,</b> starting in September 1997. The main aim of the <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes</b> was “to enable an accurate estimate {{to be made of}} the resources that would be needed to extend the scheme across the whole of England” (DNH 1997). The essential aim was to advance knowledge of history and archaeology.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} joint {{undertaking}} by the Federal Government and the Länder to improve {{the structure of the}} regional exonomies, the promotion of telematics <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes</b> in Schleswig-Holstein, Bremen, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia was started in 1988. The aim of the parallel scientific research by ISI was to examine the effectiveness of the promotion, ensure the success of the <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes,</b> correct unsuccessful developments and give recommendations for the realization of telematics <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes.</b> The concern was to determine how telematics schemes should best be organized in order to achive their aims, and to determine what contributionpublic promotion can make t to this. In Schleswig-Holstein, Bremen, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia the joint federal and Länder promotion has given rise to innovations in the form of new services tailored to the regional environment. These are "mailbox" applications in local authorities, logistics services in seaport traffic, the use of T emex in environmental protection, and consulting on the use of telematics in the office. The new services are being offered already in Schleswig-Holstein, Bremen, Norden, Nordhorn and Duisburg; in Gelsenkirchen and Dortmund they are stil being developed. A general assessment {{of the success of the}} <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes</b> can only be made some years later, especially as two schemes are still in the planning phase.

30|$|Another {{challenge}} in a MIMO-OFDM system {{is how to}} distribute pilots in the time, frequency and spatial domains. Barhumi et al. [9] and Minn and Al-Dhahir [10] proposes optimal <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes</b> but only for time-invariant channels or systems for which the time variation of the channel within one OFDM symbol can be neglected. Except for [7, 11], much less {{attention has been paid}} to systems dealing with channels varying faster. In this paper, we will use the channel identifiability criterion as a guideline to design <b>pilot</b> <b>schemes.</b> It is noteworthy that the proposed pilot structures can be independent of the oversampling factor of the (O)CE-BEM, which endows the receiver with the freedom to choose the most suitable oversampling factor.|$|R

25|$|The Brighton Main Line railway route {{south from}} Croydon links {{the town to}} Sussex, Surrey, and Kent and to central London to the north: {{providing}} direct services to Hastings, Southampton, Brighton, Portsmouth, Gatwick Airport, Bedford and Luton. The main station for all these services is East Croydon station in {{the centre of the}} town centre. East Croydon station is the largest and busiest station in Croydon, third busiest in London, excluding Travelcard Zone 1. The station at West Croydon serves all trains travelling west except the fastest. There are also more regional stations scattered around the borough. Passenger rail services through Croydon are provided by Southern and Thameslink. A <b>pilot</b> <b>scheme</b> launched by the Strategic Rail Authority, Transport for London and three train operators is designed to encourage more passengers to travel off-peak. In full partnership with the South London Boroughs which includes Croydon, SWELTRAC, SELTRANS and the transport users group, the scheme promotes the advantages of off-peak travel following improvements to safety, travel connections and upgrading of station facilities. The Thameslink Programme (formerly known as Thameslink 2000), is a £3.5billion major project to expand the Thameslink network from 51 to 172 railway stations spreading northwards to Bedford, Peterborough, Cambridge and King's Lynn and southwards to Guildford, Eastbourne, Horsham, Hove to Littlehampton, East Grinstead, Ashford and Dartford. The project includes the lengthening of platforms, station remodelling, new railway infrastructure (e.g. viaduct) and additional rolling stock. When implemented, Thameslink services would call at other stations in the borough including Purley and Norwood Junction.|$|E
