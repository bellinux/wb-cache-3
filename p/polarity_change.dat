40|$|We propose {{and analyze}} several {{strategies}} for performing timestamping of an MPEG 2 Transport Stream transmitted over a packet-switched network using the PCR-unaware encapsulation scheme, and analyze {{their effect on}} the quality of the recovered clock at the MPEG- 2 Systems decoder. When the timestamping scheme is based on a timer with a fixed period, the PCR values in the packet stream may switch polarity deterministically, at a frequency determined by the timer period and the transport rate of the MPEG signal. This, in turn, can degrade the quality of the recovered clock at the receiver beyond acceptable limits. We consider three timestamping schemes for solving this problem: (i) selecting the deterministic timer period to avoid the phase difference in PCR values altogether, (ii) fine- tuning the deterministic timer period to maximize the frequency of PCR <b>polarity</b> <b>changes,</b> and (iii) selecting the timer period randomly to eliminate the deterministic PCR <b>polarity</b> <b>changes.</b> For the case of deterministic timer period, we derive the frequency of the PCR <b>polarity</b> <b>changes</b> as a function of the timer period and the transport rate, and use it to find ranges of the timer period for acceptable quality of the recovered clock. We also analyze a random timestamping procedure based on a random telegraph process and obtain lower bounds on the rate of PCR <b>polarity</b> <b>changes</b> such that the recovered clock does not violate the PAL/NTSC clock specifications. The analytical results are verified by simulations with both synthetic and actual MPEG- 2 Transport Streams sent to an MPEG- 2 Systems decoder...|$|R

To have a comprehen-sive understanding of how solvent polarity affects ESI-MS measurements, we systematically investigated the <b>polarity</b> <b>change</b> in the ESI plume formed from an ethanol solution using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy. Two solvatochromic dyes (i. e., dyes whose fluorescence emission is sensitive to solvent polarity), Nile red and DCM (4 -dicyanomethylene- 2 -methyl- 6 -p-dimethylaminostyryl- 4 H-pyran), were used as probes. The peak emission wave-lengths of these two dyes exhibited significant red shifts (8 – 12 nm) when the measuring spot was moved away from the spray tip and in radial direction in the plume, indicating a dramatic <b>polarity</b> <b>change</b> during shrinking of the droplets. The emission intensities were also measured with a polarity-insensitive dye as a reference. The results are consistent with the peak wavelength measurements. Two key mechanisms responsible for the change of solvent polarity in the plume were considered, water entrainment from the surrounding air and solvent evaporation.

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{isothermal}} and the non-isothermal current {{released from}} a polarized/charged dielectric material is analyzed. The measured current {{is determined by the}} polarization charge and space charge and the main concern is dedicated to the situation when the process of the space charge de-trapping represents the main source of the measured current. The experimental measurements have been carried out on polyethylene terephthalate but the reported results are typical for a large class of materials. Isothermal discharging current and voltage, isothermal final discharging current experiments, for samples polarized/charged at constant current or constant voltage, have been carried out. At the same time thermally stimulated discharge current and thermally stimulated space charge current for samples charged/polarized at constant currents or constant fields, in fore or high vacuum, and on partially or well-conditioned specimens have been carried out. The currents determined by the homocharge and the heterocharge have the same polarity, no matter how high the polarization field was. For a partially conditioned sample the shape and the polarity of the thermally stimulated discharge current peaks are strongly dependent about the conditioning process. No current <b>polarity</b> <b>change</b> was observed for a well-conditioned sample.

40|$|In cell {{cultures}} monolayered cell {{growth is}} controlled by contact inhibition which again {{is controlled by}} the cell polarity system by always being positioned in accord with the cytoskeleton axis. Presently, cycling endopolyploid cells (tetraploidy) were shown to undergo perpendicular divisions relative to the cytoskeleton axis which disrupted to some degree contact inhibition in the near-senescent phase of human primary cells. These experiments included genome damage-induced endopolyploidization (TAS-treated) to simulate as a model system the state of in vivo accelerated cell senescence (ACS) which is induced by therapy-associated genomic damage. From ACS delayed tumor re-growth (re-lapse) occurs from “robust” cell propagation, but mechanisms for such cell escape from senescence are unknown. For TAS-treated a karyoplast bud-off process with change to limited mitotic activity occurred in young senescent cultures. In old, deep senescent (5 - 8 weeks) cultures, unexpectedly escape cell-growth showed three dimensional (3 -D) tumor-like spheres from growths of morphologically different cells as compared to the fibroblastic phenotype.

In the Arabidopsis root epidermis, cell polarity is revealed by basal, root tip-oriented, hair outgrowth from hair-forming cells (trichoblasts) [2].

Analysis of the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) inclination record indicates a normal magnetic polarity for the uppermost 34 m of the sequence and a distinctive abrupt <b>polarity</b> <b>change</b> {{at the bottom of the}} core. This <b>polarity</b> <b>change,</b> which spans a 27 cm thick stratigraphic interval, represents a detailed record of the Matuyama–Brunhes (M–B) transition and it is preceded by a sharp oscillation in paleomagnetic directions that may correlate to the M–B precursor event. Paleomagnetic measurements enable reconstruction of geomagnetic relative paleointensity (RPI) variations, and a highresolution age model was established by correlating the CADO RPI curve to the available global reference RPI stack, indicating that the studied sequence reaches back to ca. 800 ka with an average sedimentation rate of 4. 4 cm/ka. Orbital periodicities (100 ka and 41 ka) were found in the ChRM inclination record, and a significant coherence of ChRM inclination and RPI record around 100 ka suggests that long-term geomagnetic secular variation in inclination is controlled by changes in the relative strength of the geocentric axial dipole and persistent non-dipole components. Moreover, even if the relatively homogeneous rock magnetic parameters and lithofacies throughout the recovered sequence indicates a substantial stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet during the middle and late Pleistocene, influence of the 100 ka and 41 ka orbital periodicities has been detected in some rock magnetic parameters, indicating subtle variations in the concentration and grain-size of the magnetic minerals linked to orbital forcing of the global climate...|$|E
40|$|Cueva Victoria has {{provided}} remains {{of more than}} 90 species of fossil vertebrates, including a hominin phalanx, and the only specimens of the African cercopithecid Theropithecus oswaldi in Europe. To constrain {{the age of the}} vertebrate remains we used paleomagnetism, vertebrate biostratigraphy and Th- 230 /U dating. Normal polarity was identified in the non-fossiliferous lowest and highest stratigraphic units (red clay and capping flowstones) while reverse polarity was found in the intermediate strati graphic unit (fossiliferous breccia). A lower <b>polarity</b> <b>change</b> occurred during the deposition of the decalcification clay, when the cave was closed and karstification was active. A second <b>polarity</b> <b>change</b> occurred during the capping flowstone formation, when the upper galleries were filled with breccia. The mammal association indicates a post-Jaramillo age, which allows us to correlate this upper reversal with the Brunhes-Matuyama boundary (0. 78 Ma). Consequently, the lower reversal (N-R) is interpreted {{as the end of the}} Jaramillo magnetochron (0. 99 Ma). These ages bracket the age of the fossiliferous breccia between 0. 99 and 0. 78 Ma, suggesting that the capping flowstone was formed during the wet Marine Isotopic Stage 19, which includes the Brunhes-Matuyama boundary. Fossil remains of Theropithecus have been only found in situ similar to 1 m below the B/M boundary, which allows us to place the arrival of Theropithecus to Cueva Victoria at similar to 0. 9 - 0. 85 Ma. The fauna of Cueva Victoria lived during a period of important climatic change, known as the Early-Middle Pleistocene Climatic Transition. The occurrence of the oldest European Acheulean tools at the contemporaneous nearby site of Cueva Negra suggest an African dispersal into SE Iberia through the Strait of Gibraltar during MIS 22, when sea-level was 100 m below its present position, allowing the passage into Europe of, at least, Theropithecus and Homo bearing Acheulean technology.
