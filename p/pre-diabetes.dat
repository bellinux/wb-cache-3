50|$|Fetuin-A was {{originally}} discovered {{to be an}} inhibitor of vascular calcification in early 1990s. Since then the biologic roles attributed to fetuin-A have increased exponentially. Fetuin-A has been demonstrated {{to play an important}} role in free fatty acid induced insulin resistance in the liver. Increased fetuin-A in patients with <b>pre-diabetes</b> is associated with increased progression to diabetes and decreased reversal to normoglycemia. Hence fetuin-A is a predictor of adverse glycemic outcomes in <b>pre-diabetes.</b> Increased fetuin-A had been also been linked to increased occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular events, believed to be due to its proinflammatory effects. Fetuin-A in contrast has also been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties. It is a negative acute-phase reactant in sepsis and endotoxemia, promotes wound healing, and is neuroprotective in Alzheimer's disease. Decreased fetuin-A is a predictor of increased disease activity in obstructive lung disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Differential effects on different toll like receptors in different tissues and organ systems may explain these pradoxical effects in different systems.|$|E

50|$|Longitudinal {{analysis}} can explore associations {{in a way}} that cross-sectional studies cannot. EarlyBird established early on that insulin resistance is no longer associated with birth weight (a surrogate for gestational nutrition) - rather, the driver in contemporary children is weight gained during the early years. It showed how the large majority of excess weight gained by a child before puberty was gained before 5y. Obesity is not the result of inactivity in children, but the cause, and physical activity imposed at one time of day is compensated for - with remarkable precision - at another, supporting the concept of the ‘activitystat’, and questioning the value of imposing physical activity as a means of weight reduction in childhood. It went on to establish that today’s obese girls are largely the daughters of obese mothers (not fathers), and obese boys the sons of obese fathers (not mothers). The offspring of normal weight parents are no heavier than they were a generation ago. Children who have the privilege of sports clubs record no more activity than those who do not and, worryingly, parents are unaware of their children's overweight. Height, like weight, is dependent on nutrition and, while the focus has been on overweight, there is evidence that many of today’s children are overheight, with independent metabolic consequences. Finally, EarlyBird offers unique evidence that the stress of insulin resistance among overweight children erodes their insulin production to the point where over 20% of the cohort showed evidence of <b>pre-diabetes</b> by the age of 16 years (in preparation). This is the most worrying spectre of all to have emerged from the EarlyBird study, because <b>pre-diabetes</b> frequently spells diabetes within a few years.|$|E

50|$|Mechanisms that restore {{satisfactory}} {{blood glucose}} levels after extreme hypoglycemia (below 40 mg/dl) must be quick and effective to prevent extremely serious consequences of insufficient glucose: confusion or unsteadiness and, {{in the extreme}} (below 15 mg/dl) loss of consciousness and seizures. Without discounting the potentially quite serious conditions and risks due to or oftentimes accompanying hyperglycemia, especially in the long-term (diabetes or <b>pre-diabetes,</b> obesity or overweight, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, etc.), it is still generally more dangerous to have too little glucose- especially if levels are very low- in the blood than too much, at least temporarily, because glucose is so important for metabolism and nutrition and the proper functioning of the body's organs. This is especially the case for those organs that are metabolically active or that require a constant, regulated supply of blood sugar (the liver and brain are examples). In healthy individuals, blood glucose-regulating mechanisms are generally quite effective, and symptomatic hypoglycemia is generally found only in diabetics using insulin or other pharmacological treatment, and in starvation or severe malnutrition or malabsorption (of various causes), and conditions such as anorexia. Hypoglycemic episodes can vary greatly between persons {{and from time to}} time, both in severity and swiftness of onset. For severe cases, prompt medical assistance is essential, as damage to brain and other tissues and even death will result from sufficiently low blood-glucose levels.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this ethnographic {{study was to explore}} the {{understanding}} of <b>pre-diabetes</b> and the possibility of developing diabetes among Mexican Americans at the U. S. -Mexico border. This study also explored how Mexican Americans adjust to living with <b>pre-diabetes.</b> While extensive research has been conducted regarding <b>pre-diabetes,</b> diabetes, and how individuals perceive their susceptibility to these illnesses, few studies have examined how Mexican Americans understand <b>pre-diabetes</b> and the possibility of developing diabetes. The increased prevalence of diabetes among this population, the divergent understandings of risk held by diverse cultural groups, and the large presence of Mexican Americans in the U. S. -Mexico border region prompted this study. There are gaps in the literature about how Mexican Americans understand <b>pre-diabetes</b> and their possibility of developing diabetes. Current literature focuses on studies of causality, folk beliefs, symptoms, and treatments. Current studies do not provide a framework in which healthcare professionals can identify how Mexican Americans understand <b>pre-diabetes</b> and the possibility for developing diabetes or how to incorporate these lay understandings into their practice, research, and education. An ethnographic study, guided by Freire's framework (2000) was conducted to provide insight into the understanding of <b>pre-diabetes</b> and the possibility of developing diabetes among Mexican Americans living at the U. S. -Mexico border. An overarching theme Living with <b>Pre-diabetes</b> emerged. This theme emerged from two major themes: 1) Awareness; and 2) Adjusting to Living with <b>Pre-diabetes.</b> This study revealed that Mexican Americans may not understand <b>pre-diabetes</b> or their possibility of developing diabetes until told of having <b>pre-diabetes</b> by a healthcare provider. Becoming aware of <b>pre-diabetes</b> may not necessarily imply understanding of what <b>pre-diabetes</b> is. The study also revealed that an awareness of having <b>pre-diabetes</b> may lead to changes in lifestyle, but may not always make these changes sustainable. The use of Freire's framework may prove useful when addressing the needs of Mexican Americans with <b>pre-diabetes...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Pre-diabetes</b> is a {{state where}} glucose level higher than normal, but not satisfy the {{criteria}} for diabetes. This condition is very critical, so that if subject don’t do lifestyle modification and pharmacology therapy, they could fall to diabetes. This research objective is to describe the prevalence and predictors of <b>pre-diabetes</b> in Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by Metabolic Endocrinology Division, Department of Internal Medicine FMUI/RSCM and Jakarta Diabetes and Lipid Center using secondary data from National Health Survey 2007. Total  respondents are 24417 subjects from 33 provinces in Indonesia. We analyze characteristics, correlation, predictors, and  attributable risks for some predictors of <b>pre-diabetes</b> and diabetes. Results: Prevalence of <b>pre-diabetes</b> (based on impaired glucose tolerance data) in Indonesia is 10 %. Predictors of <b>pre-diabetes</b> are male, old-age, high socio-economic status, low education level, hypertension, obesity, central obesity, and smoking. Priority for <b>pre-diabetes</b> and diabetes prevention in Indonesia directed to decrease blood pressure (Attributable Risk/AR  56. 5 %), reduce waist circumference (AR 47. 3 %), and stop smoking (AR 44. 4 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE — New {{clinical}} practice recommendations include A 1 C {{as an alternative}} to fasting glucose as a diagnostic test for identifying <b>pre-diabetes.</b> The impact of these new recommendations on the diagnosis of <b>pre-diabetes</b> is unknown. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 – 2006 (n � 7, 029) were analyzed to determine the percentage and number of U. S. adults without diabetes classified as having <b>pre-diabetes</b> by the elevated A 1 C (5. 7 – 6. 4 %) and by the impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (fasting glucose 100 – 125 mg/dl) criterion separately. Test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) using IFG as the reference standard were calculated. RESULTS — The prevalence of <b>pre-diabetes</b> among U. S. adults was 12. 6 % by the A 1 C criterion and 28. 2 % by the fasting glucose criterion. Only 7. 7 % of U. S. adults, reflecting 61 and 27 % of those with <b>pre-diabetes</b> by A 1 C and fasting glucose, respectively, had <b>pre-diabetes</b> according to both definitions. A 1 C used alone would reclassify 37. 6 million Americans with IFG to not having <b>pre-diabetes</b> and 8. 9 million without IFG to having <b>pre-diabetes</b> (46. 5 million reclassified).

40|$|Objective: The aims of {{the study}} were to {{investigate}} the prevalence of <b>pre-diabetes</b> and explore its associated risk factors in rural areas of Ningbo, China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 4583 adult residents in rural areas of Ningbo, China between March and May 2013. The survey used a multi-stage, stratified, cluster sampling method. Data collected included demographics and medical history, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, blood lipid, and plasma glucose. After at least 10 h of overnight fasting, participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to identify <b>pre-diabetes.</b> Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the associated risk factors for <b>pre-diabetes,</b> and to estimate the effect of interaction between the factors. Results: There were 1307 survey participants having <b>pre-diabetes</b> (28. 52 %) and the age-standardized prevalence was 30. 53 %. Multivariate logistic regression results showed that overweight/obesity, hypertension, and higher triglycerides were the risk factors for developing <b>pre-diabetes.</b> There were positive interactions between overweight/obesity and triglycerides, and also between hypertension and triglycerides on the multiplicative scale, suggesting that they synergistically influenced the development of <b>pre-diabetes.</b> Conclusions: The rural areas in Ningbo had a high prevalence of <b>pre-diabetes.</b> Overweight and obesity, hypertension, and elevated triglycerides were the major risk factors.

40|$|ObjectivesPre-diabetes is an {{important}} indicator of future diabetes burden and many countries are reporting prevalence estimates of <b>pre-diabetes.</b> To date in Ireland, estimates of the prevalence of <b>pre-diabetes</b> were unavailable. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of <b>pre-diabetes</b> in a nationally representative sample of Irish adults and to explore determinants of <b>pre-diabetes.</b> MethodsThe Survey of Lifestyle Attitudes and Nutrition 2007 was a cross-sectional survey on health and lifestyle in a nationally representative sample of Irish adults. Analysis was performed on a subsample of 1132 participants 45 years who provided blood samples. Determination of <b>pre-diabetes</b> was based on American Diabetes Association HbA(1 c) cut points of 39 - 46 mmol/mol (5. 7 - 6. 4 %). To explore determinants, we modelled <b>pre-diabetes</b> prevalence {{as a function of}} a set of health system and socio-demographic variables using logistic regression. ResultsThe overall weighted prevalence estimate of <b>pre-diabetes</b> in participants 45 years was 19. 8 % (95 %CI 16. 4 - 23. 9). There {{was no significant difference between}} age or gender-specific prevalence rates. Obesity was significantly associated with <b>pre-diabetes</b> on univariate and multivariate analysis. Population attributable fraction estimates for excess BMI, physical inactivity and poor diet as causes of <b>pre-diabetes</b> were 31. 3 % (95 %CI - 3. 9 to 54. 5), 10. 0 % (95 %CI - 2. 7 to 21. 3) and 6. 1 % (95 %CI - 4. 9 to 15. 9), respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the association between}} race, region and <b>pre-diabetes.</b> Method: The study used 2003 – 2007 United States baseline data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study for this cross-sectional analysis. Participants {{in this study were}} 45 years or older at recruitment. Logistic regression was used to assess whether race and region are associated with <b>pre-diabetes</b> independent of demographics, socioeconomic factors and risk factors. Results: Twenty-four percent of the study participants (n = 19, 889) had <b>pre-diabetes.</b> The odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) for having <b>pre-diabetes</b> was 1. 28 (1. 19 – 1. 36) for blacks relative to whites and 1. 18 (1. 10 – 1. 26) for people living in the Stroke Belt region relative to the other parts of the United States. The odds of having <b>pre-diabetes</b> for Stroke Belt participants changed minimally after additional adjustment for race (OR = 1. 20; 1. 13 – 1. 28), age and sex (OR = 1. 24; 1. 16 – 1. 32), socioeconomic status (OR = 1. 22; 1. 15 – 1. 31) and risk factors (OR = 1. 26; 1. 17 – 1. 35). In the adjusted model, being black was independently associated with <b>pre-diabetes</b> (OR = 1. 19; 1. 10 – 1. 28).

40|$|<b>Pre-diabetes</b> {{represents}} {{an elevation of}} plasma glucose above the normal range but below that of clinical diabetes. <b>Pre-diabetes</b> can be identified as either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The latter is detected by oral glucose tolerance testing. Both IFG and IGT are risk factors for type 2 diabetes, and risk is even greater when IFG and IGT occur together. <b>Pre-diabetes</b> commonly associates with the metabolic syndrome. Both in turn are closely associated with obesity. The mechanisms whereby obesity predisposes to <b>pre-diabetes</b> and metabolic syndrome are incompletely understood but likely have a common metabolic soil. Insulin resistance is a common factor; systemic inflammation engendered by obesity may be another. <b>Pre-diabetes</b> has only a minor impact on microvascular disease; glucose-lowering drugs can delay conversion to diabetes, but whether {{in the long run}} the drug approach will delay development of microvascular disease is in dispute. To date, the drug approach to prevention of microvascular disease starting with <b>pre-diabetes</b> has not been evaluated. <b>Pre-diabetes</b> carries some predictive power for macrovascular disease, but most of this association appears to be mediated through the metabolic syndrome. The preferred clinical approach to cardiovascular prevention is to treat all the metabolic risk factors. For both <b>pre-diabetes</b> and metabolic syndrome, the desirable approach is lifestyle intervention, especially weight reduction and physical activity.
