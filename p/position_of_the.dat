5|$|A few villagers from Munneswaram village filed {{a case in}} the Chilaw {{district}} {{courts to}} prevent the land grab of temple properties by outsiders. The case resulted in the British colonial government accepting temple properties as belonging to a newly created temple trust.

His family maintains the hereditary priestly <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Siva temple, and controls all temple properties. A Tamil family from Munneswaram village controls the priestly <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kali temple. The Siva temple was renovated in 1875 by the personal efforts of Cumaraswamy Kurukal. Improvements were effected again in 1919 and 1963 through public support from Tamil Hindus from Colombo and Jaffna. The temple has become very popular amongst the Sinhalese and they make up over 78% of the pilgrims to both the Siva and Kali temples.|$|E

Fourier maps with coefficients (FN [...] F'P) × exp (i[alpha]'P) and (mFN [...] nF'P) exp (i[alpha]'P), where FN is the observed structure factor and F'P and [alpha]'P are the magnitude and <b>the</b> phase angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calculated structure factor corresponding to the inaccurate atomic positions, are often used to correct <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P atoms and to determine those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Q unknown atoms. A general theoretical approach is presented to elucidate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> errors in <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> known atoms on <b>the</b> corrected <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> known atoms and <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unknown atoms derived from such maps. The theory also leads to <b>the</b> optimal choice <b>of</b> parameters used in the different syntheses.

Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the tariff question.|$|E
