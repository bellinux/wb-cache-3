40|$|AbstractOne {{of crucial}} {{disadvantages}} of key predistribution schemes for ad hoc networks {{is that if}} devices A and B use a shared key K to determine their session keys, then any adversarial device that holds K can impersonate A against B (or vice versa). Also, the adversary holding such a device can eavesdrop on communication between A and B for the lifetime of the system. We develop a dynamic scheme where the devices are preloaded with <b>permanent</b> <b>keys</b> according to a predistribution scheme, but these keys are not used directly for setting up session keys. For this purpose devices use a pool of temporal keys, which periodically are selected at random by a system provider. The temporal keys are broadcast by the system provider in an encrypted form (e. g. using the GSM network or local broadcasting services). For the transmission, the temporal keys are encrypted with <b>permanent</b> <b>keys,</b> each temporal key occurring m times encrypted with m different <b>permanent</b> <b>keys.</b> (Parameter m is a small constant.) Encrypting the same temporal <b>key</b> with different <b>permanent</b> <b>keys</b> has the effect that with a high probability two devices share many more temporal <b>keys</b> than the <b>permanent</b> <b>keys</b> from the main pool of keys. Also, the shared temporal keys come not only from ciphertexts encrypted with shared <b>permanent</b> <b>keys</b> but predominantly from ciphertexts encrypted with the <b>permanent</b> <b>keys</b> that are not shared by the devices. After each re-distribution different pairs of <b>permanent</b> <b>keys</b> provide such shared temporal keys. This feature is the key property of our design. It makes it possible not only to protect communication against an adversary that has collected a large fraction of keys from the main pool of keys, but also enables using key predistribution for authentication {{in the presence of}} such an adversary. Finally, we present a scheme for renewing the <b>permanent</b> <b>keys</b> in a way that an adversary loses the knowledge of <b>permanent</b> <b>keys</b> except for the keys that it learns via the legitimate devices that he holds. The scheme is based on projective plane techniques...|$|R

40|$|DistribNet is {{a global}} {{peer-to-peer}} Internet file system in which anyone can tap into or add content to. This paper gives an overview of DistribNet. 1 Overview DistribNet is a peer-to-peer file system in which anyone can access or add content to. A key feature of DistribNet {{is that it does}} not require access to a central server in order to contribute content. A user simply adds a file to the network and it will be available for others to download. Furthermore once I file is uploaded to DistribNet it will always be available unless the file is determined to be completely worthless. Thus a DistribNet file can be cited with confidence that anyone wishing to access the document will be able to download it, which is very different from the situation of citing a document on the WWW. 2 DistribNet Architecture DistribNet will have several distinct types of keys. The behavior of the key depends on several parameters: 1 Routed or non-Routed Routed data will essentially be stored based on a distributed hashing algorithm so it can always be found. Non-routed data will be stored where it will be the most beneficial performance and availability wise. Routed data will typically be small (under 1 k) and will often point to non-routed data. Map or Data Data in DistribNet will either be indexed based on there identification or there content. Data index via there identification are Map keys while data indexed on there content are Data keys. Map keys are generally small and are primarily used to point to other data. Since they are small they will always be routed. Map keys can also be updated. Data keys, on the other hand can be of arbitrary size and are not routed. Since data keys are indexed based on the actual content they can not be updated. Permanent or Cached Data in DistribNet is stored where it will do the most beneficial both performance and availability wise. Depending on the location of the data it can either be considered a <b>Permanent</b> <b>key</b> or a Cached key. Cached keys are freely deleted when space is needed while <b>permanent</b> <b>keys</b> are only deleted if the data is also available somewhere else on the network. A cached key can become a <b>permanent</b> <b>key</b> if necessary to insure that data does not disappear from the network...|$|R

Understanding natural variation of lateral septal anatomy and function, as well as its genetic modulation, may provide important insights into individual differences in these evolutionarily important functions. Here we address these issues by using efficient and unbiased stereological probes to estimate the volume of the lateral septum in the BXD line of recombinant inbred mice. Lateral septum volume is a highly variable trait, with a 2. 5 -fold difference among animals. We find that this trait covaries with a number of behavioral and physiological phenotypes, many of which have already been associated with behaviors modulated by the lateral septum, such as spatial learning, anxiety, and reward-seeking. Heritability of lateral septal volume is moderate (h 2 = 0. 52), and much of the heritable variation is caused by a locus on the distal portion of chromosome (Chr) 1. Composite interval analysis identified a secondary interval on Chr 2 that works additively with the Chr 1 locus to increase lateral septum volume.

While neuronal dysfunction and abnormalities in neurotransmitter systems within the medulla oblongata have been implicated, the specific pathways associated with autonomic and cardiorespiratory failure are unknown. The neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its tachykinin neurokinin- 1 receptor (NK 1 R) {{have been shown to}} play an integral role in the modulation of homeostatic function in the medulla, including regulation of respiratory rhythm generation, integration of cardiovascular control, and modulation of the baroreceptor reflex and mediation of the chemoreceptor reflex in response to hypoxia. Abnormalities in SP neurotransmission may therefore result in autonomic dysfunction during sleep and contribute to SIDS deaths. [125 I] Bolton Hunter SP autoradiography was used to map the distribution and density of the SP, NK 1 R to 13 specific nuclei intimately related to cardiorespiratory function and autonomic control in the human infant medulla of 55 SIDS and 21 control (non-SIDS) infants. Compared to controls, SIDS cases exhibited a differential, abnormal developmental profile of the SP/NK 1 R system in the medulla. Furthermore the study revealed significantly decreased NK 1 R binding within <b>key</b> medullary <b>nuclei</b> in SIDS cases, principally in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and all three subdivisions of the inferior portion of the olivo-cerebellar complex; the principal inferior olivary complex (PIO), medial accessory olive (MAO) and dorsal accessory olive (DAO). Altered NK 1 R binding was significantly influenced by prematurity and male sex, which may explain the increased risk of SIDS in premature and male infants. Abnormal NK 1 R binding in these medullary nuclei may contribute to the defective interaction of critical medullary mechanisms with cerebellar sites, resulting in an inability of a SIDS infant to illicit appropriate respiratory and motor responses to life threatening challenges during sleep. These observations support the concept that abnormalities in a multi-neurotransmitter network within <b>key</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the medullary homeostatic system may underlie the pathogenesis of a subset of SIDS cases.

This presence of deformation has been explained in S isotopes by a moderate reduction of the N= 28 shell closure together with a proton induced collectivity originating from the near degeneracy of the PI d 3 / 2 and PI s 1 / 2 orbitals [6]. As a consequence, the observed deformation is the result of a subtle interplay between neutron and proton excitations and the importance of the N= 28 shell closure reduction is then difficult to estimate.

The amygdala is a <b>key</b> <b>nucleus</b> involved in the autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to stress. The goal {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that prolonged exposure of the central amygdala (CeA) to stress or the stress hormone cortisol (or corticosterone in rats) induces nociceptive behaviors mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) within the CeA. We selectively knocked down CRF in the CeA via antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASO) in animals with targeted, stereotaxically placed corticosterone (CORT) micropellets or following repeated water avoidance stress (WAS). CRF expression in the CeA was analyzed concurrently with the assessment of visceral hypersensitivity to colonic distension and mechanical somatic withdrawal threshold. The responses were characterized at 7 or 28 days post implantation of the CORT micropellet or following 7 days of WAS. Exposure of the CeA to elevated CORT or WAS increased CRF expression and heightened visceral and somatic sensitivity. Infusion of CRF ASO into the CeA decreased CRF expression and attenuated visceral and somatic hypersensitivity in both models. Our study provides important evidence for a CRF-mediated mechanism specifically within the CeA that regulates stress-induced visceral and somatic nociception.

40|$|The {{external}} {{globus pallidus}} (GPe) is a <b>key</b> <b>nucleus</b> within basal ganglia circuits that {{are thought to}} be involved in action selection. A class of computational models assumes that, during action selection, the basal ganglia compute for all actions available in a given context the probabilities that they should be selected. These models suggest that a network of GPe and subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons computes the normalization term in Bayes' equation. In order to perform such computation, the GPe needs to send feedback to the STN equal to a particular function of the activity of STN neurons. However, the complex form of this function makes it unlikely that individual GPe neurons, or even a single GPe cell type, could compute it. Here, we demonstrate how this function could be computed within a network containing two types of GABAergic GPe projection neuron, so-called 'prototypic' and 'arkypallidal' neurons, that have different response properties in vivo and distinct connections. We compare our model predictions with the experimentally-reported connectivity and input-output functions (f-I curves) of the two populations of GPe neurons. We show that, together, these dichotomous cell types fulfil the requirements necessary to compute the function needed for optimal action selection. We conclude that, by virtue of their distinct response properties and connectivities, a network of arkypallidal and prototypic GPe neurons comprises a neural substrate capable of supporting the computation of the posterior probabilities of actions...|$|R
