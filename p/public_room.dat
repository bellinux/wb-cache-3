Philpotts reports that, by the early 19th century, most debtors spent only months in the prison; on 19 April 1826 it held 105 debtors, 99 {{of whom had been}} there for less than six months and the other six for less than a year.|$|E

25|$|Mexico was a {{crossroads}} of {{trade in the}} colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those natively produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain. It was popular among the upper classes to have a main <b>public</b> <b>room,</b> called a salon de estrado, to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to recline in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men. Folding screens were introduced from Japan, with Mexican-style ones produced called biombos The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One {{example of this is}} a screen with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of Mexico City on the other at the Franz Mayer Museum.|$|E
500|$|As is {{the case}} with many modern {{passenger}} ships, many of the major public rooms on board Queen Mary 2 are on the lowest public decks of the ship, with the passenger cabins stacked above. [...] This is the opposite of the traditional practice on ocean liners, but the design allowed for larger rooms to be contained within the stronger hull, as well as for more passenger cabins to have private balconies higher up on the ship, where they are less affected by large waves. Payne attempted to create a central axis to the two main <b>public</b> <b>room</b> decks (similar in fashion to the Normandie), but a full vista is broken by various public rooms that span the full beam of the ship. The dining rooms were placed further aft, though not directly at the stern, where the fore-and-aft pitching of the ship is most noticeable, and might cause discomfort to dining passengers.|$|E
500|$|The keep {{occupies}} the southern corner of Peveril Castle. Construction probably began in around 1176, instigated by HenryII. Its plan is square, measuring less than , and the parapet is [...] above the keep's base; {{as the ground}} is uneven, {{on the other side}} it rises [...] above ground level. It is smaller than contemporary royal keeps such as those at Dover and Scarborough Castles. Today the exterior is coarse, but originally the facing would have been smooth; the south-east side, where the steep natural slope prevented removal of the facing stone, gives an idea of how it may once have appeared. A projection in the south-east face of the keep housed a garderobe. As was usual with Norman keeps, Peveril's was entered through the first floor and was accessed by a staircase. This entrance level would have been a large <b>public</b> <b>room</b> and the basement used for storage. A narrow staircase in the east corner allowed access to the basement and the wall walk around the top of the keep.|$|E

50|$|<b>Public</b> <b>Rooms</b> are rooms {{which are}} {{available}} to all members. They often depict scenes such as restaurants, cinemas, and dance clubs. Most <b>Public</b> <b>Rooms</b> contain automated robots which shout pre-recorded messages and tips and can give members drinks and food items. <b>Public</b> <b>rooms</b> are designed by Sulake and are not customizable by users. Some rooms used to contain games called Battle Ball, SnowStorm, Wobble Squabble and diving, but these games were removed due to coding issues when they upgraded from Shockwave to Flash.In June 2011, most Official rooms {{were removed from the}} hotel. The popular games BattleBall and SnowStorm were replaced with Freeze and Battle Banzai to coincide with the new Flash client. By buying certain furni, players can build their own rooms for other players to play these games.|$|R
2500|$|Cunard’s {{major concern}} was the {{delivery}} of the mail {{and most of the}} ship’s space was allocated to engines and coal. [...] The Britannia quartette also carried 115 passengers traveling in a single class along with 225 tons of cargo. [...] The dining room was a long deck house aft of the funnel and the only other <b>public</b> <b>room</b> was a small ladies cabin. [...] A special padded deck house had the ship’s cow and overturned boats protected vegetables from the weather. Smoking was limited to the upper deck.|$|E

He was briefly named as an Honorary Canon of Manchester in 1898, but later that year ascended to the Episcopate as the Bishop of Southampton, suffragan to the Bishop of Winchester. In the same year, he was appointed as Provost at St. Nicholas College, Lancing, West Sussex. He {{was one of a}} number of contributors to Lux Mundi. He was granted a Doctorate in Divinity from the University of Cambridge in 1899. In 1900, he was appointed Archdeacon of Winchester. He died of cancer at his home in Petersfield, Hampshire on 19 February 1903. He was described in a history of Selwyn College as a [...] "fine teacher and a reserved, aloof-seeming man of judgement, decision and piety." [...] A <b>public</b> <b>room</b> at Selwyn College was named the [...] "Lyttelton Room" [...] in his honour. He was Lady Margaret's Preacher in each of 1885 and 1897, and delivered the Hulsean Lectures in 1891.|$|E
2500|$|Solaris deck {{consisted}} {{almost entirely}} of public spaces. The main dining room was located just aft of the ship's galley. The much smaller Bar Grill extended aft off the starboard side of the dining area. Amidships, the purser's office and ship's reception area were located in the primary entrance area of Stella Solaris. The Solaris Lounge and Piano Bar were located aft of the entrance hall, both used for various forms of entertainment. Golden deck was the lowest deck on the superstructure and was used for passenger accommodations. The ship's Beauty Parlor and hospital were directly aft of the cabins in the bow section, which contained the forecastle. Amidships were 16 [...] "Deluxe Cabins". The aft of Golden Deck had the ship's gym and spa area, and the poop deck and fantail. Ruby deck, the highest deck in the ship's hull, also had passenger cabins and 16 Deluxe Cabins below those on Golden Deck. Emerald deck had further cabins and the main entrance area of the Stella Solaris. The entrance area had recessed circular lighting inspired by 1950s Italian ocean liners. Sapphire Deck had the lowest passenger cabins on the ship, divided into two portions. The ship's cinema was located in the back, as was the Discothèque, a <b>public</b> <b>room</b> located underneath the cinema.|$|E

2500|$|It was the pub {{that first}} {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the bar counter being used to serve the beer. Until that time beer establishments used to bring the beer out to the table or benches, as remains the practice in (for example) beer gardens and other drinking establishments in Germany. A bar might be provided for the manager to do paperwork while keeping an eye on his or her customers, but the casks of ale were kept in a separate taproom. When the first pubs were built, the main room was the <b>public</b> <b>room</b> with a large serving bar copied from the gin houses, the idea being to serve the maximum {{number of people in the}} shortest possible time. It became known as the public bar. The other, more private, rooms had no serving bar—they had the beer brought to them from the public bar. There are a number of pubs in the Midlands or the North which still retain this set up but these days the beer is fetched by the customer from the taproom or public bar. One of these is The Vine, known locally as The Bull and Bladder, in Brierley Hill near Birmingham, another the Cock at Broom, Bedfordshire a series of small rooms served drinks and food by waiting staff. In the Manchester district the public bar was known as the [...] "vault", other rooms being the lounge and snug as usual elsewhere. By the early 1970s there was a tendency to change to one large drinking room and breweries were eager to invest in interior design and theming.|$|E
