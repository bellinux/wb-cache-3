Palestinian security forces dispersed them and extinguished the flames; and although the tomb itself was not apparently damaged, the women's section was reported to be heavily damaged. Israeli security forces later arrived at the scene. According to a Palestinian official, the Palestinians had attempted to set up barricades in the area to prevent home demolitions by the Israeli Army, but a group of them proceeded to attack the tomb.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a lively}} debate around the shape that a lasting peace {{settlement}} would take (see {{for example the}} One-state solution and Two-state solution). Authors like Cook {{have argued that the}} one-state solution is opposed by Israel because the very nature of Zionism and Jewish nationalism calls for a Jewish majority state, whilst the two-state solution would require the difficult relocation of half a million Jewish settlers living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Palestinian leaders such as Salam Fayyad have rejected calls for a binational state or unilateral declaration of statehood. As of 2010, only a minority of <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Israelis</b> support the one-state solution. Interest in a one-state solution is growing, however, as the two-state approach fails to accomplish a final agreement.|$|E
25|$|Michael Palumbo, {{author of}} The Palestinian Catastrophe: The 1948 Expulsion of a People from Their Homeland, {{reviewing}} {{the first edition}} of Morris's book on Palestinian refugees, criticizes Morris's decision, which Palumbo thinks characteristic of Israeli revisionist historians generally, to rely mainly on official, 'carefully screened' Israeli sources, especially for radio transcripts of Arab broadcasts, while disregarding unofficial Israeli sources such as BBC and CIA transcripts, many of which point to a policy of expulsion. He says Morris failed to supplement his work in Israeli archives, many still classified, by U.N., American, and British archival sources that Palumbo considers objective on such issues as IDF atrocities, as well as oral testimonies of <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Israelis,</b> which can be reliable if their substance can be independently verified. Palumbo says:Morris' regard for documentation is indeed commendable, were it not for his tendency to choose sources which support his views, while avoiding those document collections which contain information inconsistent with his principal arguments. His decision not to use the testimony of Israeli veterans is unfortunate, since some of them have spoken candidly about Israeli atrocities and expulsion of civilians at Deir Yassin, Lydda–Ramle and Jaffa.|$|E

In 2007 Israeli prosecutors determined that of 515 criminal suits relating to violent activity committed by <b>Israeli</b> settlers against <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Israeli</b> security forces, 502 were related to right-wing Jewish settlers in the Occupied Territories.

[...] Later in the debate, he announced his disagreement with a possible constitutional amendment to give naturalized citizens such as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the ability to run for president. On abortion, Gilmore confirmed his support for a woman's right to an abortion in the first eight to twelve weeks of pregnancy, but commented that he operated as a pro-life governor. He affirmed his opposition to stem-cell research. At the end of the debate, Gilmore asserted his attributes as a [...] "consistent Conservative" [...] while surprising many when he stated that he would not pardon Scooter Libby. He established his opposition to a National Identification Card, and highlighted the need to be [...] "vigorous on the war on terror", focus on homeland security, and become energy independent in the next presidency.|$|E

2500|$|Sheikh Jarrah ( [...] , [...] ) is a {{predominantly}} Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem, 2 kilometers {{north of the}} Old City, {{on the road to}} Mount Scopus. It received its name from the 13th-century tomb of Sheikh Jarrah, a physician of Saladin, located within its vicinity. The modern neighborhood was founded in 1865 and gradually became a residential center of Jerusalem's Muslim elite, particularly the al-Husayni family. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, it straddled the no-man's land area between Jordanian-held East Jerusalem and Israeli-held West Jerusalem until the neighborhood was occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. It is currently the center of a number of property disputes between <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Israelis.</b> Most of its present Palestinian population is said to come from refugees expelled from Jerusalem's Talbiya neighbourhood in 1948.|$|E
