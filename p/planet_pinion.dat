40|$|There the carrierless ZK {{planetary}} gears with coaxial arrangement of central wheeles and with approximate internal engagement of <b>planet</b> <b>pinion</b> {{have been studied}} in view to improvement of mass and dimensions of drive, to decrease of its cost, to rise of workability. The hew schemes of carrierless {{planetary gears}} have been developed, the geometrical theory of internal plane approximate engagement has been created, the dependences to analyse the wheel teeth for rigidity, strength have been obtained; the dependences of non-uniformity of distribution of load and stresses on the gear indicators have been studied. The results of study have been introduced. Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} control system consists of a valve arrangement and an engine driven pump. The automatic transmission contains a planetary gear set consisting of two sun gears, two sets of three <b>planet</b> <b>pinions</b> contained within a planetary carrier and ring gear. Various speed ratios are obtained by holding or clutching various combinations of elements of the planetary train. This is performed by two bands, two multi-disc clutches and a one-way clutch.|$|R
40|$|Second stage <b>planet</b> <b>pinions</b> of {{main gear}} box (MGB) {{belonging}} to a helicopter that met with an accident {{were sent to the}} laboratory for analysis. Out of the nine pinions, four were found fractured into pieces, one collapsed and the remaining four had damages in the form of breakage and chewing of teeth. Fractographic examination revealed fatigue cracks in three pinions. Fatigue cracks were found to have originated at the tooth root radius regions, propagated progressively over about 90 % of the tooth cross section before culminating in overload fracture. Excessive spalling was observed on the flanks of the pinion teeth indicating high contact stresses. The microstructure, hardness and case depth in the pinions were found to conform to specifications. From the analysis, it appears most probable that the pinions have failed due to high operating stresses...|$|R
