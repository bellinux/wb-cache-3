These cards held the permit holder’s name and their permit number and also were needed in order to purchase liquor at the LCBO.When an individual wanted to make a purchase at an LCBO store he or she had to fill in a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> <b>form</b> that included their name, address and permit number as well as the kind and volume of liquor that they wished to purchase.The <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> <b>form</b> would be handed to an LCBO employee along with the individual’s liquor permit and he would “examine the permit and see to what extent the purchaser has been buying liquor. If purchaser has exceeded a reasonable quantity per week, note permit number and address and refer to vendor.”Under the Liquor Control Act the LCBO was to promote temperance through facilitating education and moderation. This meant a store employee could deny a sale to a customer if his intended purchases may be considered too large for one person to reasonably consume.|$|E

50|$|A {{sales order}} is an {{internal}} document of the company, meaning it {{is generated by}} the company itself. A sales order should record the customer's originating <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> which is an external document. Rather than using the customer's <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> document, an internal sales <b>order</b> <b>form</b> allows the internal audit control of completeness to be monitored as a sequential sales order number {{can be used by}} the company for its sales order documents. The customer's PO is the originating document which triggers the creation of the sales order. A sales order, being an internal document, can therefore contain many customer <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> under it. In a manufacturing environment, a sales order can be converted into a work order to show that work is about to begin to manufacture, build or engineer the products the customer wants.|$|R
5000|$|Creating a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is {{typically}} {{the first step}} of the purchase to pay process in an ERP system. <b>Purchase</b> <b>orders</b> may require a SKU code. Within an ERP system, a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> can be created manually, and may require confirmation or changes via editing. Within an ERP system (such as in SAP), manually creating a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> within the system may look something like [...] "Logistics -> Materials Management -> <b>Purchasing</b> -> <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Order</b> -> Create" [...] and providing a Transaction Code. This document type will be chosen from the screen.

40|$|The {{research}} in this paper was done in CV. Rooesman, a small scale shoes and bag manufacturer company located in Yogyakarta Indonesia. Their strategy to response the demand is make-to-order. This company receives many <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> from several countries such as Japan, South Korea, and USA. Each <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is unique for example in term of design, complexity of the production process and raw material needed. Currently CV. Rooesman has difficulty to select which <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> should be accepted. Ideally, all <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> from the customers have to be accepted. However due to the some factors such as limitation of resources that the company have i. e. human resources (number of workers and skill of workers needed) and other factor such as characteristic of the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> the company have to select which <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> should be accepted. It {{happened in the past}} that the company accepted the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> without considering those factors then the order was not be able to deliver on time {{and the quality of the}} products did not meet the expectation of the customer. As a result, the company paid the penalty and the products were rejected by the customer. The {{research in}} this paper therefore tries to model <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> selection problem using Analytic Network Process. There are four clusters considered in the model which are: Characteristic of the <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> (Design of the Product, Quantity Order, Characteristic of the Customer, and Expected Quality), Complexity of the Production Process (Number of Workers Needed, Ability to Make the Prototype, Manufacturing Lead Time, Skill of the Worker), Economical Value (Production Cost, Selling Price and Price of Raw Material), and Alternative <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> (<b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> 1, <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> 2, <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> 3) ...|$|R

Yet despite the nature of the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> as a contract, it is common to accompany the acceptance of a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> with a legal document such as the terms & conditions of sale, which establish specific or additional legal conditions of the contract.|$|R

50|$|For example, {{consider}} a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> that moves through various departments for authorization and eventual <b>purchase.</b> The <b>order</b> may be moved from department to department for approval automatically.
