The court explained that, [...] "here, a ReDigi user owns the <b>phonorecord</b> that was created when she purchased and downloaded a song from iTunes to her hard disk. But to sell that song on ReDigi, she must produce a new <b>phonorecord</b> on the ReDigi server. Because it is therefore impossible for the user to sell her “particular” <b>phonorecord</b> on ReDigi, the first-sale statute cannot provide a defense." ...|$|E

50|$|For example: Puff-Daddy {{wants to}} sample the opening riff from “Every Breath You Take” by The Police. He {{contacts}} the copyright holder of the underlying musical work and gets a mechanical license to use {{all or part of}} The Police’s song in his composition. He now has the right to reproduce all or part of “Every Breath You Take” in his new song. He cannot, however, purchase The Police’s Greatest Hits, take the CD (or MP3 from iTunes) into the studio, pull the track off of the <b>phonorecord,</b> and sample the riff into his new song. For Puff Daddy to sample from the <b>phonorecord</b> of The Police’s music, he must get both a mechanical license from the copyright holder of the underlying musical work, and a license from the copyright holder of the <b>phonorecord</b> from which he copies the sample. He is free to hire musicians to reproduce the Police's sound, but he cannot copy from any <b>phonorecord</b> with only a mechanical license.|$|E

50|$|A <b>phonorecord</b> {{is defined}} by the United States Copyright Act of 1976 to be a {{material}} object which embodies sounds (other than those accompanying audio-visual recordings such as movies), for example cassette tapes, CDs or albums.|$|E
50|$|With {{regards to}} {{copyrights}} of musical recordings, {{there are at}} least two distinct copyrights. There is (1) the copyright of the composition, embodied in the sheet music (the “musical work”), which may include separate copyrights for lyrics or composition; and (2) the copyright in the sound recording, embodied as a “phonorecord” (Please note that the law considers ANY tangible medium capable of storing a recording to be a <b>phonorecord.</b> This includes MP3 players, CDs, 8-tracks, vinyl records, cassette tapes, or any future technology.) It is not unusual for one party to own the copyright in the underlying musical work while another, independent, party owns the copyright to the <b>phonorecord.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{explain the}} difference, {{a person or}} group takes a song and makes a {{performance}}. That performance is a sound recording (also called phonogram); the physical media that the sound recording is stored upon is a <b>phonorecord.</b>|$|E

50|$|Section 401 of the Copyright Act {{specifies}} {{the form}} and location of the copyright notice. The form used for “visually perceptible” copies — that is, copies {{that can be seen}} or read, either directly (such as books) or {{with the aid of a}} machine (such as films)— differs from the form used for <b>phonorecords</b> of sound recordings (such as compact discs or cassettes).|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} sale {{doctrine}} to apply, lawful [...] "ownership" [...] of the copy or <b>phonorecord</b> is required. As §109(d) prescribes, first sale doctrine {{does not apply}} if the possession of the copy is [...] "by rental, lease, loan, or otherwise without acquiring ownership of it." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{mechanical}} license (or simply, “mechanical”) is {{a license}} the holder {{of the underlying}} musical work grants to another party to cover, reproduce, or sample specific parts of the original composition. A mechanical license does NOT give a third party the rights to sample from any <b>phonorecord</b> of the original recording.|$|E
50|$|The Record Rental Amendment of 1984, codified in 17 USC §109(b) prohibits {{an owner}} of a <b>phonorecord</b> that embodies a sound {{recording}} or musical work from renting {{it to the public}} for direct or indirect commercial advantage. This exception was designed to prevent music stores from renting records and thereby facilitating home copying.|$|E
5000|$|Copyright law grants a {{copyright}} owner an exclusive right [...] "to distribute copies or <b>phonorecords</b> of the copyrighted {{work to the}} public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending." [...] 17 U.S.C. 106(3). This is called a [...] "distribution right" [...] and differs from the copyright owner's [...] "reproduction right" [...] which involves making copies of the copyrighted works. Rather than the right to copy, the distribution right involves the right to transfer physical copies or <b>phonorecords</b> (i.e., recorded music) of the copyrighted work. For example, the distribution right could be infringed when a retailer acquires and sells to the public unlawfully made audio or video tapes. Although the retailer may not have copied the work in any way and {{may not have known}} that the tapes were made unlawfully, he nevertheless infringes the distribution right by the sale. The distribution right allows the copyright owner to seek redress from any member in the chain of distribution.|$|R
5000|$|The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 {{amended the}} law to make {{the use of a}} {{copyright}} notice optional on copies of works published on and after March 1, 1989 and also revised Section 403. After the adoption of this act, a copyright notice was no longer necessary to secure copyright protection. Including the notice, however, does continue to confer certain benefits, notably in the challenging a defendant's claim of innocent infringement, where the question of proper notice may be a factor in assessing damages in infringement actions. Under the revised Section 403, these benefits are denied to a work consisting predominantly U.S. Government works [...] "unless the notice of copyright appearing on the published copies or <b>phonorecords</b> to which a defendant in the copyright infringement suit had access includes a statement identifying, either affirmatively or negatively, those portions of the copies or <b>phonorecords</b> embodying any work or works protected under this title." ...|$|R
50|$|Copyright {{is a form}} of {{protection}} provided by U.S. law to authors of “original works of authorship.” When a work is published under the authority of the copyright owner, a notice of copyright may be placed on all publicly distributed copies or <b>phonorecords.</b> The use of the notice {{is the responsibility of the}} copyright owner and does not require permission from, or registration with, the Copyright Office.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name of the}} {{copyright}} owner of the sound recording, an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner. If the producer of the sound recording is named on the <b>phonorecord</b> label or container and if no other name appears {{in conjunction with the}} notice, the producer’s name will be considered a part of the notice.|$|E
50|$|The {{copyright}} notice for phonorecords embodying a sound recording {{is different from}} that for other works. Sound recordings are defined as “works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken or other sounds, but not including the sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audio visual work.” Copyright in a sound recording protects the particular series of sounds fixed in the recording against unauthorized reproduction, revision, and distribution. This copyright is distinct from the copyright of the musical, literary, or dramatic work that may be recorded on the <b>phonorecord.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The sound {{recording}} copyright symbol, {{represented by the}} graphic symbol ℗ (a circled capital letter P), is the copyright symbol used to provide notice of copyright in a {{sound recording}} (phonogram) embodied in a <b>phonorecord</b> (LPs, audiotapes, cassette tapes, compact discs, etc.). [...] Present in Europe {{since at least the}} mid-1960s, the use of the symbol in United States copyright law after 1971 was codified at 17 U.S.C. and is specified internationally in the Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms.|$|E
5000|$|Section 602(a)(1) of the Copyright statute {{states that}} [...] "importation into the United States, without the {{authority}} of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or <b>phonorecords</b> of a work that have been acquired outside the United States is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords." [...] This provision provides copyright owner an opportunity to stop goods from entering the United States market altogether.|$|R
50|$|In a House Report, Congress said:The {{exclusive}} right to prepare derivative works, specified separately in clause (2) of section 106, overlaps the {{exclusive right}} of reproduction to some extent. It is broader than that right, however, {{in the sense that}} reproduction requires fixation in copies or <b>phonorecords,</b> whereas the preparation of a derivative work, such as a ballet, pantomime, or improvised performance, may be an infringement even though nothing is ever fixed in tangible form.|$|R
5000|$|SoundExchange is {{designated}} by the Librarian of Congress as the sole organization authorized to collect royalties paid by services making ephemeral <b>phonorecords</b> or digital audio transmissions of sound recordings, or both, under the statutory licenses set forth in [...] and [...] As of January 1, 2003, SoundExchange is {{designated by}} the United States Copyright Office to also distribute the collected royalties to copyright owners and performers entitled under and pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 114(g)(2).|$|R
