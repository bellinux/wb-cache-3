5000|$|Because of this {{holistic}} emphasis, {{whole language}} is contrasted with skill-based areas of instruction, especially <b>phonics</b> and synthetic <b>phonics.</b> <b>Phonics</b> instruction is a commonly used technique for teaching students to read. <b>Phonics</b> instruction tends to emphasize {{attention to the}} individual components of words, for example, the phonemes /k/, /æ/, and /t/ are represented by the graphemes c, a, and t. Because they do not focus exclusively on the individual parts, tending {{to focus on the}} relationship of parts to and within the larger context, whole language proponents do not favor some types of <b>phonics</b> instruction.

Instruction in embedded <b>phonics</b> typically emphasizes the consonants and the short vowels, as well as letter combinations called rimes or phonograms. The use of this embedded <b>phonics</b> model is called a [...] "whole-part-whole" [...] approach because, consistent with holistic thinking, students read the text for meaning first (whole), then examine features of the <b>phonics</b> system (part) and finally use their new knowledge while reading the text again (whole).

5000|$|Blended <b>phonics</b> (US) or {{synthetic}} <b>phonics</b> (UK) is {{a method}} employed to teach children to read by blending the English sounds to form words.

40|$|This study {{examined}} a Pseudoword <b>Phonics</b> Curriculum {{to determine if}} this form of instruction would increase students’ decoding skills compared to typical real-word <b>phonics</b> instruction. In typical <b>phonics</b> instruction, children learn to decode familiar words which allow them to draw on their prior {{knowledge of how to}} pronounce the word and may detract from learning decoding skills. By using pseudowords during <b>phonics</b> instruction, students may learn more decoding skills because they are unfamiliar with the “words” and therefore cannot draw on memory for how to pronounce the word. It was hypothesized that students who learn <b>phonics</b> with pseudowords will learn more decoding skills and perform higher on a real-word assessment compared to students who learn <b>phonics</b> with real words. ^ Students from two kindergarten classes participated in this study. An author-created word decoding assessment was used to determine the students’ ability to decode words. The study was broken into three phases, each lasting one month. During Phase 1, both groups received <b>phonics</b> instruction using real words, which allowed for the exploration of baseline student growth trajectories and potential teacher effects. During Phase 2, the experimental group received pseudoword <b>phonics</b> instruction while the control group continued real-word <b>phonics</b> instruction. During Phase 3, both groups were taught with real-word <b>phonics</b> instruction. Students were assessed on their decoding skills before and after each phase. ^ Results from multiple regression and multi-level model analyses revealed a greater increase in decoding skills during the second and third phases of the study for students who received the pseudoword <b>phonics</b> instruction compared to students who received the real-word <b>phonics</b> instruction. This suggests that pseudoword <b>phonics</b> instruction improves decoding skills quicker than real-word <b>phonics</b> instruction. This also suggests that teaching decoding with pseudowords for one month can continue to improve decoding skills when children return to real-word <b>phonics</b> instruction. Teacher feedback suggests that confidence with reading increased for students who learned with pseudowords because they were less intimidated by the approach and viewed pseudoword <b>phonics</b> as a game that involved reading “silly” words. Implications of these results, limitations of this study, and areas for future research are discussed. ...|$|R

500|$|Running {{through the}} head are two air passages.

[...] When the whale is submerged, it can close the blowhole, and air that passes through the <b>phonic</b> lips can circulate back to the lungs.

These sounds are reflected by the dense concave bone of the cranium and an air sac at its base. The focused beam is modulated by a large fatty organ known as the 'melon'. This acts like an acoustic lens because it is composed of lipids of differing densities.|$|E
