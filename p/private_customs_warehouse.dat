40|$|Nowadays, as the {{increasingly}} intense {{international trade and}} logistics, the administrative burden of customs has been dramatically raised. In order to reduce repetitive taxing work and promote automatic administration, <b>custom</b> <b>warehouses</b> with electronic declaration systems are introduced and implemented by EU countries. The owner of <b>custom</b> <b>warehouses</b> can postpone the payment of import duties {{under the supervision of}} customs in case these goods are re-exported. The implementation of customwarehouses has significantly simplified custom formality and enhance administrative efficiency. However, its successful management highly depends on the accuracy and reliability of inventory information. Inaccurate inventory records may lead to a variety of undesirable effects, such as troubles in taxing and compliance failure with custom terms. As the common way to address this problem in the past, the traditional physical auditing is always time-consuming and costly, especially when the inventory is various and massive. Moreover, since the multiple stakeholders involvement in <b>custom</b> <b>warehouses,</b> the fault detection and diagnosis processes for inventory record inaccuracy in reality are usually problematic and complicated. Without the effective communication and cooperation between different stakeholders, it is difficult to solve inventory record inaccuracy issues and to guarantee the efficiency and reliability of customwarehousemanagement.
