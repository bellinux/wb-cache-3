25|$|The {{total cost}} of the project (all paid by U.S. taxpayers) was $134 million, in 1943 U.S. dollars. Total crude {{production}} was 315,000 m³ (2.7 million barrels) of which 7,313 m³ (63,000 barrels) were spilled. The cost of the crude oil was $426 per cubic metre ($67.77 per barrel). Refined petroleum <b>product</b> <b>output</b> was just 138,000 m³ (1.2 million barrels). Cost per barrel of refined product was thus $975 per cubic metre, or 97.5 cents per litre ($3.69 a gallon). Adjusted to current dollars using the U.S. consumer price index, in 2000 dollars the oil would have cost $4,214 per cubic metre ($670 a barrel), while the refined product would have been worth an astonishing $9.62 a litre ($36.42 a gallon).|$|E

Further, the tolerance for this reaction to short retention times make this process ideal for carrying out industrial roasting.

5000|$|Cleaner {{production}} is a preventive, company-specific environmental protection initiative. It {{is intended to}} minimize waste and emissions and maximize <b>product</b> <b>output.</b> [...] By analysing the flow of materials and energy in a company, one tries to identify options to minimize waste and emissions out of industrial processes through source reduction strategies. Improvements of organisation and technology help to reduce or suggest better choices in use of materials and energy, and to avoid waste, waste water generation, and gaseous emissions, and also waste heat and noise.|$|E
5000|$|Marx's critics {{interpreting}} his models often argue {{he keeps}} assuming {{what he needs}} to explain, because rather than really [...] "transforming values into prices" [...] by some quantitative mapping procedure, such that prices are truly deduced from labour-values, he either (1) equates value quantities and price quantities, or else (2) he combines both value quantities and price quantities in one equation.

50|$|Continued process {{verification}} (CPV) is {{the collection}} and analysis of end-to-end production components and processes data to ensure <b>product</b> <b>outputs</b> are within predetermined quality limits. In 2011 the Food and Drug Administration published a report outlining best practices regarding business process validation in the pharmaceutical industry. Continued process verification is outlined in this report as the third stage in process validation. Its central purpose {{is to ensure that}} processes are {{in a constant state of}} control, thus ensuring final product quality. Central to effective CPV is a method with which to identify unwanted process inconsistencies in order to execute corrective or preventative measures. Once quality standards are set in place they must be monitored with regular frequency to confirm those parameters are being met. Continued process verification not only helps protect consumers from production faults, but business also see benefits in implementing a CPV program. Should <b>product</b> <b>outputs</b> not match target standards it can be very costly to investigate the problem source without existing CPV data.|$|R

50|$|By {{modeling}} the swing producer behavior, John Morecroft describes two modes: normal swing mode and punitive mode. Usually {{in the normal}} mode, the swing producer responds to market price fluctuations by increasing or decreasing its output {{in order to maintain}} stable prices for all producers. However, independent participants can take unjust advantage of the reduced supply and increase their output in order to win a larger market share. In such cases, the swing producer switches to the punitive mode and greatly increases its <b>product</b> <b>output</b> in order to reduce prices, causing losses for other producers and making them cooperate.|$|E

50|$|The {{use of a}} rapid thermal {{heating process}} {{followed}} by their quenching/cooling is essential in many chemical engineering fields. For example, the aluminum hydroxide powder (i.e. gibbsite) used for the preparation of an alumina-based catalyst goes {{through the process of}} thermochemical activation (TCA) to form a thermally activated product, Al2O3∙nH2O. A centrifugal FR, TSEFLAR can be employed to heat the powder up to 400-900 K with a plate temperature of 1000 K and a speed of 90-250 turns per minute.

5000|$|In economics, {{potential}} output (also {{referred to as}} [...] "natural gross domestic product") refers {{to the highest level}} of real gross domestic <b>product</b> (<b>output)</b> that can be sustained over the long term. The existence of a limit is due to natural and institutional constraints. If actual GDP rises and stays above {{potential output}}, then (in the absence of wage and price controls) inflation tends to increase as demand for factors of production exceeds supply. This is because of the limited supply of workers and their time, capital equipment, and natural resources, along with the limits of our technology and our management skills. Graphically, the expansion of output beyond the natural limit {{can be seen as a}} shift of production volume above the optimum quantity on the average cost curve. Likewise, if GDP is below natural GDP, inflation will decelerate as suppliers lower prices to fill their excess production capacity.|$|E
50|$|Critical process {{parameters}} (CPP) in {{pharmaceutical manufacturing}} are key variables affecting the production process. CPPs are attributes that are monitored to detect deviations in standardized production operations and <b>product</b> <b>output</b> quality or changes in Critical Quality Attributes. Those attributes {{with a higher}} impact on CQAs should be prioritized and held in a stricter state of control. The manufacturer should conduct test to set acceptable range limits of the determined CPPs and define acceptable process variable variability. Operational conditions within this range are considered acceptable operational standards. Any deviation from the acceptable range will be indicative of issues within {{the process and the}} subsequent production of substandard products. Data relating to CPP should be recorded, stored, and analyzed by the manufacturer. CPP variables and ranges should be reevaluated after careful analysis of historical CPP data. Identifying CPPs is done in stage one of Process Validation: Process design and ???are an essential part of a manufacturing control strategy.|$|E
30|$|In most cases, {{the ratio}} between {{the high price}} of feed inputs and lower price of {{livestock}} <b>product</b> <b>outputs</b> provides insufficient incentives for the nomads to purchase inputs for developing intensive production systems (Rueda et al. 2003).

Sedentary farmers allow the nomads to graze their herds on the crop stubble left in the fields or in the orchards. This agreement provides food for the nomads' livestock while providing manure to fertilise the farmers' fields and orchards.|$|R
