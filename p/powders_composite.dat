40|$|Spark plasma {{sintering}} (SPS), {{also called}} Field Assisted Sintering Technique (FAST), represents a novel {{method of preparation}} of sintered materials from powders. The main advantage of the SPS method is a high achievable heat rate (> 200 °C/min) and high sintering temperatures (up to 2200 °C in our laboratory). Combination of high heating rate, rather high pressures (up to 80 MPa) and electric field fluctuations leads to an effective sintering and significant reduction of sintering time for both coarse-grained and nanocrystalline <b>powders.</b> <b>Composite</b> materials may be easily obtained by mixing or layering of different powders.

40|$|Sphere {{packings}} {{are essential}} to modeling many physical phenomena, including <b>powders,</b> <b>composite</b> materials, and the liquid state. There is a strong need to fit packings to data, but this {{is complicated by the}} lack of a formal probabilistic model for packings. This lack requires that simulation algorithms and collections of physical objects be used as models. Identification of common aspects different realizations of the same packing process requires a large library of descriptive statistics, many of which can be taken directly from mathematical models in physics. These considerations also dictate that model fitting will require the use of large samples of independent and identically distributed realizations, rather than the large single stationary realizations found in conventional spatial statistics. Any model-fitting procedure will be based on multivariate statistical methods, and on statistical learning...|$|E

However, calcium may react with zirconium to form calcium zirconate. In addition, decomposition of HAp to tricalcium phosphate (TCP) occurs with water loss inhibiting ceramic densification.

The experimental {{results show that the}} ball mill 50 h, Fe 50 Cu 50 <b>composite</b> <b>powder</b> size basically stable, size in a few microns or so, and Fe and Cu has fully fuses in together to form uniform solid solution...|$|R
