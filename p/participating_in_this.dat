25|$|In 1967, Rolf Hochhuth, a German playwright, {{included}} one {{theory of the}} 1943 crash in his play Soldiers: An Obituary for Geneva.

Unaware that Prchal was still alive, the pilot was accused of <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> plot. A libel case resulted and a court in London found in favour of Prchal and awarded him substantial damages and costs (50 thousand British pounds). Hochhuth moved to Switzerland and avoided the payments. The London theatre staging the play agreed to out-of-court compensation.|$|E

25|$|A stroke {{can affect}} the ability to live {{independently}} and with quality. Self-management programs are a special training that educates stroke survivors about stroke and its consequences, helps them acquire skills to cope with their challenges, and helps them set and meet their own goals during their recovery process. These programs are tailored to the target audience, and lead by someone trained and expert in stroke and its consequences (most commonly professionals, but also stroke survivors and peers). A 2016 review reported that these programs {{improve the quality of}} life after stroke, without negative effects. People with stroke felt more empowered, happy and satisfied with life after <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> training.|$|E

25|$|Milk {{often is}} homogenized, a {{treatment}} that prevents a cream layer from separating {{out of the}} milk. The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation. A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than {{a smaller number of}} larger ones, and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces. Nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> new membrane structure. The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2013, Prime Minister Harper {{announced}} {{funding for}} ecoENERGY Innovation Initiative projects including a project {{being led by}} Owens Corning entitled Integrating Renewables and Conservation Measures in a Net-Zero Energy Low-Rise Residential Subdivision. This demonstration project is aimed at addressing challenges specific to production housing when building to net zero energy performance levels. The buildABILITY Corporation project management team will be working to assess and resolve challenges in relation to site planning, construction, equipment, grid connections, cost, trade capability, warranty, reliability, sales, marketing, and homebuyer information/education. Five home builders across four provinces will build at least 25 Net Zero Energy (NZE) homes by March 2016 {{as part of this}} project. The five selected builders <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> initiative are: Mattamy Homes Limited (Calgary, Alberta); Construction Voyer (Laval, Quebec); Minto Communities (Ottawa, Ontario); Provident Development Inc. (Halifax, Nova Scotia); and Reid’s Heritage Homes (Guelph, Ontario).|$|E
25|$|On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further {{expanded}} the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper {{using the new}} Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy {{as much of the}} debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of October 1, 2008, {{according to the most recent}} data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.|$|E
