50|$|In {{preparation}} for the referendum, the Ecuadorian Internal Revenue Service issued a resolution outlining the criteria for a jurisdiction {{to be considered a}} tax haven, establishing two categories: Preferential tax regimes, and low tax jurisdictions. A <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> was classed as a jurisdiction whose effective tax rate is below 60% in relation to the Ecuadorian corporate income tax (CIT) rate of 13.2%. A low tax jurisdiction was classed as having an effective tax rate below 60% in relation to the Ecuadorian CIT of 13.2% and no substantial economic activity. The IRS may remove a country from their list of tax havens if it reforms its tax policy, if it enforces a treaty to avoid double taxation, including a special information exchange clause, or if its laws do not include banking confidentiality, securities or other regulations that prohibit sharing information with the Ecuadorian IRS.|$|E

40|$|The OECD or Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has {{produced}} a report titled Harmful Tax Competition An Emerging Global Issue.

40|$|Tax {{expenditures}} {{are one of}} the instruments a government can use to implement specific tax policies. In many cases, subsidies and tax {{expenditures are}} close substitutes. However, tax expenditures are less transparent since they are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as subsidies are. The paper first presents the basic issues of tax expenditures: definition, discussion of the « benchmark tax system » from which tax expenditures derogates, reporting practice and recent figures and trends. We then turn to the economic analysis of tax expenditures. While there is a clear case for tax expenditures in the case of externalities and market imperfections, the pro and cons of departing neutrality should be clearly assessed when tax expenditures are used in other circumstances. The paper also documents the effects of tax expenditures on the distribution of the tax burden. Empirical evidence shows that the take-up of tax expenditures by households concentrates on the right-hand side of income distribution and lowers the progressivity of income tax. The final section discusses the economic implications of some tax expenditures: tax credits favouring long-term savings, exempted savings accounts and <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> for corporate income tax.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Zambia has seen an {{increase}} in the flow of foreign direct investment; a large quantity of which went into the copper mining industry. The price of copper increased radically, which prompted the Zambian government to reconsider the <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> that foreign mining companies enjoyed to ensure that Zambia benefited from this change in circumstances. The tax regime was originally implemented to encourage the inflow of foreign capital, and to revive an industry that had been crippled by previously low copper prices. The concession agreements between the Government of Zambia and the mining companies contained Stabilisation clauses which constitute a promise {{on the part of the}} host government not to amend its laws in a way that adversely affects the economic rights contained within that particular concession agreement. The article examines Stabilisation clauses in concession agreements and their legal effect on a host state’s power to amend its laws unilaterally. This issue is discussed in light of the Kuwait v Aminoil case which seems to suggest that “Stabilisation clauses ” do not outrightly prohibit states from modifying their laws when economic circumstances change. Finally the article looks at a legal framework that ensures that neither the rights of the investor on one hand or the state on the other take precedence over the other. 1...|$|E
40|$|The EU {{policy against}} harmful tax {{competition}} aims at eliminating tax policies targeted at attracting the internationally mobile tax base. We construct an imperfectly competitive model of costly trade between two countries. In setting their corporate taxes, governments non-cooperatively decide whether to discriminate between internationally mobile and immobile firms. We find the Nash equilibrium <b>tax</b> <b>regimes.</b> When trade costs are high countries impose a uniform tax on all firms while nations will discriminate between mobile and immobile firms when costs are low. At some trade costs, fiscal competition results in tax discrimination despite uniform taxation being socially preferable. <b>Preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> <b>Tax</b> competition Imperfect competition Trade costs...|$|R
40|$|Extract] The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} enormous growth in the reliance by taxpayers on <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> designed to attract foreign investment and <b>tax</b> haven <b>regimes.</b> These regimes allow investors to effectively allocate profit to the tax preferred location, notwithstanding that the primary business activities occur elsewhere. Many are predicated on secrecy {{and a lack of}} transparency (in the sense that the amount of taxable income and its beneficial owner cannot be identified) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{assumption}} of separate tax bases {{on which the}} literature of <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> has been based {{is not necessarily the}} case. In this paper we assume a single type of capital, or money, invested in different industries as well as in different countries. Tax elasticities can differ across industries depending on production technologies and therefore governments have incentives to provide <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> treatment to certain industries. Then it is shown that preferential regimes may not be desirable in different senses from the literature. Copyright (c) 2010 the author(s). Journal compilation (c) 2010 RSAI. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the strict {{relation}} between the continuous changes of the diversified tax regimes of {{the various types of}} cooperatives and the political composition of the governments succeeding each other in Italy from the after war period to the present. It emerged that the different types of cooperatives prevailing in the leftwing League of Cooperatives or in the Confederation of Italian Cooperatives (CCI) of catholic orientation or in both organization had a different possibility of exerting successful rent seeking with the various Governments with different political orientation. Consumption cooperatives operating in the mass retail which obtained generous tax treatments by Governments leaning to the left, lost most of them by centre right Governments. The cooperatives of agriculture and food processing, those of small fishing and those of production and labor, important both in the League and in CCI, were able to obtain from different Governments special privileges in the postwar period and   kept most of them also under the centre right Governments of the last period. Social cooperatives object of a special legislation in 1992 under a Government of Giulio Andreotti, a leader close to the catholic organizations, kept their <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> with all the subsequent governments. They are important both in CCI and in the League and have a peculiar electoral power because of their capillary activities. </p...|$|E

40|$|In 1998 the OECD {{issued a}} report announcing a project to rid the World of harmful tax practices. Targeted were <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> that {{permitted}} residents of foreign countries to escape their home country tax obligations. The project was premised on fairness and morality, namely that those who enjoy {{the benefits of a}} welfare state should make a fair contribution to its maintenance. From the outset the process adopted by the OECD was authoritarian and threatening. Particularly divisive was its differentiation between member and non-member states. Those in the latter category with <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> were labelled <b>tax</b> havens and the real focus of the project soon appeared to be directed at these countries. The tax havens’ primary response was to point to the inequity {{in the absence of a}} level playing field arising from the intransigence of a number of OECD states and other developed nations to removing their <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regimes.</b> Faced with opposition, particularly from the United States, the OECD’s project evolved to focus on the need for <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> transparency and international information exchange agreements. This placed the project in accord with a number of other international initiatives directed to similar ends. Faced with overwhelming international pressure all but five of the tax havens have committed to co-operate. Notwithstanding that these commitments are premised on a level playing field, and whether this can be achieved is problematic, it may nevertheless be in the interests of the tax havens to take the initiative and embrace the principles of transparency and information exchange on their terms. Such terms might ensure a proper balance between the rights of nations and of taxpayers. Furthermore, in the negotiation of information exchange agreements the commercial value of the information sought by the developed nations should be recognised by both parties. The application of these propositions can be illustrated by reference to the relationship between Australia and the tax haven Vanuatu. There is a long way to go but there is every possibility that a project, whose process spurred recriminations and emotional rhetoric, might yet lead to a result that promotes the principles of morality and fairness for all parties concerned. ...|$|R

This paper shows that, on the contrary, preferential regimes may serve a useful strategic purpose in enabling countries to con-fine their most aggressive tax competition to particular parts of the tax system.

40|$|Most states {{within the}} EU {{have some kind}} of CFC-legislation that allows the state in {{question}} to tax its residents for gains accrued within foreign companies that they control.

40|$|Using a {{panel of}} {{administrative}} data and regression discontinuity analysis, this paper examines how the introduction of <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> for Georgian micro and small businesses in 2010 affects formal firm creation and tax compliance.

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{increase}} investment and growth in the European Union. Major obstacles are the very complex tax structure and the tax uncertainty an investor face. To make more investments economically viable Member States have reduced tax rates. At the same time <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> have been reduced or eliminated since they distort investment decisions. Furthermore, many countries in East and Central Europe have streamlined their tax systems and several have introduced flat taxes. Member States have also embarked on a process of developing an optional Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). Such a tax system would make consolidation possible but would call for some mechanism for the allocation of tax revenues across countries.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of an {{international}} crackdown against <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regimes,</b> Caribbean <b>tax</b> havens and other jurisdictions have adopted "due diligence" procedures to manage financial and reputational risk. Due diligence relies on qualitative forms of evaluation and defers grounded and definitive knowledge claims through continuous peer review. In doing so, it mirrors certain forms of ethnographic practice {{at a number of}} levels of scale. This article tracks the shifts in financial regulation from crime to harm and from certainty to scrutiny and reflects on their implications for ethnography-as a limited and open-ended process of evaluation warranted by qualitative forms of judgment. It seeks to complicate our picture of contemporary capitalisms by drawing attention to the nonquantifiable and the ethical that lie "inside" them. Where conventional forms of ethnographic critique might look to expose the political or economic interests behind actions, symbols, or social relationships, this article has a more modest goal: to try to understand the similarity of form between due diligence and anthropology. © 2005 by the American Anthropological Association.

Additionally, this effort deviates from traditional measures utilized to remedy international fiscal issues, specifically double taxation, and will likely result in stifling global economic development.

The endogenous spatial allocation of mobile firms depends upon different parameters of the economy while the distribution of immobile firms is exogenous.

Trade integration makes imposing the same tax on all firms more appealing such that, at low trade costs, the unique Nash equilibrium is characterized by uniform corporate taxes being set by both governments.
