5|$|The {{fruits of}} the genus Cucurbita are good sources of {{nutrients}}, such as vitamin A and vitamin C, among other nutrients according to species. The fruits have many culinary uses including <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie,</b> biscuits, bread, desserts, puddings, beverages, and soups.|$|E
5|$|Long before European contact, Cucurbita {{had been}} a major food source for the native peoples of the Americas, and the species became an {{important}} food for European settlers, including the Pilgrims, even featuring at the first Thanksgiving. Commercially produced pumpkin commonly used in <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> is most often varieties of C.moschata; Libby's, {{by far the largest}} producer of processed pumpkin, uses a proprietary strain of the Dickinson pumpkin variety of C.moschata for its canned pumpkin. Other foods that can be made using members of this genus include biscuits, bread, cheesecake, desserts, donuts, granola, ice cream, lasagna dishes, pancakes, pudding, pumpkin butter, salads, soups, and stuffing. Squash soup is a dish in African cuisine. The xerophytic species are proving useful in the search for nutritious foods that grow well in arid regions. C.ficifolia is used to make soft and mildly alcoholic drinks.|$|E

25|$|The play Pin Cushion, by Clay McLeod Chapman {{is based}} around {{a husband and}} wife knife {{throwing}} act and consists of the target girl delivering a monologue while her husband throws knives around her. It was performed as part of Chapman's <b>Pumpkin</b> <b>Pie</b> Show at The Red Room Theatre, New York, in May and June 2002. The performance involved a genuine knife throwing act, with actress Niabi Caldwell as the target girl and professional knife thrower Dr. David Adamovich (aka The Great Throwdini) playing her husband.|$|E

500|$|Halloween {{is widely}} celebrated with jack-o-lanterns made of large orange {{pumpkins}} carved with ghoulish faces and illuminated from inside with candles.

Molly Eichel, one of the reviewers, was especially interested in moments other than the food fight, such as the [...] "childishness" [...] (also described as [...] "devolution") of the characters, Diane's motherliness toward the gang, and Eichel's [...] "favorite part", Vera's long-awaited appearance, even though her face was covered with <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie.</b>|$|E

500|$|Food critic John Hess {{and food}} {{historian}} Karen Hess have {{commented that the}} [...] "quality and richness" [...] of the dishes [...] "should surprise {{those who believe that}} Americans of those days ate only Spartan frontier food", giving as examples the glass of Malaga wine, seven eggs and half a pound of butter in the <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie.</b> They argue that while the elaborate bills of fare given for each month of the year in American editions were conspicuously wasteful, they were less so than the [...] "interminable" [...] menus [...] "stuffed down" [...] in the Victorian era, as guests were not expected to eat everything, but to choose which dishes they wanted, and [...] "the cooking was demonstrably better in the eighteenth century." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the dining}} room, Diane orders them {{to wait for}} dinner until the turkey is ready. As suppertime is passing, the turkey is still very undercooked and the {{trimmings}} have gone cold. Carla and Norm start blaming {{each other for the}} turkey's slow cooking. Norm throws some of Carla's peas at her, and she then throws carrots back at him. Cliff throws mashed yams at Frasier, who accidentally throws gravy skin back at Woody, intended for Cliff. The whole gang is poised to start a food fight until Diane stands up and tells them loudly to stop. When she is close to scolding them, Sam throws cranberry sauce at her, so the food fight resumes. By the time the food fight ends, the turkey is finally cooked. The gang calms down and decides to eat what they can. Diane comes out of the kitchen and throws a <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> to spite Sam for throwing cranberry sauce at her. The pie misses Sam but accidentally hits Vera as she enters. Vera tells Norm to fetch his coat, and Norm says, [...] "Yes, dear." ...|$|E

After Emma's reunion of the children with Michael that evening, Henry arrived with <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> to give Emma in order to thank her for explaining about his birth father. They are interrupted by a stranger (Eion Bailey) on a motorcycle with a unique box. Without giving his name, he asks Emma about finding a place to stay.

2500|$|Mashed {{potatoes}} with gravy, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, sweet corn, various fall vegetables, squash, and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> are {{commonly associated with}} Thanksgiving dinner. Green bean casserole was introduced in 1955 and remains a favorite. All of these are actually native to the Americas or were introduced as a new food source to the Europeans when they arrived. Turkey may be an exception. In his book Mayflower, Nathaniel Philbrick suggests that the Pilgrims might already have been familiar with turkey in England, even though the bird is native to the Americas. The Spaniards had brought domesticated turkeys back from Central America in the early 17th century, and the birds soon became popular fare all over Europe, including England, where turkey (as {{an alternative to the}} traditional goose) became a [...] "fixture at English Christmases". The Pilgrims did not observe Christmas.|$|E

2500|$|A popular Dairy Queen item is the Blizzard, {{which is}} soft-serve {{mechanically}} blended with mix-in ingredients such as sundae toppings and/or pieces of cookies, brownies, or candy. It {{has been a}} staple on the menu since its introduction in 1985, {{a year in which}} Dairy Queen sold more than 100 million Blizzards. Popular flavors include Oreo Cookies, mint Oreo, chocolate chip cookie dough, M's, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Heath Bar (Skor in Canada), and Butterfinger (Crispy Crunch in Canada). Seasonal flavors are also available such as October's <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie</b> and June's cotton candy. It has been argued that Dairy Queen drew its inspiration from the concrete served by the St. Louis-based Ted Drewes. On July 26, 2010, Dairy Queen introduced a new [...] "mini" [...] size Blizzard, served in 6 oz. cups. During the 25th anniversary of the Blizzard, two special flavors were released: Strawberry Golden Oreo Blizzard and Buster Bar Blizzard. Salted Caramel Truffle was released in 2015 during the Blizzard's 27th anniversary and Dairy Queen's 75th anniversary, and is still on the menu today.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, Thanksgiving traditions in America varied from region to region. A {{traditional}} New England Thanksgiving, for example, consisted of a raffle held on Thanksgiving Eve (in which the prizes were mainly geese or turkeys), a shooting match on Thanksgiving morning (in which turkeys and chickens were used as targets), church services—and then the traditional feast, which consisted of some familiar Thanksgiving staples such as turkey and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pie,</b> and some not-so-familiar dishes such as pigeon pie. The earliest high school football rivalries took root in the late 19th century in Massachusetts, stemming from games played on Thanksgiving; professional football took root as a Thanksgiving staple during the sport's genesis in the 1890s, and the tradition of Thanksgiving football both at the high school and professional level continues to this day. In New York City, people would dress up in fanciful masks and costumes and roam the streets in merry-making mobs. By the beginning of the 20th century, these mobs had morphed into Ragamuffin parades consisting mostly of children dressed as [...] "ragamuffins" [...] in costumes of old and mismatched adult clothes and with deliberately smudged faces, but by the late 1950s the tradition had diminished enough to only exist in a few communities around New York.|$|E

6000|$|Our dinner {{consisted}} {{of meat and}} pumpkin, boiled or baked, maize [...] "in the milk" [...] in its season and sweet potatoes, besides the other common vegetables and salads. Maize-meal puddings and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pies</b> and tarts were common with us, but the sweet we loved best was a peach-pie, made like an apple-pie with a crust, and these came in about the middle of February and lasted until April or even May, when our late variety, which we called [...] "winter peach," [...] ripened.|$|R
60|$|But {{the triumph}} of the corn-field is not yet. The {{transformation}} of its products into Indian puddings and <b>pumpkin</b> <b>pies</b> will not occur until the golden Autumn days, when the sun, and the corn, and the pumpkins are all yellow alike, and gold--if it was not so scarce--would be nothing to compare to any of them. Then come the men, with their corn-cutters--pieces of scythe-blades, with handles fitted to them--and down go the corn-stalks. Only one crack apiece, and sometimes a big cut will slice off the stalks on a whole hill.|$|R
