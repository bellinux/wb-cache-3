50|$|A {{method of}} {{achieving}} the spreading {{of a given}} signal {{is provided by the}} modulation scheme. With DSSS, the message signal is used to modulate a bit sequence known as a <b>Pseudo</b> <b>Noise</b> (PN) code; this PN code consists of a radio pulse that is much shorter in duration (larger bandwidth) than the original message signal. This modulation of the message signal scrambles and spreads the pieces of data, and thereby resulting in a bandwidth size nearly identical to that of the PN sequence. In this context, the duration of the radio pulse for the PN code {{is referred to as the}} chip duration. The smaller this duration, the larger the bandwidth of the resulting DSSS signal; more bandwidth multiplexed to the message signal results in better resistance against interference.|$|E
5000|$|Spread Spectrum Time Domain Vernier Method or SSTDV, is a {{time domain}} {{reflectometry}} method that uses a spread spectrum time domain reflectometry signal to locate intermittent faults in wires (such as aircraft wires) by measuring time delay between incident and reflected signals. SSTDR uses a <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> (PN) code as the test signal. This code travels {{down the length of}} the wire, where it is reflected off of impedance discontinuities such as open or short circuits. The reflected signal is correlated with the incident signal to identify the locations of these discontinuities. In the case of SSTDV, the correlation is accomplished by adding one bit to the PN code each cycle, thus creating a vernier sequence that can be used to resolve the time delay between incident and reflected signals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> (PN) {{generating}} method for digital audio watermarking using time-spread echo hiding. In time-spread echo based audio watermarking, the secret payload {{is embedded in the}} form of multiple echoes spread by a <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> sequence and the <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> sequence is used as secret key. Generally, the <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> sequence is required to be uncorrelated with other sequence and therefore typically generated by an M-sequence generator. In this paper, we propose a key sequence generating method which generates a key sequence from an audio signal. By using the new key sequence generated from an audio signal instead of an M-sequence, the key information users have to remember is their secret audio signal but not a complicated random PN key. Therefore, the availability of digital audio watermarking would be improved. After introducing the new key generation method, we evaluated the proposed key sequence. The result shows it can detect a secret payload similar to use of a conventional M-sequence and does not deteriorate inaudibility of the embedded watermark. 11 th International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, IIH-MSP 2015; Adelaide; Australia; 23 - 25 September 201...|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> sequence and information sequence {{is of great}} importance in the security of DS-CDMA system, which remains a hot research problem in reconnaissance and supervision of wireless communication. In DS-CDMA system, the <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> sequences of different users are uncorrelated and the information sequences of different users are statistical independent, thus independent component analysis (ICA) could be introduced to separate the DS-CDMA signals with little prior knowledge. In multipath situations, the recovered <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> sequence with ICA is overlapped. For DS-CDMA signals which utilize m-sequence as <b>pseudo</b> <b>noise</b> sequence, the triple correlation function (TCF) is introduced to eliminate the influence of overlap in this paper, which increases the estimation correct ratio greatly.

30|$|The {{experiments}} are conducted with {{various types of}} <b>pseudo</b> <b>noises</b> and also with real noise that is observed in the images taken in low-illumination conditions. It is shown that the proposed method gives lower PSNR than the state-of-the-art methods such as BM 3 D [6] and BLS-GSM [4] when the white Gaussian noise is added. However, it gives higher PSNR than the conventional wavelet shrinkage methods and the spatial nonlocal means filtering method. Also, it gives higher PSNR than BM 3 D when the noise {{is a mixture of}} Gaussian and impulsive noises and when the noise model is Poisson which better explains the real noise from CCD/CMOS sensors [9]. For the experiments with real noise, images taken under low-illumination conditions and film images are denoised by various denoising methods. Subjective comparison shows that the wavelet domain nonlocal means filtering provides competitive results for real noises, which supports the simulation results with non-Gaussian noises.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} low {{frequency}} watermarking scheme on gray level images, {{which is based on}} DCT transform and spread spectrum communications technique. The DCT of non overlapping 8 x 8 blocks of the host image is computed, then using each block DC coefficients we construct a low-resolution approximation image. We apply block based DCT on this approximation image, then a <b>pseudo</b> random <b>noise</b> sequence is added into its high frequencies. For detection, we extract the approximation image from the watermarked image, then the same <b>pseudo</b> random <b>noise</b> sequence is generated, and its correlation is computed with high frequencies of the watermarked approximation image. In our method, higher robustness is obtained because of embedding the watermark in low frequency. In addition, higher imperceptibility is gained by scattering the watermark's bit in different blocks. We evaluated the robustness of the proposed technique against many common attacks such as JPEG compression, additive Gaussian noise and median filter. Compared with related works, our method proved to be highly resistant in cases of compression and additive noise, while preserving high PSNR for the watermarked images...|$|R
