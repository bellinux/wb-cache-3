50|$|The eastern (<b>pale)</b> <b>{{chanting}}</b> <b>goshawk</b> or Somali {{chanting goshawk}} (Melierax poliopterus) is a {{bird of prey}} of East Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pale</b> <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> eats {{a variety}} of {{vertebrate}} prey, mainly lizards, but also small mammals and birds, and large insects. It often walks on the ground.|$|E
50|$|The {{chanting}} goshawks {{are sometimes}} {{considered to be}} a singe species, the chanting goshawk Melierax metabates, or to be this species plus the other two lumped as the <b>pale</b> <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> Melierax canorus.|$|E
5000|$|Recorded as prey of the Melierax metabates or <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk,</b> a {{bird of prey}} {{indigenous}} to Africa ...|$|R
50|$|The dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> {{occurs in}} savannahs and open {{woodlands}}, favouring mixed bushveld and broad-leafed woodlands and avoid dense forest and desert, where it overlaps with other Melierax species the dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> prefers moister richer woodland. In southern Africa {{it is found}} in tall, well-developed woodland, especially wheremiombo (Brachystegia spp), mopane (Colosphermum mopane), Zambezi teak (Baikiaea plurijuga), Knob thorn (Senegalia nigrescens) and Marula (Sclerocarya birrea) are among the canopy.|$|R
50|$|Urotriorchis macrourus has a {{well-developed}} procoracoid foramen, {{which suggests}} a separation from Accipiter. It {{may be related}} to the <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawks</b> in tribe Melieraxini.|$|R
50|$|The dark {{chanting}} goshawk breeds in sub-Saharan Africa, but avoids the rainforests of the Congo basin and the far south, where it is replaced by the <b>pale</b> <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> and east Africa where the Eastern {{chanting goshawk}} seems to replace it.|$|E
50|$|The ({{southern}}) <b>pale</b> <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> (Melierax canorus) is a {{bird of prey}} in {{the family}} Accipitridae. This hawk breeds in southern Africa. It is a resident species of dry, open semi-desert with 75 cm or less annual rainfall. It is commonly seen perched on roadside telephone poles.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{intermediate}} between the smaller {{dark chanting goshawk}} (widespread {{to the west and}} south) and the <b>pale</b> <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> (southern Africa) in colour, size, and leg length, but not in range. It has often been considered a subspecies of the latter, but because of this disparity between geography and characters, it is now considered a separate species, as agreed by many authorities.|$|E
50|$|The dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> (Melierax metabates) is a {{bird of prey}} in {{the family}} Accipitridae which is found across much of sub-Saharan Africa and {{southern}} Arabia, with an isolated and declining population in southern Morocco.|$|R
50|$|The {{subfamily}} Accipitrinae contains Accipiter; it {{also contains}} genera Micronisus (Gabar goshawk), Urotriorchis (long-tailed hawk), and Megatriorchis (Doria's <b>goshawk).</b> Melierax (<b>chanting</b> <b>goshawks)</b> may {{be included in}} the subfamily, or given a subfamily of its own.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{calls are}} [...] "a melodious piping whee-pee-pee-pee, {{and a long}} high-pitched kleee-yeu", {{slightly}} lower-pitched {{than those of the}} dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk,</b> or [...] "peeu-peeu-peeu-pee-pee-pee-pee..." [...] in the nesting season, the source of its name.|$|R
50|$|Outside of the Bubo genus, other owls in Africa {{are much}} smaller than Verreaux's eagle-owls {{and are more likely}} to be viewed as prey than competition. Among the small-to-mid-sized owls that have fallen prey to this species {{including}} the barn owl (Tyto alba) and the African grass owl (Tyto capensis), both of which average around 419 g in body mass in Africa, the 334 g marsh owl (Asio capensis) and the 216 g southern white-faced owl (Ptilopsis granti). The only verified interactions with other typical eagle-owls have been predatory, as the 645 g spotted eagle-owl has been recorded among their prey in a few cases. There are several owls was broadly similar habitat preferences from African scops owls (Otus senegalensis) to African wood owls (Strix woodfordii) that have not been reported as food but are almost certainly occasionally threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owls. As is commonly the case with eagle-owls, the Verreaux's eagle-owl is perhaps the most serious predatory threat to diurnal raptors in its range, most often ambushing raptors on their prominent nests upon nightfall and freely killing birds of prey of any age from nestlings to adults. Such prey is not quantitatively significant as a food source but since raptors as a rule are sparsely distributed the habitual visitation of a single or pair of Verreaux's eagle-owl can potentially be devastating to a local population. Among the species known to be attacked have included, among small-to-medium-sized raptors, include the 638 g African harrier-hawk (Polyboroides typus), the 675 g <b>pale</b> <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> (Melierax canorus), the 507 g African marsh harrier (Circus ranivorus), the 110 g scissor-tailed kite (Chelictinia riocourii), the 291.5 g African goshawk (Accipiter tachiro) the 875 g common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and the 640 g Wahlberg's eagle (Hieraaetus wahlbergi).|$|E
50|$|The {{martial eagle}} {{infrequently}} hunts other birds of prey, perhaps doing so {{only slightly more}} often than do crowned eagles and Verreaux's eagles. In comparison, the temperate-zone-dwelling golden eagle is a fairly prolific predator of other birds of prey. This {{may be due to}} more scarce prey resources in colder regions forcing eagles to pursue difficult prey such as this more frequently, whereas booted eagles in rich Africa biospheres may not need to do so as much. Nonetheless, a somewhat diverse range of raptorial birds have been identified as prey for martial eagles: the 0.61 kg lanner falcon (Falco biarmicus), the 0.65 kg spotted eagle owl (Bubo africanus) (with a surprisingly large number of 6 found at one nest in Tsavo East), the 0.67 kg <b>pale</b> <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> (Melierax canorus), the 2.04 kg hooded vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus) (in one case after a protracted aerial battle), the 4.17 kg white-headed vulture (Trigonoceps occipitalis) and even Africa’s largest bird of prey, the 9.28 kg Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres). As apex predators, martial eagles are themselves largely invulnerable to predation. A video exists that purportedly depicts a leopard killing a martial eagle but this eagle was misidentified as it actually features a leopard preying on an immature African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vociferus) (and, at that, one that was possibly grounded for unknown reasons). There are, however, verified (if rare) cases of caracals preying on sleeping martial eagles at night, by climbing trees and pouncing in an ambush. It is possible that leopards may too ambush sleeping eagles but post-fledgling martial eagles are known to be highly wary and healthy individuals a great majority of the time will successfully evade potential dangers by day. Predation on nests of martial eagles, beyond those by humans, are little-known, with no verified depredations known in the literature, but are likely to occur.|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 251 - 265. A {{population}} of Pale Chanting Goshawks Melierax canorus, {{some of which}} live in families, was studied during 1988 - 1992 {{for a total of}} 117 group-years near Calitzdorp, South Africa. The aims of the study were to identify ecological and social factors that might predispose individuals in the population to delay dispersal and become non-breeding or co-breeding members of <b>Pale</b> <b>Chanting</b> <b>Goshawk</b> families, and to determine why cobreeders breed cooperatively in polyandrous trios. In all vegetation types within the study area, non-breeders, as juvenile and adult offspring, delayed dispersal from their natal territories. However, co-breeding males occurred only in one vegetation type, Karroid Broken Veld. Co-breeding males participated in all reproductive activities, including copulation. Karroid Broken Veld also supported the largest known groups of Pale Chanting Goshawks and the highest frequency of groups with non-breeders, which resulted in some of the highest recorded single species raptor densities in the Afrotropics. Pale Chanting Goshawks in Karroid Broken Veld preyed primarily on two otomyinid rodents, Otomys unisulcatus (42 - 48 % of prey biomass) and Parotomys brantsii (18 - 32 %). The habitat quality of Karroid Broken Veld for Pale Chanting Goshawks was high since, compared with other vegetation types, it incorporated: (1) optimal habitat for otomyinid prey, (2) a very high estimated biomass of otomyinids, almost twice that of other vegetation types, and (3) a hunting habitat with an optimum combination of prey visibility and perch availability that facilitated hunting efficiency. Territorial space was limited throughout the study area, constraining the number of nonbreeders per group to two and inhibiting new breeders from establishing territories. Juvenile non-breeders probably delayed dispersal to increase their probability of survival, and dispersed later as sexually mature adults, since they could not increase their fitness further by becoming helpers at the nest. During the nestling period, co-breeding beta males provided prey at an equal rate to dominant males, that enabled polyandrous trios to undertake more frequent and successful breeding attempts in years of high prey abundance. The help provided by co-breeders contributed more to this success than did density of dominant prey and territory size. In Karroid Broken Veld co-breeders delayed dispersal since their fitness as subordinate sibling males was probably higher than fitness achieved due from dispersing to a breeding vacancy in habitat of lower quality. I suggest that those ecological factors which contribute to habitat quality provided the proximate impetus, and the resulting saturation of the habitat the ultimate impetus, in promoting the establishment of <b>Pale</b> <b>Chanting</b> <b>Goshawk</b> family units. Once <b>Pale</b> <b>Chanting</b> <b>Goshawk</b> formed families, a range of secondary benefits evolved as birds adjusted their behaviour to benefit from the presence of other group members. For example, although breeders in high-quality habitat produced the highest number of offspring, the lack of territorial space probably forced more offspring to disperse. To increase offspring survival, breeders may have adjusted their reproductive strategy and allow non-breeders to partake and share in returns of cooperative hunts. Other secondary benefits included the possibility of inheriting a natal territory, budding-off onto territorial borders or helping close relatives as an experienced co-breeder...|$|E
5|$|In Africa, Crex {{species may}} be hunted by the leopard, serval, cats, the black-headed heron, dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk,</b> African hawk-eagle, Wahlberg's eagle, and black sparrowhawk. In South Africa, newly hatched African crake chicks {{were taken by}} a boomslang.|$|R
5000|$|The eastern <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> {{is usually}} seen alone. [...] It often perches on {{the tops of}} trees and utility poles. [...] Its wingbeats are shallow and [...] "straight-arm". It holds its wings flat, or {{sometimes}} in a V, when it glides.|$|R
5|$|Predators {{include the}} leopard, serval, cats, the black-headed heron, dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk,</b> African hawk-eagle and Wahlberg's eagle. In South Africa, newly hatched chicks {{were taken by}} a boomslang. If surprised, an African crake will leap {{vertically}} into the air before running away, a tactic believed to help it to evade snakes or terrestrial mammals.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of polyandrous and monogamous pale chanting goshawks Melierax canorus {{was investigated}} {{to determine if}} co-breeders, by defending the territory and nest contents, helped to increase the fitness of polyandrous trios. Polyandrous trios consisted of a female and male breeder, {{as well as a}} subordinate co-breeding male. <b>Pale</b> <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> males performed most of the interspecific territorial maintenance duties, as well as participating in aggressive intraspecific interactions against other males on territory borders. Intraspecific territorial interactions were almost exclusively recorded in high-quality habitat, Karroid Broken Veld, and probably functioned in the defence of foraging habitat and potential mates. In this habitat, males of polyandrous families largely occupied exclusive sections of a territory. It is suggested that the cost of defending territories in Karroid Broken Veld was offset by the co-breeder's contribution to high-risk, intraspecific territorial defence. During the nestling period females of polyandrous trios stayed at nesting sites for longer periods than did monogamous females and all males, enabling these females to guard the nest and act as sentinels. Predation of nestlings was recorded at the nests of monogamous pairs, but not at those of polyandrous trios. Co-breeders did not guard the nesting site but contributed directly to nest defence by either coming to the female's aid when solicited, or attacking potential predators when present at the nesting site. Co-breeders may also have helped indirectly, through activities such as provisioning prey to females that relieved them of their hunting duties. We suggest that the female's nest guarding and the resulting lower nest predation may hold reproductive and fitness benefits for polyandrous breeders...|$|E
50|$|Several {{species such}} as golden nightjar, Sudan golden sparrow, hooded vulture, dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk,</b> {{speckled}} pigeon, African mourning dove, blue-naped mousebird, Kordofan lark, red-chested swallow, chestnut-bellied starling, African swallow-tailed kite, tawny eagle, slender-billed curlew, demoiselle crane, Arabian bustard, ostrich, lappet-faced vulture, helmeted guineafowl are seemingly locally rare or extinct, or rather visitors of vagrants.|$|R
50|$|This species averages 49 to 55 cm long, with a {{wingspan}} of 96 to 110 cm and a {{tail length}} of 20 to 25 cm. Males average 85% {{of the size}} of females. Like the other <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawks,</b> it resembles an accipiter but the tail is shorter and graduated (the feathers increase in length from the edges to the center), and the wings are broader.|$|R
50|$|Adults have grey head, neck, breast, and upperparts, {{except for}} the white or lightly barred uppertail coverts. The belly has narrow grey and white bars and the undertail coverts are white. The belly and wing linings are white, the {{secondaries}} are light grey, and the primaries are dark, giving an impression from below of a white bird with grey head and dark wingtips. The tail is blackish above and white below with grey bars. The cere is yellow, and the legs are orange-red. Juveniles are dull brown above with a pale stripe over the eye. They have white underparts with brown streaks on the throat and breast, brown bars on the belly coverts, and faint or no barring on the undertail coverts. The tail is brown with widely spaced darker brown bars. The rump is white, partially barred or unmarked. They are indistinguishable from some juvenile dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawks</b> {{except for the}} less barred undertail coverts and rump. Also, the legs are slightly longer at all ages than the dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk's.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> preys on a {{wide variety}} of animals, {{especially}} mammals, birds and reptiles; these are normally hunted from a perch, from which the bird swoops to capture prey on the ground or in the air. They have been recorded following honey badgers (Mellivora capensis), Southern ground-hornbills, dogs or people, catching the small animals disturbed by their passage. [...] The largest recorded prey items are helmeted guineafowl Numida meleagris and dwarf mongoose.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} new fossil {{records of}} three diurnal {{birds of prey}} and an owl from four Miocene sites in western Kenya. All four new records are very similar to recent species present today in Kenya and include a vulture (cf. Aegypius monachus), a Goshawk (cf. Accipter tachiro) and a <b>Chanting</b> <b>Goshawk</b> (cf. Melierax metabates/canorus) as well as a small owl (cf. Otus senegalensis). All four new fossil taxa may represent the earliest known records for these genera...|$|R
5000|$|As its {{common name}} {{suggests}} the dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> is a vocal bird, although less so than its two congeners. It often calls from a perch or in flight, making an accelerating series of piping notes and fluty whistles, {{which has been}} described as a song or chant and there are up to a dozen notes in a series [...] “peeu-peeu-pu-pu-pu”. It also gives a high-pitched “peee-u”. During the breeding season it is more vocal than when non breeding.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} 56-65 cm long. The adult has grey upperparts {{with a white}} rump. The central tail {{feathers}} are black tipped with white, and the outer feathers are barred grey and white. The head and upper breast are pale grey; {{the rest of the}} underparts are finely barred in dark grey and white. Its eyes are yellow, the bill is mostly orange, and it has long orange legs. It is paler than the grey-rumped dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk,</b> Melierax metabates.|$|R
5000|$|The dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> is {{a medium}} sized, bulky hawk with an upright stance. The head, breast and upperparts are {{essentially}} dark grey, while the underparts, other then the breast, are white, finely barred with black. The wing primaries are black, and the tail has broad {{black and white}} bars. The cere and the long legs are orange-red. The female is, on average, larger than the male, weighing up to 840g to the male's maximum weight of 700g. Juveniles tend to have browner plumage reminiscent in colour and pattern to a buzzard Buteo spp but with the broad winged, long tailed silhouette of an accipiter.|$|R
50|$|The dark <b>chanting</b> <b>goshawk</b> is a {{territorial}} nester. The courtship {{display is}} performed by both sexes {{during which the}} male repeatedly dives at the female, who presents her claws to him. The nest is constructed in a tree by both sexes and is a flattish platform of sticks, slightly lower in the centre than at the edges and decorated with spider webs and sometimes cemented with mud. It may be lined {{with a wide variety}} of materials, including animal, plant, mineral and man-made objects. The one to two, occasionally three, eggs are laid from July-November, with a peak from August-October, and they are incubated by the female for around 36-38 days, while the male brings food to her at the nest. Initially, the young are brooded and guarded by the female, while the male hunts to provide all the food. The young fledge at about 50 days old, and are fully independent roughly 3-8 months after fledging. They move away from their natal area at the beginning of the following breeding season.|$|R
