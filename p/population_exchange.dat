25|$|The Treaty of Lausanne also {{provided}} for a <b>Population</b> <b>exchange</b> between Greece and Turkey {{that had begun}} before the final signature of the treaty in July 1923. About {{one and a half}} million Greeks had to leave Turkey for Greece and about half a million Turks had to leave Greece for Turkey (note that the <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> was on religious grounds, thus the exchange was officially that of Christians for Muslims). The exceptions to the <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> were Istanbul (Constantinople) and the islands of Gökçeada (Imbros) and Bozcaada (Tenedos), where the Greek minority (including the Ecumenical Patriarch) was allowed to stay, and Western Thrace, whose Muslim minority was also allowed to stay.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{at the end}} of World War II, some 30,000 Hungarians {{left the}} {{formerly}} Hungarian re-annexed territories of southern Slovakia. While Czechoslovakia expelled ethnic Germans, the Allies prevented a unilateral expulsion of Hungarians. They did agree to a forced <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, one which was initially rejected by Hungary. This <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> proceeded by an agreement whereby 55,487, 74,407, 76,604 or 89,660 Hungarians from Slovakia were exchanged for 60,000, 71,787 or 73,200 Slovaks from Hungary (the exact numbers depend on the source.) Slovaks leaving Hungary moved voluntarily, but Czechoslovakia forced Hungarians out of their nation.|$|E

50|$|It {{is useful}} to {{contrast}} the mass migrations and forced expulsion of ethnic Germans out of Eastern Europe with other massive transfers of <b>populations,</b> such as <b>exchange</b> of <b>populations</b> between Greece and Turkey, and <b>population</b> <b>exchanges</b> that occurred after the Partition of India.

25|$|Intense {{communal}} rioting in the Punjab {{forced the}} governments of India and Pakistan {{to agree to a}} forced <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> of Muslim and Hindu/Sikh minorities living in Punjab. After this <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> only a few thousand low-caste Hindus remained in Pakistan's side of Punjab and only a tiny Muslim population remained in the town of Malerkotla in India's part of Punjab. Political scientist Ishtiaq Ahmed says that although Muslims started the violence in Punjab, by the end of 1947 more Muslims had been killed by Hindus and Sikhs in East Punjab than the number of Hindus and Sikhs who had been killed by Muslims in West Punjab.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, {{it became}} part of the Soviet Union (Joseph Stalin's gift to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic) and there was a <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> between Poland and Soviet Ukraine. In 1991, it became the {{independent}} nation of Ukraine.|$|E

25|$|During the Lausanne Conference in 1923, the Turkish and Greek sides {{after some}} discussions {{accepted}} the proposal of a <b>population</b> <b>exchange.</b> Muslims in Greece (save {{the ones in}} Eastern Thrace) were expelled to Turkey, and Greek Orthodox people in Turkey (save the ones in Istanbul) were expelled to Greece.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, a <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> between Greece and Turkey {{resulted}} in a near-complete elimination of the Greek ethnic presence in Turkey and a similar elimination of the Turkish ethnic presence in much of Greece. According to the Greek census of 1928, 1,104,216 Ottoman Greeks had reached Greece. It {{is impossible to know}} exactly how many Greek inhabitants of Turkey died between 1914 and 1923, and how many ethnic Greeks of Anatolia were expelled to Greece or fled to the Soviet Union. Some of the survivors and expelled took refuge in the neighboring Russian Empire (later, Soviet Union). Similar plans for a <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> were negotiated earlier at 1913-1914 between Ottoman and Greek officials during the first stage of the Greek genocide but were interrupted by World War I.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I, Greece fought against Turkish nationalists led by Mustafa Kemal, a war that eventually resulted in a massive <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> {{between the two countries}} under the Treaty of Lausanne.

5000|$|Historically, {{there have}} been sizable Greek and Bulgarian {{communities}} in the territories which form present day Bulgaria and Greece respectively.

25|$|The 1923 <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> between Greece and Turkey {{involved}} {{about two}} million people (around 1.5 million Anatolian Greeks and 500,000 Muslims in Greece) {{most of whom were}} forcibly repatriated and denaturalized from homelands of centuries or millennia (and guaranteed the nationality of the destination country) by a treaty promoted and overseen by the international community as part of the Treaty of Lausanne.|$|E
25|$|The {{percentage}} of Christians in Turkey fell from 19 percent in 1914 to 2.5 percent in 1927, due to events {{which had a}} significant impact on the country's demographic structure, such as the Armenian Genocide, the <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> between Greece and Turkey, and the emigration of Christians to foreign countries (mostly in Europe and the Americas).

25|$|The {{percentage}} of Christians in Turkey fell from 19 percent in 1914 to 2.5 percent in 1927, predominately due to persecution, including the Armenian Genocide, the Greek genocide and subsequent <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> between Greece and Turkey, population exchanges between Bulgaria and Turkey, and associated emigration of Christians to foreign countries (mostly in Europe and the Americas).

5000|$|German populations {{affected}} by the <b>population</b> <b>exchanges</b> were primarily the Baltic Germans and Bessarabia Germans and others who were forced to resettle west of the Curzon Line.

50|$|Sürgün or verb form sürmek (to displace) was a {{practice}} within the Ottoman Empire that entailed {{the movement of}} {{a large group of}} people from one region to another, often a form of forced migration imposed by state policy or international authority. The practice was also a form of banishment or exile often applied to the elites of Ottoman society, the Pashas. It was most famously used as a method of ethnic cleansing in the oft disputed Armenian Genocide perpetrated by the Young Turk government in 1915, {{in order to deal with}} a perceived threat from Armenian nationals receiving military support from the, Ottoman hostile, Russian Empire.The practice was also used to enforce <b>population</b> <b>exchanges</b> such as the Balkan <b>population</b> <b>exchanges</b> in 1913 and the periodic exchanges between the new Republic of Turkey and Greece in 1923.|$|R
25|$|After the <b>population</b> <b>exchange,</b> several Cappadocian dialects {{have been}} {{described}} by collaborators of the Center for Asia Minor Studies (Κέντρον Μικρασιατικών Σπουδών) in Athens: Uluağaç (I.I. Kesisoglou, 1951), Aravan (D. Phosteris & I.I. Kesisoglou, 1960), Axo (G. Mavrochalyvidis & I.I. Kesisoglou, 1960) and Anaku (A.P. Costakis, 1964), resulting {{in a series of}} grammars (although regrettably not all Cappadocian villages were covered). The Pharasiot priest Theodoridis also published some folk texts.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} with Greece {{was confirmed}} by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, which resolved persistent boundary and territorial claims involving areas in Thrace and provided for a <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> (see: War of Independence). Under the agreement, {{most members of the}} sizable Greek-speaking community of western Turkey were forced to resettle in Greece, while the majority of the Turkish-speaking residents of Thrace who were not forced out during the Balkan wars were removed to Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Rebetiko, {{initially}} a music {{associated with}} the lower classes, later (and especially after the <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> between Greece and Turkey) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes {{to the point of}} unrecognizability. It was the base of the later laïkó (song of the people). The leading performers of the genre include Vassilis Tsitsanis, Grigoris Bithikotsis, Stelios Kazantzidis, George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou and Glykeria.|$|E

50|$|Several {{months after}} the Washington Agreement the Croatian {{government}} continued to pursue irredentism. According to a Novi list report, Ivić Pašalić, who was a key adviser to Tuđman and acted on his behalf, led a three-man delegation near Banja Luka to discuss with Karadžić the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the meeting Karadžić proposed territory and <b>population</b> <b>exchanges,</b> something Tuđman was very interested in.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of World War II, Lviv was depolonised, mainly through Soviet-arranged <b>population</b> <b>exchange</b> in 1944–1946 but also by early deportations to Siberia.

During the Soviet decades only two Polish schools continued to function: № 10 (with 8 grades) and № 24 (with 10 grades).|$|E

25|$|As a result, the Greek {{government}} {{accepted the}} demands of the Turkish national movement and returned to its pre-war borders, thus leaving East Thrace and Western Anatolia to Turkey. The Allies abandoned the Treaty of Sèvres to negotiate a new treaty at Lausanne with the Turkish National Movement. The Treaty of Lausanne recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey and its sovereignty over Asia Minor, Constantinople, and Eastern Thrace.
