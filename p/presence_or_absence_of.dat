5|$|In certain regions, <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> certain scales {{may be a}} {{quick way}} to {{distinguish}} non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{environmental}} factors affecting {{the distribution of}} living organisms are temperature, humidity, climate, soil type and light intensity, and the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> all the requirements that the organism needs to sustain it. Generally speaking, animal communities are reliant on specific types of plant communities.|$|E
5|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{classification scheme}} {{has been suggested}} by Ogilvy and Carter to predict outcome and gauge therapy. The system consists of five grades and it assigns one point for the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> each of five factors: age greater than 50; Hunt and Hess grade 4 or 5; Fisher scale 3 or 4; aneurysm size greater than 10 mm; and posterior circulation aneurysm 25 mm or more.|$|E
50|$|Clamp {{connections}} are structures {{unique to the}} phylum Basidiomycota. Many fungi from this phylum produce spores in basidiocarps (fruiting bodies, or mushrooms), above ground. Though clamp {{connections are}} exclusive to this phylum, not all species of Basidiomycota possess these structures. As such, the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> clamp connections has been a tool in categorizing genera and species.|$|R

40|$|Annotators of {{multimodal}} corpora rely on {{a combination}} of audio and video features to assign labels to the events observed. The reliability of annotations may be influenced by the <b>presences</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> certain key features. For practical applications it can be useful to know what circumstances determined fluctuations in the interannotator agreement. In this paper we consider the case of annotations of addressing on the AMI corpus. 1...|$|R
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming with the camera, image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E
5|$|Gene flow {{involves}} {{the exchange of}} genes between populations and between species. The <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due {{to the complexity of}} organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus, but morphological identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> cystidia and morphology of the cystidia {{are the most important}} characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{negation}} in Moroccan Arabic (MA) which is marked with both elements ma- and -š. The first element is obligatory in all contexts, {{the second one}} falls in various contexts. It's shown that MA sentential negation results from the association between the neg(ator) ma- and an undefined q(uantifier). The <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> the element -š {{is related to the}} <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> the [+undefined] feature...|$|R
30|$|In Step 5, {{chemicals}} with {{exposure levels}} exceeding their RVs are identified using the exposure assumptions described below. In an actual risk assessment, these estimates of exposure and the RVs {{would be subject}} to refined chemical-specific risk assessments. However, such efforts require detailed site-specific information on where the samples were collected (e.g., the degree of dilution, environmental fate, the <b>presences</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> environmental receptors, and detailed toxicity data). Such information was not available for the monitoring data and performing such assessments {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper. Therefore, in this paper the exposures to the mixtures that do not pass Step 5 are not analyzed further.|$|R
50|$|In the SMASS classificationthe G-type {{corresponds}} to the Cgh and Cg types, depending on the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> (respectively) <b>of</b> the absorption feature at 0.7 μm. The G-type, C-type and some rare types are sometimes collected together into a wider C-group of carbonaceous asteroids.|$|R
5|$|The ocean can be {{conceptualized}} as being divided into various zones, depending on depth, and <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> sunlight. Nearly all life {{forms in the}} ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.|$|E
5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, there has been great interest in studying the icy moons in detail. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. The Europa Orbiter was a planned NASA mission to Europa, which was canceled in 2002. Its main objectives included determining the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> a subsurface ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter), which was canceled in 2005, and a European Jovian Europa Orbiter mission were also studied, but were superseded by the Europa Jupiter System Mission.|$|E

40|$|Prehensile‐tailed porcupines (Coendou prehensilis), {{like other}} rodents, lack {{external}} sexual traits, {{making it difficult}} to non‐ invasively determine their gender. By exploiting genetic differences between the X and the Y chromosome, we developed a simple genetic test to determine the gender of Coendous from shed quills. We Sanger sequenced a short portion (195 bp) of the zinc finger protein gene of known male (XY) Coendous to identify positions that are polymorphic between the X and Y chromosomes at this locus. By directly sequencing this fragment, we were able to correctly determine (confirmed via anatomical sexing) the gender of male and female Coendous by the <b>presences</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> polymorphisms in the resulting chromatograms. This assay is simple, quick and is applicable to other porcupine species. Zoo Biol. XX:XX–XX...|$|R
5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E
5|$|In 1735 Brandt {{proposed}} {{to make the}} <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> malleability the principle of this classification. On that basis he separated mercury from the metals. The same view was adopted by Vogel (1755, Institutiones Chemiæ) and Buffon (1785, Histoire Naturelle des Minéraux). In the interim, Braun had observed the solidification of mercury by cold in 1759–60. This was confirmed by Hutchins and Cavendish in 1783. The malleability of mercury then became known, and it was included amongst the metals.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} a location in the galaxy as {{being a part of}} the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for. These include the distribution of stars and spiral arms, the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> an active galactic nucleus, the frequency of nearby supernovae that can threaten the existence of life, the metallicity of that location, and other factors. Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency.|$|E

5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus but identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> cystidia and morphology of the cystidia {{are the most important}} characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus. Volvopluteus michiganensis is distinguished from other species of Volvopluteus by its relatively shorter spores, measuring on average less than 12.5µm long.|$|E
5|$|Panpsychism is {{the view}} that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of {{experience}} or point of view. Superficially, {{it seems to be}} a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> complex structure in a compound object. So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly {{the size and shape}} of a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> underlying causes. If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1–2), it indicates that a liver transplant may be required, {{and transfer to a}} specialist centre is advised. Hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{geographic}} variation in size. The main differences are the <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> a whitish partial collar {{at the base of}} the nape, the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|E
