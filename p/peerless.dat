5|$|Ipswich's {{record at}} Portman Road is <b>peerless</b> in European football. For 45 years, Ipswich held {{the record for}} the longest unbeaten run of games at home in European competition. The team's absence from such tournaments in recent years had seen the record {{overtaken}} by AZ Alkmaar, whose home undefeated run was finally broken by Everton in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Five {{companies}} did {{the visual}} effects – Industrial Light & Magic, Double Negative, Moving Picture Company, Cinesite and <b>Peerless</b> – {{under the supervision}} of Steve Begg. The computer-generated effects included set extensions, digital touches on the vehicles, and crumbling buildings. A sixth one, Framestore, handled the title sequence, the seventh in the series designed by Daniel Kleinman. It took four months to complete, and centred on an octopus motif reminiscent of the Spectre logo, along with images of love and relationships.|$|E
5|$|The Norse {{legacy of}} art and {{architecture}} is limited. The Christchurch at Brough of Birsay, now reduced, was the early seat of the Bishop's of Orkney. St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall is <b>peerless</b> {{as an example of}} Norse-era construction in Scotland and St. Magnus Church, on Egilsay retains its round tower. The iconic Lewis chessmen are the best known treasure trove and numerous finds of grave goods including brooches and weaponry such as the Scar boat burial are well-documented.|$|E
5|$|The art {{department}} {{made sure}} that the 2035 underground world would only use pre-1996 technology {{as a means to}} depict the bleakness of the future. Gilliam, Beecroft, and Crispian Sallis (set decorator) went to several flea markets and salvage warehouses looking for materials to decorate the sets. The majority of visual effects sequences were created by <b>Peerless</b> Camera, the London-based effects studio that Gilliam founded in the late 1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston (The Golden Compass, Casino Royale). Additional digital compositing was done by The Mill, while Cinesite provided film scanning services.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush {{rather than}} a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, {{listening}} for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly <b>peerless</b> in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses {{as large as a}} heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{abilities}} as an all-rounder led to enormous success as both batsman and bowler. The ICC player rankings {{have been applied}} retrospectively to cricket history and Miller achieved top ten rankings with both bat and ball. As a batsman, he peaked at ninth {{in the world in}} 1952, and was a top-20 player from shortly after his début {{and for the rest of}} the duration of his career. Miller's bowling abilities led to even greater success. By the end of 1946, he was already ranked sixth in the world and thereafter never slipped lower than ninth; for much of his career, he was the second-best bowler in the world according to the ratings, remarkably, for a 36-year-old, peaking at the number 1 slot for a few months in 1956. As an all-rounder, therefore, it is unsurprising to find that he was <b>peerless</b> for most of his career, ranked as number one in the world for most of his career, including an unbroken eight-year run from June 1948 until his retirement.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{references to}} Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There {{have been few}} attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, {{rather than in a}} single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The first is that he was a <b>peerless</b> warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.|$|E
25|$|The final Corvette GTP built (HU8811.01) as raced by <b>Peerless</b> Racing {{underwent}} extensive {{wind tunnel}} testing by GM, {{with many of}} the 'aero' developments (such as the short tail design) being used in later production C4's. The <b>Peerless</b> GTP Corvette also went back to the V-8 small block engine from the turbo V-6. This final GTP Corvette (<b>Peerless)</b> was driven by Hobbs, Baldwin, Villeneuve & Goodyear in IMSA before having the BBC based Eagle (10.2) engine installed to take to Le Mans in 1990.|$|E

25|$|During the 1930s, {{automobile}} {{production by}} the Big Three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) increased, {{while all the}} other domestic automakers were damaged and saw their total market share drop from 25% in 1929 to 10% by 1939. {{with many of the}} premium-type brands disappearing, such as Cord, Durant, Franklin, <b>Peerless,</b> Pierce-Arrow, and Stutz.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Süntel {{is portrayed}} in the annals as a victory, {{as opposed to a}} {{crushing}} Frankish defeat {{at the hands of the}} Saxons. The 792 conspiracy of Pepin the Hunchback against Charlemagne is also omitted, along with any reference to potential misconduct on Charlemagne’s part. The revised text, however, incorporates these events while maintaining a positive tone towards the emperor, presented as a <b>peerless</b> leader in battle.|$|E
25|$|Rostam's {{mother was}} Rudaba, {{the princess of}} Kabul, who was known for her <b>peerless</b> beauty, and Rostam's father was Zal. Zal was one of Persia's most {{powerful}} warriors and a great general who conquered many rebellious tribes and ruled over Zabulistan. Zal {{was known for his}} wisdom and was unparalleled in riding and fighting on horseback. He once demonstrated his skills to Emperor Menuchihr, to seek his approval to marry his lover Rudaba.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{the walls}} of Incan {{buildings}} were slightly inclined inside and the corners were rounded. This, in combination with masonry thoroughness, led Incan buildings to have a <b>peerless</b> seismic resistance thanks to high static and dynamic steadiness, absence of resonant frequencies and stress concentration points. During an earthquake with a small or moderate magnitude, masonry was stable, and during a strong earthquake stone blocks were “ dancing ” near their normal positions and lay down exactly in right order after an earthquake.|$|E
25|$|During the 1961–1962 school year, Special Collections {{moved back}} to BYU campus; it was housed in the J. Rueben Clark library. Hansen played an {{integral}} role in transporting both archival materials and other papers to their new homes. By this time the collection contained the Arthur V. Watkins Papers, James E. Talmage papers, <b>Peerless</b> Coal Co. records, Bamberger Railway Records, Herald R. Clark papers, L. John Nuttall papers, and Jesse Knight Investment Company records. Hansen left BYU in 1962 {{and was replaced by}} Roach. Roach remained enthusiastic about manuscript collecting, but left the university after about a year; Hollis Scott was then appointed the university archivist.|$|E
25|$|Hinchliffe's <b>peerless</b> {{reputation}} {{made him}} the natural choice for pilot when Elsie Mackay attempted to achieve her ambition {{to be the first}} woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. The daughter of P & O chairman James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape had bought a Stinson Detroiter, and had it shipped from the USA to England and delivered to the Brooklands motor racing track, which at the time was also used as an airfield. Named Endeavour, it was a monoplane with gold tipped wings and a black fuselage, powered by a 9 cylinder, 300 h.p. Wright Whirlwind J-6-9 (R-975) engine, with a cruising speed of 84mph.|$|E
25|$|During the campaign, {{she wrote}} a letter to her family {{explaining}} her disappearance. They used their connections {{in a desperate attempt to}} locate her. The rumor of an amazon in the army reached Tsar Alexander I, who took a personal interest. Durova's chain of command reported that her courage was <b>peerless.</b> Summoned to the palace at St. Petersburg, she impressed the Tsar so much that he awarded her the Cross of St. George and promoted her to lieutenant in a hussar unit (Mariupol Hussar Regiment). The story that there was the heroine in the army with the name Alexander Sokolov had become well known by that time. So the Tsar awarded her a new pseudonym, Alexandrov, based on his own name.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being a <b>peerless</b> match player, Go Seigen has also made great contributions to go theory, especially in the area of fuseki. He is well known, along with Kitani Minoru, as one of the two leading exponents and innovators of the shinfuseki, a period of revolutionary experimentation in the opening of the game that broke away from traditional moves. Go attributed some of his ideas to Honinbo Shuei, for whom he had much respect. As a result of their substantial contributions to go theory, Go Seigen and Kitani Minoru are regarded as the founders of modern go. He was inventor of the notable and revolutionary uchimagari (inward bending) avalanche joseki variation. It was first played during a match against Takagawa Kaku in 1957.|$|E
25|$|In essence the Australian batting {{revolved}} around Ian and Greg Chappell {{and the new}} stability of Doug Walters. The Chappell combination was probably the strongest fraternal Test-match pair since {{the era of the}} Graces. In the First Test against New Zealand in Wellington in March 1974, they struck new coinage in cricket records by both scoring centuries in each innings. Greg's unbeaten 247 stamped him as probably one of {{the best players in the}} world; correct, upright and unrelenting. But brother Ian, with pugnacity and shuffling, hooking savagery, was virtually his equal in scoring terms. Walters also proved that he could now be ranked with the greats by scoring a <b>peerless,</b> unbeaten 104 in the levelling Third Test at Auckland, when all climatic and wicket conditions favoured the medium-pace of the Hadlees and Collinge.|$|E
25|$|Film-making began {{attracting}} both {{capital and}} an innovative workforce, {{and when the}} Kalem Company began using Fort Lee in 1907 {{as a location for}} filming in the area, other filmmakers quickly followed. In 1909, a forerunner of Universal Studios, the , built the first studio. They were quickly followed by others who either built new studios or who leased facilities in Fort Lee. In the 1910s and 1920s, film companies such as the Independent Moving Pictures Company, <b>Peerless</b> Studios, The Solax Company, Éclair Studios, Goldwyn Picture Corporation, American Méliès (Star Films), World Film Company, Biograph Studios, Fox Film Corporation, Pathé Frères, Metro Pictures Corporation, Victor Film Company, and Selznick Pictures Corporation were all making pictures in Fort Lee. Such notables as Mary Pickford got their start at Biograph Studios.|$|E
25|$|Late in {{the fourth}} quarter, Titans {{receiver}} Isaac Byrd's 16-yard punt return to the Bills 45 and five carries from Eddie George for 17 yards set up a 36-yard field goal by Del Greco, giving Tennessee a 15–13 lead with 1:38 left. But following a 33-yard kickoff return by Williams, the Bills retook the lead with a 41-yard field goal from Steve Christie {{at the end of}} a 38-yard drive that saw Johnson lose a shoe. Stuck in the no-huddle offense in order to beat the clock, Johnson was forced to play without a shoe for most of the drive, but still managed to lead the team into scoring range with two key completions to <b>Peerless</b> Price for 23 yards. Christie's field goal gave the Bills a 16–15 lead with only 16 seconds left in the game.|$|E
25|$|The fell is very rugged {{with several}} small tops along {{the summit of}} the ridge. At the {{northern}} end is a peaked summit at 1,971ft (601m), very prominent from the valley below. Alfred Wainwright took this as {{the summit of the}} fell in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, even though he readily acknowledged that it wasn't the highest point. This is one of many subjective decisions which differentiate Wainwrights from more modern (and logical) hill lists such as Nuttalls and Hewitts. Wainwright stated that the 1,971ft top was generally regarded as the summit of the fell, although he cited no references. Other guidebooks have taken Wainwright's lead, Mark Richards stating Stand upon that (northern) pike and you know why tradition has ordained this to be the summit. The view down Borrowdale is <b>peerless.</b> A new generation of fellwalkers may arrive seeking to overthrow the traditional perception and feeling no compunction at adopting the highest ground as a summit. Richards does at least acknowledge the highest point as a top, as does Birkett, who gives equal status to both.|$|E

500|$|<b>Peerless</b> Industries {{moved to}} Aurora and {{established}} a [...] facility. <b>Peerless</b> Industries {{is one of the}} largest US-based manufacturers of audio-visual mounting solutions. They have operations in China, Mexico, and two facilities in Melrose Park, IL. [...] Through the utilization of a TIF district, the popular Ballydoyle Irish Restaurant and Pub was able to open a second location within the city. In addition, the previous year, the creation of the Illinois Tollway interchange at Eola Road on Interstate 88 created another avenue of access to Aurora for Chicago-based commerce. [...] The tollway is expected to bring an increased retail and restaurant presence to the city. [...] This has been realized with the introduction of a Chick-Fil-a, Golden Corral, Chipolte, and a Von Maur Dry Goods. In 2009, 425 new jobs were added to the city with the introduction of the North American headquarters of Freudenberg Household Products.|$|E

So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them." ...|$|E
500|$|Post-production was {{severely}} delayed when Gilliam {{disagreed with the}} Weinsteins over the final cut privilege. In the meantime, the conflict lasted so long that Gilliam {{had enough time to}} shoot another feature film, Tideland. To create the visual effects, Gilliam awarded the shots to <b>Peerless</b> Camera, the London-based effects studio he founded in the late-1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston. However, two months into filming, Houston said that <b>Peerless</b> [...] "ran into a number of major issues with The Brothers Grimm and with the Weinstein Brothers". He continued that [...] "the main problem {{was the fact that the}} number of effects shots had dramatically increased, mainly because of issues that arose during shooting with the physical effects." [...] Meanwhile, the Queen's chamber inside the tower was actually built by the Art Department as 2 sets. One set was resplendent and new while the other was old and decrepit. The sets were joined to each other by the central mirror, a piece of transparent glass giving the illusion that a single set was reflected and used to create the effect.|$|E
500|$|For {{over thirty}} years Windon was Australia's leading Test try-scorer with 11, until his record was {{overtaken}} by winger Brendan Moon in the 1980s. Upon his induction Australian Rugby Union President Paul McLean referred to Windon as [...] "an electrifying talent and a try scoring machine". His 1947 Wallaby tour teammate Sir Nicholas Shehadie described him as follows: [...] "As back-row forwards go, he was the very best. A try-scoring machine, a superb attacker and {{with the speed of}} a three-quarter, the man they nicknamed 'Breeze' was simply <b>peerless</b> in supporting play".|$|E
500|$|Richardson thought himself temperamentally unsuited to {{the great}} tragic roles, and most reviewers agreed, but to critics of several generations he was <b>peerless</b> in classic comedies. Kenneth Tynan judged any Falstaff against Richardson's, which he {{considered}} [...] "matchless", and Gielgud judged [...] "definitive". Richardson, though hardly ever satisfied with his own performances, evidently believed he had done well as Falstaff. Hall and others tried hard {{to get him to}} play the part again, but referring to it he said, [...] "Those things I've done in which I've succeeded a little bit, I'd hate to do again." ...|$|E
