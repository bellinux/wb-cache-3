5|$|In the 2005 {{session of}} the General Assembly, Daniels and Republicans, with some Democratic support, {{successfully}} enacted a voter registration law that required voters to show a government issued <b>photo</b> <b>ID</b> before they could be permitted to vote. The law {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States, and many civil rights organizations, like the ACLU, opposed the bill saying it would unfairly impact minorities, poor, and elderly voters who may be unable to afford an ID or may be physically unable to apply for an ID. To partially address those concerns, the state passed another law authorizing state license branches to offer free state <b>photo</b> <b>ID</b> cards to individuals who did not already possess another type of state ID.|$|E

Government-issued <b>photo</b> <b>ID</b> is usually required.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{devoted a}} large amount of secrecy for Batman Returns. The art {{department}} was required to keep their office blinds pulled down. Cast and crew had to have <b>photo</b> <b>ID</b> badges with the movie's fake working title Dictel to go anywhere near the sets. Kevin Costner was refused a chance to visit the set. An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin; in response Warner Bros. employed a private investigator to track down the accomplice. $65 million was spent during the production of Batman Returns, while $15 million was used for marketing, coming to a total cost of $80 million. The final shot of Catwoman looking at the Bat-Signal was completed during post-production and {{was not part of the}} shooting script. After Batman Returns was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive, saving more characterizations in a future installment. Pfeiffer was unavailable and a body double was chosen.|$|E

50|$|Sarah Elgazzar, an {{advocate}} for the Canadian Council on American-Islamic Relations in Montreal, declared that it is improbable that very many Muslim women will have hidden faces when voting. Elgazzar insisted that women using niqabs usually take them off to distinguish themselves and do not sport them for <b>photo</b> <b>IDs.</b> This fact was echoed by Salam Elmenyawi of the Muslim Council of Montreal.|$|R
50|$|Requiring {{scrap metal}} buyers {{to record the}} <b>photo</b> <b>IDs</b> of scrap metal sellers, and record scrap metal {{transactions}} may reduce the rate of metal theft. Paying scrap metal sellers by check rather than cash may reduce the rate of metal theft.

50|$|Proponents {{of voter}} ID laws {{argue that they}} reduce electoral fraud while placing only little burden on voters. Opponents argue that electoral fraud is {{extremely}} rare in the United States and has been magnified as an issue to create barriers to voter registration, and that requiring voter ID in effect discriminates against minority groups {{and those who are}} less likely to possess <b>photo</b> <b>IDs.</b> Critics have argued that the barriers could result in the disenfranchisement of black, Hispanic and other minority voters.|$|R
50|$|Grimes faced Republican {{businessman}} and former Senate candidate Bill Johnson {{in the general}} election. A main aspect of the campaign was Grimes's opposition to Johnson's proposal to require <b>photo</b> <b>IDs</b> in order to vote. Grimes argued this would take away voting rights from the homeless among others. She also became well known through commercials that showed her elderly grandmothers. Grimes defeated Johnson with over 60% of the vote. She received {{a higher percentage of}} the vote than any other Kentucky statewide Democratic candidate during the 2011 elections.|$|R

At the same time, it was a pioneer in banking services; it was the first bank in Arizona to issue a credit card in 1965 and the pioneer of direct deposits for Social Security in 1973, a program that was taken nationwide two years later. It also was early with drive-in banking branches and in issuing <b>photo</b> <b>IDs</b> to customers.|$|R

25|$|Most {{transport}} operators permit {{passengers to}} travel within the Common Travel Area without a passport, although Ryanair require all passengers {{to carry a}} passport or a national identity card. In 2014 a private member's bill was put before the Irish parliament which proposed to prohibit transport operators from requiring {{the production of a}} passport for travel within the Common Travel Area, but it was not passed. <b>Photo</b> <b>ID</b> is required for Irish or British citizens travelling by air at the minimum. The Irish government in October 2015, started issuing passport cards and are the same size as national identity cards from other EU countries, which are accepted by all transport operators but the issuing of a passport card requires the holder to already have a conventional passport book.|$|E
25|$|Homeless {{people often}} find it {{difficult}} to document their date of birth or their address. Because homeless people usually have no place to store possessions, they often lose their belongings, including their identification and other documents, or find them destroyed by police or others. Without a <b>photo</b> <b>ID,</b> homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services, including health care and clinic access. They can be denied access to even the most basic assistance: clothing closets, food pantries, certain public benefits, and in some cases, emergency shelters. Obtaining replacement identification is difficult. Without an address, birth certificates cannot be mailed. Fees may be cost-prohibitive for impoverished persons. And some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification, creating a Catch-22. This problem is far less acute in countries which provide free-at-use health care, such as the UK, where hospitals are open-access day and night and make no charges for treatment. In the US, free-care clinics, for homeless and other people, do exist in major cities, but they often attract more demand than they can meet.|$|E
25|$|The niqāb {{became an}} issue in the 2007 {{election}} in Quebec after it became public knowledge that women wearing the niqāb were allowed to vote under the same rules as electors who did not present photo identification (ID); namely, by sworn oath {{in the presence of a}} third party who could vouch for their identity. The chief electoral officer received complaints that this policy was too accommodating of cultural minorities (a major theme in the election) and thereafter required accompaniment by bodyguards due to threatening telephone calls. All three major Quebec political parties were against the policy, with the Parti Québécois and Action démocratique du Québec vying for position as most opposed. The policy was soon changed to require all voters to show their face, even if they did not carry <b>photo</b> <b>ID.</b> However, Quebec residents who wear the niqāb stated they were not opposed to showing their faces for official purposes, such as voting. Salam Elmenyawi of the Muslim Council of Montreal estimated that only 10 to 15 Muslim voters in the province wear the niqāb and, since their veils have become controversial, most would probably not vote.|$|E

50|$|Public {{opinion polls}} have shown support for voter ID laws among {{voters in the}} United States. A 2011 Rasmussen poll found that 75% of likely voters “believe voters should be {{required}} to show photo identification, such as a driver’s license, before being allowed to vote.” A Pew poll showed that 95% of Republicans, 83% of independent voters, and 61% of Democrats favor requirements that voters should show <b>photo</b> <b>IDs</b> to vote. A 2012 Fox News poll produced similar results, revealing that 87% of Republicans, 74% of independent voters, and 52% of Democrats supported new voter ID laws.|$|R
40|$|The {{results provide}} some {{evidence}} of vote fraud and that regulations that prevent fraud can actually increase the voter participation rate. It {{is hard to see}} any evidence that voting regulations differentially harm either minorities, the elderly, or the poor. While this study examines a broad range of voting regulations, it is still too early to evaluate any possible impact of mandatory <b>photo</b> <b>IDs</b> on U. S. elections. What can be said is that the non-photo ID regulations that are already in place have not had the negative impacts that opponents predicted. The evidence provided here also found that campaign finance regulations generally reduced voter turnout...|$|R
