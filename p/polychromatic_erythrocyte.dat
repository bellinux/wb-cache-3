50|$|The in vivo test {{normally}} uses mouse {{bone marrow}} or mouse peripheral blood. When {{a bone marrow}} erythroblast develops into a <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte,</b> the main nucleus is extruded; any micronucleus that has been formed may remain behind in the otherwise anucleated cytoplasm. Visualisation of micronuclei is facilitated in these cells because they lack a main nucleus. An increase {{in the frequency of}} micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in treated animals is an indication of induced chromosome damage.Micronuclei were first used to quantify chromosomal damage by H.J. Evans et al., in root tips of the Broad Bean, Vicia faba. Subsequently the in vivo assay was developed independently by W. Schmid and by J.A. Heddle and their colleagues. The mouse peripheral blood assay was developed by J.T. MacGregor and has now been adapted for measurement by flow cytometry by A. Tometsko and colleagues. The first use of micronuclei in cultured cells was by J.A. Heddle and colleagues in human lymphocytes. The assay has been improved by M. Fenech and colleagues for use in lymphocytes and other cells in culture cells.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{intend to}} study the {{inhibitory}} effect of sulfur compound in Ramsar hot spring mineral on tumor-genesis ability of high natural background radiation. Objective: The radioprotective effect of sulfur compounds was previously shown on radiation-induced chromosomal aberration, micronuclei in mouse bone marrow cells and human peripheral lymphocyte. Ramsar is known for having {{the highest level of}} natural background radiation on Earth. This study was performed to show the radioprotective effect of sulfur-containing Ramsar mineral water on mouse bone marrow cells. Method: Mice were fed three types of water (drinking water, Ramsar radioactive water containing sulfur and Ramsar radioactive water whose sulfur was removed). Ten days after feeding, mice were irradiated by gamma rays (0, 2 and 4 Gy). 48 and 72 hours after irradiating, mice were killed and femurs were removed. Frequency of micronuclei was determined in bone marrow erythrocytes. Results: A significant reduction was shown in the rate of micronuclei <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> in sulfur-containing hot spring water compared to sulfur-free water in hot spring mineral water. Gamma irradiation induced significant increases in micronuclei <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> (MNPCE) and decreases in polychromatic erythrocyte/polychromatic erythrocyte + normochromatic erythrocyte ratio (PCEs/ PCEs+NCEs) (P < 0. 001) in sulfur-containing hot spring water compared to sulfur-free hot spring mineral water. Also, apparently {{there was a significant difference}} between drinking water and sulfur-containing hot spring water in micronuclei <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> and polychromatic erythrocyte/polychromatic erythrocyte+ normochromatic erythrocyte ratio.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Methotrexate, a folate antagonist, is a {{mainstay}} treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It is also {{widely used in}} a low dose formulation to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In rats, methotrexate is known to induce micronuclei formation, leading to genetic damage, while vitamin A is known to protect against such methotrexate-induced genetic damage. Leucovorin (folinic acid) is generally administered with methotrexate to decrease methotrexate-induced toxicity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether vitamin A and leucovorin differed in their capacity to prevent formation of methotrexate-induced micronuclei in rat bone marrow erythrocytes. The present study also aimed to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with vitamin A and leucovorin on the formation of methotrexate-induced micronuclei. METHODS: Male and female Wistar rats (n= 8) were injected with 20 mg/kg methotrexate (single i. p. dose). The control group received an equal volume of distilled water. The third and fourth groups of rats received vitamin A (5000 IU daily dose for 4 successive days) and leucovorin (0. 5 mg/kg i. p. dose for 4 successive days), respectively. The fifth and sixth groups of rats received a combination of vitamin A and a single dose of methotrexate and a combination of leucovorin and methotrexate, respectively. The last group of rats received a combination of leucovorin, vitamin A and single dose of methotrexate. Samples were collected at 24 hours after the last dose of the treatment into 5 % bovine albumin. Smears were obtained and stained with May-Grunwald and Giemsa. One thousand polychromatic erythrocytes were counted per animal {{for the presence of}} micronuclei and the percentage of <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> was determined. RESULTS: Comparison of methotrexate-treated rats with the control group showed {{a significant increase in the}} percentage of cells with micronuclei and a significant decrease <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> percentage. Combined methotrexate and vitamin A therapy and combined methotrexate and leucovorin therapy led to significant decreases in the micronuclei percentage and an increase in <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> percentage when compared to rats treated with methotrexate alone. Leucovorin was found to be more effective than vitamin A against the formation of methotrexate-induced micronuclei.

Methods: Arbutin (50, 100, and 200  mg/kg) was intraperitoneally (ip) administered to NMRI mice two hours before gamma radiation at 2 and 4 gray (Gy). The frequency of micronuclei in 1000 PCEs (MnPCEs) and the ratio of PCE/PCE+NCE were calculated for each sample. Data were statistically evaluated using one-way ANOVA,Tukey HSD test, and t-test. Results: The findings indicated that gamma radiation at 2 and 4  Gy extremely increased the frequencies of MnPCE (P< 0. 001) while reducing PCE/PCE+NCE (P< 0. 001) compared to the control group. All three doses of arbutin before irradiation significantly reduced the frequencies of MnPCEs and increased the ratio of PCE/PCE+NCE in mice bone marrow compared to the non-drug-treated irradiated control (P< 0. 001).

In this study, we employed dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) -treated mice {{to reveal the}} molecular mechanism of inflammation and its correlation with oxidative stress in PCOS patients. Methods: miR- 21 and miR- 146 a expression levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). DNA strand breakage frequency was measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay (comet assay) and micronucleus test (MN). CRP levels were measured by ELISA method and ESR values were measured by means of Micro-Dispette (Fisher No: 02 - 675 - 256) tubes according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA in SPSS 21. 0 software. Results: Our results showed that miR- 21 and miR- 146 a as inflammation markers were up-regulated in the sample group in comparison with control group. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C- reactive protein (CRP) levels were also increased in mouse models of PCOS (p <  0. 000). Micronucleated <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> (MNPCE) rates per 1000 <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> (PCE) significantly increased in DHEA treated mice (6. 22  ±  3. 28) {{in comparison with the}} controls (2. 33 ± 2. 23, p <  0. 000).

The extract was administered by an oral route at single doses of 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg/kg body weight. N-nitroso-N-ethylurea was used as a positive control. The comet assay was performed on peripheral blood leukocytes at 4 and 24 h after treatment, and the micronucleus test was carried out on bone marrow cells collected at 24 and 48 h after treatment. The ratio of polychromatic/normochromatic erythrocytes was scored for cytotoxicity assessment. No {{increase in the number of}} micronucleated <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> from bone marrow or in leukocyte DNA damage was observed. The hydro-alcoholic extracts of A. occidentalis had no mutagenic or cytotoxic effects in the mouse cells...|$|R
40|$|Chromosomal {{mutation}} and oxidative DNA damage {{have been}} associated with some arsenic linked human diseases. This study investigated the effects of T. occidentalis on the formation of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in laboratory mice. The mice were treated with or without sodium arsenite and/or T. occidentalis and the effects were assessed in the bone marrow of mice using micronucleus assay. In addition, the effects on the activity of gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and certain heamatological parameters were also evaluated. Certain vitamins were extracted by chemical methods and their presence was detected using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the leaf extract of T. occidentalis. The mice treated with sodium arsenite alone and those administered with sodium arsenite and T. occidentalis had micronucleated <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> (mPCEs) counts of 21. 00 ± 2. 00 and 12. 67 ± 2. 67 respectively. The ALP and GGT concentrations of the mice treated with T. occidentalis and sodium arsenite shows about two times decrease than those treated with sodium arsenite alone. Treatment of mice with sodium arsenite and/or T. occidentalis revealed varying degree of deviations in the mice haematologica...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the ability of}} Punica granatum ethanolic leaf extract (PGL) and Punica granatum ethanolic fruit extract (PGF) to induce {{mutagenicity}} or to modulate the genotoxic effects induced by the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CP) was evaluated. Swiss male mice were treated by gavage for 10 days with PGL or PGF (12. 5, 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg/day) prior to exposure to CP (i. p. 200 mg/kg), 24 h {{after the end of}} the treatment. Initial observations revealed that normal mice treated with both extracts (12. 5, 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg/day) showed a similar micronucleated <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> (MNPCE) frequency to that of the control group. Investigation of the protective effect of PGL and PGF based on data analysis revealed that, irrespective of dose or extract, oral administration of PGL or PGF for 10 days prior to exposure had reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the frequency of MNPCE induced by CP in all groups studied. Higher reductions were observed at PGF doses of 50 and 75 mg/kg. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mice treated with P. granatum showed an absence of mutagenic effects and dose-dependent protective effects against CP-induced oxidative DNA damage...|$|E

The in vivo micronucleus assay {{was used to}} examine the anticlastogenic effects of crude extracts of Bridelia ferruginea, Vernonia amygdalina, Tridax procumbens, Ocimum gratissimum, and Lawsonia inermis in Wistar albino rats. Extracts of doses of 100 mg/kg body weight were given to rats in five groups for seven consecutive days followed by a single dose of 2 -AAF (0. 5 mmol/kg body weight). The rats were sacrificed after 24 hours and their bone marrow smears were prepared on glass slides stained with Giemsa. The micronucleated <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocyte</b> cells (mPCEs) were thereafter recorded. The hepatoprotective effects of the plant extracts against 2 -AAF-induced liver toxicity in rats were evaluated bymonitoring the levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and histopathological analysis. The results of the 2 -AAF-induced liver toxicity experiments showed that rats treated with the plant extracts (100 mg/kg) showed a significant decrease in mPCEs as compared with the positive control. The rats treated with the plant extracts did not show any significant change in the concentration of ALP and GGT in comparison with the negative control group whereas the 2 -AAF group showed a significant increase...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antitumour activities and genotoxic effects of isoliquiritigenin (ISL) combined with cyclophosphamide (CP) in vitro and in vivo. U 14 cells were treated with either of ISL (5 – 25 μg/mL) or CP (0. 25 – 1. 25 mg/mL) alone or with combination of ISL (5 – 25 μg/mL) and CP (1. 0 mg/mL) for 48 h. The proliferation inhibitory effect in vitro was evaluated by MTT and colony formation assays. KM mice bearing U 14 mouse cervical cancer cells were used to estimate the antitumour activity in vivo. The genotoxic activity in bone marrow <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> was assayed by frequency of micronuclei. The DNA damage in peripheral white blood cells was assayed by single cell gel electrophoresis. The results showed that ISL enhanced antitumour activity of CP in vitro and in vivo, and decreased the micronucleus formation in <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> and DNA strand breaks in white blood cells in a dose-dependent way...|$|R

40|$|Background: The main {{objective}} was to evaluate the possible protective effect of Chuquiraga spinosa extract on N-methyl nitrosourea (NMU) -induced prostate cancer in rats and DU- 145 cell line. Materials and methods: Prostate carcinogenesis was induced in 30 male Holtzman rats by providing cyproterone acetate, testosterone, and NMU. The tumors were monitored and hematological and biochemical parameters and frequency of micronucleated <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> were recorded. The cell line was assessed by a cytotoxicity assay. Results: Oral administration of C.  spinosa extract significantly lowered superoxide dismutase malondialdehyde, NO, C-reactive protein, and prostate-specific antigen levels (all P <  0. 01 compared with Inductor Group). There was {{a significant decrease in}} the frequency of micronucleated <b>polychromatic</b> <b>erythrocytes</b> (P <  0. 05). C.  spinosa presented a selectivity index of 17. 24 in the cytotoxicity assay. Conclusions: Considering its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antigenotoxic effects, and important variations on biochemical and hematological parameters, including prostate-specific antigen of C.  spinosa extract, we conclude that it has a protective effect on NMU-induced prostate cancer in rats and cytotoxicity in the DU- 145 cell line...|$|R
