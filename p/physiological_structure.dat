5|$|The {{external}} morphology of Lepidoptera is the <b>physiological</b> <b>structure</b> of {{the bodies}} of insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera, also known as butterflies and moths. Lepidoptera are distinguished from other orders {{by the presence of}} scales on the external parts of the body and appendages, especially the wings. Butterflies and moths vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimetres long, to a wingspan of many inches such as the Atlas moth. Comprising over 160,000 described species, the Lepidoptera possess variations of the basic body structure which has evolved to gain advantages in adaptation and distribution.|$|E

2500|$|Chang's {{body of work}} in {{mammalian}} fertilisation is {{vast and}} appears in nearly 350 publications. [...] One of his major discoveries was the effect of lowering temperature on sperm. [...] Chang found that at a temperature of 13°C or lower, the membrane structure and function of sperm would disintegrate, thus destroying the fertilising capacity of the sperm. [...] This phenomenon is now commonly known as cold shock. [...] Yet another of Chang's major discoveries was his observation {{on the relationship between}} the number of available sperm and the effective fertilisation of ova by the sperm. [...] It was believed that the fertilisation of the egg was dependent on there being {{a very large number of}} available sperm in the fertilisation process. [...] Chang found that it was actually the <b>physiological</b> <b>structure</b> of the individual sperm that affected the actual fertilisation of the egg, and that having a large number of sperm was not necessary. [...] He then posited that the purpose of having a large number of sperm in the fertilisation process was to allow for greater genetic recombination, in that only the strongest sperm would reach the site of fertilisation through the female reproductive tract. [...] The process of capacitation, the maturation period of sperm that is required in order for them to be able to fertilise ova, was also amongst one of Chang's major discoveries. [...] This observation would lead him further to find that capacitated sperm would lose capacitation if exposed to seminal plasma or blood serum, and that recapacitation could be achieved if the sperm was placed back in the uterus or the fallopian tubes.|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} prove {{conclusively}} that mnemic phenomena arise whenever certain physiological conditions are fulfilled, {{we ought to}} be able actually to see differences between the brain of a man who speaks English and that of a man who speaks French, between the brain of a man who has seen New York and can recall it, and that of a man who has never seen that city. It may be that the time will come when this will be possible, but at present we are very far removed from it. At present, there is, so far as I am aware, no good evidence that every difference between the knowledge possessed by A and that possessed by B is paralleled by some difference in their brains. We may believe that this is the case, but if we do, our belief is based upon analogies and general scientific maxims, not upon any foundation of detailed observation. I am myself inclined, as a working hypothesis, to adopt the belief in question, and to hold that past experience only affects present behaviour through modifications of <b>physiological</b> <b>structure.</b> But the evidence seems not quite conclusive, so that I do not think we ought to forget the other hypothesis, or to reject entirely the possibility that mnemic causation may be the ultimate explanation of mnemic phenomena. I say this, not because I think it LIKELY that mnemic causation is ultimate, but merely because I think it POSSIBLE, and because it often turns out important to the progress of science to remember hypotheses which have previously seemed improbable.|$|E

5000|$|The Articulata {{hypothesis}} originates {{from the}} phylogenetic analyses of Georges Cuvier in his 1817 published work Le Règne animal, distribué après son organization.

By studying these <b>physiological</b> <b>structures,</b> Cuvier was able to group the known animal kingdom according to structural similarities resulting from what he referred to as special [...] "ground-plans", which are analogous to blueprints. Each of these ground-plans, he further argued, evolved separately from the others and structural similarities were due to common function and not to common ancestry. From these ground-plans, Cuvier separated the known animal kingdom into four branches or : Vertebrata, Articulata, Mollusca and Radiata. From this phylogenetic grouping, the Articulata hypothesis was born.|$|R

The frequent inter- and intracellular structures suggest that DSE gain nutrition {{from the plant}} host.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of a neuromusculoskeletal system results from the complex mechanical interaction between muscle visco-elasticity resulting from (co-) contraction and afferent feedback from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. As {{a result of the}} multiple interactions the individual effect of each of the structures to the overall dynamics is hard to recognize, if not impossible. Here a neuromuscular control (NMC) model is developed to analyze the functional contribution of the various <b>physiological</b> <b>structures</b> on the mechanical {{behavior of}} a limb. The dynamics of a joint are presented in admittances, i. e. the dynamic relation between input force (or torque) and the output displacement, which can be represented by either frequency or impulse response functions. With the model it can be shown that afferent feedback reduces, while muscle visco-elasticity increases, the stability margins. This implicates that there is a delicate balance between muscle co-contraction and afferent feedback, which depends on the joint specific physiological properties. The main application of the model is educational; it is implemented in a graphical user interface allowing users to explore the role of the various <b>physiological</b> <b>structures</b> on joint dynamics. Other applications of the model are more experimental, e. g. to elucidate experimentally measured admittances and to compare the quantified parameter values with the theoretically optimal ones. It is concluded that the NMC model is a useful and intuitive tool to investigate human motor control, in a theoretical as well as an experimental way...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the computational modelling and simulation of <b>physiological</b> <b>structures</b> and cognitive functions of brains through the use of artificial neural nets. While the structures of these models are loosely related to neurons and <b>physiological</b> <b>structures</b> observed in brains, the extent to which we can accept claims about how neurons and brains really function based on such models depends largely on judgments about the fitness of (virtual) computer experiments as empirical evidence. The thesis examines the computational foundations of neural models, neural nets, and some computational models of higher cognitive functions in terms of their ability to provide empirical support for theories within the framework of Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP). Models of higher cognitive functions in this framework are often presented in forms that hybridise top-down (e. g. employing terminology from Psychology or Linguistics) and bottom-up (neurons and neural circuits) approaches to cognition. In this thesis I argue that the use of terminology from either approach can blind us to the highly theory-laden nature of the models, and that this tends to produce overly optimistic evaluations of the empirical value of computer experiments on these models. I argue, further, that some classes of computational models and simulations based on methodologies that hybridise top-down and bottom-up approaches are ill-designed. Consequently, many of the theoretical claims based on these models cannot be supported by experiments with such models. As a result, I question the effectiveness of computer experiments with artificial neural nets as an empirical technique for cognitive modelling...|$|R

50|$|Some cryoprotectants {{function}} {{by lowering}} the glass transition temperature of a solution or of a material. In this way, the cryoprotectant prevents actual freezing, and the solution maintains some flexibility in a glassy phase. Many cryoprotectants also function by forming hydrogen bonds with biological molecules as water molecules are displaced. Hydrogen bonding in aqueous solutions is important for proper protein and DNA function. Thus, as the cryoprotectant replaces the water molecules, the biological material retains its native <b>physiological</b> <b>structure</b> and function, although {{they are no longer}} immersed in an aqueous environment.

50|$|The Purple Island, or the Isle of Man, is a poem {{in twelve}} cantos {{describing}} in cumbrous allegory the <b>physiological</b> <b>structure</b> {{of the human}} body and the mind of man.

50|$|PBPK models try to rely {{a priori}} on the {{anatomical}} and <b>physiological</b> <b>structure</b> of the body, {{and to a}} certain extent, on biochemistry. They are usually multi-compartment models, with compartments corresponding to predefined organs or tissues, with interconnections corresponding to blood or lymph flows (more rarely to diffusions). A system of differential equations for concentration or quantity of substance on each compartment can be written, and its parameters represent blood flows, pulmonary ventilation rate, organ volumes etc., for which information is available in scientific publications. Indeed, the description they make {{of the body is}} simplified and a balance needs to be struck between complexity and simplicity. Besides the advantage of allowing the recruitment of a priori information about parameter values, these models also facilitate inter-species transpositions or extrapolation from one mode of administration to another (e.g., inhalation to oral). An example of a 7-compartment PBPK model, suitable to describe the fate of many solvents in the mammalian body, is given in the Figure on the right.|$|E
50|$|The {{engineers}} at Fujitsu, led by Yasunori Kanda, who were developing Japanese word processors, first {{tried to use}} simultaneous hit of multiple character keys to differentiate hiragana characters but they {{found it difficult to}} use. They then came up with an idea of using thumb in conjunction with other fingers. Unlike the shift action with little finger in English keyboard, in which shift key is pressed and held while a character key is hit, this method uses simultaneous hit by thumb and other finger. This has several advantages. First, it enables each key to be conjugated in three ways: without thumb action, with the same hand thumb and with the thumb of the opposite hand. This means that the keyboard can accommodate half as much more characters than in the usual method. Second, simultaneous hit with thumb is more natural than the shift action with little finger because of the <b>physiological</b> <b>structure</b> of the human body. Thumbs are much stronger than little fingers. Third, since this was a new concept, it was possible to choose a better layout of characters, taking into account such parameters as frequency of occurrence, sequencing of characters and phonological structure of the Japanese language.|$|E

5000|$|Mead {{was a very}} {{important}} figure in 20th century social philosophy. One of his most influential ideas was the emergence of mind and self from the communication process between organisms, discussed in Mind, Self and Society, also known as social behaviorism. [...] This concept of how the mind and self emerge from the social process of communication by signs founded the symbolic interactionist school of sociology. Rooted intellectually in Hegelian dialectics and process philosophy, Mead, like Dewey, developed a more materialist process philosophy that was based upon human action and specifically communicative action. Human activity is, in a pragmatic sense, the criterion of truth, and through human activity meaning is made. Joint activity, including communicative activity, is the means through which our sense of self is constituted. The essence of Mead's social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm, nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human <b>physiological</b> <b>structure.</b> This approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body. The emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment; it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behavior, that is, thought. Mind, in Mead’s terms, is the individualized focus of the communication process. It is linguistic behavior {{on the part of the}} individual. There is, then, no “mind or thought without language;” and language (the content of mind) “is only a development and product of social interaction” (Mind, Self and Society 191-192). Thus, mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual, but is emergent in “the dynamic, ongoing social process” that constitutes human experience (Mind, Self and Society 7).|$|E
