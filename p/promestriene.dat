50|$|<b>Promestriene</b> (INN) (brand names Colpotrofin, Colpotrophine, Delipoderm), {{also known}} as {{estradiol}} 3-propyl 17β-methyl diether, is a synthetic, steroidal estrogen used topically in a 1% cream formulation. It is the 3-propyl and 17β-methyl diether of estradiol. The drug {{is described as a}} tropic agent and antiseborrheic. It has not been found to be effective in the treatment of androgenic alopecia or other conditions of cutaneous androgenization.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} C17β and/or C3 ester prodrugs of {{estradiol}}, such as estradiol acetate, estradiol benzoate, estradiol cypionate, estradiol dipropionate, estradiol enanthate, estradiol undecylate, estradiol valerate, and polyestradiol phosphate (an estradiol ester in polymeric form), among many others, {{have been developed}} and introduced for medical use as estrogens. Estramustine phosphate is also an estradiol ester, but with a nitrogen mustard moiety attached, and is used as an alkylating antineoplastic agent {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer. Cloxestradiol acetate and <b>promestriene</b> are ether prodrugs of estradiol that have been introduced for medical use as estrogens as well, although they are little known and rarely used.|$|E
40|$|Lack of {{estrogen}} affects the urinary tract mainly by diminishing vascular, muscular and epithelial trophism, resulting in {{negative effects on}} continence in postmenopausal women. Therefore, the use {{of estrogen}}s in these patients may revert these alterations and lead to an expressive improvement of the urinary symptoms. Objective: Study the effect of topical estrogen therapy (conjugated equine estrogens, estriol or <b>promestriene)</b> in periurethral vessels detected by Dopplervelocimetric analysis using, as parameters: the number of vessels, resistance and pulsatility indexes, {{as well as the}} minimum diastolic value. Methods: Forty-one postmenopausal women with stress urinary incontinence were randomized into three groups according to different types of topical estrogen received during 3 months. Group I received conjugated equine estrogens, group 2 received estriol and group 3 received <b>promestriene.</b> Periurethral Dopplervelocimetry analysis was done before estrogen administration and during treatment in all groups. Results: We observed {{an increase in the number}} of the periurethral vessels in group 1 and group 2, being higher in group I than in group 2. the pulsatility index remained unchanged in all three groups. the resistance index at the periurethral vessels reduced only at the conjugated estrogen group (group 1). in this same group we noticed an increase in the mean minimal diastolic value, meaning a better periurethral vascularization. Conclusion: Topical conjugated equine estrogens and estriol were effective in increasing the number of periurethral vessels in postmenopausal women with Urinary stress incontinence, with the Conjugated equine estrogens being the most effective intervention studied.

40|$|Splenic-macrophage Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) {{participate}} in the pathophysiologies of immune-complex diseases and in host defense against infection. Modulation of macrophage FcγR expression is an immuno-therapeutic target. Glucocorticoids, sex steroids, and dopaminergic drugs modulate macrophage FcγR expression. Previous data indicate that estradiol increases macrophage FcγR expression. Nevertheless, the effects of clinically used estrogens upon macrophage FcγR expression are unknown. We assessed the effects of treatment with commonly used estrogens on the expression of macrophage FcγRs using a guinea pig experimental model. Six estrogens have been studied: ethynylestradiol (Et), mestranol (M), chlortianisene (Ct), <b>promestriene,</b> 17 -epiestriol, and 17 β-estradiol. Following in vivo treatment of guinea pigs, we determined the clearance of immunoglobulin G (IgG) -sensitized erythrocytes in vivo, the binding of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes by isolated splenic macrophages, and splenic-macrophage FcγR cell surface expression. Estrogens enhance the clearance of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes by increasing splenic-macrophage FcγR expression. Et, M, and Ct were {{more effective than the}} other estrogens. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy with monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that estrogens increase the cell surface expression of FcγR 1 and - 2 more than that of FcγR 2. These data indicate that treatment with commonly used estrogens enhances the clearance of IgG-sensitized cells by improving splenic-macrophage FcγR expression...|$|E
