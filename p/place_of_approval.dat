5000|$|In {{writing for}} the Court's majority, Justice Antonin Scalia derided the concept of {{psychological}} impediments to public access; he wrote that if a public agency wishes to <b>place</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> on a permit, that those conditions must bear some relation to the public-policy concerns purported to be resolved through the imposition <b>of</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>approval.</b> For example, if a project eliminates 120 sq ft of public parkland, an appropriate condition would be to require replacement in-kind of the 120 sq ft to maintain the size of public parkland. In short, {{there had to be}} a nexus between the public-policy issue and the condition <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> which sought to address it. Justice Scalia then pointed out that under the ruling, a public-access condition did not meet that nexus test by compensating for the slight loss of public view across the Nollans' property; he then stated that if loss of public views across the Nollans' property was truly the issue, then an appropriate condition <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> would have been [...] "construction of a public viewing platform on the roof of the Nollans' house".|$|R

40|$|A social {{contract}} theory of government {{can be used}} to <b>place</b> a stamp <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> on all, or most, of the actions of the existing government (for example, Rousseau). Thus, the theory of the divine right of kings began as a check on government, as an order to the King to stay within divinely-commanded laws; it was transformed, by the State, into a divine stamp <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> for anything the King might decide to do. (Murray Rothbard) According to public choice theory, the market and the state are both devices through which cooperation is organized and made possible. This theme of voluntary government is most prevalent in the subset of public choice known as constitutional economics. We believe that the analogy between politics and markets made by constitutional economists is theoretically weak and clouds rather than enhances our understanding of political economy. Politics has very little in common with non-coercive, voluntary exchange in the marketplace. ...|$|R

50|$|Youqing is cold on the {{exterior}} but is a warm person inside. She was kidnapped {{as a child and}} was trapped together with a young boy who had told her the story of the Tortoise Prince. This boy, as would be revealed later on in the series, was actually Fang Kai. In memory of the boy, she keeps several tortoises as pets. As a result of the trauma from the kidnapping experience, she develops claustrophobia and a general distrust towards men. She puts up a cold exterior in defense of her inner psychological scars. All this changes when she meets Yue Guang (Zhang Yaodong) a psychiatrist. She mistakes him for a pervert at first, but later falls in love with him.

50|$|A second {{version of}} phase II was {{proposed}} later in 2006, {{in which some}} of the original Phase II proposals were modified based on earlier complaints, but it never took effect, {{with the exception of}} additional service being added on five bus lines in October of that year. On October 8, 2006, part of Phase II was implemented. All other plans were scheduled to be implemented on February 11, 2007. However, as Martin O'Malley replaced Robert Ehrlich as Maryland governor, and much of the administration saw changes, MTA has delayed further implementing any part of GBBI in order to give the O'Malley administration a chance to <b>place</b> their stamp <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> upon the changes, but the administration announced it was scrapping the plan on May 9, 2007 in favor of incremental changes three times a year. The first set of changes, which affected 19 bus lines, and were mostly very minor, took place on June 10, 2007.|$|R
500|$|The {{next day}} Michael Morell, former deputy {{director}} and twice {{acting director of}} the Central Intelligence Agency, resigned as a nonresident senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. [...] "Unfortunately," [...] Morell wrote, [...] "I cannot be part of an organization—The Kennedy School—that honors a convicted felon and leaker of classified information … the Kennedy School's decision will assist Ms. Manning in her long-standing effort to legitimize the criminal path that she took to prominence, an attempt that may encourage others to leak classified information as well." [...] Later that day, CIA director Mike Pompeo advised the university that he supported Morell's decision, and withdrew from his scheduled public appearance that evening at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Calling Manning an [...] "American traitor," [...] Pompeo wrote, [...] "While I have served my country as a soldier in the United States Army and will continue to defend Ms. Manning's right to offer a defense of why she chose this path, I believe it is shameful for Harvard to <b>place</b> its stamp <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> upon her treasonous actions." ...|$|R
