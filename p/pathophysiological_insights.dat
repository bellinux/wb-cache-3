40|$|International audienceCentral core disease (CCD) and multi-minicore disease (MmD) are muscle {{disorders}} {{characterized by}} foci of mitochondria depletion and sarcomere disorganization ("cores") in muscle fibers. Although core myopathies {{are the most}} frequent congenital myopathies, their pathogenesis remains elusive and specific diagnostic markers are lacking. Core myopathies are mostly caused by mutations in 2 sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins: the massive Ca-release channel RyR 1 or the selenoprotein N (SelN) of unknown function. To search for distinctive markers and to obtain further <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>insight,</b> we identified the molecular defects in 12 core myopathy patients and analyzed the immunolocalization of 6 proteins of the Ca-release complex in their muscle biopsies. In 7 cases with RYR 1 mutations (6 CCD, one MmD), RyR 1 was depleted from the cores; in contrast, the other proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (calsequestrin, SERCA 1 / 2, and triadin) and the T-tubule (dihydropyridine receptor-alpha 1 subunit) accumulated within or around the lesions, suggesting an original modification of the Ca-release complex protein arrangement. Conversely, all Ca-related proteins were distributed normally in 5 MmD cases with SelN mutations. Our results provide an appropriate tool to orientate the differential and molecular diagnosis of core myopathies and suggest that different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to core formation in SelN- and in RyR 1 -related core myopathies...|$|R

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS), which {{arises from}} trisomy of chromosome 21, {{is associated with}} deposition of large amounts of amyloid within the central nervous system. Amyloid accumulates in two compartments: as plaques within the brain parenchyma and in vessel walls of the cerebral microvasculature. The parenchymal plaque amyloid is thought to result in an early onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia, a phenomenon so common amongst people with DS {{that it could be}} considered a defining feature of the condition. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene lies on chromosome 21 and its presence in three copies in DS is thought to largely drive the early onset AD. In contrast, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), the main clinical consequence of vascular amyloidosis, is a more poorly defined feature of DS. We review recent epidemiological data on stroke (including haemorrhagic stroke) in order to make comparisons with a rare form of familial AD due to duplication (i. e. having three copies) of the APP region on chromosome 21, here called ‘dup-APP’, which is associated with more frequent and severe ICH. We conclude that although people with DS are at increased risk of ICH, this is less common than in dup-APP, suggesting the presence of mechanisms that act protectively. We review these mechanisms and consider comparative research into DS and dup-APP that may yield further <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>insight...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{intriguing}} novel <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>insight</b> into mood disorders is {{the notion}} that one's metabolic status influences mood. In rodents, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and nesfatin- 1 /NUCB 2 have not only been implicated in metabolism, but in the pathobiology of anxiety and depressive- like behaviour, however they have not previously been investigated in depressed subjects. Both peptides are highly expressed in centrally projecting neurons in the Edinger- Westphal nucleus (EWcp) in the midbrain. The EWcp has been implicated in stress adaptation and stress-related mood disorders like major depressive disorder in a sex-specific manner. This is intriguing, given the fact that females have higher prevalence of mood disorders. Here, we hypothesized that the expression of CART and nesfatin- 1 in EWcp would exhibit a sex-specific difference between depressed suicide victims vs. controls. We found that CART and nesfatin/NUCB 2 colocalized in the human EWcp, and that CART mRNA content was much higher in both male (x 3. 8) and female (x 5. 9) drug-free suicide victims than in controls (persons who died without any diagnosed neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorder). Similarly, NUCB 2 mRNA content was also higher (x 1. 8) in male suicides, whereas in female suicide victims, these contents were x 2. 7 lower compared to controls. These observations are the first to show changes in the dynamics of CART and nesfatin/NUCB 2 expressions in the midbrain of drug-free depressed suicide victims vs. controls.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{a frequent}} chronic dysrythmia with an incidence that increases with age (> 40). Because of its medical and socio-economic impacts {{it is expected to}} become an increasing burden on most health care systems. AF is a multi-factorial disease for which the identification of subtypes is warranted. Novel approaches based on the broad concepts of systems biology may overcome the blurred notion of normal and pathological phenotype, which is inherent to high throughput molecular arrays analysis. Here we apply an internal contrast algorithm on AF patient data with an analytical focus on potential entry pathways into the disease. We used a RMA (Robust Multichip Average) normalized Affymetrix micro-array data set from 10 AF patients (geo_accession #GSE 2240). Four series of probes were selected based on physiopathogenic links with AF entryways: apoptosis (remodeling), MAP kinase (cell remodeling), OXPHOS (ability to sustain hemodynamic workload) and glycolysis (ischemia). Annotated probe lists were polled with Bioconductor packages in R (version 2. 7. 1). Genetic profile contrasts were analysed with hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis. The analysis revealed distinct patient groups for all probe sets. A substantial part (54 % till 67 %) of the variance is explained in the first 2 principal components. Genes in PC 1 / 2 with high discriminatory value were selected and analyzed in detail. We aim for reliable molecular stratification of AF. We show that stratification is possible based on physiologically relevant gene sets.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare anthropometric and laboratory data, related to weight loss, between patients with chronic HF and patients with different tumors as well as control population. MethodsLaboratory and anthropometric data on 143 consecutive patients with chronic HF and malignant diseases as well as data for 20 controls were collected. ResultsPatients with HF had lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin compared to controls. Anthropometric measurements revealed lower body mass index (BMI), muscle strength, mid-arm circumference, and waist circumference in patients with HF compared to controls. Measurements of biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfolds were also lower in HF group. Compared to solid tumor group, HF patients had lower levels of CRP and higher levels of hemoglobin. Solid tumor patients had lower values of BMI and subscapular skinfold thickness, as well as higher muscle strength compared to HF group. Finally, compared to patients with solid hematological tumors, HF group had lower levels of albumin, lower muscle strength, as well as lower mid-arm circumference. ConclusionWe found differences in anthropometric and laboratory features, related to weight loss, in patients with HF compared to control population that were expected. On the other hand, observed differences in HF group compared to patients with various tumors could imply different pathophysiological mechanisms of weight loss between those groups.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{neonates}} with {{spina bifida}} aperta (SBA), leg movements by myotomes caudal to the meningomyelocele (MMC) are transiently observed. It {{is unclear whether}} these leg movements relate to functional neural conduction through the MMC. For optimal therapeutical intervention, <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>insight</b> in these transient leg movements seems relevant. If leg movements by myotomes caudal to the MMC concur with the execution of general movements (GMs), functional neural conduction through the MMC is implicated. OBJECTIVE: In neonates with SBA, we aimed {{to determine whether the}} transiently present leg movements caudal to the MMC indicate functional neural conduction through the MMC. METHODS: During the perinatal period, fetuses and neonates with SBA (n = 7 and n = 13, respectively) were longitudinally analysed for concurrency between leg movements caudal to the MMC and GMs. To address the integrity of the reflex arc in spinal segments (at, or) caudal to the MMC, tendon leg reflexes were assessed during the first postnatal week. RESULTS: At postnatal day 1, leg movements caudal to the MMC concurred with GMs in 12 of 13 infants. Isolated leg movements were observed in only 3 of these 12 infants (isolated vs. concurrent; p < 0. 005). Leg movements concurring with GMs lasted longer than isolated leg movements (median duration = 11 s vs. 2 s; p < 0. 05). Between days 1 and 7, tendon leg reflexes (at, or) caudal to the MMC had disappeared in all but 1 neonate. However, leg movements caudal to the MMC remained concurrently present with GMs in all five neonates available for follow-up after day 7. Comparing these leg movements between days 1 and 7 indicated a decreased duration (- 44 %, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In neonates with SBA, leg movements caudal to the MMC concur with GMs, indicative of functional neural conduction through the MMC. The disappearance of these leg movements is caused by lower motor neuron dysfunction at the reflex arc, whereas neural conduction through the MMC is still functional...|$|R

40|$|Tinnitus is the {{perception}} of sound {{in the absence of}} a corresponding external acoustic stimulus. With prevalence ranging from 10 % to 15 %, tinnitus is a common disorder. Many people habituate to the phantom sound, but tinnitus severely impairs quality of life of about 1 - 2 % of all people. Tinnitus has traditionally been regarded as an otological disorder, but advances in neuroimaging methods and development of animal models have increasingly shifted the perspective towards its neuronal correlates. Increased neuronal firing rate, enhanced neuronal synchrony, and changes in the tonotopic organisation are recorded in central auditory pathways in reaction to deprived auditory input and represent [...] together with changes in non-auditory brain areas [...] the neuronal correlate of tinnitus.

40|$|International audienceMagnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the everyday management of spondyloarthritis, particularly in its axial forms. The ability of MRI to identify characteristic inflammatory changes {{not only at}} the sacroiliac joints, but also at the spine has shed new light on the diagnosis of spondyloarthritis and provided new <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>insights,</b> particularly regarding ossification of the spinal entheses [1]. Thus, sacroiliitis detectable only by MRI was included into the ASAS criteria set in 2009 [2], so that the radiographic sacroiliitis required in the modified New York criteria is no longer mandatory. This change may shorten the time to diagnosis [3] and constitutes official recognition of non-radiographic forms of axial spondyloarthritis [4], with a new terminology [5]. The unique capabilities of MRI have thus illuminated some of the obscure issues surrounding spondyloarthritis. Their discovery generated hope that many of the challenges raised by the early diagnosis or objective monitoring of spondyloarthritis (and therefore by the evaluation of treatments) might find “visible” solutions in everyday practice.

We aim to validate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VEGFA gene as prognostic biomarkers for the PXE retinopathy which could be used for ocular risk stratification and hence counseling and follow-up of PXE families. METHODS: the VEGFA coding and non-coding (intronic and promotor) regions were Sanger sequenced in 65 molecularly confirmed PXE patients with a mild, respectively severe retinopathy. The latter was defined as unilateral best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) < 5 / 10 (with an impact on quality of life) and/or the need for anti-angiogenesis treatment with multiple anti-VEGF injections. Associations of VEGFA SNPs with disease severity and anti-VEGF therapeutic outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: a significant association of 5 VEGFA SNPs with severe retinopathy - but not with therapeutic outcome - was found, 4 of which had been previously suggested {{to be involved in the}} PXE ocular phenotype. Importantly, in several patients severe eye disease was characterized by an increased need for anti-VEGF therapy due to neovascularization, even with (near) normal BCVA. Hence, carriers of these SNPs have a more active eye disease but will not necessarily go blind if followed and treated sufficiently strict. CONCLUSIONS: the association of 4 VEGFA SNPs with a severe PXE retinopathy could be validated in an independent patient cohort, providing reliable data to stratify PXE patients for the ophthalmological complications and individualize counseling and management in the high-risk group. Prospective evaluation is ongoing to evaluate the outcome of such a personalized regime. Apart from the benefits for patient management, the need for validated prognostic biomarkers for the different phenotypic features of PXE is also essential for the design and interpretation of clinical trials. This is a pressing need, as novel <b>pathophysiological</b> and molecular <b>insights</b> in PXE have recently paved the way for human trials with allele-specific treatment using 4 -phenylbutyrate or anti-mineralization therapy using bisphosphonates. Based on our results, genotyping of these VEGFA genetic biomarkers is now done in the design of such trials in PXE patients...|$|R
40|$|Sarcopenia is a {{prevalent}} {{disease in}} elderly (13 - 24 %), peaking in patients over 85 years of age. In spite of sharing some age-related anatomo functional alterations with muscular apparatus, several pathogenetic mechanisms are independent on aging itself, leading {{to frame the}} disease as a true geriatric syndrome, {{also in terms of}} comorbidity, disability and overall mortality. The current definition addresses the disease as a progressive loss of muscular mass, strength and tone, lacking of at least a fundamental issue; the disease is almost reversible if diagnosed with promptness. It definitely paves the way to challenging approaches in terms of primary and secondary prevention, able to restrain the disability related to osteo-sarco-dynapenia as well as its outgrowing socioeconomic burden. Moreover, new <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>insights</b> in the field are focusing interesting therapeutic targets (genetic therapy on stem cells commitment or myostatin inhibition as well as hormonal therapy with SERM) enlarging the disease therapeutic conceptual framework. Anyway, this geriatric syndrome, needs a multidisciplinary approach; a fruitful sharing of knowledge among geriatrics, orthopaedics and general practitioners to better define the therapeutic target as well as the functional outcomes. Key. words: osteo-sarco-dynapenia,geriatric syndrome, prevention, multidisciplinary approac...|$|E
40|$|Ischemia {{followed}} by reperfusion leads to severe organ injury and dysfunction. Inflammation {{is considered to}} be the most important cause of tissue injury in organs subjected to ischemia. The mechanism that triggers inflammation and organ injury after ischemia remains to be elucidated, although different causes have been postulated. We investigated the role of apoptosis in the induction of inflammation and organ damage after renal ischemia. Using a murine model, we demonstrate a relationship between apoptosis and subsequent inflammation. At the time of reperfusion, administration of the antiapoptotic agents IGF- 1 and ZVAD-fmk (a caspase inactivator) prevented the early onset of not only renal apoptosis, but also inflammation and tissue injury. Conversely, when the antiapoptotic agents were administered after onset of apoptosis, these protective effects were completely abrogated. The presence of apoptosis was directly correlated with posttranslational processing of the endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP-II), which may explain apoptosis-induced influx and sequestration of leukocytes in the reperfused kidney. These results strongly suggest that apoptosis is a crucial event that can initiate reperfusion-induced inflammation and subsequent tissue injury. The newly described <b>pathophysiological</b> <b>insights</b> provide important opportunities to effectively prevent clinical manifestations of reperfusion injury in the kidney, and potentially in other organ...|$|E
