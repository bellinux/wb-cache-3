5000|$|Several testing {{mechanisms}} {{are used to}} gauge a person's ability to drive, which indicate levels of intoxication.

Impairment of performance is seen at BACs of as little as 0.7 milligrams per milliliter (mg/ml)." [...] Another form of tests is a choice reaction task, which deals more primarily with cognitive function.

40|$|A {{trajectory}} guidance apparatus {{can guide}} motion with passive actuators {{with at least}} two degrees of freedom. The trajectory guidance apparatus has a linkage that is mounted to a reference and an interaction part that is to be manipulated by a master, such as a human, gravity g, water flow, a spring, or other force generator. The linkage has at least two force elements adapted to move the interaction part so that the interaction part is guided and can be moved along a <b>prescribed</b> <b>path</b> at a prescribed velocity relative to the reference. A controllable passive coupling connects the force elements and is adapted to impart passive forces against each force element of the linkage. The passive forces are derived substantially solely from a quantity of energy that is imparted to the interaction part by the master, not from other sources. A control mechanism controls the passive coupling, dynamically if desired, so that the interaction part is moved along a <b>prescribed</b> <b>path</b> of travel at a prescribed velocity by the force elements. The control mechanism essentially shifts energy from one force element to another force element during movement of the linkage so that the <b>prescribed</b> <b>path</b> and velocity are maintained.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{optimization}} intended {{to speed up}} motions of non-redundant hydraulic manipulators along <b>prescribed</b> <b>paths</b> of their end-eectors is presented. A parametric path of the end-eector of a non-redundant manipulator determines the corresponding path in the mani-pulator joint-space. The optimization problem therefore reduces to n-ding the optimum distribution of the parameter of the path in time. The proposed optimization scheme is based on discretization of the di-stribution of the parameter into a xed number of points, and nding their optimum locations by methods of constrained nonlinear program-ming. Incompressibility of the hydraulic uid is assumed throughout for greater eectiveness of the procedure. Results of sample optimizations performed on a three-link hydraulic excavator are presented.

40|$|International audienceCable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are a {{class of}} {{parallel}} robots whose legs consist of cables. In most previous studies, {{the positions of the}} cable connection points on the moving platform and on the base frame are fixed, these positions being determined during the CDPR design. However, such fixed-configuration CDPRs are not always suitable and some situations require reconfiguration capabilities, e. g. a cluttered environment where cable collisions with objects in the CDPR workspace cannot be completely avoided without reconfigurations. This paper deals with Reconfigurable Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (RCDPRs) whose cable connection points on the base frame can be positioned at a possibly large but discrete set of possible locations. Means to select and optimize the sequence of discrete reconfigurations allowing the RCDPR moving platform to follow a <b>prescribed</b> <b>path</b> are introduced. A so-called feasibility map is first generated. For each possible configuration of the RCDPR, this map stores the feasible or unfeasible character of each point of the discretized <b>prescribed</b> <b>path,</b> according to user-defined constraints which ensure a proper functioning of the RCDPR. The feasibility map is next analyzed in order to determine minimum sets of configurations which allow the RCDPR to follow the whole <b>prescribed</b> <b>path.</b> Finally, the corresponding discrete reconfiguration planning problem is represented as a graph whose nodes correspond to feasible RCDPR reconfigurations. The arcs of the graph are weighted by a user-defined cost function so that the graph can be searched for an optimal reconfiguration strategy using Dijkstra’s algorithm...|$|E

40|$|With {{the rise}} of {{smartphones}} and tablet pcs, children's book apps have emerged as {{a new type of}} children's media. While some of them are based on popular children's books such as Mo Willems’ Pigeon books or Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit, others were specifically designed as apps. This paper focuses on examining book apps under the aspects of implied user strategies and narrative structure. Using a narratological framework that also takes into account the unique characteristics of the medium, a terminology for the analysis of book apps will be sketched out. Furthermore, an exemplary analysis of iOS books apps for pre- and grade school children comes to the conclusion that, far from offering the child users room for individual creativity, a large number of apps rather train their users in following <b>prescribed</b> <b>paths</b> of reading...|$|R

In this survey, we explore a variety of classical and modern problems that illustrate how simple rules of motion generate interesting curves and, conversely, the computational problems that arise in producing motions with <b>prescribed</b> <b>paths</b> and speeds. These encompass the geometry of trajectories under centripetal forces; the use of mechanisms to transform rotary motion into motion along general curves; real-time interpolators for digital motion control; and the specification of spatial motions that involve continuous variation of position and orientation. Such examples illustrate both the intellectual appeal and practical benefits of a sustained synergy between dialog between the study of curves and of motions...|$|R
