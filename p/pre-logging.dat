40|$|Currently, {{more than}} 400 million {{hectares}} of tropical forests worldwide {{are now being}} managed for timber production. Understanding the long-term responses of tropical forests to management practices is critical for managing tropical forests sustainably. To investigate the responses of tropical forest dynamics to different silvicultural treatment intensities, permanent plots were established in 1967 in an Australian tropical forest with four treatments: selective logging only as a control and selective logging followed by three differing intensity silvicultural treatments in 1969. We investigated changes {{in the number of}} species, species dominance, and species composition of trees (DBH ≥ 10 cm) from 1967 to 2015. Before selective logging, the number of tree species did not differ between the treatments, ranging from 70 to 75. Selective logging alone had small immediate effects on the number of species and species abundance distributions. After silvicultural treatment, the number of species in the low-intensity treatment, medium-intensity treatment and high-intensity treatment were reduced to 48, 42, and 18 respectively. The number of species in the control, low-intensity, and medium-intensity treatments recovered to their <b>pre-logging</b> levels within 46 years, but recovery in the high-intensity treatment was incomplete due to much greater initial species loss through silvicultural treatment. Silvicultural treatments increased species dominance, with the differences being progressively more marked as the level of treatment intensity increased. Over 46 years, tree species abundance distribution in the silvicultural treatments became more even and largely returned to <b>pre-logging</b> conditions, with more rapid recovery after low and intermediate silvicultural treatments. Following silvicultural treatments, species composition in the logging only, low-intensity and medium-intensity silvicultural treatments did not change markedly, whereas species composition was substantially altered by high-intensity silvicultural treatment and was subsequently distinct from the other treatments. Within 46 years following treatments, species composition in the high intensity treatment showed a recovery trajectory towards <b>pre-logging</b> conditions, leading to increased species compositional similarity among the four treatments. Increasing the intensity of silviculture treatment led to greater time required for recovery of species diversity, composition and compositional similarity. We recommend that high-intensity silvicultural treatments should be avoided if rapid recovery of species diversity and composition is the desired management outcome in tropical rainforests similar to those in our study area...|$|E

Habitat inventories suggested pool availability increased after the onset of timber harvest activities. Increased large woody debris in the channel was associated {{with an increase in}} the frequency of blowdown in the riparian buffer zone. This increase in large woody debris volume increased the availability of pools. No dramatic changes in the abundance of young-of-the-year steelhead, yearling steelhead, coho, or Pacific giant salamanders were directly related to logging. High interannual variation in the abundance of aquatic vertebrates made it difficult to contrast changes in abundance between <b>pre-logging</b> and post-logging periods. Changes in channel morphology associated with increased volume of large woody debris in the channel suggest that yearling steelhead, coho, and Pacific giant salamanders may benefit from logging in the short-term because of increased living space.

We tested whether killing buckthorn stems before logging reduces its post-logging abundance and increases the density and height of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) seedlings. Three 0. 4 ha plots were clearcut, three were thinned, and three were left as controls. Each plot had previously been divided into three subplots that received different buckthorn treatments during the two years before logging. Buckthorn treatments were (1) stems cut at base five times; (2) stems cut once then heat killed four times; (3) untreated control. Three years post-logging, buckthorn density and stem height were unaffected by logging but equally reduced by the two buckthorn treatments. Buckthorn reduction increased density and height of pine seedlings, and seedling height also increased with logging. In the fifth year post-logging, pine height growth and biomass were greater in clearcut than in thinned treatments, greater in areas of buckthorn removal and, within treated subplots, greater in areas with low buckthorn density than in thickets of recovering buckthorn.

40|$|AbstractIn Finland a {{great number}} of forest lakes are {{affected}} by silvicultural practices such as logging. Logging affects water chemistry and thus the ecological state of lakes by causing nutrient loads and increasing erosion and humic substances in water. Water quality assessment requires definition of natural background conditions and ecological status of water bodies.

In the absence of long-term monitoring data, paleolimnological methods provide a powerful tool for determining human-induced changes in lakes. In this study diatom assemblages, diatom-inferred water total phosphorus and total organic carbon, and sediment chemistry were analyzed from the sediments of six lakes with a logged catchment area (11 – 53 %). According to one-way analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) the diatom communities of three lakes were different before, immediately after and more than 10 years after logging and diatom assemblages in remaining three lakes did not show statistically significant differences between these times. However, all changes were minor, and at present the diatom assemblages and diatom-inferred water chemistry of all the lakes are close to the <b>pre-logging</b> conditions.

It is unclear whether severely damaged forests can return to a <b>pre-logging</b> state via natural regeneration, or whether active restoration is required. In this review, we highlight how the socioeconomic dynamics in the Solomon Islands promote excessive logging, resulting in highly degraded forests. We detail seven key elements currently promoting excessive logging in this region: (i) economic interests, (ii) corruption, (iii) poor employment conditions in the logging sector, (iv) high forest accessibility, (v) resource limitations for forest monitoring, (vi) contention over logging benefits, and (vii) a paucity of information for policy development. Though research on the regeneration capacity of logged forests in the Solomon Islands remains extremely limited, we suggest that some logged forests in the country may require active restoration—especially those that have been most heavily damaged. Our argument is based on previous tree planting initiatives in logged forest in the 1970 s and 1980 s.

Assuming Gaussian non-zero-coefficients and noise, and focusing on the high-SNR regime, it is first shown that the ergodic noncoherent channel capacity has <b>pre-log</b> factor 1 for any. It is then shown that, to communicate with arbitrarily small error probability at rates in accordance with the capacity <b>pre-log</b> factor, it suffices to use pilot-aided orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with pilots per fading block, in conjunction with an appropriate noncoherent decoder. Since the achievability result is proven using a noncoherent decoder whose complexity grows exponentially in the number of fading blocks, a simpler decoder, based on + 1 pilots, is also proposed.

40|$|A {{waveform}} {{channel is}} considered where the transmitted signal {{is corrupted by}} Wiener phase noise and additive white Gaussian noise. A discrete-time channel model {{that takes into account}} the effect of filtering on the phase noise is developed. The model is based on a multi-sample receiver, i. e., an integrate-and-dump filter whose output is sampled at a rate higher than the signaling rate. It is shown that, at high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the multi-sample receiver achieves a rate that grows logarithmically with the SNR if the number of samples per symbol (oversampling factor) grows with the cubic root of the SNR. Moreover, the <b>pre-log</b> factor is at least 1 / 2 and can be achieved by amplitude modulation. For an approximate discrete-time model of the multi-sample receiver, the capacity <b>pre-log</b> at high SNR is shown to be at least 3 / 4 if the number of samples per symbol grows with the square root of the SNR. The analysis shows that phase modulation achieves a <b>pre-log</b> of at least 1 / 4 while amplitude modulation still achieves a <b>pre-log</b> of 1 / 2.

Here, we reviewed 26 years of tropical forest logging literature to evaluate the relationship between sampling design and the quality of information reported, which varied greatly among 75 studies. Most studies (88 %) failed to include a <b>pre-logging</b> baseline condition in the sampling design, and the temporal scale of post-logging studies was generally inadequate. Studies also usually failed to report key information on study areas; only half of the articles reported some information on the spatial scale of the study, and only one-third presented some quantitative metric to describe forest habitat structure. Additionally, most studies (64 %) failed to report the type of forest management and almost half (45 %) did not describe the intensity of timber harvest in the logged areas. These sampling and reporting biases in logging studies hugely undermine the comparability among studies.

40|$|The {{long-term}} effects of logging treatments on rainforest regeneration are difficult to quantify due to compounding interactions with natural dynamics, site characteristics and tree species. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine regeneration differences over a 36 -year period in stands subjected to various levels of disturbance ranging from natural, through an increasing intensity of individual tree removal to intensive logging. Multivariate and univariate analyses of trees > 10 cm diameter at 1. 3 m above the ground (dbh) showed that regeneration responses were generally correlated with disturbance gradient. In the undisturbed controls there were gradual changes that had no significant effects on tree species richness and diversity, stem density, or diameter distribution. Gradual changes were also observed during the early stages of regeneration following logging. However, in logged sites changes in tree species richness and diversity, stem density and diameter distribution became more rapid with time, and significant changes were observed. Similar regeneration events across site and disturbance levels resulted in three identifiable stages. In the first stage, lasting about 10 years, stem density of abundant shade tolerant trees decreased with no discernable changes in tree species richness. In the second stage, also lasting about 10 years, tree species richness and diversity, as well as stem density decreased to minima due to localised species turnover and net mortality. In the third stage, recruitment surpassed mortality and reversed the net loss of both species and stems, as tree species assemblages began to return to pre-disturbance levels. Sites subjected to individual tree selective logging returned to their <b>pre-logging</b> states in all aspects within 35 years of logging, but diameter distribution of trees > 40 cm dbh showed low density compared to that observed in the controls. After 15 - 30 years, sites subjected to more intensive logging returned to their <b>pre-logging</b> levels of stem densities, species abundance and richness, but after 35 - 44 years of regeneration this sites had low species diversity and high densities of both the small sized stems and shade intolerant tree species. More intensively logged sites also had a low density of shade tolerant tree species compared to the controls. This suggests that the restoration of forest structure takes considerably longer than the restoration of tree species richness and abundance following logging in these forests. A high rate of stand basal area growth and a modest diameter distribution of lager trees > 40 cm dbh were observed in moderate tree selection logging. This indicates high timber production potential at moderate tree selection rate in this type of forest. However, if the stem size distribution of larger trees is to be maintained, a logging cycle longer than 50 years is necessary...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{information}} rates of non-coherent, stationary, Gaussian, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) flat-fading channels that are achievable with nearest neighbor decoding and pilot-aided channel estimation. In particular, we investigate {{the behavior of}} these achievable rates in the limit as the signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to infinity by analyzing the capacity <b>pre-log,</b> which {{is defined as the}} limiting ratio of the capacity to the logarithm of the SNR as the SNR tends to infinity. We demonstrate that a scheme estimating the channel using pilot symbols and detecting the message using nearest neighbor decoding (while assuming that the channel estimation is perfect) essentially achieves the capacity <b>pre-log</b> of non-coherent multiple-input single-output flat-fading channels, and it essentially achieves the best so far known lower bound on the capacity <b>pre-log</b> of non-coherent MIMO flat-fading channels. We then extend our analysis to the multiple-access channel. Comment: 47 pages, 5 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1107. 1640, arXiv: 1103. 020...|$|R
