40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a method for}} automating rendering parameter selection to simplify tedious user interaction and improve the usability of visualization systems. Our approach acquires the important/interesting regions of a dataset through simple user interaction with an eye tracker. Based on this importance information, we automatically compute reasonable rendering parame-ters using a set of heuristic rules, which are adapted from visualization experience and psychophysical experiments. A user study has been conducted to evaluate these rendering parameters, and while the <b>parameter</b> <b>selections</b> for a specific visualization result are subjective, our approach provides good preliminary results for general users while allowing additional control adjustment. Furthermore, our system improves the interactivity of a visualization system by significantly reducing the required amount of <b>parameter</b> <b>selections</b> and providing good initial rendering parameters for newly acquired datasets of similar types...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} allocating resource and selecting operational parameters for multiple tasks for an electronically steered phased array radar system. The continuous double auction <b>parameter</b> <b>selection</b> (CDAPS) algorithm is presented, which controls the operational parameters such that a resource constraint is satisfied. The algorithm optimises the complete multiple task <b>parameter</b> <b>selection</b> problem, {{in contrast to the}} common approach of optimising the <b>parameter</b> <b>selection</b> for each single task separately. It is shown that CDAPS produces a near-optimal solution for the single resource discrete <b>parameter</b> <b>selection</b> problem. Simulated scenarios verify that this near-optimum solution significantly improves upon conventional rule based methods. The additional desirable characteristics of the CDAPS algorithm: computational efficiency, scalability, and rapid reaction, are also highlighted...|$|R

40|$|Research in {{optimization}} algorithm design is {{often accompanied by}} benchmarking a new algorithm. Some benchmarking is done as a proof-of-concept, by demonstrating the new algorithm works on {{a small number of}} difficult test problems. Alternately, some benchmarking is done in order to demonstrate that the new algorithm in someway out-performs previous methods. In this circumstance {{it is important to note}} that algorithm performance can heavily depend on the selection of a number of user inputed parameters. In this paper we begin by demonstrating that if algorithms are compared using arbitrary <b>parameter</b> <b>selections,</b> results do not just compare the algorithms, but also compare the authors ’ ability to select good parameters. We further present a novel technique for generating and providing results using each algorithm’s “optimal parameter selection”. These optimal <b>parameter</b> <b>selections</b> can be computed using modern derivative free optimization methods and generate a framework for fairer benchmarking between {{optimization algorithm}}s...|$|E
