40|$|Recent {{studies have}} started {{exploring}} the linkages between organisational ambidexterity (OA) and HRM practices. OA is noted {{as a critical}} resource in achieving product, process, and business model innovations. By adopting an inductive case study of a US MNC subsidiary in India, we found empowerment-focused HRM practices were being used for exploration of new ideas and efficiency-focused HRM practices were adopted for the exploitation of the organisation¿s existing strengths. Empowerment-focused HRM practices created a culture of openness and risk-taking, which facilitated {{the creation of an}} ambidextrous context. Further, ambidextrous learning was moderated by the adoption of a managerial/leadership style that focused on ¿mirroring competencies¿ between the <b>parent</b> <b>operation</b> and its subsidiary. HRM practices were aimed at developing behaviours that valued the team-based co-development of graphic processor designs by means of a ¿parallel processing¿ approach to product development. Additionally, the HRM practice of offering intrinsic employee rewards and both informal and formal training facilitated OA in delivering product innovation. This study represents a pioneering exploration of multiple levels of analysis (individual, functional, and organisational) for product innovation through the lenses of ambidexterity, innovation, and HRM practices. The implications for both theory and practice are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Subsidiary units {{must respond}} to {{emerging}} threats including disaggregation of value chains and increased headquarters {{monitoring and control}} which have lead to a cycle of subsidiary decline. We {{recognize the value of}} subsidiary initiatives as a short term response but argue that subsidiary long term survival and growth will depend on the unit’s ability to align with its parent strategic activities and knowledge base. Design/ Methodology This research is part of an ongoing quantitative and qualitative study programme of Irish subsidiary operations of foreign MNCs. This paper integrates our broader research to date with both in-depth interviews of a focal case with a comprehensive review of the literature relating to MNC and subsidiary management to identify how subsidiaries can respond to current challenges. Findings. In contrast to the dominant view in the literature, our research found that subsidiaries can respond to emerging threats by integrating their activities and deepening their alignment with their <b>parent</b> <b>operation.</b> We identify three significantly important features in developing alignment – strategic embeddedness or ensuring development of subsidiary strategy in line with headquarters stated objectives, relational embeddedness determined by trust relationships and a history of consistent subsidiary delivery and finally knowledge embeddedness facilitated through coalescent knowledge creation and collaborative effort in line with headquarters strategy and direction. Research Limitations. Results from the survey are subject to the standard limitations and a larger pool of interviewees may have reinforced the qualitative findings. Practical Implications. Subsidiary managers {{need to be aware of}} how closer integration of unit activities with headquarters and the management of knowledge outflows can reduce the risk of relocation and better position subsidiaries for survival and growth. Originality. By demonstrating the benefits of alignment with headquarters, this paper provides a valuable alternative perspective to the predominant view in the literature that subsidiary survival is dependent on subsidiary initiative. Capturing both the subsidiary and parent perspectives addresses a significant limitation of many studies and provides valuable insights...|$|E
