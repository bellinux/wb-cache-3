40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{introduce}} the defect sequence for a contractive tuple of Hilbert space operators and investigate its properties. The defect sequence is {{a sequence of}} numbers, called defect dimensions associated with a contractive tuple. We show that there are upper bounds for the defect dimensions. The tuples for which these upper bounds are obtained, are called maximal contractive tuples. The upper bounds are different in the non-commutative and in the com-mutative case. We show that the creation operators on the full Fock space and the co ordinate multipliers on the Drury-Arveson space are maximal. We also study <b>pure</b> tuples <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how the defect dimensions {{play a role in}} their irreducibility. 1...|$|R

How are we to use it? We are bound in honour, I think, to state our own belief, especially to those who are in trouble. Having stated it, we should not force it, but leave the rest to higher wisdom than our own. We wish to subvert no religion.

The mathematical foundations were given by Grossmann and Morlet [5]. The harmonic analyst Meyer and many other mathematicians became aware of this theory, and they recognized many classical results inside it (see [6 – 8]). Classical wavelets have wide applications, ranging from signal analysis in geophysics and acoustics to quantum theory <b>and</b> <b>pure</b> mathematics (<b>see</b> [9 – 11] and the references therein).|$|R

We would like to emphasize that the variational inclusions theory is a natural development of the variational principles, the origin of which {{can be traced back to}} Fermat, Newton, Leibniz, the Bernoulli brothers, Euler, and Lagrange, has been one of the major branches of mathematical and engineering sciences for more than two centuries. It can be used to interpret the basic principles of mathematical and physical sciences in a form characterized by simplicity and elegance. The variational principles have played a fundamental and important part as unifying influence in sciences and have played a fundamental role in the development of general theory of relativity, gauge field theory in modern particle physics, <b>and</b> soliton theory, <b>see</b> [17 – 21, 23, 30 – 33].|$|R
40|$|The lottery preparation, a new general kind of Laver preparation, works uniformly with supercompact cardinals, {{strongly}} compact cardinals, strong cardinals, measurable cardinals, or {{what have}} you. And like the Laver preparation, the lottery preparation makes these cardinals indestructible by various kinds of further forcing. A supercompact cardinal kappa, for example, becomes fully indestructible by kappa-directed closed forcing; a strong cardinal kappa becomes indestructible by less-than-or-equal-kappa-strategically closed forcing; and a strongly compact cardinal kappa becomes indestructible by, among others, the forcing to add a Cohen subset to kappa, the forcing to shoot a club C in kappa which avoids the measurable cardinals and the forcing to add various long Prikry sequences. The lottery preparation works best when performed after fast function forcing, which adds a new completely general kind of Laver function for any large cardinal, thereby freeing the Laver function concept from the supercompact cardinal context.

40|$|Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is {{the most}} common brain tumor in children. This tumor is usually benign and has a good prognosis. Total {{resection}} is the treatment of choice and will cure the majority of patients. However, often only partial resection is possible due to the location of the tumor. In that case, spontaneous regression, regrowth, or progression to a more aggressive form have been observed. The dependency between the residual tumor size and spontaneous regression is not understood yet. Therefore, the prognosis is largely unpredictable and there is controversy regarding the management of patients for whom complete resection cannot be achieved. Strategies span from <b>pure</b> observation (wait <b>and</b> <b>see)</b> to combinations of surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Here, we intro-duce a mathematical model to investigate the growth and progression behavior of PA. In particular, we propose a MARKOV chain model incorporating cell proliferation and death as well as mutations. Our model analysis shows that the tumor behavior after partial resection is essentially determined by a risk coefficient γ, which can be deduced from epidemiological data about PA. Our results quantitatively predict the regression probability of a partiall...|$|R
