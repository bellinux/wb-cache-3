5|$|The {{discovery}} of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but {{the challenge was}} met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. In October 1944, Creutz moved to Los Alamos, where he became a group leader responsible for explosive lens design verification and <b>preliminary</b> <b>testing.</b> Difficulties encountered in testing the lenses led {{to the construction of}} a special test area in Pajarito Canyon, and Creutz became responsible for testing there. As part of the preparation for the Trinity nuclear test, Creutz conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon without nuclear material. This test brought bad news; it seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Hans Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and was able to report that the results were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E

The first prototype (serial number 46-6525), powered by two 3,000lbf (13.3kN) Westinghouse XJ34-WE-13 turbojets, flew from Muroc on 20 October 1948. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>testing</b> revealed that while handling and range was adequate, the top speed was a disappointing 641mph (1,032km/h) at sea level.

Fuel consumption was greatly increased by use of the afterburners, however, reducing the range.|$|E

40|$|A <b>preliminary</b> <b>test</b> {{approach}} using shrinkage {{technique is}} {{proposed for the}} estimation of a Poisson parameter. In this article, an a priori value of the parameter {{is assumed to be}} available in the form of realistic guessed value based on the experimenter's knowledge and experience to increase the precision of estimators by using a <b>preliminary</b> <b>test.</b> It is to be noted that this approach differs from the Bayesian approach since we do not assume a prior distribution for the parameter. Three possible estimators, namely the unrestricted maximum likelihood estimator (UMLE), the shrinkage restricted maximum likelihood estimator (SRMLE) and the shrinkage <b>preliminary</b> <b>test</b> maximum likelihood estimator (SPTMLE), are presented. Asymptotic mean squared errors of the estimators are derived and compared analytically and numerically. The relative dominance picture of the estimators is presented. It is shown that the range in the parameter space which SPTMLE dominates the UMLE is wider than that of usual <b>preliminary</b> <b>test</b> maximum likelihood estimator (PTMLE).
