The service provider, Canon, was interested in the results of the research, too. Data for the study was collected with a user satisfaction questionnaire that was sent to the personnel in February 2015. The survey consisted of open ended and closed-ended questions. The research was a qualitative case study and the emphasis was on qualitative analysis of the open ended questions. The data collected from the closed questions was analysed quantitatively.
