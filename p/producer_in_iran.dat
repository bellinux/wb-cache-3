Average frequency of the A allele among herds was 0. 256 while the frequency of B allele was 0. 744. Results showed {{there was no significant}} relationship between herd management and genotypic frequency, for different herds. However, BB genotype was the most frequent in the 1 st, 2 nd and 4 th herds (0. 500 - 0. 600), while in the 3 rd herd AB genotype was the most frequent one (0. 564). AA genotype was the least frequent frequency (0. 018 - 0. 050) among all the genotypes. Statistical analysis showed that there was no Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for average genotypic frequencies of different herds. Overall, the lack of equilibrium seems to be due to preference of AB genotype in the studied populations which could be as a result of selection that normally would apply in commercial herds.

The data used in this research consisted of information about 260 rice <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> Mazandaran province in 2004. The results indicated that lowering transactions costs would increase output by both increasing market participation and increasing production for market participants.

On the other hand, exports in industry sector can be a noticeable point for the economic growth of any country. Enhancing the exports of the steel industry of the country can have a principal role in the economic pursuit of the country’s non-oil products. Such an enhancement brings about a positive effect in the efficiency of the stocks within the financial markets by developing the steel industry. Researchers of this field claim that privatization in the steel industry results in the further development of the steel stock market and exports. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on factors influencing on privatization of the firms in steel industry. The study has designed a questionnaire in Likert scale and distributed it among some experts who worked for Mobarakeh steel <b>producer</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iran.</b> Using principle component analysis, the survey has concluded that export activities were influenced the most by six major factors including creativity, technological limitation, opportunities and challenges, being up to date, customer orientation and financial sanction. Moreover, firm performance was influenced by two major factors of stakeholder’s satisfaction and organizational culture. Finally, two factors of rationalism and market orientation influenced the most on privatization...|$|E

Therefore, study on all aspects of its cultivation mechanization is necessary to sustain its production. This study focused on identifying factors that affect the development of hazelnut harvesting mechanization in Guilan Province, Iran, using a three-round Delphi technique. The technical panel of the study consisted of 27 hazelnut production in Eastern Guilan. The factor “observing engineering principles {{in the construction of}} new hazelnut orchards (row planting at appropriate density) ” was identified as the most important driving factor with about 99 % consensus from experts. Also, the factors “devising regional and provincial macro plans for developing orchard mechanization” and “development of mechanized irrigation of orchards with convenient methods tailored to local conditions” were ranked the second and third most important driving factors, respectively, with 91. 30 % and 90. 05 % consensus of experts. The most important inhibiting factor was found to be “the slope of most hazelnut farms” with 96 % consensus of experts. The second most important inhibiting factors were “lack of appropriate roads for quick and convenient access to hazelnut cultivation machinery” and “hazelnut growers’ limited financial capability” with 94. 75 % consensus. These results indicated {{that it is necessary to}} address the modification of old gardens to oblige observing the construction principles of orchards tailored to hazelnut mechanical harvesting and to purposefully and specifically support research on the design and manufacture of small-scale implements for hazelnut harvesting tailored to local conditions of hazelnut orchards in Guilan Province...|$|E
