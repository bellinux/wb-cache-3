50|$|Trichotillomania (TTM), {{also known}} as <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> {{disorder}}, is an impulse control disorder characterised by a long term urge that results in the pulling out of one's hair. This occurs {{to such a degree}} that hair loss can be seen. Efforts to stop <b>pulling</b> <b>hair</b> typically fail. Hair removal may occur anywhere; however, the head and around the eyes are most common. The <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> is {{to such a degree that}} it results in distress.|$|R

50|$|Waxing {{involves}} using {{a sticky}} wax and {{strip of paper}} or cloth to <b>pull</b> <b>hair</b> from the root. Waxing is the ideal hair removal technique to keep an area hair-free {{for long periods of}} time. It can take three to six weeks for waxed hair to begin to resurface again. Hair in areas that have previously been waxed also is known to grow back finer and thinner, especially compared to hair that has been shaved with a razor.|$|E
50|$|Environment {{is a large}} factor {{which affects}} <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b> Sedentary {{activities}} such as being in a relaxed environment are conducive to <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b> A common example of a sedentary activity promoting <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> is lying in a bed while trying to rest or fall asleep. An extreme example of automatic trichotillomania is found when some patients have been observed to <b>pull</b> their <b>hair</b> out while asleep. This is called sleep-isolated trichotillomania.|$|R
5000|$|Trichotillomania {{is defined}} as a {{self-induced}} and recurrent loss of hair. [...] It includes the criterion of an increasing sense of tension before <b>pulling</b> the <b>hair</b> and gratification or relief when <b>pulling</b> the <b>hair.</b> [...] However, some people with trichotillomania do not endorse the inclusion of [...] "rising tension and subsequent pleasure, gratification, or relief" [...] as part of the criteria; [...] because many individuals with trichotillomania may not realize they are <b>pulling</b> their <b>hair,</b> patients presenting for diagnosis may deny the criteria for tension prior to <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> or a sense of gratification after <b>hair</b> is <b>pulled.</b>|$|R

Eighty-nine participants reporting TTM completed a 12 -item section of the Italian <b>Hair</b> <b>Pulling</b> Questionnaire online and rated {{the extent to which they}} had experienced 12 affective states before, during, and after <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b> Overall, participants reported increased levels of shame, sadness, and frustration from pre- to post-pulling, and decreased levels of calmness after <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> episodes. Moreover, participants reported increased pleasure and relief across the pulling cycle, and variations in the direction of change for anger and anxiety depending on the <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> phase. Lastly, reported boredom decreased across the <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> cycle.

50|$|Traditionally, {{every house}} {{is said to}} have a Bichura. He would <b>pull</b> <b>hair</b> to warn a woman of danger from an abusive man. He would moan and howl to warn of coming trouble. If he showed himself, it forewarned of death, and if he was weeping it was said to be a death in the family. Tatar {{folklore}} says that a Bichura could harass horses in the stable overnight, as well as steal the grain of a neighbour to feed his own horses. If Bichura becomes unhappy, it plays nasty tricks on the members of the household. Those include moving and rattling small objects, breaking dishes, leaving muddy little footprints, causing the walls of a house to creak, banging on pots and moaning. If the family can determine the cause of their Bichuras discontent, they can rectify the situation and return things to normal. More often than not, however, families live in harmony with the spirits, and no problems arise.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is another}} side to this story that, when Lou Thesz was just {{starting}} out in the early 1930s, there were a good many professional wrestlers still active who had known Gotch and were not {{reluctant to talk about}} him. [...] "The picture that emerged of Gotch from those conversations", Thesz recalled, [...] "was of a man who succeeded at his business primarily because he was, for lack of a kinder description, a dirty wrestler. That's not to say that he wasn't competent, because everyone I ever talked with said {{he was one of the}} best. But those same people described him as someone who delighted in hurting or torturing lesser opponents, even when they were supposed to be working out, and he was always looking for an illegal edge when he was matched against worthy ones. One of the old-timers I met was a fine man named Charlie Cutler, who knew Gotch very well and succeeded him as world champion; according to Cutler, Gotch would gouge, <b>pull</b> <b>hair</b> and even break a bone to get an advantage in a contest, and he was unusually careful to have the referee in his pocket, too, in case all else failed". Referee Ed Smith, who officiated several of Gotch's bouts, including both of the Gotch-Hackenschmidt contests, had observed after the second match that [...] "to my mind... he wasn't just exactly through one hundred percent on the courageous side. Two or three times I saw needless acts of absolute cruelty on his part that I did not like. Always will I think that the really courageous man, no matter how ferocious and filled with the killing instinct and eager to win he may be, is willing to let up on a beaten foe and not punish needlessly or wantonly".|$|E
40|$|Hairpulling (trichotillomania) {{is often}} linked to {{stressful}} circumstances and may produce feelings of guilt, shame and humiliation. In a behavioural model, affective experience {{was identified as}} an important maintaining factor, as both a cue and reinforcer. Habit Reversal {{is one of the}} more successful behavioural treatment options. The present study evaluated the role of emotional arousal in the intensity of urges to <b>pull</b> <b>hair</b> in a teenaged patient with trichotillomania. Using an experimental ABCD/DCBA reversal design, the patient used imagery to increase her emotional arousal through the presentation of a manipulation script based on her own experience, after baseline and during a rumination, cognitive and a behavioural distraction phase. Subjective measures of urge intensity were collected at five time points during completion of a task, and a tally was made of an overt hair touching behaviour operationalized as a hairpulling substitute behaviour. The patient experienced more intense urges to pull whilst ruminating on the arousal script compared to either of the distraction phases. The findings support the view that the experience of negative emotional arousal can exacerbate and intensify the experience of urges to <b>pull</b> <b>hair</b> in patients with trichotillomania, and that both cognitive and behavioural distraction techniques have some effect in controlling them. Demonstrating this to the patient aided engagement in treatment...|$|E

40|$|Trichotillomania is a {{disorder}} characterized by recurrent urges to <b>pull</b> out one’s <b>hair,</b> but the experiential characteristics of <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> urges are poorly understood. This study used a comparative approach {{to understand the}} subjective phenomenology of hair pulling: participants with trichotillomania symptoms were asked about their <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> urges {{as well as their}} urges to eat unhealthy foods. Participants who reported experiencing problematic unhealthy food urges were identified and asked to compare the phenomenological characteristics of their <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> and unhealthy food urges across a variety of dimensions. Results revealed significant differences for only some urge properties measured, and differences that existed were small to moderate in magnitude. Qualitative comparisons of the two urges revealed situational characteristics of <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> that could explain these small to moderate differences between the two urges. We conclude that <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> urges may be more comparable to ordinary urges such as unhealthy food urges than one might expect, but that <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> urges may nevertheless be rated as slightly more severe due to situational characteristics of these urges. This conception may improve clinician and lay understanding of the condition, assist with destigmatization efforts, and facilitate the development of treatment strategies...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{report a}} case of {{trichotillomania}} that was resistant to pharmacological treatment but responded well to a behavioral therapy program based on habit reversal. Method: The patient was a 47 -year-old lady. Her problem had started {{at the age of}} seventeen. She had experienced several treatments including full doses of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotic, and benzodiazepines as single treatments or in combination. The mentioned medication did not affect her condition. In addition, she was drowsy during the daytime and her function was seriously impaired. At the time CBT was started for the patient, she was receiving fluoxetine 40 mg daily, which she had received during the treatment period. Initial assessments included a detailed behavioral interview, daily chart of activities, record of <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> behavior with a description of patient’s emotional and situational status during the action. The treatment procedures included self monitoring, <b>pulled</b> <b>hair</b> saving and competing response. The patient was followed for 18 months. Results: Only 2 bouts of <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> were reported, both of which occurred in the fist 6 months of the treatment. The patient’s hair became thicker, and she was very satisfied with the therapy. Her social relations and function improved markedly, and her anxiety and sadness left her.

DESCRIPTORS: habit reversal, awareness enhancement device, <b>hair</b> <b>pulling,</b> aware-ness training, competing response A number of studies have demonstrated the success of habit reversal in treating <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> by typically functioning adults (Fri-man, Finney, & Christophersen, 1984). However, habit reversal has not been eval-uated with individuals with mental retar-dation who engage in <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b> Instead, punishment procedures have most often been utilized (e. g., facial screening, Friman et al., 1984). Because the prevalence of <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> for individuals with mental retar-dation appears to be equivalent to, or pos-sibly higher than, the prevalence in the typ-ical population (Long, Miltenberger, & Rapp, 1998), an examination of habit-re-versal procedures for treating <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> in individuals with mental retardation is war-ranted.
