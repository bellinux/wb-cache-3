In the UK a single-phase household supply may be rated 100 A or even 125 A, meaning that there is little need for 3 phase in a domestic or small commercial environment. Much of the rest of Europe has traditionally had much smaller limits on the size of single <b>phase</b> <b>supplies</b> resulting in even houses being <b>supplied</b> with 3 <b>phase</b> (in urban areas with three-phase supply networks).|$|R

50|$|Since {{momentary}} interruptions or {{reductions of}} output current may cause the cathode spot to extinguish, many rectifiers incorporate an additional electrode {{to maintain an}} arc whenever the plant is in use. Typically, a two or three <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> of a few amperes passes through small excitation anodes.

30|$|The {{rock and}} fluid {{properties}} are {{specified in the}} PROPS section. The term “fluid property” refers {{to a set of}} input tables that effectively defines the phase behavior of each phase. The term “rock property” refers to sets of input tables of relative permeability and capillary pressure versus saturation. Effectively, this defines the connect, critical, and maximum saturation of each <b>phase,</b> <b>supplies</b> information for defining the transition zone, and defines the conditions of flow of phases relative to one another. This strongly affects the ratios of produced phases, that is, water cuts and gas oil ratios (GORs). The REGIONS section subdivides the reservoir.|$|R
5000|$|In many European {{countries}} {{and other countries}} that use European systems, three phase service drops are often used for domestic residences. Using three phase power allows longer service drops to serve multiple residences, which is economical with the higher density of housing in Europe. Several slightly different voltage standards have been used: 220Y380, 230Y400 and 240Y415, with plans for future [...] "harmonization" [...] towards 230Y400. The service drop consists of three phase wires and a neutral wire which is grounded. Each phase wire provides around 230 V to loads connected {{between it and the}} neutral. Each of the phase wires carries 50 Hz alternating current which is 120° out of phase with the other two.Other countries, such as the UK and Republic of Ireland, generally provide a single phase and neutral per house, with every third house on the same phase. In this case the available current is higher. Single <b>phase</b> <b>supplies</b> with a supplier's fuse of up to 100 A are common, while the 3 <b>phase</b> domestic <b>supplies</b> are generally of lower current rating (often less than 50 A) per phase.|$|R
50|$|An {{enhancement}} of this arrangement uses 12 valves in a twelve-pulse bridge. The AC is {{split into two}} separate three <b>phase</b> <b>supplies</b> before transformation. One of the sets of supplies is then configured to have a star (wye) secondary, the other a delta secondary, establishing a 30° phase {{difference between the two}} sets of three phases. With twelve valves connecting each of the two sets of three phases to the two DC rails, there is a phase change every 30°, and harmonics are considerably reduced. For this reason the twelve-pulse system has become standard on most line-commutated converter HVDC systems built since the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Distribution voltage lines {{run from}} zone {{substations}} (or the grid exit point) {{to the streets}} of consumers, and to some large local businesses, such as supermarkets, schools, large farms. Three phase power is available in all urban and most rural areas. Single <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> utilising only two phases or single wire earth return systems are used in outlying and remote rural areas with light loads. Local pole-mounted or ground-mounted distribution transformers step-down the electricity from distribution voltage to the New Zealand mains voltage of 230/400 volts (phase-to-earth/phase-to-phase) for distribution into local homes and businesses.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{mathematical}} model of an induction motor, the main variables of concern are Phase currents for the stator and rotor, output torque and speed {{with respect to}} time. Three <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> voltages are the applied variables, which are generally sinusoids with a phase displacement of [...] radians for each phase, if the motor is directly supplied from electricity grid. In case of an inverter-supplied motor, the voltages may be other functions of time. Additionally, motor parameters such as stator and rotor winding resistances, and self- and mutual-inductance values are required to complete the model.|$|E
5000|$|Electricity is {{delivered}} at a frequency of either 50 or 60 Hz, {{depending on the}} region. It {{is delivered}} to domestic customers as single-phase electric power In some countries as in Europe a three <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> may be made available for larger properties. Seen in an oscilloscope, the domestic power supply in North America would look like a sine wave, oscillating between -170 volts and 170 volts, giving an effective voltage of 120 volts. [...] Three-phase power is more efficient in terms of power delivered per cable used, and is more suited to running large electric motors. Some large European appliances may be powered by three-phase power, such as electric stoves and clothes dryers.|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s most {{towns in}} Ireland were {{connected}} to the national grid. The outbreak of World War II in Europe lead to shortages of fuel and materials and the electrification process was brought to a virtual halt. In the early 1950s the Rural Electrification scheme gradually brought electric power to the countryside, a process that was completed on the mainland in 1973 (although it wasn't until 2003 that {{the last of the}} inhabited offshore islands were fully connected). Currently the Rural Electrification scheme continues, but is primarily concerned with upgrading the quality of the network (voltage fluctuations are still a problem in parts of Ireland - particularly in rural areas) and making three <b>phase</b> <b>supplies</b> available to larger farms and rural businesses requiring it.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of a synchronous motor {{is due to the}} interaction of the magnetic fields of the stator and the rotor. Its stator winding, which consists of a 3 phase winding, is provided with a 3 <b>phase</b> <b>supply,</b> and the rotor is provided with a DC supply. The 3 phase stator winding carrying 3 phase currents produces 3 phase rotating magnetic flux (and therefore a rotating magnetic field). The rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field and rotates along with it. Once the rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field, the motor is said to be in synchronization. A single-phase (or two-phase derived from single phase) stator winding is possible, but in this case the direction of rotation is not defined and the machine may start in either direction unless prevented from doing so by the starting arrangements.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{building}} with electricity it is normal for safety reasons to connect all metal {{objects such as}} pipes together to the mains earth to form an equipotential zone. This {{is done in the}} UK because many buildings are supplied with a single <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> cable where the neutral and earth conductors are combined. Close to the electricity meter this conductor is divided into two, the earth terminal and the wire going to the neutral busbar in the consumer unit. If the ground connection to the neutral is lost, all wiring and other objects tied to the neutral will be energized at the line voltage. Examples of articles that may be bonded include metallic water piping systems, gas piping, ducts for central heating and air conditioning systems, and exposed metal parts of buildings such as hand rails, stairs, ladders, platforms and floors.|$|E
5000|$|High-leg delta (also {{known as}} wild-leg, stinger leg, bastard leg, high-leg, orange-leg, or red-leg delta) {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} service connection for three-phase electric power installations. It is used when both single and three-phase power is desired to be supplied from a three phase transformer (or transformer bank). The three-phase power is connected in the delta configuration, and the center point of one phase is grounded. This creates both a split-phase single <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> (L1 or L2 to neutral on diagram at right) and three-phase (L1-L2-L3 at right). It is called [...] "orange leg" [...] because when it is connected per the NEC, the high leg is marked with orange [...] "outer finish...or other effective means" [...] (usually tape). By convention, the high leg is usually set in the center (B phase) lug in the involved panel, regardless of the L1-L2-L3 designation at the transformer.|$|E
50|$|Power was {{supplied}} at 480 V 60 Hz AC, in a corner-grounded Delta configuration, {{with the}} guide rail {{serving as the}} ground leg {{and the other two}} <b>phases</b> <b>supplied</b> on separate rails above the ground/guidance rail. The AC power was converted on board to power two 60 horsepower DC electric motors. The system used regenerative braking, converting the energy back through the DC motors to AC into the lines. Another rail, above the power rails, carried multiplexed frequency 'tones' that were decoded by the vehicles on-board controller into a 3-of-5 command sequence that was used to control all vehicle movement and station cycle functions. The heart of the on-board controller was a DEC PDP-8 minicomputer which interfaced with various vehicle subsystems via dual-redundant fail-safe vital relay logic.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} are a two cabin {{design with}} the body built out of steel, two pantographs are fitted; one for 1500 V operation, the other for 25 kV operation.

Each of the three elements of the thyristor bridge based three phase inverter circuits are connected in parallel, with the two three <b>phase</b> <b>supplies</b> per motor being series connected. For speeds below 15 km/h one supply voltage reducing chopper circuit (French:hacheur) per motor bogie is used to assist control.

5000|$|More {{recently}} Dr. Smith {{has developed}} methods of running three-phase induction motors on single-phase power. He has also worked on methods of providing power to single <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> lines from three phase generators. His first patent in this field, [...] "Three-Phase Induction Motor with Single-Phase Power Supply", , was issued 20 December 1988. He coined the words [...] "enabler" [...] and [...] "phaseable" [...] and [...] "semi-hex" [...] to distinguish these techniques from traditional static phase conversion, rotary phase conversion and electronic means of synthesizing three phase voltages and current. These techniques allow {{the use of}} large three phase motors up to over 100 hp where only single-phase power is available.

40|$|A Smith Motor is a {{three phase}} {{induction}} motor that has shunt capacitors parallel to its induction coils. The shunt capacitors provide balance {{and allow the}} motor to operate using a single <b>phase</b> power <b>supply.</b> Preliminary {{studies show that the}} Smith Motor is more efficient than a single phase induction motor powered by a single <b>phase</b> power <b>supply,</b> but less efficient than a three phase induction motor powered by a three <b>phase</b> power <b>supply.</b> The Smith Motor’s advantage is its ability to operate from a single phase power source instead of having a three phase power source installed. Its limitation to operate properly for varying loads is its disadvantage. One way to solve this problem is to develop a control system that can change the capacitors to correspond with the different sets of loads. The three phase induction motor will be tested in order to calculate proper shunt capacitor values for the Smith Motor. Then the Smith Motor will be tested for its efficiency, power factor, winding current, and winding voltage at various loads. The data will be utilized in order to construct a control system (a switch) that changes the capacitor values. This will allow the Smith Motor to operate in a more balanced state for varying loads...|$|R
