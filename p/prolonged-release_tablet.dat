40|$|Circadin 2 mg <b>prolonged-release</b> <b>tablet</b> is {{the only}} {{licensed}} melatonin product available in the UK. Circadin is indicated for patients with primary insomnia aged 55 and over, but is more widely used “off-label” to treat sleep disorders especially in the paediatric population. Children and older people often have difficulty swallowing tablets and dividing the tablet is sometimes required to ease administration. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the release profile of melatonin from Circadin tablets when divided or crushed, and compare this with release from intact tablets. Dissolution testing was also performed for unlicensed melatonin products for comparison. Dissolution tests were performed using the pharmacopoeial paddle apparatus, with melatonin release analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Melatonin content, hardness, friability, and disintegration of the products were also evaluated. The prolonged release of melatonin from Circadin tablets was unlike that of any other product tested. When divided into halves, Circadin preserved most of the prolonged-release characteristic (f 2 = 58), whereas quarter-cut and crushed tablet had a more immediate melatonin release profile. Circadin is significantly less expensive and should be preferred to unlicensed medicines which are not pharmaceutically equivalent and offer less quality assurance...|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was established and validated for determination of melatonin in dog plasma using desvenlafaxine as an internal standard (IS). Plasma samples were pretreated by liquid–liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Chromatographic separation {{was carried out}} on a C 18 column at a flow rate of 0. 2 [*]ml/min by an isocratic mobile phase of methanol[*]:[*] 5 [*]mM ammonium acetate[*]:[*]formic acid (40 : 60 : 0. 1, v/v/v). Positive ion mode detection was performed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) at m/z 233. 2 → 174. 2 for melatonin and m/z 264. 2 → 58. 2 for desvenlafaxine. The method was linear in the concentration range of 0. 020 – 10 [*]ng/ml with a correlation coefficient ≥ 0. 996. The intra- and inter-assay precision (%RSD) values were within 12. 6 % (LLOQ 15. 2 %), and accuracy (%RE) ranged from − 1. 8 % to 5. 0 % (LLOQ ± 16. 5 %). The total analysis time was 3. 0 [*]min. The method was fully validated and successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of melatonin <b>prolonged-release</b> <b>tablet</b> in Beagle dogs.

40|$|Objective: An {{examination}} of whether oxycodone/naloxone <b>prolonged-release</b> <b>tablets</b> (OXN PR) can improve constipation and maintain analgesia, compared with oxycodone <b>prolonged-release</b> <b>tablets</b> (OxyPR) {{in patients with}} moderate/severe cancer pain. Methods: Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, double-dummy, parallel-group study in which 185 patients were randomized to receive up to 120 [*]mg/day of OXN PR or OxyPR over 4 weeks. Efficacy assessments included Bowel Function Index (BFI), Brief Pain Inventory Short-Form (BPI-SF), laxative and rescue medication use. Quality of life (QoL) and safety assessments were conducted.

40|$|International audienceBackground: WHO-Step-III opioids {{are often}} {{required}} {{right from the}} start of pain therapy in order to achieve sufficient symptom control. Bowel dysfunction, particularly constipation {{is one of the most}} frequent and persistent side effects of opioid therapy, and it is known to cause considerable distress in many patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether patients with advanced cancer and moderate to severe cancer pain will benefit from treatment with oxycodone/naloxone <b>prolonged-release</b> <b>tablets</b> (OXN), with particular regard to constipation. Material and Methods: In this exploratory, non-randomized, open-label, monocenter study we evaluated the bowel function in palliative care patients treated with OXN. During the treatment phase patients were titrated up to an adequate pain control. The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) (Type 1 - 7) and Bowel Function Index (BFI) (0 - 100) were used to assess consistency and frequency of bowel movements. Global patient satisfaction was assessed with Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC) (1 - 7). Statistics: mean±SD, significance p < 0. 05. Results: 26 patients (10 males (38. 5 %)) were included; mean age 70. 6 ± 14. 0 y, length of stay 22. 6 ± 21. 2 days. At admission all patients had opioid-induced constipation. During the observation period of 14 days the daily mean dose of OX was 36. 2 ± 17. 2 mg and of N 15. 4 ± 5. 3 mg. In 5 cancer patients pain control was not sufficient under the approved maximum total daily dose of 40 / 20 mg OXN; therefore switching to hydromorphone. BFI improved significantly in 21 patients (72. 4 ± 17. 0 vs. 36. 8 ± 13. 4) (p< 0. 0001); stool consistency (BSFS) improved from type 2. 0 ± 0. 7 to 4. 9 ± 1. 0 (p< 0. 0001). PGIC at discharge was 1. 9 ± 0. 8. Discussion: Patients with OXN treatment throughout the whole study phase showed a clinically relevant improvement in pain intensity and bowel function as well as increased satisfaction. Well known disadvantages of laxative treatment might be spared or even circumvented under OXN treatment, if appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Background: Efficacy of {{melatonin}} {{in treating}} sleep disorders {{has been demonstrated}} in numerous studies. Being with short half-life, melatonin needs to be formulated in extended-release tablets to prevent the fast drop of its plasma concentration. However, an attempt to mimic melatonin natural plasma levels during night time is challenging. Methods: In this work, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used to optimize melatonin release from hydrophilic polymer matrices. Twenty-seven different tablet formulations with different amounts of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, xanthan gum and Carbopol® 974 P NF were prepared and subjected to drug release studies. Using dissolution test data as inputs for ANN designed by Visual Basic programming language, the ideal number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined trial and error methodology to guarantee the best performance of constructed ANN. Results: Results showed that the ANN with nine neurons in the hidden layer had the best results. ANN was examined to check its predictability and then {{used to determine the}} best formula that can mimic the release of melatonin from a marketed brand using similarity fit factor. Conclusion: This work shows the possibility of using ANN to optimize the composition of <b>prolonged-release</b> melatonin <b>tablets</b> having dissolution profile desired...|$|R
40|$|Opioid analgesics {{are usually}} {{effective}} {{in the management of}} severe chronic pain. However, symptoms of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) are common during opioid therapy. Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is often unsuccessfully managed due to limited effectiveness and numerous adverse effects of tradi-tional laxatives. Newer treatment pos-sibilities directed at the pathomechanism of OIBD comprise combined prolonged-release oxycodone with <b>prolonged-release</b> naloxone (oxycodone/naloxone) <b>tablets.</b> Oxycodone/naloxone provides effective analgesia with limited impact on bowel function as oxycodone displays high oral bioavailability and naloxone act as local antagonist on opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract due to near-ly complete inactivation in the liver. Oxycodone/naloxone is administered to opioid-naive patients with severe pain and those unsuccessfully treated with weak opioids. Oxycodone/naloxone may be also administered to patients treated with strong opioids who expe-rience intense symptoms of OIBD. Stud-ies conducted to date indicate that oxycodone/naloxone is an important drug in chronic pain management, pre-vention and treatment of OIBD.

40|$|Oxycodone is {{a valued}} opioid analgesic, {{which may be}} {{administered}} either as the first strong opioid or when other strong opioids are ineffective. In case of insufficient analgesia and/or intense adverse effects such as sedation, hallucinations and nausea/vomiting a switch from another opioid to oxycodone might be beneficial. Oxycodone is administered to opioid-naive patients with severe pain and to patients who were unsuccessfully treated with weak opioids, namely tramadol, codeine and dihydrocodeine. Oxycodone ef-fective analgesia {{may be attributed to}} its affinity to µ and possibly opioid receptors, rapid penetration through the blood-brain bar-rier and higher concentrations in brain than in plasma. Oxycodone displays high bioavailability after oral administration and may be better than morphine in patients with renal impairment due to the decreased production of active metabolites. Recently an oral controlled-release oxycodone formulation was introduced in Poland. Another new product that was launched recently is a combina-tion of prolonged-release oxycodone with <b>prolonged-release</b> naloxone (oxycodone/naloxone <b>tablets).</b> The aim of this review is to outline the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, drug interactions, dosing rules, adverse effects, equianalgesic dose ratio with other opioids and clinical studies of oxycodone in patients with cancer pain. The potential role of oxycodone/naloxone in chronic pain management {{and its impact on the}} bowel function is also discussed.

40|$|Michael Prugger, Thomas Berger Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Clinic and Research Unit, Clinical Department of Neurology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} effects of <b>prolonged-release</b> (PR) fampridine <b>tablets</b> (dalfampridine extended release) in clinical practice in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) with walking impairment. Patients and methods: MS patients with walking impairment deemed candidates for treatment with PR-fampridine tablets were included in this case series. Clinical assessments included the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25 -Foot Walk (T 25 FW), 12 -item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS- 12), EuroQoL- 5 D, and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The T 25 FW was videotaped at each visit. Assessments were performed at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with PR-fampridine tablets 10 mg twice daily. Clinical benefit of treatment was defined as any improvement in T 25 FW or MSWS- 12 score at 4 weeks. Patients who demonstrated clinical benefit continued treatment and were assessed at 3 and 6 months. Results: Among all patients (N = 67; mean MS duration, 16. 5 years; mean EDSS score, 4. 8; mean T 25 FW, 13. 9 seconds), 65, 52, and 48 completed the 4 -week, 3 -month, and 6 -month visits, respectively. After 4 weeks, 50. 7 % and 32. 8 % of patients walked ≥ 10 % and ≥ 20 % faster, respectively; and in 65. 7 % of patients, MSWS- 12 scores improved. Three patients experienced adverse events (nausea, n = 2, insomnia, n = 1) that resulted in discontinuation of treatment. After 6 months, 38. 8 % and 16. 4 % of patients walked ≥ 10 % and ≥ 20 % faster versus baseline, respectively; and in 59. 7 % of patients, MSWS- 12 scores improved. Among patients who demonstrated clinical benefit of treatment at 6 months, FSS scores improved on average by 1 point and MSWS- 12 scores by 10 points. Three case studies showing different outcomes of PR-fampridine treatment are detailed with a visual depiction of the changes observed. Conclusion: In this case series, a proportion of patients demonstrated a clinical benefit of PR-fampridine treatment on walking. Determining which patients derive benefit from PR-fampridine is an important aspect of treatment. A range of clinical and patient-reported factors should be considered when assessing the clinical benefit of PR-fampridine treatment in MS patients.
