40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Note is to {{investigate}} those rules of ethics which interact with attorney blogs, placing a special emphasis on advertising rules. The central finding is that, under the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s current First Amendment jurisprudence, attorney blogs (or, more cleverly, 2 ̆ 2 blawgs 2 ̆ 2) {{are not subject to}} regulation by the ethics codes of the ABA or the various state bars. Furthermore, if the Supreme Court were to, for some reason, construe blawgs as falling outside of First Amendment protection, evidence suggests that regulating this new medium would be neither desirable nor effective. Part II outlines the historical framework which underlies regulation of attorney advertising, in an attempt to add some context to the debate over attorney blawgs. Part III compares current ethics rules and jurisprudence on the issue to what is known about blawgs thus far, concluding that blawgs neither fall under the purview of current ethics rules, nor are likely to be subjected to future restrictions given the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s First Amendment jurisprudence surrounding attorney advertising. Despite this conclusion, the Note conveys some important practical advice supporting the use of comprehensive disclaimers on attorney blawgs. Part IV advances a short <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>argument</b> derived from an economics-based analysis of the blawgosphere. The Note advances the argument that attempts to regulate blawgs would not only stifle the medium, but could also make the medium more, rather than less, dangerous. Part V uses the experience of blawgs to briefly explore the efficacy of restrictions on attorney advertising as a whole, concluding that the notion of the blawgosphere calls into question the true motives behind such restrictions...|$|E
40|$|Facing {{the exigencies}} of Emancipation, a South in ruins, and ongoing violence, between 1862 and 1872 the United States Congress debated the role {{education}} would play in the postbellum polity. Positing schooling as a panacea for the nation’s problems, a determiner of individual worth, {{and a way of}} ameliorating state and federal tensions, congressional leaders envisioned education as a way of reshaping American political life. In pursuit of this vision, many policymakers advocated national school agencies and assertive interventions into state educational systems. Interrogating the meaning of “education” for congressional leaders, this study examines the role of this ambiguous concept in negotiating the contradictions of federal and state identity, projecting visions of social change, evaluating civic preparedness, and enabling broader debates over the nation’s future. Examining legislative debates over the Reconstruction Acts, Freedmen’s Bureau, Bureau of Education, and two bills for national education reform in the early 1870 s, this project examines how disparate educational visions of Republicans and Democrats collided and mutated amid the vicissitudes of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>argument.</b> Engaging rhetorical concepts of temporality, disposition, and political judgment, it examines the allure and limitations of education policy rhetoric, and how this rhetoric shifted amid the difficult process of coming to policy agreements in a tumultuous era. In a broader historical sense, this project considers the role of Reconstruction Era congressional rhetoric in shaping the long-term development of contemporary Americans’ “educational imaginary,” the tacit, often unarticulated assumptions about schooling that inflect how contemporary Americans engage in political life, civic judgment, and social reform. Treating the analysis of public policy debate as a way to gain insights into transitions in American political life, the study considers how Reconstruction Era debate converged upon certain common agreements, and obfuscated significant fault lines, that persist in contemporary arguments...|$|E
40|$|Definitions are not neutral acts of classification. Definitions {{provide the}} {{foundation}} of our interactions with the subjects and objects defined. All definitions are arguments, even uncontroversial definitions function as claims about how the world should be. Most scholarship on definitions has concerned itself with either argument about definition or argument from definition. Instead this study examines persuasive definitions and argument by definition. Argument by definition acknowledges the epistemic nature of rhetoric and the power defining (naming) has to shape <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>argument.</b> ^ Definitions function rhetorically; the act of defining conveys a positive or negative attitude {{in the course of}} naming. In the case of persuasive definitions, the argument is never actually advanced. Instead, the definition is simply put forward as real or objective and the argument is simply smuggled in through the use of the definition itself. The definition functions terministically, foregrounding certain elements of the situation and backgrounding others. As a result, the definition affects what counts as data for or against a proposal by describing causes and identifying solutions {{at the same time it}} invites moral judgments. ^ This study investigated persuasive definitions and their use as argument by definition by exploring the use of persuasive definitions in a contemporary debate where the definitional dispute remains dormant (it is not a live dispute of a group of language users). This study examines the Congressional debate over the Border Protection, Anti-Terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 as a case study. ^ During the Congressional debate, several different persuasive definitions of immigrants are used, including illegal alien, undocumented, and worker/laborer. During the Congressional debate the persuasive definitions of immigrants functioned as arguments by definition by constructing immigration policy in a specific way. Representatives constructed the immigration problem based on the terminology they chose to talk about immigrants. The persuasive definitions functioned terministically to select, reflect, and deflect reality. This terministic function was evident in the way the different Representatives constructed the immigration problem, assigned cause and blame, and offered solutions. ...|$|E

A novel arithmetical argument shows that from a <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> perspective, 'weak' adverse selection {{can be a good}} thing. This is because a degree of adverse selection is needed to maximise 'loss coverage', the expected fraction of the population's losses which is compensated by insurance.

5000|$|That {{reading was}} not, Stevens admitted, {{consistent}} {{with how the}} Wilko Court had read the 1933 Act. But, he continued, that case had relied as much on <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>arguments</b> as {{the text of the}} statutes. The text of the 1933 Act, like the text of the 1934 Act, renders void any waiver by a plaintiff of defendants obligation to comply with the statute. Neither text expressly applies to the plaintiffs waiver of his right to sue in a federal court. Moreover, the rule of Wilko v. Swan does not entirely prohibit the plaintiffs waiver of that right; the case merely decided when plaintiff may not waive a right — namely, before the dispute under the 1933 Act has arisen. Thus, I do not read Wilko v. Swan as a case giving fixed meaning to ambiguous statutory language. Rather, I believe it is more fairly construed as a case holding that in certain situations the enforceability of arbitration agreements should be denied as contrary to the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> expressed in the statute as a whole ...|$|R

40|$|The {{right to}} defend oneself has {{traditionally}} been heavily protected by courts in all scenarios. However, the refuge that an act of self–defense provides becomes muddled {{in the context of}} an insurance agreement. State courts are split on whether an insured who claims to have acted in self–defense is entitled to legal representation and compensation from the insurer in light of an insurance contract containing an intentional injury exclusion clause. This clause is used virtually uniformly throughout the insurance industry and it has caused courts to ponder if an act of selfdefense fits within the language of such a clause, and, consequently, if an act of self–defense should be excluded from insurance coverage. This Note analyzes both the textual and <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>arguments</b> that are set forth by the proponents of each side of this dispute as well as the lines of reasoning courts use in justifying their divergent rulings. Taking this analysis into consideration, this Note ultimately concludes that acts of self–defense should be excluded from coverage when traditional policy terms are used...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} legal and {{constitutional}} issues raised by appeal waivers. Section I analyzes {{the current state of}} the case law. Section II explores the due process challenge to appeal waivers, and concludes that such a challenge would be difficult to sustain given the current state of due process law. It, nonetheless, goes on to suggest that a key premise of due process theory as it relates to plea bargaining- the presumed equality of bargaining power between the prosecution and the defense-may be ripe for challenge. Section ill discusses the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>arguments</b> for and against appeal waivers, and argues that the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> debate has been unduly skewed in favor of caseload concerns, without giving sufficient consideration to the essential role that the right to appeal plays in the criminal justice system. Section III argues that appeal waivers should either be disapproved or given very restricted scope. Finally, Section IV explores the particular problems raised by waivers of sentencing error. It concludes that waivers of future sentencing error are very difficult to reconcile with traditional definitions of knowing waiver or with the basic policies which inform the right to appeal. This section urges that even if appeal waivers are upheld generally, such approval should not extend to waivers of prospective sentencing error...|$|R

40|$|The Public Trust Doctrine, {{an ancient}} mandate {{under which the}} {{sovereign}} holds unique natural resources in trust {{for the benefit of}} the general public, has been adopted by the United States as a staple of American property law. While the federal government is the ultimate trustee of these lands, the states may flexibly interpret and administer this law to maximize the public benefit derived from trust resources. For instance, although most states own the land between the high and low tide lines in trust for its citizens, Massachusetts bases its common law interpretation of the Doctrine on the Colonial Ordinance of 1641 - 41, a statute passed by the early settlers of the commonwealth providing for private ownership of the ocean flats. However, the current application of the Doctrine to the beaches of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket directly contradicts the overall intent of the Doctrine. Although the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts have reasoned otherwise, there are strong historical, legal, and <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>arguments</b> that these islands are instead subject to the traditional common law application of the Doctrine...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the avalanche of claims against attorneys, legal malpractice insurers have sought to limit their exposure. These insurers have followed the lead of insurers that issued directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies containing exclusionary provisions, {{commonly referred to as}} FDIC exclusions or regulatory exclusions. These policy provisions specifically excluded claims made by government regulators such as the FDIC and the now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). Despite express exclusionary language in the directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies, the FDIC and FSLIC challenged the regulatory exclusions. The regulators claimed that the exclusions were unenforceable because they were contrary to <b>public</b> <b>policy.</b> A number of trial courts have ruled on the validity of regulatory exclusions under directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies. Some courts have been persuaded by the FDIC 2 ̆ 7 s myriad arguments and have declared that the regulatory exclusions are unenforceable because they contravene <b>public</b> <b>policy.</b> Other courts have held that no <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> abrogates the regulatory exclusions. To date, there has been no reported decision on regulatory exclusions in legal malpractice policies. Therefore, the only guidance on the enforceability of such exclusions is the case law on regulatory exclusions in directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies. After discussing the current case law and statutory developments affecting directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies, this article will consider the applicability of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>arguments</b> to legal malpractice policies. Finally, the article will discuss the consequences of judicial rewriting of the policies to both insured attorneys and their clients...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{a cacophony}} of {{concerns}} have been raised about the propriety of noncompetition agreements (NCAs) entered into between employers and employees, fueled by media reports of agreements which attempt to restrain low-wage and low-skilled workers, such as sandwich makers and dog walkers. In the lead-up {{to the passage of}} the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (DTSA), <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>arguments</b> in favor of employee mobility were strongly advocated by those representing the “California view” on the enforceability of NCAs, leading to a special provision of the DTSA which limits injunctive relief with respect to employee NCAs. Through our lens as trade secret scholars, we have decided to enter the fray and present this Article to explore both the values and detriments of NCAs, each taking sides in the debate and providing relevant information about the different approaches to the enforceability of these agreements. Finally, we come together to suggest a more nuanced middle-ground to encourage courts to engage in a more robust analysis that focuses on both the legitimate business interest to be protected by the NCA and reasonableness in the scope of the agreement. To that end, we recommend consideration of six questions to help guide courts in achieving a more equitable and balanced outcome to protect the interests of employers and employees...|$|R

40|$|How secure are {{the legal}} {{relationships}} between {{gay or lesbian}} {{parents and their children}} when those families move from one state to another? What happens when a non-biological parent who has been legally recognized as a full parent under the laws of one state moves with her same-sex spouse and their child to a different state where <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> is unfriendly toward same-sex relationships? Or what happens when a same-sex couple adopts a child, thus becoming its full legal parents, then seeks recognition of their parental status in a different state? In this Article I argue that the traditional doctrines of conflict of laws, as well as constitutional and statutory full faith and credit [...] which I refer to collectively as the 2 ̆ 2 state interests paradigm 2 ̆ 2 [...] will not adequately protect the rights of such non-biological parents, and thus the integrity of gay/lesbian families, but that well-established constitutional due process principles preclude a state from refusing to recognize a legal parent-child relationship that was established earlier in another state. Because the state interests paradigm does not account in any formal way for the individual rights and interests of parents or children, it typically will be too deferential to anti-gay state <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>arguments</b> that may be invoked to deny recognition of a parent-child relationship and thus effectively terminate parental rights without due process. It is well established that the state may not intrude without good cause into established relationships within the nuclear family. Recognizing this principle in litigation over interstate recognition of parental rights would provide a necessary corrective to the state interests paradigm and a check against state interference with extant family relationships...|$|R

Both cases involved the deliberate concealment of unauthorised building and both attempted to rely on section 171 B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the 1990 Act) claiming the Local Planning Authorities (“LPAs”) were time barred from taking action as {{more than four years}} had passed since the date of the breach. Section 124 gave LPAs the power to apply to the Magistrates Court to take planning enforcement action outside of the normal four and ten year time limits in situations where {{there may have been a}} breach of planning control involving concealment. LPAs may apply to the Magistrates Court for a planning enforcement order (“PEO”) within six months from the date of knowledge of evidence of the apparent breach providing they are able to satisfy the court, on the balance of probabilities, that the apparent breach has been deliberately concealed and that the making of an order is just to do so. Whilst the Government’s intentions may have been valid, was their response? Is section 124 really the answer in closing the loophole these cases exposed?
