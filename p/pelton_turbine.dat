5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a <b>Pelton</b> <b>turbine.</b> The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E

[...] The <b>Pelton</b> <b>turbine</b> is supplied by water from the Ryskivatn lake, and the Fransis turbine is supplied from the Vatnsnes lake (Vatnsnesvatn).
