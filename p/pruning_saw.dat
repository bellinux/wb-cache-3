A 2012 New York Times story {{profiled}} one of them: Luis Prado, a graphic designer at the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, who uploaded 83 icons he had created for his agency, including a <b>pruning</b> <b>saw,</b> a logging truck and a candidate symbol for global warming, which he created when he couldn't find one online.|$|E
5000|$|On April 9, Lyne's ex-husband {{arrived at}} the victim's home to drop off their children. With no one {{answering}} the door, he proceeded to call Lyne's mother, who subsequently arrived with a key and searched the residence. Lyne's wallet, purse, and cellphone {{were found in the}} home, but Lyne was not. Using the cell phone found in the residence, Lyne's mother sent texts to Charlton and then called the police, who discovered blood, human tissue, and a <b>pruning</b> <b>saw</b> in Lyne's bathroom, as well as trash bags identical to those containing Lyne's severed body parts. Following examination of the body parts, the King County coroner's office stated Lyne's death was a result of [...] "homicidal violence".|$|E
5000|$|Utu is {{the god of}} the sun, justice, {{application}} of law, and the lord of truth. He is usually depicted as wearing a horned helmet and carrying a saw-edged weapon not unlike a <b>pruning</b> <b>saw.</b> It is thought that every day, Utu emerges from a mountain in the east, symbolizing dawn, and travels either via chariot or boat across the Earth, returning to a hole in a mountain in the west, symbolizing sunset. Every night, Utu descends into the underworld to decide the fate of the dead. He is also depicted as carrying a mace, and standing with one foot on a mountain. Its symbol is [...] "sun rays from the shoulders, and or sun disk or a saw".|$|E

40|$|Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a species with considerable potential for plantation forestry in New Zealand. Investment decisions in high value alternate species must be based on accurate wood quality and value predictions. There is an opportunity to extend non-destructive evaluation tools available to redwood growers, and to present the outputs of the growth model by log products and sawn timber. A redwood <b>pruned</b> buttlog <b>sawing</b> simulator has been developed however the simulator had not been tested with real data. Twelve redwood trees from Mangatu estate were selected for a sawing study; these logs were reconstructed and run through the sawing simulator. Computerised log processing was used to produce simulated <b>pruned</b> log <b>sawing</b> outturn from the redwood Buttlog Sawing Simulator, and results were compared to real results from a sawing study. The objective of the study was therefore to determine how well the simulator matched volume and grade out-turn from twelve logs. This study found the many inconsistencies between simulated data and real data; particularly related to log size. While this study was unsuccessful in validation of the redwood sawing simulator, it provides initial insight into the simulators strengths and short comings...|$|R
30|$|The logs were sawn at the Waiariki Training Centre, Rotorua. The {{objective}} for <b>sawing</b> <b>pruned</b> logs was maximum clear-wood recovery. The maximum {{extent of}} knots and occlusion scars from the pith {{were recorded in}} order to determine the size of the defect core (DC) and hence the PLI of the log (Park 1989). When <b>sawing</b> <b>pruned</b> logs, boards with a nominal thickness of 25 mm were removed until the first defects were visible; thereafter 45 mm boards were sawn. Sapwood of unpruned logs was removed by cutting 25 mm boards. Boards of 45 mm thickness were then cut, maximising board width from the heartwood zone. Minimum recovered dimensions were 1800 x 100 x 25 mm. A total of 772 boards were obtained, with 303 boards from pruned logs.|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the characteristics of market gardens in Anambra State Nigeria. Questionnaire was used to collect data from 48 respondents using snow ball sampling procedure. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data. Majority (79. 2 %) {{of the respondents were}} sole owners of the gardens. About 38 % of the respondents used personal savings as initial investment in their operations. A greater proportion (31 %) of the respondents invested N 111, 000 - N 140, 000 in establishing gardens. The output of the gardens include Citrus aurantifolia (100 %), hedge seedlings such as Ixora coccinea (100 %), Solanum melongena (87. 5 %), medicinal seedlings (e. g. Ocimium viridus) and grasses (52. 1 %). All the respondents sold their produce at farm gates. Majority (98. 0 %) of the operators used wheel barrow for transportation of the produce for sale. Watering, planting in polythene bags, and manure application were practiced by all the respondents. All the respondents used rain harvested water in their gardens. However, 60. 4 % of the gardeners dug shallow wells. Some (29. 2 %) of the respondents had <b>pruning</b> <b>saw,</b> 25. 0 % raffia rope and 22. 9 % budding knife as tools used for budding. Constraints encountered by farmers include difficulty in securing land, lack of capital and ability to control fire outbreak...|$|E

50|$|He {{developed}} {{an interest in}} botany and horticulture as a child, and by his teenage years was friends {{with some of the}} most eminent botanists, horticulturists and landscapers of the day, including; Philip Miller, Keeper of the Chelsea Physic Garden, Philip Southcote, a leading pioneer of landscape design, and Peter Collinson, the Quaker Haberdasher turned horticulturist who was to remain a lifelong friend and colleague. In 1727, when he was 14, he received, as a Christmas gift from Ralph Howard, one of his mother’s suitors, a specially made <b>pruning</b> knife and <b>saw,</b> which, it is recorded, was “well taken”.|$|R
40|$|A Pruned Log Index (PLI), {{derived from}} {{measurements}} of log {{size and shape}} {{and the size of}} the defect core, has been developed as an absolute measure of pruned sawlog quality. It is based entirely on measurable log variables routinely acquired under either of two established pruned log analysis systems. Being dependent on accurate and detailed measurements, PLI is of higher precision than other existing forms of pruned log classification. Consequently its application should be limited to real logs only (other less precise measures are more appropriate for predicting future log quality). The index was developed and validated with the assistance of the <b>pruned</b> log <b>sawing</b> simulator SEESAW. Simulation was used in preference to the real sawing results available in order to avoid the confounding influences of sawmill variables. This simulation approach also allowed the performance of trial formulae to be examined under three distinct sawing systems. Initial derivation of formulae was intuitive, based on previous experience, and all formulae included terms for log size, log shape, and defect core size. Trial indices were regressed against conversions to clears grades from SEESAW simulations using two sets of real log data from the SEESAW "library". Set 1 consisted of 74 pruned Pinus radiata D. Don logs, originally acquired through sawing studies, and was used to explore and evaluate trial formulae. Set 2 consisted of 15 logs, originally acquired through log cross-sectional analysis, and was used for validation...|$|R
