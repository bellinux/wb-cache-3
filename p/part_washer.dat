Since the early 1990s {{there has been a}} significant shift towards aqueous based systems due to the environmental and safety hazards associated with solvent systems.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} primary {{factors that affect}} the {{cleaning}} results in an aqueous <b>parts</b> <b>washer.</b> These factors are mechanical energy, temperature, detergent and time. Adjusting {{any one of these}} factors in a cleaning cycle changes the cleaning results. A <b>parts</b> <b>washer</b> with large amounts of mechanical energy and a high temperature delivers shorter cleaning cycles and uses less cleaning detergent. Mechanical energy is provided by the pump drive system. Most aqueous <b>parts</b> <b>washers</b> use an electric motor to drive a centrifugal pump. The mechanical energy delivered to the wash load is what defines the mechanical energy for cleaning and not the horsepower of the pump. Efficient use of the pump motor energy through a well designed centrifugal pump and attention to details of piping design and nozzle types are critical to put the most mechanical energy into the cleaning process. Additionally, one must consider the work volume of the <b>parts</b> <b>washer.</b> In order to achieve similar results, from one size machine to another, the power density must be the same for a given work volume, This factor requires that substantially higher horsepower pumping systems be used as the work volume increases exponentially on larger diameter machines.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the late}} 60's, many methods of parts {{cleaning}} {{have been developed}} with improved levels of safety and lessened environmental impact. Stoddard solvent, gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene were commonly used to clean and degrease parts. Then, chlorinated solvents in vapor degreasers became an industry standard. During the 1980s environmental and safety issues led to the banning of chlorinated solvents for parts cleaning. Aqueous-based cleaning systems took on new prominence that led to many improvements, in the systems and the processes. In 1971, Gary Minkin developed an aqueous based <b>parts</b> <b>washer</b> for degreasing automobile parts. The Minkin breakthrough used the force of hydraulic impact pressure to significantly improve the cleaning power of the aqueous <b>parts</b> <b>washer.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beside high {{mechanical}} energy, higher cleaning {{temperatures are}} one of the most effective methods of improving the cleaning results in a <b>parts</b> <b>washer.</b> In general, a 10 to 15 °F (5 to 8 °C) rise doubles the chemical reaction of the detergent. The increased chemical reaction between the greases and oils and the detergent delivers faster cleaning cycles and cleaner parts. Additionally, all greases and oils exhibit a lower viscosity at higher temperatures. Cleaning solution temperatures of 170 F and above softens or melts most oils and greases causing them to flow like water so they are easily removed resulting in faster cleaning, better results and cleaner <b>parts.</b> Many <b>parts</b> <b>washers</b> are not capable of maintaining this operating temperature due to the lack of amply heating systems. Additionally, careful design is required of the pumping system so it can pull in and deliver cleaning solution at temperatures that approach boiling in the <b>parts</b> <b>washer.</b> All centrifugal pumps require a net positive suction head (NPSHr) in order to be able to pump solution. As the temperature of the solution approaches the NPSHr, the pump stops pumping because the cleaning solution flashes to steam in the pump intake. Careful design of the pump is required to minimize NPSHr and allow pumping of high temperature cleaning solution.|$|R

However, increased awareness of the health, safety, and environmental issues surrounding the use and disposal of solvents has stimulated a search for alternatives. Many parts cleaning practices that once relied on petroleum-based solvents can also be done with aqueous cleaning.

5000|$|Cosmoline that {{is fairly}} fresh, or {{that has been}} {{hermetically}} sealed {{in a plastic bag}} or shrink wrap, remains a grease-like viscous fluid, and mostly wipes off with a rag, leaving only a thin film behind. Cosmoline that is older and has had air exposure usually solidifies after a few years, as the volatile hydrocarbon fraction evaporates and leaves behind only the waxy hydrocarbon fraction. The solid wax does not readily wipe off. It can be scraped off, although the scraping is laborious and leaves crumbs to be swept or vacuumed away. One method that may help remove cosmoline is to apply gentle heat sufficient to melt the waxy hydrocarbons, the cosomoline may then be wiped off metal or allowed to drip off of wood. Another useful method of cleaning a tool of crusted cosmoline is to allow a penetrating oil (such as CRC 5-56, CLP, or equivalent) to soak into it for several minutes or hours, which typically restores it to a viscous-fluid state, allowing it to be wiped off. An additional method of cosmoline removal on new parts is to use a closed-cabinet <b>parts</b> <b>washer</b> that utilizes the power wash process. Removal of cosmoline with an aqueous <b>parts</b> <b>washer</b> requires high heat, the proper aqueous detergent, and the correct hydraulic impact pressure. All cleaning methods create waste that must be disposed of in the proper manner. Aqueous washing or solvent cleaning both have accepted methods to dispose of the [...] "sludge" [...] created. Cosmoline is mostly waxes and hydrocarbons and creates a regulated waste that is not difficult to dispose of properly. It has been reported that talcum powder can be used as an absorbent of Cosmoline by packing the powder around the item to be cleaned and applying sufficient heat to melt the solid film allowing the compound to be wicked from the coated surface into the talcum, which can be scraped off more easily. Soldiers often used gasoline or any other type of petroleum-based solvent to clean cosomoline off of stored weapons, an effective, but messy and dangerous practice.|$|R
50|$|A <b>parts</b> <b>washer</b> can be {{characterized}} by its power density. The power density is calculated by dividing the total horsepower of all the pump systems providing the wash function by the total work volume for that washing function. Typical units are horsepower per cubic foot. The results of this calculation offer a beginning point in comparing various parts washing systems. The power density number is also useful when it is desired {{to achieve the same}} cleaning standard and throughput in a different work volume. Note that the power density calculation {{does not take into account}} the pump system efficiency and assumes that all of the energy delivered to the pump is delivered to the wash load. A more accurate power density would consider the pump system efficiency as efficiencies vary greatly even from an identical pump as the efficiency is highly dependent on the pump operating point, the piping design and the friction losses in the system.|$|R
50|$|A jet spray washer cleans by {{flooding}} the parts with warm chemical solution and high chemical concentration {{to clean the}} parts. In the power wash process the parts are blasted with hot chemical solution utilizing the hydraulic impact force of the cleaning solution as the primary cleaning mechanism. A <b>parts</b> <b>washer</b> utilizing the power washer process operates at a very low concentration of cleaning detergent. The lower concentration causes the cleaning solution to last longer before it becomes supersaturated and requires disposal. Additionally, a low concentration of cleaning chemicals allows for easier rinsing of the detergent from the parts thereby minimizing rinse cycle requirements thus saving water and cycle time. A final factor used in the power wash process is an oscillating manifold system that is non-synchronous to {{the rotation of the}} turntable. This system assures that the blasted solution reaches all areas of the parts load that are otherwise blinded by the stationary manifolds used in the jet spray process. All things considered the power wash process is superior to the jet spray process for faster more thorough parts cleaning cycles while minimizing detergent use and waste generation. The power wash process is generally effective for difficult soil removal applications such as burnt hydrocarbons, paint, scale, varnish, carbon, mastic, or rubber. Additional power wash types of applications generally include cleaning diesel engines, aerospace components, aluminum automobile engine parts and rolling mill equipment.|$|R

40|$|What is {{a bamboo}} treadle pump? A bamboo treadle pump is a lightweight, {{portable}} means of pumping water from shallow depths. The pump itself is usually {{made of steel}} and has two barrels {{and is able to}} produce an almost continuous flow of water. The pumping mechanism comprises a bamboo framework and is operated by alternately depressing the bamboo treadles with ones feet. What is it used for? The bamboo treadle pump is used to pump water from depths of up to 7 - 8 metres. It can pump from boreholes and from open bodies of water and is primarily intended for use by poor farmers for the irrigation of higher- value crops such as vegetables. How is it produced? Treadle pumps can be produced by large or small-scale manufacturers with standard metalworking skills. A supply of cold-rolled steel is required, along with a range of miscellaneous <b>parts</b> such as <b>washers,</b> nuts and bolts and split pins. The pumping framework may be installed by trained technicians or by the user themselves. What is its role in development? The bamboo treadle pump affords a supply of irrigation water to poor farmers on marginal lands. They have complete control over their supply of irrigation water and require no additional inputs to operate it. The pump permits all-year-round cropping and the cultivation of a wider range of crops, and hence increases the income generating opportunities and the food security of the farmers. Previous experience has shown that incomes in India and Bangladesh have at least doubled through the use of the pump and income increases have been in the range USD $ 50 - 500 per annum. Due to the extra attention farmers pay to their pump-irrigated fields, they become more market aware and are able to manage their holdings more effectively. Production, distribution, retailing and installation of pumps also provides employment opportunities to a range of nonagricultural workers. How do I obtain, install and use a bamboo treadle pump? Presently bamboo treadle pumps are only available from IDE in India and Nepal and from private companies in Bangladesh. They are not presently available in other countries. Significant opportunities exist for establishing pump-manufacturing units in other countries to supply the expected demand. Full details of installation are included in part three of this TOTEM. Further details on applicability of the technology can be supplied by IDE who have used treadle pumps for rural development for many years.
