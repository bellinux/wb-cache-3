5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with <b>paregoric</b> to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E
25|$|Camphor was a {{component}} of <b>paregoric,</b> an opium/camphor tincture developed in the 18th century. <b>Paregoric</b> was used in various formulations for hundreds of years. It was a household remedy in the 18th and 19th centuries when it was widely used to control diarrhea in adults and children, as an expectorant and cough medicine, to calm fretful children, and to rub on the gums to counteract the pain from teething. Its use declined in the 20th century after the regulation of opium.|$|E
25|$|Codeine is used {{to treat}} mild to {{moderate}} pain and to relieve cough. Codeine {{is also used to}} treat diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, although loperamide (which is available without a prescription for milder diarrhea), diphenoxylate, <b>paregoric</b> or even laudanum are more frequently used to treat severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern culture, opium is more {{commonly}} used {{in the form of}} <b>paregoric</b> to treat diarrhea. This is a weaker solution than laudanum, an alcoholic tincture which was prevalently used as a pain medication and sleeping aid. Tincture of opium has been prescribed for, among other things, severe diarrhea. Taken thirty minutes prior to meals, it significantly slows intestinal motility, giving the intestines greater time to absorb fluid in the stool.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{preparation}} (besides smoking), include processing into regular opium tincture (tinctura opii), laudanum, <b>paregoric</b> (tinctura opii camphorata), herbal wine (e.g., vinum opii), opium powder (pulvis opii), opium sirup (sirupus opii) and opium extract (extractum opii). Vinum opii {{is made by}} combining sugar, white wine, cinnamon, and cloves. Opium syrup is made by combining 997.5 part sugar syrup with 2.5 parts opium extract. Opium extract (extractum opii) finally {{can be made by}} macerating raw opium with water. To make opium extract, 20 parts water are combined with 1 part raw opium which has been boiled for 5 minutes (the latter to ease mixing).|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, opium {{tincture}} contains 10 mg per mL of anhydrous morphine. [...] By contrast, opium tincture's weaker cousin, <b>paregoric,</b> also confusingly {{known as}} [...] "camphorated tincture of opium", is 1/25th {{the strength of}} opium tincture, containing only 0.4mg of morphine per mL. [...] A 25-fold morphine overdose may occur if opium tincture is used where <b>paregoric</b> is indicated. Opium tincture is almost always dosed in drops, or fractions of a mL, or less commonly, in minims, while <b>paregoric</b> is dosed in teaspoons or tablespoons. [...] Thus, an order for opium tincture containing directions in teaspoons is almost certainly in error. [...] To avoid this potentially fatal outcome, the term [...] "camphorated tincture of opium" [...] is avoided in place of <b>paregoric</b> since the former can easily be mistaken for opium tincture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{differences}} between Tincture of Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated Tincture of Opium (<b>Paregoric)</b> {{are important and}} {{should be kept in}} mind when administering either of these drugs. Care and caution should always be taken in administering doses of Tincture of Opium, {{such as the use of}} a dosage syringe or other suitable measurement device, and by pharmacists in preparing <b>Paregoric</b> from Laudanum, and to note that the dosages in this article refer to Apothecaries weight and fluid measure. In particular, [...] "the difference between a minim and a drop should be borne in mind when figuring doses. A minim is always a sixtieth part of a fluidrachm regardless of the character of the substance, while a drop varies from a forty-fifth to a two-hundred-and-fiftieth part, according to the surface tension of the fluid." [...] Tincture of Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated Tincture of Opium (<b>Paregoric)</b> each have 50.9 drops per gram; 50.0 drops per cc; 185.0 drops per fluid drachm; and 3.10 drops per minim." [...] The importance of these distinctions is evident in view of the dangers of erroneously relying upon more general descriptions of Apothecaries' fluid measures, which typically list 60 minims per fluid dram, and 8 fluid drams per fluid ounce (480 minims).|$|E
2500|$|Laudanum remains {{available}} by prescription in the United States and theoretically in the United Kingdom, although today the drug's therapeutic indications are generally confined to controlling diarrhea, alleviating pain, and easing withdrawal symptoms in infants born to mothers addicted to heroin or other opioids. [...] Recent enforcement {{action by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against manufacturers of <b>paregoric</b> and opium tincture suggests that opium tincture's availability in the U.S. may be in jeopardy.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the FDA's efforts {{over the}} past few years, the {{confusion}} persists, sometimes with deadly results. [...] The Institute for Safe Medication Practices recommends that opium tincture not be stocked at all in a pharmacy's inventory, and that [...] "It may be time to relegate opium tincture and <b>paregoric</b> to the museum of outmoded opioid therapy." [...] Despite the risk of confusion, opium tincture, like many end-stage medications, is indispensable for intractable diarrhea for terminally ill patients, such as those suffering from AIDS and cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, raw opium was used in diverse preparations known as laudanum (see Thomas de Quincey's [...] "Confessions of an English Opium-Eater", 1821) and <b>paregoric</b> elixirs, a number of which were popular in England since {{the beginning}} of the 18th century; the original preparation seems to have been elaborated in Leiden, the Netherlands around 1715 by a chemist named Lemort; in 1721 the London Pharmocopeia mentions an Elixir Asthmaticum, replaced by the term Elixir Paregoricum ("pain soother") in 1746.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929–30, Parke, Davis & Co., a major US drug {{manufacturer}} {{based in}} Detroit, Michigan, sold [...] "Opium, U.S.P. (Laudanum)", as Tincture No. 23, for $10.80 per pint (16 fluid ounces), and [...] "Opium Camphorated, U.S.P. (Paregoric)", as Tincture No. 20, for $2.20 per pint. [...] Concentrated versions were available. [...] "Opium Camphorated, for U.S.P. Tincture: Liquid No. 338" [...] was [...] "exactly 8 times {{the strength of}} Tincture Opium Camphorated (<b>Paregoric)</b> , U.S.P., [...] "designed for preparing the tincture by direct dilution," [...] and cost $7 per pint. [...] Similarly, {{at a cost of}} $36 per pint, [...] "Opium Concentrated, for U.S.P. Tincture: Liquid No. 336", was [...] "four times the strength of the official tincture", and [...] "designed for the extemporaneous preparation of the tincture". [...] The catalog also noted: [...] "For quarter-pint bottles add 80c. per pint to the price given for pints." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tincture of Opium {{is known}} as one of many [...] "unapproved drugs" [...] {{regulated}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the marketing and distribution of opium tincture prevails today only because opium tincture was sold prior to the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act of 1938. [...] Its [...] "grandfathered" [...] status protects opium tincture from being required to undergo strict FDA drug reviews and subsequent approval processes. However, the FDA closely monitors the labeling of opium tincture. Bottles of opium tincture are required by the FDA to bear a bright red [...] "POISON" [...] label given the potency of the drug and the potential for overdose (see discussion about confusion with <b>Paregoric</b> below). Despite opium tincture being an [...] "unapproved drug" [...] as discussed above, a search of FDA's website does not reveal any efforts at this time to ban opium tincture or restrict its use; in fact, the FDA has a [...] devoted to patient and practitioner education about opium tincture. However, in a warning letter to a manufacturer of opium tincture in late 2009, the FDA noted that [...] "In regard to your unapproved drugs, we found that your firm is manufacturing and distributing the prescription drug Opium Tincture USP (Deodorized—10 mg/mL). Based on our information, there are no FDA-approved applications on file for this drug product." [...] This warning may indicate a shift in FDA policy toward banning opium tincture or at least requiring the product to be brought within the FDA's regulatory framework.|$|E
60|$|We {{went into}} camp on that wild spot to which that ram had brought us. The men were greatly fatigued.

60|$|The Blue Light scorns the labour-saving arts {{of modern}} pharmacy. It macerates its opium and percolates its own {{laudanum}} and <b>paregoric.</b> To this day pills are made behind its tall prescription desk--pills rolled out {{on its own}} pill-tile, divided with a spatula, rolled with the finger and thumb, dusted with calcined magnesia and delivered in little round pasteboard pill-boxes.

60|$|Beginning artfully to {{question}} the boy concerning his choice of sweets, he gradually drew out the information he wanted.

60|$|Cannot {{say whether}} my master and missus were ever legally married.

Never saw missus' marriage certificate, though I have quite accidental-like looked in her desk when open, and would have seen it. Do not know of any lovers missus might have had. Believe she had a liking for John Thomas, footman, for she was always spiteful-like--poor lady--when we were together--though there was nothing between us, as Cook well knows, and dare not deny, and missus needn't have been jealous.

6000|$|We {{slept in}} the sand close to the water's edge, between two {{protecting}} boulders, which {{took care of the}} stormy night-winds for us. We never took any <b>paregoric</b> to make us sleep. At the first break of dawn we were always up and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical vigor and exuberance of spirits. That is, Johnny was--but I held his hat. While smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel peaks put on the glory of the sun, and followed the conquering light as it swept down among the shadows, and set the captive crags and forests free.

6000|$|The peril {{was soon}} over, and {{ordering}} the boys all back to bed, and leaving Silas to watch lest the {{fire broke out}} again, Mrs. Bhaer and Franz went {{to see how the}} poor boys got on.

Demi was soon made cosy, and Franz took him away to his own bed, where the kind lad soothed his fright and hummed him to sleep as cosily as a woman. Nursey watched over poor Tommy all night, trying to ease his misery, and Mrs. Bhaer vibrated between him and little Teddy with oil and cotton, <b>paregoric</b> and squills, saying to herself from time to time, as if she found great amusement in the thought, [...] "I always knew Tommy would set the house on fire, and now he has done it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He refused {{steadily}} all medicine; {{he threw}} sago and cornflour overboard till the steward {{got tired of}} bringing it to him.

He kept it between his mattress and the deal lining of the ship's side; and nobody ever saw him take a dose. Donkin abused him to his face, jeered at him while he gasped; and the same day Wait would lend him a warm jersey.

60|$|This speech {{had a great}} effect. The men {{pitched the}} tents with some little show of cheerfulness, and we were snugly under cover when the night shut down.

5000|$|In 1944, two clinicians who {{evaluated}} the expectorant action of <b>Paregoric,</b> concluded: [...] "The survival of <b>paregoric</b> through the centuries, and particularly through recent critical decades, is {{probably due to}} keen clinical observation and stubborn adherence to the clinical deduction that <b>paregoric</b> is useful in certain types of cough." ...|$|E
50|$|Beginning in late 2011, {{there was}} a period in which <b>paregoric</b> was not being {{manufactured}} in the United States. , however, the manufacture of <b>paregoric</b> has resumed.|$|E
50|$|The current {{formula for}} <b>Paregoric,</b> U.S.P. {{should not be}} assumed to be universal. For example, in the United Kingdom the formula for <b>Paregoric,</b> B.P. is {{tincture}} of opium 5 ml, benzoic acid 500 mg, camphor 300 mg, anise oil 0.3 ml, alcohol (60%) to 100 ml, and contains about 1/30th grain of anhydrous morphine in 60 minims, which is 25% stronger than <b>Paregoric,</b> U.S.P.|$|E
5000|$|Until 1970, <b>paregoric</b> {{could be}} {{purchased}} in the United States at a pharmacy without a medical prescription, {{in accordance with}} federal law. Federal law dictated that no more than 2 ounces of <b>paregoric</b> be dispensed by any pharmacy to the same purchaser within a 48-hour period. Purchasers were also required to sign a register or logbook, and pharmacies were technically required to request identification from any purchaser not personally known to the pharmacist. Some states further limited the sale of <b>paregoric,</b> or banned over-the-counter sales entirely. For example, Michigan law allowed over-the-counter (non-prescription) sale of <b>paregoric</b> until April 1964, but still allowed OTC sales of certain exempt cough medication preparations that contain 60 mg of codeine per fluid ounce." [...] Even where legally permissible by law, OTC sale of <b>paregoric</b> was subject to the discretion of individual pharmacists.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Paregoric</b> is {{sometimes}} confused with Laudanum, because their chemical names are similar: Camphorated Tincture of Opium (<b>Paregoric)</b> vs. Tincture of Opium (Laudanum). However, Laudanum contains 10 milligrams of morphine per milliliter, 25 {{times more than}} <b>Paregoric.</b> Confusion between the two drugs has led to overdose and deaths in several patients. Thus the term [...] "Paregoric" [...] should be used instead of [...] "Camphorated Opium Tincture", since the latter may be confused with Laudanum.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main effects}} of <b>Paregoric</b> are to {{increase}} the muscular tone of the intestine, to inhibit normal peristalsis, and as an expectorant; a peer-reviewed clinical study in 1944 reported [...] "that all of its ingredients {{have been found to}} contribute toward the expectorant action of <b>paregoric,</b> and, further, that an advantage is contained in the combination over the sum {{of the effects of the}} individual constituents," [...] that <b>Paregoric</b> [...] "is expectorant by virtue of a reflex from the stomach," [...] and [...] "preparations of <b>paregoric</b> which have aged for two or three years are superior as an expectorant to preparations aged for less time.". [...] Its main medical use is to control fulminant diarrhea, and as an antitussive (cough suppressant). Problems with its use include opiate dependency and analgesia which can mask symptoms of diseases that need treatment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{active ingredient}} in <b>Paregoric</b> is powdered opium. In the United States {{the formula for}} <b>Paregoric,</b> U.S.P. is tincture of opium 40 ml, anise oil 4 ml, benzoic acid 4 g, camphor 4 g, glycerin 40 ml, alcohol 450 ml, purified water 450 ml, diluted alcohol to 1000 ml, and contains the equivalent of 0.4 mg/ml of anhydrous morphine; one ounce of <b>paregoric</b> contains 129.6 mg (2 grains) of powdered opium, or the equivalent of 13 mg of anhydrous morphine. [...] The average adult dose is 4 ml by mouth which corresponds to 16 mg of opium, or 1.6 mg of anhydrous morphine." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1970, <b>paregoric</b> was {{classified}} as a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act (DEA #9809); however, drugs that contained a mixture of kaolin, pectin, and <b>paregoric</b> (e.g., Donnagel-PG, Parepectolin, and their generic equivalents) were classified as Schedule V drugs. They were available over-the-counter without a prescription in many states until the early 1990s, at which time the FDA banned the sale of anti-diarrheal drugs containing kaolin and pectin. <b>Paregoric</b> is currently listed in the United States Pharmacopeia.
