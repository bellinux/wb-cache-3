40|$|Oats {{are a new}} biofuel {{possible}} to use in modified residential wood pellet combustion appliances. The emissions of organic compounds from five sequential combustion stages; initial smouldering, early flaming, late flaming, after-flame smouldering and final glowing, for incomplete burning <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> on a laboratory scale were determined by gas chromatography and compared to those <b>of</b> softwood <b>pellets.</b> High concentrations <b>of</b> 1, 6 -anhydroglucose and furan-related compounds were released from the initial smouldering <b>of</b> <b>oats,</b> while high concentrations of methoxyphenols were released during the initial smouldering <b>of</b> wood <b>pellets.</b> The results indicate that oats are a biofuel with relatively low emissions during combustion, almost as low as those from wood <b>pellets.</b> After-flame smouldering <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> released lower concentrations of methane, alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons than the after-flame smouldering <b>of</b> wood <b>pellets.</b> The large differences in emissions from the various combustion stages should be considered when evaluating the environmental aspects and health effects of residential burning <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> and wood <b>pellets...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{avoidance}} <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> in coeliac {{patients is}} still controversial. If oats is confirmed to be safe, {{it would be}} a valuable component and offer more variation in a gluten-free diet. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether avenins from different varieties <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> show different abilities in the activation of coeliac peripheral lymphocytes. Material and methods. In order to assess whether the immunogenic effect <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> varies according to the cultivar, peripheral lymphocytes from 10 coeliac children were exposed to avenins from four different oats varieties: Lampton, Astra, Ava and Nave. Lymphocyte proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN-?) release in the culture medium were measured as indexes of immune activation. Results. All the varieties <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> tested were immunogenic, with Lampton and Ava avenins inducing lymphocyte activation similar to that activated by wheat gliadin, while Astra and Nave avenins showed less immunogenicity, but still with a measurable effect. Conclusions. There are still concerns about the suitability <b>of</b> including <b>oats</b> in a gluten-free diet. Coeliac patients consuming oats-containing food should be carefully monitored, until there is more evidence to show the safety <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> and varieties <b>of</b> low-toxicity <b>oats...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of soil contamination with tri- and hexavalent chromium and soil application of compost, zeolite, and CaO on the mass <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> and content <b>of</b> nitrogen com-pounds in different organs <b>of</b> <b>oats.</b> The oats mass and content of nitrogen compounds in the crop depended on the type and dose of chromium and alleviating sub-stances incorporated to soil. In the series without neu-tralizing substances, Cr(VI), unlike Cr(III), had a nega-tive effect on the growth and development <b>of</b> <b>oats.</b> The highest doses of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) stimulated the accu-mulation of total nitrogen but depressed the content of N-NO 3 − in most <b>of</b> organs <b>of</b> <b>oats.</b> Among the sub-stances added to soil in order to alleviate the negative impact of Cr (VI) on the mass of plants, compost had a particularly beneficial effect on the growth and devel-opment <b>of</b> <b>oats.</b> The application <b>of</b> compost, zeolite, and CaO to soil had a stronger effect on the content of nitrogen compounds in grain and straw than in roots. Soil enrichment with either of the above substances usually raised the content of nitrogen compounds in oats grain and straw, but decreased it in roots...|$|R

50|$|Oatmeal stout is a stout with a {{proportion}} <b>of</b> <b>oats,</b> normally {{a maximum of}} 30%, added during the brewing process. Even though a larger proportion <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> in beer {{can lead to a}} bitter or astringent taste, during the medieval period in Europe, oats were a common ingredient in ale, and proportions up to 35% were standard. Despite some areas of Europe, such as Norway, still clinging to the use <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> in brewing until {{the early part of the}} 20th century, the practice had largely died out by the 16th century, so much so that in 1513 Tudor sailors refused to drink oat beer offered to them because of the bitter flavour.|$|R
40|$|Consumption <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> {{has long}} been known to lower plasma total and low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) cholesterol levels, an effect usually attributed to the soluble fibers β-glucans. On the basis of this cholesterol-lowering effect, oats are ascribed cardiovascular health-promoting properties. However, besides cholesterol levels, effects <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> on parameters relating to atherosclerosis development have not been extensively investigated. Since oxidation of lipoproteins and inflammation are characteristics of atherosclerosis in addition to lipid accumulation in the vessel wall, micronutrients in oats (phytochemicals) with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties may contribute to an atheroprotective action. Here, we summarize evidence on antiatherogenic properties <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> obtained from in vitro assays, animal experiments, and human studies. Possible effects involving anti-inflammatory and antioxidative actions, as well as preservation of endothelial function, are considered in addition to those related to reduction of plasma cholesterol. Since results of in vitro assays with isolated oat components are difficult to compare with effects <b>of</b> whole <b>oats</b> in humans and experimental animals, more observational studies with isolated oat components or fractions <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> are warranted. Also, {{there is a lack of}} epidemiological studies focusing on effects of oat intake on the cardiovascular disease panorama...|$|R
