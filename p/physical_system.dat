5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a <b>physical</b> <b>system.</b> Conversely, it facilitates the description of a <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E
5|$|For illustration, if a <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> behaves the same, {{regardless}} of how it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law. As another example, if a physical experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{equivalence}} between {{mass and}} energy, as {{expressed by the}} formula E=mc, is the most famous consequence of special relativity. In relativity, mass and energy are two different ways of describing one physical quantity. If a <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> has energy, {{it also has the}} corresponding mass, and vice versa. In particular, all properties of a body that are associated with energy, such as its temperature or the binding energy of systems such as nuclei or molecules, contribute to that body's mass, and hence act as sources of gravity.|$|E

More specifically, the {{equations of motion}} describe the behaviour of a <b>physical</b> <b>system</b> as a set of mathematical functions in terms of dynamic variables: normally spatial coordinates and time are used, but others are also possible, such as momentum components and time. The most general choice are generalized coordinates which can be any convenient variables characteristic of the <b>physical</b> <b>system.</b> The functions are defined in a Euclidean space in classical mechanics, but are replaced by curved spaces in relativity. If the dynamics of a system is known, the equations are the solutions to the differential equations describing the motion of the dynamics.|$|E
