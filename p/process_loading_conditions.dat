40|$|Muscle fatigue models (MFM) have broad {{potential}} application if {{they can}} accurately predict muscle capacity and/or endurance time during the execution of diverse tasks. As an initial step toward facilitating improved MFMs, we assessed the sensitivity of selected existing models to their inherent parameters, specifically that model the fatigue and recovery processes, and the accuracy of model predictions. These evaluations were completed for both prolonged and intermittent isometric contractions, and were based on model predictions of endurance times. Based on a recent review of the literature, four MFMs were initially chosen, from which a preliminary assessment led to two of these being considered for more comprehensive evaluation. Both models had a higher sensitivity to their fatigue parameter. Predictions of both models were also {{more sensitive to the}} alteration of their parameters in conditions involving lower to moderate levels of effort, though such conditions may be of most practical, contemporary interest or relevance. Although both models yielded accurate predictions of endurance times during prolonged contractions, their predictive ability was inferior for more complex (intermittent) conditions. When optimizing model parameters for different <b>loading</b> <b>conditions,</b> the recovery parameter showed considerably larger variability, which might be related to the inability of these MFMs in simulating the recovery <b>process</b> under different <b>loading</b> <b>conditions.</b> It is argued that such models may benefit in future work from improving their representation of recovery process, particularly how this <b>process</b> differs across <b>loading</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

30|$|High-strength steels (HSS) are {{produced}} using special chemical composition or/and manufacturing processes. Both aspects affect their mechanical properties at elevated temperatures and after cooling down, {{and particularly the}} residual strength and the ductility of the structural members. As HSS equates the design of lighter structural elements, higher temperatures are developed internally compared to the elements designed with conventional carbon steel. Therefore, the low thickness members, along with the severe effect of high temperature on the mechanical properties of the HSS, constitute to the increased vulnerability of such structures in fire. Moreover, the re-use and reinstatement of these structures are more challenging due to the lower residual mechanical properties of HSS after the cooling down period. This paper presents {{a review of the}} available experimental studies of the mechanical properties of HSS at elevated temperatures and after cooling down. The experimental results are collected and compared with the proposed material model (reduction factors) of EN 1993 – 1 - 2.

Also, the post-fire mechanical properties of HSS are examined.

40|$|Shale rock {{formations}} often contain calcite, {{which is a}} mineral that {{plays an important role}} in the failure of shale and in fracturing the reservoir volume. This study uses digital images to characterise the mesoscopic-scale non-uniformity of shale resulting from the shape, size and distribution of calcite in the shale. The geometry of the calcite is mapped to a finite element mesh based on the meso-scale structure of the rock. The numerical failure analysis model RFPA 2 D-DIP, which can accurately represent the meso-scale structure of shale, is used to simulate uniaxial compression. The influence of the meso-scale structure on the compressive strength and the failure <b>process</b> under various <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> are studied. The simulation results show that the meso-scale structure has an important influence on the compressive strength and the ultimate failure mode of samples loaded in various directions α. Furthermore, the results show that the compressive strength varies significantly with the direction of the load, indicating anisotropy. Depending on the direction, the failure mode can take the form of an inverted V (α= 0 °, 30 °, 45 °), an inverted Z (α= 15 °), a line (α= 75 °), or a V (α= 60 °, 90 °). The spatial distribution of the acoustic emissions (AE) we observed is similar to those observed in macroscopic failure modes. The fractal dimension (D) of the shale fractures under various <b>loading</b> <b>conditions</b> is calculated using the box-counting method. The fractal dimension is an effective indicator of the failure mode. The value of D corresponding to the various failure modes is as follows: for the inverted Z the maximum value is 1. 688016, for the line the minimum value is 1. 481904, and for both the inverted V and the V, the value is between 1. 688016 and 1. 481904.
