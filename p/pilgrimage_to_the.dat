5|$|Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram, is the {{principal}} {{of a high school}} named after his elder daughter Mahalakshmi. As a child, she went missing during a <b>pilgrimage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Godavari River pushkaram in Kakinada. Conditions at the school deteriorate due to mismanagement by Gopalam's nephew, A. K. Raju, an amateur detective. This is exacerbated when Panthulu, an ayurvedic doctor, teaches the children. Gopalam decides to replace them with a male and a female graduate (preferably a married couple) capable of training his younger daughter Sita in singing besides teaching children at the school.|$|E
5|$|Once he was {{sufficiently}} recovered Cragh undertook {{a pilgrimage to}} Hereford, accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze, to thank Cantilupe for restoring his life.

The rope was left at Cantilupe's shrine, after which Cragh {{said that he would}} make a <b>pilgrimage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land, although there is some doubt as to whether he subsequently even left Wales. Jussi Hanska has suggested that Cragh may have invented the pilgrimage story to escape from his companions.|$|E

5|$|The Franciscan Order had {{a strong}} {{following}} by the 15th century; its Third Order of Saint Francis attracted women and men to local lay confraternities, such as the Confraternity of the Dry Tree in Bruges to which Anselme Adornes belonged. St Francis was closely associated with pilgrimages, then popular and most often taken to holy sites in Spain and Jerusalem. He was revered for his own <b>pilgrimage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land in 1219; by the 15th century the Franciscans were responsible for maintaining the holy sites in Jerusalem, particularly the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier Vita, or Life, of Æthelthryth, which resembles the Vitae of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely. The work may have helped {{to increase the number of}} pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King Æthelred II (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift. The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the Liber would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation. The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing <b>pilgrimage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the Liber.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Sava {{tried to}} stop the conflict. He most likely sympathized with Radoslav, as he was the {{legitimate}} ruler. However, to stop the conflict, which could become more serious, Vladislav was crowned king upon Radoslav's departure from Serbia. Thanks to Sava, Vladislav married the daughter of Ivan Asen II. Sava then abdicated in favour of his apprentice, Arsenije, at the end of 1233. Radoslav contacted Archbishop Sava, who welcomed him back to Serbia. Radoslav took monastic vows, and took the name Jovan (John). According to Teodosije, Sava did this to protect Radoslav from Vladislav. In 1235, while visiting the Bulgarian court, Sava died while {{on his way home from}} a <b>pilgrimage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land. He was respectfully buried at the Holy Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo. Sava's body was returned to Serbia after a series of requests, and was then buried in the Mileševa monastery, built by Vladislav in 1234. Sava was canonized, and his relics were considered miraculous; his cult remained throughout the Middle Ages and the Ottoman occupation.|$|E

5|$|The Medina {{holds the}} tombs {{of the seven}} patron saints of Morocco, which are visited every year by pilgrims during the week-long ziara pilgrimage. According to tradition, it is {{believed}} that these saints are only sleeping and will awaken one day to resume their good deeds. A <b>pilgrimage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tombs offers an alternative to the hajj to Mecca and Medina for people of western Morocco who could not visit Arabia due to the arduous and costly journey involved. Circumambulation of the tombs is undertaken by devotees to achieve inner purity. This ritual is performed on Fridays in the following ordained sequence: Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali Sanhaji, Sidi al-Qadi Iyyad al-Yahsubi, Sidi Bel Abbas, Sidi Mohamed ibn Sulayman al-Jazouli, Sidi Abdellaziz Tabba'a, Sidi Abdellah al-Ghazwani, and lastly, Sidi Abderrahman al-Suhayli. The most important of the seven tombs is the shrine of Sidi Bel Abbas.|$|E
5|$|With Poland's {{conversion}} to Christianity {{in the late}} 10th century, the pagan stanice were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones such as images of patron saints, or a Chi-Rho or dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit. In 1000 CE, during his <b>pilgrimage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tomb of Saint Adalbert in Gniezno, the capital of Poland until about 1040, Emperor Otto III officially recognized Duke Boleslaus the Brave as King of Poland (see Congress of Gniezno), crowning him and presenting him with {{a replica of the}} Holy Lance, also known as Saint Maurice's Spear. This relic, together with the vexillum attached to it, was probably the first insignia of the nascent Kingdom of Poland, a symbol of King Boleslaus's rule, and of his allegiance to the Emperor. It remains unknown what images, if any, were painted or embroidered on the vexillum.|$|E
