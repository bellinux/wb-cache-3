5000|$|Halfway {{through the}} 1984 model year, a new {{space-saver}} spare wheel was added, that provided {{room for a}} larger fuel tank (with a second [...] "transfer" [...] fuel <b>pump).</b> <b>Leather</b> interior, power windows and mirrors, air conditioning, and a manual sunroof were options for all years. The 1984 model year saw the return of two windshield wipers (vs the large single wiper), absent since the 1976 models. Eleven different engines were offered in the Type 2 Scirocco over the production run, although not all engines were available in all markets. These engines included both carburetor and fuel injection engines. Initially all models had eight-valve engines. A 16-valve head was developed by tuner Oettinger in 1981, with the modification adopted by Volkswagen when they showed a multi-valve Scirocco at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show. It went on sale in Germany {{and a few other}} markets in July 1985, with a catalyzed model arriving in 1986. Displacements ranged from 1.3 liters up to 1.8 liters. Power ranged from 44 kW (60 PS) to 82 kW (112 PS) for the 8 valve engines and either 95 kW (129 PS) or 102 kW (139 PS) for the 16 valve engines.|$|E
