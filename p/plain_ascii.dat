50|$|The Commodore PET's {{lack of a}} {{programmable}} bitmap-mode {{for computer}} graphics, {{as well as it}} having no redefinable character set capability, {{may be one of the}} reasons PETSCII was developed; by creatively using the well thought-out block graphics, a higher degree of sophistication in screen graphics is attainable than by using <b>plain</b> <b>ASCII's</b> letter/digit/punctuation characters. In addition to the relatively diverse set of geometrical shapes that can thus be produced, PETSCII allows for several grayscale levels by its provision of differently hatched checkerboard squares/half-squares. Finally, the reverse-video mode (see below) is used to complete the range of graphics characters, in that it provides mirrored half-square blocks.|$|R

25|$|The {{x-system}} {{has become}} as popular as the h-system, but {{it has long been}} perceived as being contrary to the Fundamento de Esperanto. However, in its 2007 decision, the Akademio de Esperanto has issued a general permission for the use of surrogate systems for the representation of the diacritical letters of Esperanto, under the condition that this is being done only when the circumstances do not permit the use of proper diacritics, and when due to a special need the h-system fixed in the Fundamento is not convenient. This provision covers situations such as using the x-system as a technical solution (to store data in <b>plain</b> <b>ASCII)</b> yet still displaying proper Unicode characters to the end user.|$|E
2500|$|UTF-8 encoded text {{is larger}} than {{specialized}} single-byte encodings except for <b>plain</b> <b>ASCII</b> characters. In the case of scripts which used 8-bit character sets with non-Latin characters encoded in the upper half (such as most Cyrillic and Greek alphabet code pages), characters in UTF-8 will be double the size. [...] For some scripts, such as Thai and Devanagari (which is used by various South Asian languages), characters will triple in size. There are even examples where a single byte turns into a composite character in Unicode and is thus six times larger in UTF-8. This has caused objections in India and other countries.|$|E
5000|$|Tag pairs {{begin with}} an initial left bracket , {{followed}} {{by the name of}} the tag in <b>plain</b> text (<b>ASCII).</b> The tag value is enclosed in double-quotes, and the tag is then terminated with a closing right bracket [...] A quote inside a tag value is represented by the backslash immediately followed by a quote. A backslash inside a tag value is represented by two adjacent backslashes. There are no special control codes involving escape characters, or carriage returns and linefeeds to separate the fields, and superfluous embedded spaces (or SPC characters) are usually skipped when parsing.|$|R
2500|$|It is also {{possible}} to use a DDNS [...] "push" [...] request to automatically send an amateur call sign in <b>plain</b> text (<b>ASCII)</b> every 10 minutes. This requires that a computers hostname be set to the call sign of the amateur operator and that the DHCP servers lease time be set to {{less than or equal}} to 10 minutes. With this method implemented the computer will send a DNS [...] "push" [...] request that includes the local computers hostname every time the DHCP lease is renewed. This method is supported by all modern operating systems including but not limited to Windows, Mac OS X, BSD, and Linux.|$|R

5000|$|Networks can {{consist of}} {{anything}} from families, project teams, classrooms, sports teams, legislatures, nation-states, disease vectors, membership on networking websites like Twitter or Facebook, {{or even the}} Internet. Networks can consist of direct linkages between nodes or indirect linkages based upon shared attributes, shared attendance at events, or common affiliations. [...] Network features can be {{at the level of}} individual nodes, dyads, triads, ties and/or edges, or the entire network. For example, node-level features can include network phenomena such as betweenness and centrality, or individual attributes such as age, sex, or income. [...] SNA software generates these features from raw network data formatted in an edgelist, adjacency list, or adjacency matrix (also called sociomatrix), often combined with (individual/node-level) attribute data. [...] Though the majority of network analysis software uses a <b>plain</b> text <b>ASCII</b> data format, some software packages contain the capability to utilize relational databases to import and/or store network features.|$|R

40|$|Product family {{engineering}} is a commonly accepted approach {{to exploit the}} reuse potential of related software systems in a systematic and pre-planned way. Successful product family engineering, however, necessitates a sound organization of the involved work products to manage the required variability efficiently while exploiting the commonality. But <b>plain</b> and unstructured <b>ASCII</b> files offer no special support to meet these demands. On the contrary, XML and related languages, as XSLT and XLink, for instance, bear an enormous but still only partially exploited potential to facilitate the organization and management of product families. The aim {{of this paper is}} to foster the exploitation of XML technology in product family engineering. To this end, it identifies special issues, especially regarding the variability management, and analyses XML technology for its potentials to satisfy those special demands. Besides an examination of the more general XML potentials, the paper also discusses two of our XML based approaches that illustrate the application of the offered capabilities...|$|R

40|$|I present GrayStarServer (GSS), {{a stellar}} {{atmospheric}} modeling and spectrum synthesis code of pedagogical accuracy that is accessible in any web browser on commonplace computational devices and {{that runs on}} a time-scale of a few seconds. The addition of spectrum synthesis annotated with line identifications extends the functionality and pedagogical applicability of GSS beyond that of its predecessor, GrayStar 3 (GS 3). The spectrum synthesis {{is based on a}} line list acquired from the NIST atomic spectra database, and the GSS post-processing and user interface (UI) client allows the user to inspect the <b>plain</b> text <b>ASCII</b> version of the line list, as well as to apply macroscopic broadening. Unlike GS 3, GSS carries out the physical modeling on the server side in Java, and communicates with the JavaScript and HTML client via an asynchronous HTTP request. I also describe other improvements beyond GS 3 such as more realistic modeling physics and use of the HTML element for higher quality plotting and rendering of results, and include a comparison to Phoenix modeling. I also present LineListServer, a Java code for converting custom ASCII line lists in NIST format to the byte data type file format required by GSS so that users can prepare their own custom line lists. I propose a standard for marking up and packaging model atmosphere and spectrum synthesis output for data transmission and storage that will facilitate a web-based approach to stellar atmospheric modeling and spectrum synthesis. I describe some pedagogical demonstrations and exercises enabled by easily accessible, on-demand, responsive spectrum synthesis. GSS may serve as a research support tool by providing quick spectroscopic reconnaissance. GSS may be found at www. ap. smu. ca/~ishort/OpenStars/.
