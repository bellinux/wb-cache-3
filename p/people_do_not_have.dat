25|$|The {{prevalence}} of vWD {{is about one}} in 100 individuals. However, {{the majority of these}} <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> symptoms. The {{prevalence of}} clinically significant cases is one per 10,000. Because most forms are rather mild, they are detected more often in women, whose bleeding tendency shows during menstruation. It may be more severe or apparent in people with blood type O.|$|E
25|$|One study {{looked at}} the root of the hot-hand fallacy as being from an {{inability}} to appropriately judge sequences. The study compiled research from dozens of behavioral and cognitive studies that examined the hot-hand and gambler's fallacies with random mechanisms and skill-generated streaks. In terms of judging random sequences the general conclusion was that <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a statistically correct concept of random. It concluded that human beings are built to see patterns in sensory and conceptual data of all types.|$|E

25|$|Most {{people who}} are {{infected}} have no or few symptoms. Otherwise the most common {{signs and symptoms of}} Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The time from a mosquito bite to developing symptoms is not yet known, but is probably a few days to a week. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to go to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|In {{defiance}} of the common complaint that anti-cure advocates' ability to articulate complex opinions in writing—which some critics see as being impossible for autistic people—autistic adults such as Amanda Baggs use their own writing and videos to demonstrate {{that it is possible}} for severely disabled autistics to be autism rights advocates. She says that when the critics assume that intelligent and articulate autistic <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> difficulties like self-injurious behavior and difficulty with self-care, they affect the opinions of policy makers and {{make it more difficult for}} intelligent and articulate autistic people to get services. Baggs cites an example of an autistic person who was denied services when it was discovered that she could type.|$|E
25|$|Free parking at {{businesses}} {{is often}} strictly enforced to patrons, with clearly placed tow warning signs for abusing {{the space to}} go to other places or for parking for an excessive length of time, especially in highly trafficked areas such as South Beach. Many businesses have no free parking available, or do for only limited amounts of time. Even suburban plazas and big box stores often have parking security to ensure both patron safety and designated use of parking. In many suburban residential areas, <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> their own private garages as properties are small due to high land values. A parking pass even for residents of a high rise residential building often costs an additional fee over the rent or association dues.|$|E

25|$|Several reasons {{have been}} speculated {{as to why}} older adults use less {{effective}} encoding and retrieval strategies as they age. The first is the “disuse” view, which states that memory strategies are used less by older adults as they move further away from the educational system. Second is the “diminished attentional capacity” hypothesis, which means that older people engage less in self-initiated encoding due to reduced attentional capacity. The third reason is the “memory self-efficacy,” which indicates that older <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> confidence in their own memory performances, leading to poor consequences. It is known that patients with Alzheimer’s disease and patients with semantic dementia both exhibit difficulty in tasks that involve picture naming and category fluency. This is tied to damage to their semantic network, which stores knowledge of meanings and understandings.|$|E
25|$|A third gain in {{cognitive}} ability involves thinking about thinking itself, a process {{referred to as}} metacognition. It often involves monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process. Adolescents' improvements in knowledge of their own thinking patterns lead to better self-control and more effective studying. It is also relevant in social cognition, resulting in increased introspection, self-consciousness, and intellectualization (in the sense of thought about one's own thoughts, rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism). Adolescents are much better able than children to understand that <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism, which results in two distinct problems in thinking: the imaginary audience and the personal fable. These likely peak at age fifteen, along with self-consciousness in general.|$|E
500|$|Critics listed [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] {{among the}} best tracks of 2010 and of Eminem's career. The song won many awards and {{received}} five Grammy nominations. It is Eminem's best-selling single and ranked number one on several record charts, including the United States' Billboard Hot 100 for sevenweeks. The single sold sixmillion copies in the US and was the best-selling song of 2010 in the United Kingdom. [...] Musical acts such as Cher Lloyd and The Band Perry have performed cover versions. Rihanna {{has said that the}} theme of domestic violence, a topic on which she claims many <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> insight, is what makes the song effective. She later recorded [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", narrated mostly from her perspective.|$|E

500|$|The {{next morning}} gay leaders convened in a {{committee}} {{room in the}} Civic Center.

Britt informed a press conference, [...] "Harvey Milk's <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> anything to apologize for. Now the society {{is going to have to}} deal with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not going to put up with Dan Whites anymore." [...] Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Mubarak {{said that}} he was [...] "fed up" [...] with being in power but would not resign because he did not want Egypt to descend into a chaos in which the Muslim Brotherhood would be the beneficiaries. Suleiman said, in the same interview, that the Egyptian <b>people</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a culture of {{democracy}} and that an Islamic current is pushing young people to protest. In an interview broadcast on state television, Suleiman reasserted that [...] "The president will not go for another term nor any member of his family including his son. The January25 youth was not a destructive movement, however it was a demand movement... Constitution articles 76 and 77 will be modified, other articles are subjected to change." [...] Regarding the clashes in Tahrir Square he commented, [...] "Everyone responsible for these clashes will be questioned... The clashes had negatively impacted what the president speech had achieved." [...] Regarding economic effects, he commented, [...] "A million tourists had left Egypt in 9 days, imagine the lost revenue." [...] He declared that anyone who had been arrested during the demonstrations would be released unless they had committed a crime. He asked the protesters to go home as all their demands had been heard. He thanked them for their efforts to move political life in Egypt forward.|$|E
