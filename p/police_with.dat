5|$|Police {{work and}} {{criminal}} prosecutions {{relied heavily on}} confessions, witness testimony, and apprehending perpetrators {{in the act of}} committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. Forensic techniques, such as fingerprint analysis, were not in use. Policing in London was—and still is—divided between two forces: the Metropolitan <b>Police</b> <b>with</b> jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the City of London <b>Police</b> <b>with</b> jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9km2) of the city centre. The Home Secretary, a senior minister of the United Kingdom government, controlled the Metropolitan Police, whereas the City Police were responsible to the Corporation of London. Beat constables walked regular, timed routes.|$|E

5|$|During a {{press conference}} on 26 February 2015, Chovanec {{introduced}} five areas that were to be scrutinized {{in connection with the}} Uherský Brod attack: the communication of national <b>police</b> <b>with</b> municipal authorities, possible changes in crisis plans, operational range of tactical teams, and enhanced training of policemen. Chovanec didn't repeat his sentiment regarding the number of gun license holders, and instead specified that one of the issues to be analyzed will be the issuing and revocation of licenses under the existing legislation.|$|E

The legislation came into effect on 1 February 1920, officially marking the end of the older force.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{allegations}} had not previously been reported to authorities, the reasons given included fear of disbelief and distrust in the judicial system. At least seven allegations of sexual assault made to police during Savile's lifetime were not linked by <b>police,</b> <b>with</b> Savile as the same alleged perpetrator. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that {{the allegations}} made to Surrey Police between 2007 and 2009 could have resulted in prosecutions being undertaken.|$|E

5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title {{as a metaphor for the}} viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the <b>police</b> <b>with</b> access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
5|$|Detective Chief Superintendent Graham Melvin of the Serious Crime Squad {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} {{investigation}} a few hours after the killing, at 2:00 am on 7 October. The inquiry became the largest {{in the history of the}} Metropolitan <b>Police,</b> <b>with</b> 150 officers assigned full-time. Melvin was born in Halifax in 1941, joining the Metropolitan Police in 1960, then the Criminal Investigation Department. He studied at Bramshill Police College, served with the Flying Squad, and was known for having solved several notorious cases, including that of Kenneth Erskine, the Stockwell Strangler. He became a detective chief superintendent in March, 1985, when he joined the elite International and Organised Crime Squad (SO1).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the sudden}} {{shift in the}} {{projected}} track, {{a state of emergency}} was declared on September14 in La Paz, Los Cabos, Comondú, Loreto and Mulegé.

5|$|Graham {{continued}} {{to serve in}} the Coldstream Guards after Waterloo. The 2nd Battalion advanced on Paris with the army, remaining there until 1816 as part of the army of occupation, after which they were posted to Cambrai. In November 1818 they returned to England. While stationed in London in 1820, a detachment of Guards were ordered to support the <b>police</b> <b>with</b> the arrest of the Cato Street conspirators, under the command of Captain FitzClarence (later given the title Lord Frederick FitzClarence), one of the illegitimate sons of the Duke of Clarence. The arrest was not straightforward, and a scuffle ensued. The Naval and Military Gazette (May 1845) identified Sergeant Graham as the man who saved FitzClarence's life.|$|E
5|$|In June 1873, around 30 {{members of}} the Assiniboine First Nation {{were killed in the}} Cypress Hills Massacre, {{creating}} a national furore. In response, Macdonald used a Privy Council order to enact the new legislation, formally creating the North-West Mounted <b>Police</b> <b>with</b> the intention of mobilising the force and deploying it early the next year. A report then arrived from Alexander Morris, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, blaming the massacre on the activities of whiskey traders at Fort Whoop-Up; Morris predicted that if action was not taken immediately, there would be a major uprising by the First Nations across the region, into which the United States might choose to intervene. Macdonald was not entirely convinced by the governor's analysis, but nonetheless he agreed to recruit 150 men and send them west to Lower Fort Garry before winter weather blocked the route.|$|E
