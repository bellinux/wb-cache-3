40|$|Molten metal droplet {{detachment}} and plate fusion characteristics, {{which have}} an important bearing on the weld quality, were influenced by the parameters of pulsed current, viz. peak current (I-P), peak duration (T-P), background current (I-B) and background duration (T-B). The complex interdependence of the above parameters of pulsed current {{makes it difficult to}} select the most suitable combination of parameters for welding (Refs. 1 - 3). To resolve this problem, a first estimate of the pulse parametric zone based on burnoff, droplet detachment and are stability criteria was obtained. It has been Further restricted taking into account the short circuit and burnback characteristics. Within this narrowed zone, the suitable combination of the pulsed current parameters has been recommended {{on the basis of a}} combined criteria, viz. uniformity in are length, uniformity in droplet detachment and weld bead surface quality. This is done to obtain good quality welds. These studies have been carried out for a fixed <b>pulse</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> and one droplet detachment per pulse conditions. Further studies have been carried out for different types of droplet detachments, namely background detachment, one droplet detachment per peak, two droplets detachment per peak and three droplets detachment per peak by varying <b>pulse</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>time.</b> The suitable type of droplet detachment has been selected on the basis of uniformity in are length, uniformity in droplet detachment and uniformity in weld bead surface undulation. The effect of types of droplet detachment on weld bead geometry has been studied. The peak energy, are noise level, reinforcement height and heat input were found to be low for background detachments. Also with background detachments, uniformity in are length and weld penetration were found to be high...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{high-strength}} {{aluminium alloys}} as material for injection molding tools to produce small and medium batches of plastic products {{as well as}} prototyping molds is becoming of increasing demand by the tooling industry. These alloys are replacing the traditional use of steel in the cases above because they offer many advantages such as very high thermal conductivity associated with good corrosion and wear resistance presenting good machinability in milling and electrical discharge machining operations. Unfortunately there is little technological knowledge on the Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) of high-strength aluminium alloys, especially about the AMP 8000 alloy. The duty factor, which means the ratio between pulse duration and <b>pulse</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> exerts an important role {{on the performance of}} EDM. This work has carried out an experimental study on the variation of the duty factor in order to analyze its influence on material removal rate and volumetric relative wear under roughing conditions of EDM process.

This study investigates the influence of plasma treatment conditions on the surface activation {{of a range of}} polymers using the PlasmaTreat (Open Air) system. In this study the effect of dc <b>pulse</b> plasma <b>cycle</b> <b>time,</b> compressed air flow rate and the plasma jet nozzle to substrate distance on the plasma discharge was examined. The influence that the dc <b>pulse</b> plasma <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> parameter has on the activation of polypropylene, polystyrene and polycarbonate was also investigated. The level of polymer surface activation was evaluated based on the change in water contact angle after plasma treatment. The polymer surface properties were also monitored using AFM and XPS measurements. The heating effect of the plasma was monitored using both infrared thermographic camera and thermocouple measurements. Plasma diagnostics measurements were obtained using the photo-diode and optical emission spectroscopy techniques. From this study it was concluded that for the PlasmaTreat system the level of plasma activation was closely correlated with the dc pulsed plasma <b>cycle</b> <b>time,</b> which {{is a measure of the}} plasma intensity. For example, the more intense plasma obtained with shorter <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> gave higher levels of polymer activation.

40|$|Electrochemistry {{combined}} with mass spectrometry (EC-MS) is an emerging analytical technique in the imitation of oxidative drug metabolism {{at the early}} stages of new drug development. Here, we present the benefits of electrochemical oxidation by square-wave potential pulses for the oxidation of lidocaine, a test drug compound, on a platinum electrode. Lidocaine was oxidized at constant potential and by square-wave potential <b>pulses</b> with different <b>cycle</b> <b>times,</b> and the reaction products were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [LC-MS(/MS) ]. Application of constant potentials of up to + 5. 0 V resulted in relatively low yields of N-dealkylation and 4 -hydroxylation products, while oxidation by square-wave potential pulses generated up to 50 times more of the 4 -hydroxylation product at <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> between 0. 2 and 12 s (estimated yield of 10 %). The highest yield of the N-dealkylation product was obtained at <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> shorter than 0. 2 s. Tuning of the <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> is thus an important parameter to modulate the selectivity of electrochemical oxidation reactions. The N-oxidation product was only obtained by electrochemical oxidation under air atmosphere due to reaction with electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide. Square-wave potential pulses may also be applicable to modulate the selectivity of electrochemical reactions with other drug compounds in order to generate oxidation products with greater selectivity and higher yield based on the optimization of <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> and potentials. This considerably widens the scope of direct electrochemistry-based oxidation reactions for the imitation of in vivo oxidative drug metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Volume Focusing {{is a new}} {{technique}} based on Phased Array utilization. Some of its advantages are to inspect faster, {{to be able to}} make multi-mode inspection at once, and to increase the depth of field of the UT beam to inspect thick parts with only one probe. This document does not demonstrate or explains concepts, but provide an experimental point of view. This document demonstrates these advantages, but also shows that lateral resolution as well as the ability to detect flaws on the same axis is preserved. Finally, typical application work for Power Generation parts inspection illustrates a real case. Conventional phased array inspection techniques consist of setting virtual probes along the Phased Array, by programming the aperture (group of elements firing or receiving together) with a delay pattern to provide the same effect as a focusing lens. The electronics are usually fast enough to scan different settings at each transmitted <b>pulses,</b> so-called <b>cycles</b> or <b>time</b> slots...|$|R

In an effort to identify and act accordingly when these variations occur, the development of a software application to analyse equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> via OPC is investigated in this project. Manufacturing organisations continuously seek improvements {{in equipment}} performance and output. A common improvement made is the reduction of equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time,</b> this provides an increase in output for a relatively small capital outlay. These improvements remain relatively unchecked and variations in <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> due to numerous factors continue to influence equipment performance. An equipment <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> analyser can be used to monitor and report variations in <b>cycle</b> <b>time.</b> The resulting information can be used to predict equipment failures and allow maintenance departments to plan corrective actions.
