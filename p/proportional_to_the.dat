5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model is <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> square of the mass and inversely <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> period. This value {{can be used to}} estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|The nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} constructs a clustering in time <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{square of}} the number of points to be clustered. This is also <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> size of its input, when the input is provided {{in the form of an}} explicit distance matrix. The algorithm uses an amount of memory <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of points, when it is used for clustering methods such as Ward's method that allow constant-time calculation of the distance between clusters. However, for some other clustering methods it uses a larger amount of memory in an auxiliary data structure with which it keeps track of the distances between pairs of clusters.|$|E

5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> degree of viremia, and inversely <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} this is that the {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface is <b>proportional</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mean curvature, as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E
