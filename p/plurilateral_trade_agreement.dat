If adopted, a treaty of this form would impose a strong, top-down enforcement regime imposing new cooperation requirements upon ISPs, including perfunctory disclosure of customer information, as well as measures restricting the use of online privacy tools. The proposal also specifies a plan to encourage developing nations to accept the legal regime. Talking points from the European Commission, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and others have published selected passages ostensibly from this document.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{controversy}} over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) – a <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> involving a dozen nations from throughout the Pacific Rim – and its impact upon the environment, biodiversity, and climate change. The secretive treaty negotiations involve Australia and New Zealand; countries from South East Asia such as Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Japan; the South American nations of Peru and Chile; {{and the members of}} the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Canada, Mexico and the United States. There was an agreement reached between the parties in October 2015. The participants asserted: ‘We expect this historic agreement to promote economic growth, support higher-paying jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in our countries; and to promote transparency, good governance, and strong labor and environmental protections. ’ The final texts of the agreement were published in November 2015. There has been discussion as to whether other countries – such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Korea – will join the deal. There {{has been much}} debate about the impact of this proposed treaty upon intellectual property, the environment, biodiversity and climate change. There have been similar concerns about the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – a proposed trade agreement between the United States and the European Union. In 2011, the United States Trade Representative developed a Green Paper on trade, conservation, and the environment in the context of the TPP. In its rhetoric, the United States Trade Representative has maintained that it has been pushing for strong, enforceable environmental standards in the TPP. In a key statement in 2014, the United States Trade Representative Mike Froman insisted: ‘The United States’ position on the environment in the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations is this: environmental stewardship is a core American value, and we will insist on a robust, fully enforceable environment chapter in the TPP or we will not come to agreement. ’ The United States Trade Representative maintained: ‘Our proposals in the TPP are centered around the enforcement of environmental laws, including those implementing multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) in TPP partner countries, and also around trailblazing, first-ever conservation proposals that will raise standards across the region’. Moreover, the United States Trade Representative asserted: ‘Furthermore, our proposals would enhance international cooperation and create new opportunities for public participation in environmental governance and enforcement. ’ The United States Trade Representative has provided this public outline of the Environment Chapter of the TPP: A meaningful outcome on environment will ensure that the agreement appropriately addresses important trade and environment challenges and enhances the mutual supportiveness of trade and environment. The Trans-Pacific Partnership countries share the view that the environment text should include effective provisions on trade-related issues that would help to reinforce environmental protection and are discussing an effective institutional arrangement to oversee implementation and a specific cooperation framework for addressing capacity building needs. They also are discussing proposals on new issues, such as marine fisheries and other conservation issues, biodiversity, invasive alien species, climate change, and environmental goods and services. Mark Linscott, an assistant Trade Representative testified: ‘An environment chapter in the TPP should strengthen country commitments to enforce their environmental laws and regulations, including in areas related to ocean and fisheries governance, through the effective enforcement obligation subject to dispute settlement. ’ Inside US Trade has commented: ‘While not initially expected to be among the most difficult areas, the environment chapter has emerged as a formidable challenge, partly due to disagreement over the United States proposal to make environmental obligations binding under the TPP dispute settlement mechanism’. Joshua Meltzer from the Brookings Institute contended that the trade agreement could be a boon for the protection of the environment in the Pacific Rim: Whether it is depleting fisheries, declining biodiversity or reduced space in the atmosphere for Greenhouse Gas emissions, the underlying issue is resource scarcity. And in a world where an additional 3 billion people are expected to enter the middle class over the next 15 years, countries need to find new and creative ways to cooperate in order to satisfy the legitimate needs of their population for growth and opportunity while using resources in a manner that is sustainable for current and future generations. The TPP parties already represent a diverse range of developed and developing countries. Should the TPP become a free trade agreement of the Asia-Pacific region, it will include the main developed and developing countries and will be a strong basis for building a global consensus on these trade and environmental issues. The TPP has been promoted by its proponents as a boon to the environment. The United States Trade Representative has maintained that the TPP will protect the environment: ‘The United States’ position on the environment in the TPP negotiations is this: environmental stewardship is a core American value, and we will insist on a robust, fully enforceable environment chapter in the TPP or we will not come to agreement. ’ The United States Trade Representative discussed ‘Trade for a Greener World’ on World Environment Day. Andrew Robb, at the time the Australian Trade and Investment Minister, vowed that the TPP will contain safeguards for the protection of the environment. In November 2015, after the release of the TPP text, Rohan Patel, the Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, sought to defend the environmental credentials of the TPP. He contended that the deal had been supported by the Nature Conservancy, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative, the World Wildlife Fund, and World Animal Protection. The United States Congress, though, has been conflicted by the United States Trade Representative’s arguments about the TPP and the environment. In 2012, members of the United States Congress - including Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), and John Kerry (D-MA) – wrote a letter, arguing that the trade agreement needs to provide strong protection for the environment: ‘We believe that a ' 21 st century agreement' must have an environment chapter that guarantees ongoing sustainable trade and creates jobs, and this is what American businesses and consumers want and expect also. ’ The group stressed that ‘A binding and enforceable TPP environment chapter that stands up for American interests is critical to our support of the TPP’. The Congressional leaders maintained: ‘We believe the 2007 bipartisan congressional consensus on environmental provisions included in recent trade agreements should serve as the framework for the environment chapter of the TPP. ’ In 2013, senior members of the Democratic leadership expressed their opposition to granting President Barack Obama a fast-track authority in respect of the TPP House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said: ‘No on fast-track – Camp-Baucus – out of the question. ’ Senator Majority leader Harry Reid commented: ‘I’m against Fast-Track: Everyone would be well-advised to push this right now. ’ Senator Elizabeth Warren has been particularly critical of the process and the substance of the negotiations in the TPP: From what I hear, Wall Street, pharmaceuticals, telecom, big polluters and outsourcers are all salivating at the chance to rig the deal in the upcoming trade talks. So the question is, Why are the trade talks secret? You’ll love this answer. Boy, the things you learn on Capitol Hill. I actually have had supporters of the deal say to me ‘They have to be secret, because if the American people knew what was actually in them, they would be opposed. 		Think about that. Real people, people whose jobs are at stake, small-business owners who don’t want to compete with overseas companies that dump their waste in rivers and hire workers for a dollar a day—those people, people without an army of lobbyists—they would be opposed. I believe if people across this country would be opposed to a particular trade agreement, then maybe that trade agreement should not happen. The Finance Committee in the United States Congress deliberated over the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations in 2014. The new chair Ron Wyden has argued that there needs to be greater transparency in trade. Nonetheless, he has mooted the possibility of a ‘smart-track’ to reconcile the competing demands of the Obama Administration, and United States Congress. Wyden insisted: ‘The new breed of trade challenges spawned over the last generation must be addressed in imaginative new policies and locked into enforceable, ambitious, job-generating trade agreements. ’ He emphasized that such agreements ‘must reflect the need for a free and open Internet, strong labor rights and environmental protections. ’ Elder Democrat Sander Levin warned that the TPP failed to provide proper protection for the environment: The TPP parties are considering a different structure to protect the environment than the one adopted in the May 10 Agreement, which directly incorporated seven multilateral environmental agreements into the text of past trade agreements. While the form is less important than the substance, the TPP must provide an overall level of environmental protection that upholds and builds upon the May 10 standard, including fully enforceable obligations. But many of our trading partners are actively seeking to weaken the text to the point of falling short of that standard, including on key issues like conservation. Nonetheless, 2015, President Barack Obama was able to secure the overall support of the United States Congress for his ‘fast-track’ authority. This was made possible by the Republicans and dissident Democrats. Notably, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden switched sides, and was transformed from a critic of the TPP to an apologist for the TPP. For their part, green political parties and civil society organisations have been concerned about the secretive nature of the negotiations; and the substantive implications of the treaty for the environment. Environmental groups and climate advocates have been sceptical of the environmental claims made by the White House for the TPP. The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, the Australian Greens and the Green Party of Canada have released a joint declaration on the TPP observing: ‘More than just another trade agreement, the TPP provisions could hinder access to safe, affordable medicines, weaken local content rules for media, stifle high-tech innovation, and even restrict the ability of future governments to legislate for the good of public health and the environment’. In the United States, civil society groups such as the Sierra Club, Public Citizen, WWF, the Friends of the Earth, the Rainforest Action Network and 350. org have raised concerns about the TPP and the environment. Allison Chin, President of the Sierra Club, complained about the lack of transparency, due process, and public participation in the TPP talks: ‘This is a stealth affront to the principles of our democracy. ’ Maude Barlow’s The Council of Canadians has also been concerned about the TPP and environmental justice. New Zealand Sustainability Council executive director Simon Terry said the agreement showed ‘minimal real gains for nature’. A number of organisations have joined a grand coalition of civil society organisations, which are opposed to the grant of a fast-track. On the 15 th January 2013, WikiLeaks released the draft Environment Chapter of the TPP - along with a report by the Chairs of the Environmental Working Group. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks' publisher, stated: ‘Today's WikiLeaks release shows that the public sweetener in the TPP is just media sugar water. ’ He observed: ‘The fabled TPP environmental chapter turns out to be a toothless public relations exercise with no enforcement mechanism. ’ This article provides a critical examination of the draft Environment Chapter of the TPP. The overall argument of the article is that the Environment Chapter of the TPP is an exercise in greenwashing – it is a public relations exercise by the United States Trade Representative, rather than a substantive regime for the protection of the environment in the Pacific Rim. Greenwashing has long been a problem in commerce, in which companies making misleading and deceptive claims about the environment. In his 2012 book, Greenwash: Big Brands and Carbon Scams, Guy Pearse considers the rise of green marketing and greenwashing. Government greenwashing is also a significant issue. In his book Storms of My Grandchildren, the climate scientist James Hansen raises his concerns about government greenwashing. Such a problem is apparent with the TPP – in which there was a gap between the assertions of the United States Government, and the reality of the agreement. This article contends that the TPP fails to meet the expectations created by President Barack Obama, the White House, and the United States Trade Representative about the environmental value of the agreement. First, this piece considers the relationship of the TPP to multilateral environmental treaties. Second, it explores whether the provisions in respect of the environment are enforceable. Third, this article examines the treatment of trade and biodiversity in the TPP. Fourth, this study considers the question of marine capture fisheries. Fifth, there is an evaluation of the cursory text in the TPP on conservation. Sixth, the article considers trade in environmental services under the TPP. Seventh, this article highlights the tensions between the TPP and substantive international climate action. It is submitted that the TPP undermines effective and meaningful government action and regulation in respect of climate change. The conclusion also highlights that a number of other chapters of the TPP will impact upon the protection of the environment – including the Investment Chapter, the Intellectual Property Chapter, the Technical Barriers to Trade Chapter, and the text on public procurement...|$|E

40|$|Sanitary and {{phytosanitary}} matters {{have acquired}} greater {{significance in the}} region's trade, {{as reflected in the}} significant number of complaints brought before the various dispute settlement mechanisms pertaining to the regional integration schemes. This may be attributed to the importance of the Latin American countries in world agricultural trade and to different phytosanitary and zoosanitary standards required by each. Given the multiplication of bilateral and plurilateral agreements in Latin America and the Caribbean, convergence on the sanitary standards required under such accords is crucial for the trade integration of a region that is an agro-exporter par excellence.

From a developing country perspective, a truly effective TPRM should accomplish several interrelated goals which together should add up to a boost to investor confidence in developing country markets. Several improvements that may move us closer to such a regime are discussed. These include better organization and retention of the data already collected as part of the TPRM process, better dissemination of the information collected as part of the TPRM process, and technical assistance in the use of this information. "The purpose of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism ('TPRM') is to contribute to improved adherence by all Members to rules, disciplines and commitments made under the Multilateral <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreements</b> and, where applicable, the <b>Plurilateral</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreements,</b> and hence to the smoother functioning of the multilateral trading system, by achieving greater transparency in, and understanding of, the trade policies and practices of Members.

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] A {{defining}} characteristic of today's international trading system is that <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> like the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) are gaining in importance relative to the gridlocked Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations. These more selective <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> pose new and so far little understood challenges for the governance of the international trading system, {{especially with regard to}} the distribution of liberalization gains among participants which differ in their stage of development, their institutions, and their resources and capabilities. The paper examines India's experience with ITA. Initially, the main concern was to attract inward FDI and to facilitate the growth of its then still nascent IT services industry. For electronics manufacturing however, the analysis shows that gains from trade liberalization were overshadowed by substantial costs - with rising electronics imports inflating the country's current account deficit to unsustainable record highs, while eroding domestic electronic manufacturing and innovation. To improve reciprocity in the distribution of gains from ITA, the paper suggests that latecomers like India deserve, under certain conditions, special and differentiated treatment. In turn, these countries need to agree to reforms that reduce investment barriers in their domestic industries, such as restrictive regulations and discrimination against foreign direct investment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to perform an}} empirical analysis {{of the effects of}} “labor clauses ” provided in bilateral or <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (or regional <b>trade</b> agreements: RTAs) on working conditions that laborers in the RTA signatory countries actually face, using macro-level data {{for a wide variety of}} countries. The paper first reexamines the labor-provision classification of 223 RTAs in force proposed in the author’s other study (Kamata, 2014) by reviewing the texts of a selected set of those RTAs, and re-defines “RTAs with labor clauses ” according to two criteria: (i) the agreement urges or expects the signatory countries to harmonize their domestic labor standards with internationally recognized standards, and (ii) the agreement stipulates the procedures for consultations and/or dispute settlement on labor-condition issues between the signatory countries. Based on this RTA labor-clause (re-) classification, this paper then estimates the impacts of a country’s trade intensities with partners of RTAs with labor clauses and of those without on four measured working conditions in the country: average earnings, average work hours, fatal occupational injury rate, and the number of the ILO’s fundamental conventions ratified. The empirical result indicates that RTAs with labor clauses do not differ from RTA...|$|R
40|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two types of}} <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (PAs) among WTO Members, an exclusive and an open variant. While {{the benefits of the}} former agreements are shared among participants only, the latter are implemented on an MFN-basis, thus profiting non-signatories as well. The most prominent examples are the Information Technology Agreement (1996) and the Fourth and Fifth Protocols under the GATS (1997) on telecom and financial services, respectively. To preclude "free riding", their entry into force was made contingent on the participation of a "critical mass" of countries. The respective benchmarks, usually market shares of some 80 % or more, are quite challenging, however. To promote more widespread use of plurilaterals, given the plethora of pressing policy concerns, whether investment-, competition- or labour-related, and the persistent stalemate in the Doha Round negotiations, the conclusion of exclusive agreements is thus being (re-) considered in ongoing policy discussions. This article takes a sceptical view, since any such PA would need to be agreed by consensus among all 160 -odd WTO Members. It may prove more rewarding to further explore the potential of open agreements to address policy concerns among interested Members either in the form of co-ordinated improvements of their current schedules or, if not covered by existing treaty frameworks, as "WTO-extra" understandings...|$|R

30|$|Schhot (2013) also {{explores the}} {{political}} machinations of trust at work between Beijing leaders and Washington. This has {{time and again}} reflected in certain ways, biannual US–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue being one of them. Though China may not be ready to accept the large array of TPP obligations related to transparency and discipline related to government intervention in the market, China’s increasing efforts toward aligning to TPP standards are much apparent in two major ways. One is its constructive efforts toward domestic economic reforms {{and the other is}} its participation in <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> and in FTAs and bilateral investment treaties. But TPP obligations do also pose great challenges to China in the form of labor rights, freedom of data flows and intellectual property. Thus, China has for some time been weighing these challenges that TPP obligations are likely to pose to its policies and competitiveness as against new opportunities that TPP could fetch for it. Though uncertainty lingers as to whether China would amend its trade policies like Vietnam, in a definitive conclusion, if TPP expands to other key Asian trading partners, China would have to reconsider its stance on TPP membership. One of these options would include deepening its economic engagement with the USA, which includes efforts under way in APEC to build a Free Trade Area of Asia Pacific (FTAAP).|$|R

40|$|Competition {{law is a}} tool first {{employed}} by countries {{more than a hundred}} years ago, to address issues relating to restrictions on competition conducted by private firms. Competition law is still predominantly an instrument to resolve national problems while the dominance of market based economies in the last fifty years, particularly following the collapse of the eastern block, in combination with improvements in transport, communications and technology have progressively dismantled national borders and internationalised trade. Trade liberalisation has in turn led to practices by firms that have an effect on the territories of more than one country. Attempts to address this paradox - national rules to address international issues - have appeared on several occasions in the last 80 years at the international, regional and lately bilateral level. The research question that the thesis addresses is: What is the role of the competition law and policy of the EU in the formation of international competition rules (norms). This question encompasses two main concepts: international agreements with competition elements, and the role of EU competition law and policy. As to the former, four main forms of agreements are discussed in separate chapters of the thesis: bilateral and tripartite enforcement cooperation <b>agreements,</b> bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> with competition provisions, <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> and the negotiations over a possible multilateral agreement on competition. As to the latter, the EU is the focus of examination of these agreements.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of bilateral or <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (or regional <b>trade</b> agreements: RTAs) include "labor clauses" that require or urge the signatory countries to commit to maintaining {{a certain level of}} labor standards. This paper performs an empirical analysis of the impacts of such labor clauses provided in RTAs on working conditions that laborers in the RTA signatory countries actually face, using macro-level data {{for a wide variety of}} countries. The paper first examines the texts of labor provisions in more than 220 effective RTAs and (re-) classifies "RTAs with labor clauses" according to two criteria: (i) the agreement urges or expects the signatory countries to harmonize their domestic labor standards with internationally recognized standards, and (ii) the agreement stipulates the procedures for consultations and/or dispute settlement on labor-condition issues between the signatory countries. Based on this labor-clause RTA classification, the paper estimates the impacts of RTA labor clauses on working conditions in countries with two empirical specifications using the sample covering 136 countries or economies and years from 1995 through 2011. The estimation is extended to takes into account possible lags in the labor-condition effects of labor clauses as well as to consider potential difference in the impacts for countries in different income levels. The empirical results for the four measures of labor conditions (mean monthly real earnings, mean weekly work hours per employee, fatal occupational injury rate, and the number of the ILO's Core Conventions ratified) find no evidence for possible pro-labor-condition effects of RTA labor clauses overall, which should be consistent with the view of economics literature that questions the relevance of linking trade policy with issues in the domestic labor standards...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Bilateral free <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (BTAs) {{have been}} proliferating. The {{outcome of this}} {{proliferation}} of often overlapping BTAs and <b>plurilateral</b> free <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (PTAs) is described as the spaghetti bowl effect or, in the Asian region, the noodle bowl effect. This is costly, and welfare reducing. How do we remedy the situation? In this paper, we consider the various options proposed {{in dealing with the}} spaghetti bowl, and assess their ability to do so. A general limitation of these proposals is their tendency to group all kinds of BTAs together, treating them as a homogeneous group. Thus, the proposals ignore underlying differences in motivation in forming BTAs. To overcome this, we develop a taxonomy for classifying BTAs by motivation before considering the effectiveness of the different remedies proposed. We find that each proposal has its pros and cons, and can cater for different types of BTAs. Thus, a combination of the various proposals may be warranted, even {{in the event of an}} expeditious and bona fide conclusion to the Doha Round. Copyright 2009 The Author.

40|$|The {{interface}} between trade and Internet governance {{is one of}} the most complex policy challenges in the current-day digital economy. This working paper highlights the following observations and findings on the delicate and complex relationship between international trade and the Internet: Recent preferential <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (PTAs) such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) and the Japan - Mongolia Economic Partnership Agreement (Japan - Mongolia FTA) contain legal provisions on cybersecurity, data protection, data localisation, consumer protection, net neutrality, spam control, and protection of online intellectual property, intended to facilitate electronic commerce and enable cross-border data flows. However, these provisions will also have a lasting impact on important aspects of Internet regulation. Similar provisions are likely to appear in other ongoing trade deals such as the <b>Trade</b> in Services <b>Agreement</b> (TISA) and the renegotiation of North American Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreement</b> (NAFTA). International <b>trade</b> law does not contain adequate tools to address all aspects of Internet data flows because: (a) Internet is not just an important platform for trade, but also a site for political, cultural and social engagement - the latter aspects largely relate to the domestic regulatory space of countries and fall outside the scope of international trade law; (b) trade lawyers and policy-makers have insufficient knowledge of the technical and policy aspects of the Internet; and (c) the ideological divide between countries on issues including online censorship and surveillance, cybersecurity and privacy (which deeply impact cross-border data flows) cannot be resolved through international <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> Yet, many issues related to Internet policy are also central to trade in digital economy, and thereby, not entirely avoidable in international trade law. Internet openness, security and trust are fundamental to the governance of Internet data flows. Measures designed to enforce Internet security and Internet trust, when implemented in a well-reasoned and proportionate manner, do not act as impediments to Internet openness - to the contrary, these measures play an essential role in facilitating efficient and secure data flows through the Internet. Thus, issues of cybersecurity, privacy and data protection can not only act as barriers to electronic commerce, but also facilitate electronic commerce - this perspective necessitates a reorientation of legal provisions in <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> International <b>trade</b> institutions should explore both formal and informal means to engage with the Internet policy community in course of dialogues and/or trade negotiations within the World Trade Organization (WTO) as well as bilateral and <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> and in multistakeholder platforms such as the Internet Governance Forum. Further, international trade tribunals can rely on the technical and policy expertise of the Internet community to resolve certain complex trade disputes in international trade law...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{traces the}} {{development}} of the TRIPs Agreement and explores why less developed countries were dissatisfied with the international intellectual property system. It also looks at the future challenges confronting these countries and {{what they need to do}} to preserve the goals and intentions behind the TRIPs negotiations. The Article begins by describing the four different narratives used to explain the origins of the TRIPs Agreement. It contends that, while none of these narratives is complete, each of them provides valuable insight into understanding the context in which the Agreement was created. The Article then explores why less developed countries have been dissatisfied with the international intellectual property system and discusses latest developments in the area, such as the recent WTO debacle in Cancun, the proliferation of bilateral and <b>plurilateral</b> free <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> and the increasing use of technological protection measures. The Article concludes by offering suggestions on how less developed countries can take advantage of the TRIPs Agreement and reform the international intellectual property system...|$|R

It provivdes empirical evidence and qualitative analysis on how the process of trade integration worked and {{what could have been}} done for it to have worked better. Where appropriate it elaborates on forces or institutions driving the process of integration. The paper uses descriptive statistics and some off-the-shelf indicators to track progress in trade integration which is the main pillar of building ASEAN Economic Community. Second part of the paper examines the progress in building effective integration with the other trading partners. Three difference but inter-related issues are analyzed. 1) ASEAN in world economy in terms of relative size, discrimination of other partners in trade, and treatment that ASEAN obtains in importing markets of developed countries compared to average of all developing countries; 2) the WTO membership and negotiation positioning of individual ASEAN members, and 3) the role of bilateral and <b>plurilateral</b> preferential <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> of ASEAN member countries and of the ASEAN as a bloc.

40|$|FULL TEXT: In this {{submission}} the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance comments on whether Australia should participate {{as a third}} party in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) dispute settlement panel requested by the United States concerning the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights by China. The Alliance {{is aware of the}} disputes in question and is aware of justifiable concern regarding levels of counterfeiting and piracy in China. However, the Alliance is not convinced that Australia 2 ̆ 7 s best course of action to address their members 2 ̆ 7 concerns and those of the audiovisual and cultural industries more broadly is to join the United States 2 ̆ 7 dispute as a third party. The Australian Government is currently negotiating a free <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> with China. The Alliance considers that Australia 2 ̆ 7 s concerns regarding the manner in which Australian interests are being negatively affected by lack of enforcement of intellectual property rights is best addressed {{in the course of the}} negotiation of this agreement. The Alliance is aware that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has held a number of workshops and seminars on a range of issues, including intellectual property, as background to the negotiations and that this approach is proving to be a productive one. By contrast, joining the dispute as a third party might mitigate against the collaborative and capacity building approach that the Department has adopted in the <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> negotiations. Further, the Alliance understands that Australia 2 ̆ 7 s copyright legislation has been changed at the behest of the United States in the wake of the concessions made in the United States – Australia Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreement</b> but is not supportive of the consequent amendments. In particular, the Alliance was not supportive of the introduction of criminal sanctions and the extension of copyright term. The Alliance considers that determination of legal thresholds and the availability of criminal procedures and penalties is a matter for individual nations to determine subject to compliance with obligations under TRIPS. Finally, the Alliance is aware that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a very large workload supporting the range of trade negotiations currently underway. The Alliance considers that the Department 2 ̆ 7 s resources are best directed towards a successful conclusion to the current Doha Round and then towards addressing the current bilateral and <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> in negotiation. Joining the United States dispute would put pressure on resources that could be better utilised elsewhere and in respect of the substance of the dispute Australia 2 ̆ 7 s interests will be better served through the course of the negotiations for the free <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> with China, as indicated above. Certainly, the United States is well place to pursue its own trade objectives unassisted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the ongoing}} plurilateral negotiations {{for a new}} <b>Agreement</b> on <b>Trade</b> in Services. Its aim is to answer to the following set of questions: (1) What are the motivations behind these negotiations {{as well as the}} objectives of the new <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade</b> in services <b>agreement?</b> How will the architecture of the new agreement look like? (2) What are the interests involved in negotiating this new <b>plurilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> on <b>trade</b> in services? and (3) How will it fit into the multilateral trading system revolving around the WTO? According to the findings of the paper, the new deal that is promoted by 23 like-minded WTO Members, including the EU, is a policy response to disappointment over the protracted multilateral talks and the very impasse of the Doha Round. Yet, the stakes on negotiating an ambitious market opening for services are quite high, given the importance of services in international trade and particularly their crucial role in global production networks, that dominate nowadays global production, trade and investments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNew Zealand's Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC) {{has been}} highly {{successful}} in facilitating affordable access to medicines {{through a combination}} of aggressive price negotiations, innovative procurement mechanisms, and careful evaluation of value for money. Recently the US government, through the establishment of a series of bilateral and <b>plurilateral</b> “free” <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> has attempted to constrain the pharmaceutical access programs of other countries in order to promote the interests of the pharmaceutical industry. The Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) represents the latest example; through the TPPA the US is seeking to eliminate therapeutic reference pricing, introduce appeals processes for pharmaceutical companies to challenge formulary listing and pricing decisions, and introduce onerous disclosure and “transparency” provisions that facilitate industry involvement in decision-making around coverage and pricing of medicines (and medical devices). This paper argues that the US agenda, if successfully prosecuted, would be likely to increase costs and reduce access to affordable medicines for New Zealanders. This would in turn be likely to exacerbate known inequities in access to medicines and thus disproportionately affect disadvantaged population groups, including Māori and Pacific peoples...|$|R
40|$|The global {{economic}} crisis {{has affected the}} East Asian economies via trade and investment. The export-led model which had {{been responsible for the}} “East Asian Miracle” now must redirect the basis of growth from exports sent to the US and Europe to regional and domestic demand. Regional trade integration has been market-led through production networks and foreign direct investment (FDI). Since the proliferation of bilateral and <b>plurilateral</b> free <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (FTA) and economic partnership agreements (EPA) has not resulted in an integrated regional market, it is important that East Asia seek an arrangement for a region-wide FTA/EPA. Currently, there are proposals for an ASEAN+ 3, an ASEAN+ 6, Pan-Asia, and Asia Pacific initiatives. While proponents of a region-wide FTA/EPA highlight its benefits, skeptics and critics point to the difficulties of reaching consensus in a region with widely varying political, economic, and social systems. Ultimately it will depend on a political-economic decision based on a cost-benefit analysis of liberalization, facilitation, and cooperation in a region-wide FTA.

40|$|This article revisits a past {{article by}} the authors in which they propose a new {{methodology}} for analyzing trade issues, cross-cutting through the three ―layers‖ of international trade regulation: so-called multisystem of trade regulation. In this text the authors include another approach to international trade regulation studies, proposing {{a better understanding of}} the influence of transnational enterprises in the shaping of modern internal trade. In this sense, the transnationals are not only influencing international trade regulation through lobbying in traditional fora (especially in <b>plurilateral</b> and preferential <b>trade</b> <b>agreements),</b> but they are also becoming sources of their own private regulations, particularly regarding private standards. In this sense, the study of international trade regulation must take into account the activities and interests of these indispensible actors, critically analyzing the differences between the regulatory logic of states against the one keen to transnational...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{a number}} of {{procedural}} and substantive considerations arising from ongoing attempts to craft a <b>plurilateral</b> <b>Trade</b> in Services <b>Agreement</b> (TISA) among the so-called “Really Good Friends of Services” coalition of WTO Members. The paper suggests that considerable scope exists to move forward a multilateral negotiating agenda on services that both the digital revolution and a continued surge of preferential rule-making has rendered increasingly obsolete. As the most significant attempt to date to craft a GATS Article V-compatible PTA in services, TISA offers considerable promise. The paper, however, cautions that the case for embedding TISA into the architecture of WTO rules alongside the General <b>Agreement</b> on <b>Trade</b> in Services or in its place is weak on both procedural and substantive grounds {{to the extent that}} the ongoing talks take place behind doors that remain closed even to the WTO Secretariat, let alone to many of the world’s leading developing country suppliers of services, and involve potentially significant departures from GATS rules liable to complicate any hoped for multilateral migratory journey.

40|$|Due to {{multilateral}} {{trade liberalization}} {{and a large}} number of bilateral and <b>plurilateral</b> preferential <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> border barriers to trade, especially tariffs, have decreased tremendously. As a result, trade facilitation plays an increasingly important role in removing behind-the-border trade barriers which have become a major trade obstacle. Realizing this, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program created two important initiatives for the improvement of transportation and trade facilitation. Complementing the ADB's GMS program, Thailand has implemented several national infrastructure and trade facilitation projects. However, these trade facilitation initiatives have yet to positively impact microenterprises, especially the producers of traditional knowledge-based goods in border communities. With a renewed emphasis on rural economic growth, {{it is important to recognize}} the challenges microenterprises face and the potential benefits that could be enjoyed if proper policies were put in place to promote their economic integration. This paper illustrates the results of a survey performed by Cheewatrakoolpong et al. (2011) analyzing the main constraints microenterprises face in expanding their businesses and in export promotion. The findings suggest that better access to microfinance products and the procedure for accessing microfinance are instrumental in enabling small businesses to take advantage of trade facilitation initiatives in place. In addition, better coordination between offices of provincial development, the provincial chambers of commerce and other academies such as vocational schools or universities to provide necessary skills and knowledge to the poor and microenterprises. The community groups also have the potential to be very influential in providing knowledge sharing, skills training and access to microfinance and should be explored...|$|R
40|$|The “Asian Paradox” in the Northeast of the {{continent}} appears to be particularly evident if seen through European eyes. While one of the tightest networks of intra-regional trade binds the economies of China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, their political leaders hardly ever connect {{with each other in}} substantive exchanges. Cold images of frozen faces and of an “icy lady” seem to contrast with the warm embraces that businesspeople enjoy after successful deals over borders. However, is this the view only {{in the eyes of the}} European beholder, who is used to the myriad of regular institutionalised meetings at all political and bureaucratic levels of the EU? Northeast Asia comprises two of the three biggest national economies in the world and on the basis of its interdependence flourishes economically – with the exception of Japan – with GDP growth-rates above OECD average. At the same time, in view of unresolved historical legacies their leading politicians still feel forced to keep frozen faces because of voters’ gazes of self-instilled nationalisms back home. Homogeneous cultures of Confucianism and shame rather than guilt, notably on the islands and the peninsula, maintain a very high level of national identity, in spite of a growing awareness of economic interdependence and globalisation that even conservative schoolbooks and dominant mainstream media cannot refute anymore. Nevertheless, fledgeling attempts to facilitate the flow of goods and services across national borders through bilateral and <b>plurilateral</b> free <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> seem to advance, albeit only slowly. China, Japan and South Korea have managed to institutionalise at the level of rotating ambassadors at the tri-lateral secretariat in Seoul some forms of cooperation. “Hot-lines” of emergency communications have been installed at the highest level to fend off sudden misunderstandings related to still looming territorial disputes. This paper will explore the above issues with concrete evidence and examples, notwithstanding the author’s perspective as an observer from Europe...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{advances}} {{the view}} that while free trade and trade liberalization under the multilateral framework is the first best policy on purely theoretical grounds, {{the theory of the}} second best in the form of regional, plurilateral and bilateral free trade arrangements is at work in the real world. The methodology of economics is an important discipline; however, dysfunctional and power-structured multilateralism, heterogeneous economic structures and diverse development paths and levels render a political economy approach based on strategic pragmatism more realistic. In addition, empirical results have demonstrated that regional, plurilateral and bilateral free <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> can offer benefits to complement and supplement multilateralism provided these arrangements are consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} reinforce {{the view that}} while free trade and trade liberalization under the multilateral framework is the first best policy, in the real world, the theory of the second best in regional, plurilateral and bilateral free trade arrangements is at work. A brief overview is germane to capture prevailing trends and developments in trade liberalization, related investment facilitation and other factor flows and economic integration, as the paradigm appears to have moved from multilateral and regional to <b>plurilateral</b> and bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (see Radtke, and others, eds., 2002). After this stocktaking at various levels and modalities, some interpretations of the economic and geopolitical nuances and impact of trade policy in the broader context of foreign economic policy by various actors in the global economy are attempted in section II. Section III focuses on issues and challenges in the Asia-Pacific region, from which conclusions, policy implications and prospects are drawn in section IV. I.

40|$|The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), which {{entered into}} force on January 1, 1995, {{remains the most}} {{comprehensive}} intellectual property agreement ever adopted by the international community. Building on two century-old cornerstone agreements – the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris Convention) and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Berne Convention) – the TRIPS Agreement provides minimum protection of intellectual property rights {{in a wide variety}} of areas. The Agreement also strengthens intellectual property enforcement while requiring countries to abide by the mandatory dispute settlement process of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Since the adoption of the TRIPS Agreement, developed countries have sought to raise the international standards of intellectual property protection and enforcement by establishing bilateral, regional and <b>plurilateral</b> <b>trade,</b> investment and intellectual property agreements. Particularly controversial are recent efforts to negotiate the Anti-Counterfeiting <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreement</b> (ACTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement.
