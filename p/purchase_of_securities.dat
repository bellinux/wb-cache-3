25|$|In the U.S., the Federal Reserve most {{commonly}} uses overnight repurchase agreements (repos) to temporarily create money, or reverse repos to temporarily destroy money, which offset temporary {{changes in the}} level of bank reserves. The Federal Reserve also makes outright purchases and sales of securities through the System Open Market Account (SOMA) with its manager over the Trading Desk at the New York Reserve Bank. The trade of securities in the SOMA changes the balance of bank reserves, which also affects short-term interest rates. The SOMA manager is responsible for trades that result in a short-term interest rate near the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or create money by the outright <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities.</b> More rarely will it permanently destroy money by the outright sale of securities.

500|$|The first {{instance}} of a non-governmental attempt {{to put an}} issue before the Constitutional Tribunal came from Non-constituency Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam.

[...] Jeyaretnam interpreted this to mean that the giving of a loan required parliamentary and presidential approval. The Finance Minister Dr. Richard Hu Tsu Tau did not agree with Jeyaretnam's interpretation of the provision, and stated that the Attorney-General had given advice that the granting of loans and the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> of this type had the prior approval of two Presidents.|$|E
60|$|The same effects {{which would}} thus {{arise from the}} {{discovery}} of a treasure accompany the process by which bank-notes, {{or any of the other}} substitutes for money, take the place of the precious metals. Suppose(282) that the United States possessed a currency, wholly metallic, of $200,000,000, and that suddenly $200,000,000 of bank-notes were sent into circulation. If these were issued by bankers, they would be employed in loans, or in the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities,</b> and would therefore create a sudden fall in the rate of interest, which would probably send a great part of the $200,000,000 of gold out of the country as capital, to seek a higher rate of interest elsewhere, before there had been time for any action on prices. But we will suppose that the notes are not issued by bankers, or money-lenders of any kind, but by manufacturers, in the payment of wages and the purchase of materials, or by the Government [as, e.g., greenbacks] in its ordinary expenses, so that the whole amount would be rapidly carried into the markets for commodities. The following would be the natural order of consequences: All prices would rise greatly. Exportation would almost cease; importation would be prodigiously stimulated. A great balance of payments would become due, the exchanges would turn against the United States, to the full extent of the cost of exporting money; and the surplus coin would pour itself rapidly forth, over the various countries of the world, in the order of their proximity, geographically and commercially, to the United States.|$|E

50|$|The Federal Reserve {{has three}} main {{mechanisms}} for manipulating the money supply. It can {{buy or sell}} treasury securities. Selling securities {{has the effect of}} reducing the monetary base (because it accepts money in return for <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities),</b> taking that money out of circulation. Purchasing treasury securities increases the monetary base (because it pays out hard currency in exchange for accepting securities). Secondly, the discount rate can be changed. And finally, the Federal Reserve can adjust the reserve requirement, which can affect the money multiplier; the reserve requirement is adjusted only infrequently, and was last adjusted in 1992.|$|E

40|$|In the paper, we use {{data from}} an English study <b>of</b> <b>security</b> consumption, and recent {{work in the}} {{cultural}} sociology of markets, to illustrate {{the way in which}} moral and social commitments shape and often constrain decisions about how, or indeed whether, individuals and organizations enter markets for protection. Three main claims are proffered. We suggest, firstly, that the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> commodities is a mundane, non-conspicuous mode of consumption that typically exists outside of the paraphernalia of consumer culture – a form of grudge spending. Secondly, we demonstrate that security consumption is weighed against other commitments that individuals and organizations have and is often kept in check by these competing considerations. We find, thirdly, that the prospect <b>of</b> consuming <b>security</b> prompts people to consider the relations that obtain between security objects and other things that they morally or aesthetically value, and to reflect on what the buying and selling <b>of</b> <b>security</b> signals about the condition and likely futures of their society. These points are illustrated using the examples of organizational consumption and gated communities. In respect of each case, we tease out the evaluative judgements that condition and constrain the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> among organizations and individuals and argue that they open up some important but neglected questions to do with the moral economy <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> The article is co-authored with Ian Loader and Angelica Thumala...|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} economic {{function of}} the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> is investment, with the view to receiving income or achieving capital gain. Debt securities generally offer {{a higher rate of}} interest than bank deposits, and equities may offer the prospect of capital growth. Equity investment may also offer control of the business of the issuer. Debt holdings may also offer some measure of control to the investor if the company is a fledgling start-up or an old giant undergoing 'restructuring'. In these cases, if interest payments are missed, the creditors may take control of the company and liquidate it to recover some of their investment.|$|E

5000|$|The term “due diligence” means [...] "required carefulness" [...] or [...] "reasonable care" [...] {{in general}} usage {{and became a}} {{specialized}} legal term and later a common business term due to the United States’ Securities Act of 1933, where the process is called [...] "reasonable investigation" [...] (section 11b3).

If the lack of regulation that is concerned with the transfer of non performing credits to the secondary market (the re-selling market) is able to create a decrease in the liquidity of the resale market and affects indirectly the supply and demand in the lending market, the legal rules that is concerned with the sale of loans for the goal of securitization and the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> (as asset backed securities) are not always suitable to resolve the problem. Some of them mine the liquidity in secondary market and if this one becomes illiquid, we could have on the capital market: no incentive for lenders to extend credit; raising of the costs of loan and no good situation for high risk companies to get loans...|$|E
40|$|Keynes's {{proposition}} that consumption-and-saving {{decisions on the}} part of the public exert no direct influence on the conditions of finance faced by investors contrasts with the loanable funds theory claim that a public's shift from consumption to saving with the purpose of purchasing securities generates an excess supply of funds that eases conditions in the capital market. This paper provides a simple kind of flow-of-funds model where the flow of savings {{on the part of}} households, even when it is entirely directed to the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities,</b> is not a net component of the supply of funds in the capital market. Thus, Keynes's proposition about the independence of finance from saving does not require the assumption of a hidden increase in liquidity preference. Rather, it is based upon a specific conception of the finance process in a monetary economy. Flow-of-funds model; Keynesian theory; Finance and saving...|$|E
