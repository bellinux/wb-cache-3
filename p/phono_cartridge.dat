50|$|Of modular construction, {{the various}} {{elements}} of the amplification and power supply circuitry are in form of plug-in boards.

50|$|Because {{measured}} {{audio distortion}} {{is higher in}} electromechanical components such as microphones, turntables, tonearms, <b>phono</b> <b>cartridges,</b> and loudspeakers than in purely electronic components such as preamplifiers and power amplifiers, objectivists generally do not accept that very subtle differences in the latter can have an appreciable effect on the perceived quality of reproduced sound.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{high-performance}} CD-4 {{system would}} include a turntable with a CD-4 compatible <b>phono</b> <b>cartridge,</b> a CD-4 demodulator, a discrete four-channel amplifier, and four identical full-range loudspeakers. Some audio electronics manufacturers included the CD-4 demodulator as a built in feature of other equipment. A four-channel audio receiver, for example, could contain the demodulator along with FM radio and amplifier circuitry.|$|E
5000|$|Rumble : The {{measure of}} the low {{frequency}} (many tens of Hz) noise contributed by the turntable of an analogue playback system. It is caused by imperfect bearings, uneven motor windings, vibrations in driving bands in some turntables, room vibrations (e.g., from traffic) that is transmitted by the turntable mounting and so to the <b>phono</b> <b>cartridge.</b> A lower number is better.|$|E
50|$|Despite being {{designed}} in the 1960s it {{is still one of}} the masterpieces in audio technology and can easily compete with contemporary constructions. Due to its construction, Denon DL-103 is recommended as one of the very few cartridges suitable for heavy tonearms. (like in Lenco or Garrard turntables)As a low-output <b>phono</b> <b>cartridge</b> it requires either a step up transformer for a standard MM phono preamp, or phono preamp with built-in MC input.|$|E
5000|$|CD-4 {{technology}} was {{also responsible for}} major improvements in stereo phonograph technology. Improvements included higher compliance, lower distortion levels, <b>phono</b> <b>cartridges</b> with a significantly higher frequency range, and new vinyl compounds for records.

50|$|Stax Ltd. {{was founded}} in 1938. Twenty-two years later, in 1960, Stax {{released}} their first electrostatic earspeaker, the Stax SR-1. Over the following thirty-six years Stax produced a variety of amplification, earspeaker, tonearm, CD player, DAC, <b>phono</b> <b>cartridge</b> and loudspeaker products. In 1995, fifty-seven years after the company's foundation, it became insolvent. The company was revived in 1996 as the new STAX company.In December 2011, Chinese loudspeaker manufacturer Edifier announced the acquisition of 100% equity in Stax.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{interesting}} {{product was}} the Philco [...] "Beam of Light" [...] 78 RPM record players offered in 1941 and 1942. These units had a tiny mirror {{attached to the}} player's needle. A beam of light {{was focused on the}} mirror which caused a vibrating light to hit a solar cell and produce the audio signal. While this system had some advantages over the standard crystal <b>phono</b> <b>cartridge</b> of the time, it was unreliable and is today a very difficult unit to restore.|$|E
50|$|Grado Labs {{was founded}} in 1953, by master watchmaker Joseph Grado. The origins of the audio company {{date back to the}} early 1950s, when Joseph left Tiffany & Company and Sherman Fairchild to start {{crafting}} phono cartridges at his kitchen table in Brooklyn, NY. After seeing a market for cartridges, he went around the corner and closed the existing Grado fruit shop, opening up Grado Laboratories. Joseph went on to invent the first stereo moving coil <b>phono</b> <b>cartridge</b> while building up Grado's cartridge lineup.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phono</b> <b>cartridges,</b> {{also known}} as pickups, are {{electromechanical}} devices which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. The cartridge contains a removable or permanently mounted stylus, the tip of which makes physical contact with the record's groove. In popular usage and in disc jockey jargon, the stylus, and sometimes the entire cartridge, is often called the needle. The electrical signal generated by the cartridge can be amplified and then converted into sound by a loudspeaker.|$|R
25|$|Shure began {{supplying}} replacement crystal pickups {{to various}} manufacturers in 1933 {{and by the}} mid-1940s Shure was the largest supplier of phonograph cartridges in America, supplying record manufacturers like Philco, RCA, Emerson, Magnavox, Admiral, and Motorola. At the peak of Shure's production the company was producing more than 28,000 cartridges per day, with 25,000 produced at Shure's Phoenix plant. While Shure continues to manufacture <b>phono</b> <b>cartridges,</b> the Phoenix facility was closed in the late 1980s due to declining demand.|$|R
5000|$|The Decca International tone arm: The Decca International tone {{arms were}} fluid-damped unipivot designs. They were {{designed}} to complement the Decca <b>phono</b> <b>cartridges.</b> They would enjoy a brief renaissance {{in the 21st century}} as they were almost a drop-in replacement for the pick-up arms of Lenco GL75 record turntables from the 1970s. The arm damping was via a viscous silicone fluid held in a well, and magnetic repelling force supported the arm, and provided anti-skate (bias compensation). New Old Stock arms rapidly sold out by 2008 as vintage hifi enthusiasts sought them for refurbishment projects.|$|R

5000|$|Later {{preamplifier}} offering {{included the}} PS IV, the company's first 17" [...] full chassis design and featured an {{external power supply}} {{for the first time}} in the American high-end audio industry. The IV featured a built in phono preamplifier with a novel switch on the bottom of the unit enabling users to select Moving Coil or Moving Magnet cartridges. Instead of adding in another circuit known as a head amp to increase the gain for Moving Coil cartridges, the IV took advantage of its passive RIAA curve design and simply increased the gain of the input amplification stage by an additional 30dB. All future preamplifiers pre-1997 had this unique circuit that reduced the circuitry in the path of the <b>phono</b> <b>cartridge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|RIAA {{equalization}} is not {{a simple}} low-pass filter. It defines transition points in three places: 75 µs, 318 µs and 3180 µs, which correspond to 2122 Hz, 500 Hz and 50 Hz (rounded values). [...] Implementing this characteristic is not especially difficult, but is more involved than a simple amplifier. In the past, almost all hi-fi preamplifiers, integrated amplifiers, and receivers had a built-in phono preamplifier with the RIAA characteristic, but it is often omitted in modern designs, due to the gradual obsolescence of vinyl records. Add-on phono preamplifiers with the RIAA equalization curve are available; these adapt a magnetic <b>phono</b> <b>cartridge</b> to an unbalanced −10 dBv consumer line-level RCA input. Some modern turntables feature built-in preamplification to the RIAA standard. Special preamplifiers are also available for the various equalization curves used on pre-1954 records.|$|E
5000|$|Linn were {{distributors}} for Grace and Supex Corporation at the time, {{and thus}} the Grace G-707 tone arm and Supex SD900 and SD1000 <b>phono</b> <b>cartridges</b> were also frequently partners for the deck. Early Linn-branded cartridges, such as the Asak and Asaka, and the 3-point mounted Troika (now discontinued), were produced by Supex for Linn. Linn's later subcontracted cartridge manufacture to Lyra Corporation in Japan. Paul Messenger, writing in Stereophile, credits Linn's endorsement and importation of the Supex brand for the resurgence of audiophile interest in moving coil cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|Decca London {{phonograph}} cartridges: The Decca <b>phono</b> <b>cartridges</b> were {{a unique}} design, with fixed magnets and coils.

5000|$|The {{process of}} sound {{transfer}} from magnetic tape to LP {{is a highly}} complicated process. Apprentice engineers typically spend several years learning how to become an expert in disc mastering. A mastering engineer may need to adjust and or compromise the sound quality of a record {{in order to maintain}} loudness and make the groove traceable by the stylus a record player using a low quality <b>phono</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Often, sounds have been mastered with additional compression, limiting, and equalization. In order to reduce wear on the master most discs are not sourced from the original master tape. The source tape used may be many generations removed from the original. Typically, the engineer cut the first pressing and a [...] "cutting master" [...] tape in parallel. Subsequent pressings were cut directly from the cutting master. Some pressings were even cut from copies of the cutting master tape. Each subsequent tape copy added additional levels of tape hiss, and wow and flutter, degrading sound quality.|$|E
5000|$|Equalization {{is used in}} a {{reciprocal}} manner in certain communication channels and recording technologies. The original music is passed through a particular filter to alter its frequency balance, followed by the channel or recording process. At {{the end of the}} channel or when the recording is played, a complementary filter is inserted which precisely compensates for the original filter and recovers the original waveform. For instance, FM broadcast uses a pre-emphasis filter to boost the high frequencies before transmission, and every receiver includes a matching de-emphasis filter to restore it. The white noise that is introduced by the radio is then also de-emphasized at the higher frequencies (where it is most noticeable) along with the pre-emphasized program, making the noise less audible. Tape recorders used the same trick to reduce [...] "tape hiss" [...] while maintaining fidelity. On the other hand, in the production of vinyl records, a filter is used to reduce the amplitude of low frequencies which otherwise produce large amplitudes on the tracks of a record. Then the groove can take up less physical space, fitting more music on the record. The preamp attached to the <b>phono</b> <b>cartridge</b> has a complementary filter boosting those low frequencies following the standard RIAA equalization curve.|$|E

40|$|Audio signal preamplifiers (preamps) {{represent}} the low-level {{end of the}} dynamic range of practical audio circuits using modern IC devices. In general, amplifying stages with input signal levels of 10 mV or less fall into the preamp category. This section discusses some basic types of audio preamps, which are: ■ Microphone — including preamps for dynamic, electret and phantom powered microphones, using transformer input circuits, operating from dual and single supplies. ■ Phonograph — including preamps for moving magnet and moving coil <b>phono</b> <b>cartridges</b> in various topologies, with detailed response analysis and discussion. In general, when working signals drop {{to a level of}} ≈ 1 mV, the input noise generated by the first system amplifying stage becomes critical for wide dynamic range and good signal-to-noise ratio. For example, if internally generated noise of an input stage is 1 µV and the input signal voltage 1 mV, the best signal-to-noise ratio possible is just 60 dB. In a given application, both the input voltage level and impedance of a source are usually fixed. Thus, for best signal-to-noise ratio, the input noise generated by the first amplifying stage must be minimized when operated from the intended source. This facto...|$|R
2500|$|In 1960, John Cage {{completed}} his noise composition <b>Cartridge</b> Music for <b>phono</b> <b>cartridges</b> with foreign objects replacing the 'stylus' and small sounds amplified by contact microphones. Also in 1960, Nam June Paik composed Fluxusobjekt for fixed tape and hand-controlled tape playback head. On May 8, 1960, six young Japanese musicians, including Takehisa Kosugi and Yasunao Tone, formed the Group Ongaku with two tape recordings of noise music: Automatism and Object. These recordings {{made use of}} a mixture of traditional musical instruments along with a vacuum cleaner, a radio, an oil drum, a doll, {{and a set of}} dishes. Moreover, the speed of the tape recording was manipulated, further distorting the sounds being recorded. Canada's Nihilist Spasm Band, the world's longest-running noise act, was formed in 1965 in London, Ontario and continues to perform and record to this day, having survived to work with many of the newer generation which they themselves had influenced, such as Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and Jojo Hiroshige of Hijokaidan. In 1967, Musica Elettronica Viva, a live acoustic/electronic improvisational group formed in Rome, made a recording titled SpaceCraft using contact microphones on such [...] "non-musical" [...] objects as panes of glass and motor oil cans that was recorded at the Akademie der Kunste in Berlin. At the end of the sixties, they took part in the collective noise action called Lo Zoo initiated by the artist Michelangelo Pistoletto.|$|R
