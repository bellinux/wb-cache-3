5|$|Chemically, the perxenate {{compounds}} {{are used}} as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry. Xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon, particularly {{in the production of}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil. Xenon is also used in protein crystallography. Applied at <b>pressures</b> <b>from</b> 0.5 to 5MPa (5 to 50atm) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative {{that can be used for}} solving the phase problem.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, two representatives on mission {{informed}} the National Convention of the disquieting condition of Vendée, and this news was quickly {{followed by the}} exposure of a royalist plot organized by the Marquis de la Rouerie.

5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong <b>pressures</b> <b>from</b> the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 18th Century, French traders first began {{trade with the}} Akokisa and the nearby Bidai tribes for furs. In 1754 several traders {{including}} Joseph Blancpain established a trading post on the Trinity River a {{just north of the}} bay, near modern Wallisville. Spanish authorities quickly seized the post and transformed it into the San Augustín de Ahumada fort. They named the site El Orcoquisac and established a Catholic mission. The Spanish were not successful in maintaining trade with the natives and the post was abandoned within a few years. Encroachment by Spanish as well as U.S. settlers continued such {{that by the end of}} the century native populations had declined dramatically due to disease and territorial <b>pressures</b> <b>from</b> the Europeans.|$|E
5|$|Montreal {{finished}} {{in last place}} in the Northeast Division in 1998–99 and missed the playoffs. Their 75 points was the lowest total in a full season in 40 years. The season concluded with rumours of the team being sold and relocated {{if it did not}} receive government subsidies to help alleviate <b>pressures</b> <b>from</b> Quebec's tax system and the record-low value of the Canadian dollar. The Canadiens denied the report, however Molson hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to examine its future involvement in sports. Montreal missed the playoffs again the next two seasons, and annual losses of $10–$12million and a desire to focus on its core brewing business led Molson to put the franchise up for sale in the summer of 2001.|$|E
5|$|Rebellion {{broke out}} in late June 1848, after Frățias members came to adopt a single project {{regarding}} the promise of land reform. This resolution, which had initially caused dissension, was passed into the revolutionary program upon <b>pressures</b> <b>from</b> Nicolae Bălcescu and his supporters. The document itself, destined to {{be read as a}} proclamation, was most likely drafted by Heliade Rădulescu, and Bălcescu himself was possibly responsible for most of its ideas. It called for, among other issues, national independence, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, responsible government, a five-year term of office for Princes and their election by the Assembly, freedom of the press, and decentralization.|$|E

5|$|Although {{tropical}} cyclones in {{the extreme}} eastern Atlantic are typically propelled westward by high <b>pressures</b> <b>from</b> a subtropical ridge, this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in the ridge from a previous disturbance. Its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved rainband, resembling the precursor to an eye, tightened around the center. At 06:00UTC on August30, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred 390mi (625km) east-southeast of Praia, Cape Verdeamong the four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern record-keeping began in 1851. A steady trend of intensification ensued while Fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture, light upper winds, and above-average sea surface temperatures. The storm developed a thick, circular central dense overcast with good outflow, and the eye feature became well established {{at all levels of}} the circulation. Based on these characteristics, as well as satellite intensity estimates of 75mph (120km/h) winds, Fred was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 00:00UTC, August31. Then centered 165mi (270km) east-southeast of Sal, Cape Verde, it became the easternmost tropical cyclone ever to attain hurricane status in the tropical Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, <b>pressures</b> <b>from</b> The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E
5|$|The state passed {{legislation}} in 1941 that authorized {{the creation of}} limited-access roadways; the MSHD could prohibit access to a state trunkline from the adjacent properties. Around the same time, single-digit highways like M-9 were renumbered to set aside those numbers for future freeways in the state. During World War II, the Willow Run Expressway, the Detroit Industrial Expressway and the Davison Freeway were built, ushering in {{the beginnings of the}} state's freeway system. These highway improvements were financed by the Defense Highway Act of 1941 to aid in national defense. After the war, the MSHD and the Good Roads Federation studied the highway needs of the state. Their study reported that road maintenance and improvement deteriorated since the Great Depression. It also stated that funding needed to be increased to deal with <b>pressures</b> <b>from</b> traffic increases after the war.|$|E
