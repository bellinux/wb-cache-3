40|$|The main {{objective}} of this presentation is to systemise the present innovation tasks of the Hungarian agriculture, especially focusing on the SMS’s. I prepared and use some models to determine the development tasks. Let me introduce three models out of them. • The general model of agricultural innovation demonstrates clearly the connecting and depending works to do. It shows that the innovation <b>part-works</b> can be systematised into two integrating umbrellas. These are marketing and knowledge. • The model about the substance of technical development shows that technical development serving agricultural production has got a particular bridging role between the production and the previous innovation phases by integrating several factors at the same time. • The model of adaptive innovation shows the special possibilities and tasks for developing of the small and medium size enterprises (SMS’s). kkv szektor, innovációs lehetőség, adaptáció, small and medium size enterprises, possibility for innovation, adaptation, Agribusiness, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|R

5000|$|The {{limestone}} can {{be turned}} on a lathe to create urns, candlesticks and other similar objects, or sawn to produce smooth, flat items such as obelisks and paperweights. Derby Museum and Art Gallery holds collections of worked and <b>part-worked</b> items of Ashford Black Marble, acquired from an inlaying workshop owned by the Tomlinson family. This includes a range of pre-cut pieces ready for inlaying into the black marble background. Items such as forget-me-not and {{lily of the valley}} flowers would typically be represented. Coloured rocks to inlay into the black [...] "marble" [...] included grey, blue and purple minerals locally from Monyash, [...] "rosewood" [...] from Nettler Dale in Sheldon which consisted of red and white layers, barytes which created other variations, the local Castleton Blue John which could create purple, and yellow flourspar from Crich, whilst [...] "Birds-Eye" [...] rock had a design made from the fossils that it contained. The rarest mineral was known as [...] "Duke's Red" [...] and this was so valuable that it was stored at Chatsworth House. The tabletop design illustrated shows some of the combinations described here.|$|R

50|$|Several {{innovations}} {{had taken}} place in the magazine. In its early days, a wide range of subjects was covered in each issue. But in 1976 this changed. The idea of a <b>part-work</b> emerged, and each month's edition was devoted to one particular subject (for example Islam or World Food) to give the reader a comprehensive guide and analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Dong Jianhong and Chen Tiying {{wrote that}} in the Great Leap Forward period school {{activities}} were not focused on education and instead were [...] "mostly devoted to political movements and productive labor" [...] which produced a low educational quality. During the period many schools established school-operated factories that their students worked in, and the Beijing educational authorities established <b>part-work</b> part-study experimental schools and work-study programs.|$|E
40|$|The role {{of small}} and medium-size {{enterprises}} has increased in the Hungarian agriculture after the transition. In connection with the general problems, most of the Hungarian small and medium-size enterprises (SME’s) agricultural enterprises have serious problems {{in the field of}} innovation. I prepared and used some models to examine the exact possibilities of innovation and to determine what needs to be developed. In this publication I am going to present three of them. – The simplified model of agricultural innovation serves as a theoretical basis for agricultural developments. This model clearly demonstrates the related and dependent works to be done. It shows that the innovation <b>part-works</b> can be systematized into two integrating umbrellas. These aremarketing and knowledge. Marketing is important as the success of innovation is decided in the market. The whole innovation process should be guided by the endeavour for market success. Knowledge combines earlier experience and recent information in the entire process. – The model of the components of technical development shows that technical development serving agricultural production has got a particular bridging role between the production and the previous innovation phases; it integrates several factors at the same time. – These models that were successful in the past, would be useful today as well, but the small and medium-size enterprises do not have suitable possibilities for applying them. Unfortunately the conditions of cooperation between the actors are missing as well. In our current situation if an enterprise wants to innovate, it has to develop itself with state support. The adaptive innovation can be a possible solution too. This model is going to be presented later...|$|R
50|$|Blek was {{published}} in other countries such as Greece (where it is being published since June 1969), Turkey (as Steel Blek - Teksas), France (as Blek le Roc), and former Yugoslavia (as Veliki Blek). In Scandinavia he was called Davy Crockett, although {{he has nothing to}} do with the historic person Davy Crockett. As 'Blek' the comics are still available from numerous retail outlets in <b>part-work</b> form in Serbia and in some kiosks in Greece.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{successful}} publication of The Children's Encyclopædia as a <b>part-work</b> between 1908 and 1910, {{the title was}} immediately relaunched as The New Children's Encyclopædia. This new edition, published in monthly parts from March 1910, added a supplement in September 1910 entitled The Little Paper which carried news stories of interest to children. This idea was expanded by Mee into the 12-page, tabloid-sized Children's Newspaper which debuted on 22 March 1919, priced 1½d.|$|E
5000|$|Previously {{published}} as a <b>part-work,</b> {{it was first}} {{published as}} a book in 1861 by S. O. Beeton Publishing, 161 Bouverie Street, London, a firm founded by Samuel Beeton.The book was an immediate best-seller, selling 60,000 copies {{in its first year}} and totalling nearly two million by 1868. In 2010 a copy of the first edition of Household Management in [...] "top condition" [...] was stated to be worth more than £1,000. In 1863 a revised edition was issued.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 Denys Ovenden {{went to work}} on the <b>part-work,</b> Understanding Science, {{where he}} met Michael Chinery, a close and valued friend to this present time. With Michael he began a new phase of work for William Collins, first on Field Guide to the Insects of Britain & Northern Europe, then the {{ground-breaking}} Reptiles & Amphibians of Britain & Europe. This was followed by a number of other books for Collins, including entry level hand guides to Wild Animals and The Sea Coast.|$|E
5000|$|As {{well as his}} journalistic output, Baines was {{the author}} of a number of {{histories}} and gazetteers. His first book - a History of the Wars of the French Revolution - was published in 1817, having first been published as a <b>part-work</b> from 1814 onwards. Its account up to 1801 borrowed extensively (and sometimes verbatim) from another author's earlier work of 1803 on the same topic (A Stephens The History of the Wars Which Arose out of the French Revolution to Which is Prefixed a Review of the Causes of that Event (London 1803). This went unacknowledged until Baines revised, expanded and retitled the work as a History of the Reign of King George III (1820); his new preface stating [...] "To facilitate ... progress, and at the recommendation of the publisher and proprietor of Mr Alexander Stephens' s History of the Wars published in 1803, nearly half the details of the first volume were abridged from that work." [...] This later led to denunciation of Baines as a plagiarist by one of the editors of the Intelligencer. He also produced history/directory/gazetteers for Yorkshire and for Lancashire, later reworking the latter as a county history.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{identify}} the key factors that are associated with the adoption of a commercial robot in the home. This article is based on the development of the robot product Cybot by the University of Reading in conjunction with a publisher (Eaglemoss International Ltd.). The robots were distributed through a new <b>part-work</b> magazine series (Ultimate Real Robots) that had long-term customer usage and retention. A <b>part-work</b> is a serial publication that is issued periodically (e. g., every two weeks), usually in magazine format, and builds into a complete collection. This magazine focused on robotics and was accompanied by cover-mounted component parts that could be assembled, with instructions, by the user to build a working robot over the series. In total, the product contributed over half a million operational domestic robots to the world market, selling over 20 million robot <b>part-work</b> magazines across 18 countries, thereby providing a unique breadth of insight. Gaining a better understanding of the overall attitudes that customers of this product had toward robots in the home, their perception of what such devices could deliver and how they would wish to interact with them should provide results applicable to the domestic appliance, assistance/care, entertainment, and educational markets...|$|E
