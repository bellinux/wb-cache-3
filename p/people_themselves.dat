5|$|Two {{months before}} the war's end, on 7 March 1945, when the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and entered German territory, Friedrich Kellner tried {{to explain why the}} German <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> had not rebelled against Nazi rule, why it was {{necessary}} for outside forces to rid the Germans of the tyrannical government they themselves had voted into power.|$|E
5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E

25|$|During {{the battle}} the Kirghiz {{prevented}} the Uighur from looting the city, mainly {{because they wanted}} to loot it themselves.

25|$|In an Emmaus community, volunteers help {{homeless}} people {{by giving them}} accommodation, and somewhere to eat and work. A number of Emmaus volunteers are also formerly homeless <b>people</b> <b>themselves,</b> from all age groups, religious or ethnic origins, and social backgrounds.

25|$|The {{origin of}} the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is not {{definitively}} known. The Swiss <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> cannot be clearly defined as belonging exclusively {{to one of the}} European tribes; they are inhabitants of a typical transit country. Beginning in 1515, the remote valleys of Switzerland were more or less isolated from world history for three centuries. Specific dog breeds were created by inbreeding, and puppies were given to neighbors and family members.|$|E
25|$|Josephus {{taught that}} when the Israelites brought {{together}} the materials with great diligence, Moses set architects over the works by the command of God. And these were the very same people that the <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> would have chosen, had the election been allowed to them: Bezalel, the son of Uri, of the tribe of Judah, the grandson of Miriam, the sister of Moses, and Oholiab, file son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.|$|E
25|$|The Indonesian {{government}} set up {{a special}} agency for Aceh reconstruction, the Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi (BRR) headed by Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, a former Indonesian Minister. This agency had ministry level of authority and incorporated officials, professionals and community leaders from all backgrounds. Most of the reconstruction work was performed by local people using a mix of traditional methods and partial prefabricated structures, with funding coming from many international organizations and individuals, governments, and the <b>people</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the life}} of nations, <b>people</b> address <b>themselves</b> and their {{collective}} identity in historically specific and changing ways.

25|$|Currently many {{cultural}} revival {{projects and}} initiatives are being {{undertaken by the}} <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> and the Squamish Nation itself.

Recently a language immersion school was created with plans to expand further on the program. Other programs and services offered through the Squamish Nation include strong cultural components in their Health, Lands, and Education departments.|$|E
25|$|The majlis is {{also the}} means to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi has written {{that members of the}} majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, they must have enough {{knowledge}} to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and must have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates.|$|E
25|$|In May 1964, Chiume {{looked forward}} to Malawi being {{organised}} with no opposition at all and claimed {{that there was nothing}} wrong with dictatorship. Banda went further in saying that any government chosen by the <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> was not a dictatorship. By the time that many of the ministers had concerns about the reintroduction of Preventive Detention in July 1964, the possibility of reasoned opposition to Banda was long past. The Cabinet Crisis did not therefore represent any change in the nature of MCP, merely that, as external enemies had been subdued, its leader made enemies of the party's own long term members.|$|E

25|$|This {{ethnic group}} label {{has been used}} by other Malagasy and foreigners to {{describe}} the people who traditionally inhabited the southwestern coast of Madagascar, bounded inland by the Menarandra and Onilahy rivers. The <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> do not use this label or identify as part of a single ethnic group, however, and prefer to identify along other kinship or geopolitical lines; the name Mahafaly holds no meaning for the people originating from this area and instead is a label imposed from the outside. The majority of the population is concentrated {{along the banks of the}} rivers that run through the otherwise largely arid territory.|$|E
25|$|Barry then {{attempted}} to anticipate {{some of the}} counter-arguments that might be made. To the argument that someone denying the jurisdiction of a court must also indicate some jurisdiction that is competent, Barry said that the customary legal system of the Aboriginal <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> was the correct jurisdiction. Barry indicated {{he was prepared to}} call witnesses to testify on the methods within the Aboriginal legal system of dealing with such matters, and also argued that although there were certainly differences between the Aboriginal and English legal systems, that did not mean that the former was not a valid jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Flavius Josephus {{mentions}} that Abraham confronts Nimrod {{and tells him}} face-to-face to cease his idolatry, whereupon Nimrod orders him {{burned at the stake}}. Nimrod has his subjects gather enough wood so as to burn Abraham in the biggest fire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit and Abraham is thrown into it, Abraham walks out unscathed. In Islam, it is debated whether the decision to have Ibrahim burned at the stake came from Nimrod and the temple priests or whether the <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> became vigilantes and hatched the plan to have him burned at the stake.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{seeing this}} as an opportunity, early in 192 Commodus, declaring himself the new Romulus, ritually re-founded Rome, {{renaming}} the city Colonia Lucia Annia Commodiana. All the {{months of the year}} were renamed to correspond exactly with his (now twelve) names: Lucius, Aelius, Aurelius, Commodus, Augustus, Herculeus, Romanus, Exsuperatorius, Amazonius, Invictus, Felix, Pius. The legions were renamed Commodianae, the fleet which imported grain from Africa was termed Alexandria Commodiana Togata, the Senate was entitled the Commodian Fortunate Senate, his palace and the Roman <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> were all given the name Commodianus, and the day on which these reforms were decreed was to be called Dies Commodianus.|$|E
25|$|Biopiracy {{describes}} a practice in which indigenous knowledge of nature, originating with indigenous peoples, {{is used by}} others for profit, without permission from and {{with little or no}} compensation or recognition to the indigenous <b>people</b> <b>themselves.</b> For example, when bioprospectors draw on indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants which is later patented by medical companies without recognizing the fact that the knowledge is not new, or invented by the patenter, and depriving the indigenous community to the rights to commercial exploitation of the technology that they themselves had developed. Critics of this practice, such as Greenpeace, claim these practices contribute to inequality between developing countries rich in biodiversity, and developed countries hosting companies that engage in 'biopiracy'.|$|E

They select their cases based on a criterion the organisation has established, which depends {{on a wide range}} of factors, such as the reliability and continuity of the information, the gravity of the situation the tribe in question is facing, the degree to which they believe their work can make a real difference, the degree to which improvements in this area would have a knock on effect for others, whether any other organisation is already working on the case, and whether they are sure of what the <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> want.|$|E
