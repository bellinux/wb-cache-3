40|$|A {{study of}} the {{interaction}} of a continuous-wave Gaussian beam with a concave lens used as a spot-size converter (SSC) is presented. The lens {{is based on a}} 2 -D photonic crystal (PC) structure with a negative refractive index. A numerical method based on a 2 -D finite-difference time domain was employed to investigate the light propagation in a photonic integrated circuitry (PIC). The PIC consisted of a single-mode fiber, an SSC, and a PC waveguide (PCW). By employing an optimized <b>planoconcave</b> <b>lens,</b> a large spot-size area of the Gaussian beam was focused/transformed into a very small spot-size area, which is even smaller than the order of the operating wavelength. Optimization of the proposed device parameters has also been reported. A significant reduction in the device size, transmission efficiency, and coupling efficiency has been achieved by optimizing the <b>planoconcave</b> <b>lens</b> and the PCW...|$|E
40|$|Prism {{bars and}} {{variable}} Herschel prisms are {{most commonly used}} today to measure the angle of squint. Both have drawbacks, however. Prism bars are too large to carry around all day and are usually limited to 40 prism diopters (PD), while variable Herschel prisms have even smaller ranges. Hans Meester and I have therefore developed, at the Netherlands Ophthalmic Research Institute, Amsterdam, a hand-held prism that is continuously variable over a large range, horizontally as well as vertically. We propose {{to call it the}} "Variprism. " It consists of a small housing containing two glass elements, ie, planoconvex and planoconcave, with equal radii of the convex and concave surfaces (Fig 1). The planoconvex front element is a half globe, freely rotatable in gimbals. The <b>planoconcave</b> <b>lens</b> is situated immediately behind it...|$|E
30|$|The {{viewing angle}} of {{integral}} imaging system {{is limited by}} the size of each elemental image and the distance between the lenslet and the EIA. In an integral imaging system, the lenslet array acts as a spatial beam splitter. Each lenslet unit is equivalent to a macro pixel so the lenslet unit is always not large. Most of the commercially available lenslet arrays are made of single-layer optical glass or optical plastic. They have no aberration correction capability and the monolayer lenslet array has a small viewing angle of about 30 degrees. To overcome the limitation of viewing angle, various methods have been proposed [5 – 10, 14, 15]. However, most of these algorithms have some limitations and their performances heavily depend on some specific conditions. The viewer tracking has a complex control system and modifying the configuration of the lens array can also extend the viewing angle, such as the fresnel lens array and negative index <b>planoconcave</b> <b>lens</b> array [18, 19]. Conventional fisheye lenses can map flat image onto wide field of view, but suppressing field curvature and their aberrations needs multi-layer components, and thus imposes harsh design tradeoffs.|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to previous two-dimensional coated photonic crystals, {{in this paper}} we propose a left-handed one that is made of dielectric tubes arranged in a close-packed hexagonal lattice. Without metallic cores, this structure is low-loss and convenient to fabricate. Negative refraction and its resulting focusing are investigated by dispersion characteristic analysis and numerical simulation of the field pattern. With proper modification at the interface, the image is improved. With better isotropy than that with noncircular rods, <b>planoconcave</b> <b>lenses</b> made by dielectric tubes focus a Gaussian beam exactly at R//n - 1 /...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} a binary-staircase optical element can be {{engineered}} to exhibit an effective negative index of refraction, thereby expanding the range of optical properties theoretically available for future optoelectronic devices. The mechanism for achieving a negative-index lens is based on exploiting the periodicity of the surface corrugation. By designing and nanofabricating a <b>planoconcave</b> binary-staircase <b>lens</b> in the InP/InGaAsP platform, we have experimentally demonstrated at 1. 55  μm that such negative-index concave lenses can focus plane waves. The beam propagation in the lens was studied experimentally and was in excellent agreement with the three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain numerical simulations...|$|R

Ultra-compact <b>planoconcave</b> zoned metallic <b>lens</b> {{based on}} the fishnet metamaterial. Applied Physics Letters, 103 (18), and may be found at [URL] 1. 5 λ 0 -thick <b>planoconcave</b> zoned <b>lens</b> {{based on the}} fishnet metamaterial is demonstrated experimentally at millimeter wavelengths. The zoning technique applied allows a volume reduction of 60 % compared to a full fishnet metamaterial lens without any deterioration in performance. The structure is designed to exhibit an effective refractive index n = - 0. 25 at f = 56. 7 GHz (λ 0 = 5. 29 mm) with a focal length FL = 47. 62 mm = 9 λ 0. The experimental enhancement achieved is 11. 1 dB, which is in good agreement with simulation and also with previous full fishnet metamaterial lenses {{and opens the door}} for integrated solutions.

40|$|Anastasios John, KanellopoulosLaserVision gr Institute, Athens, Greece; New York University Medical School, New York City, NY, USABackground: This {{research}} comprised {{a laboratory}} {{evaluation of a}} novel refractive surgery technique involving sequential corneal subsurface shrinkage-driven reshaping using a continuous wave mid-infrared laser application followed by stiffening via rapid transepithelial higher fluence collagen cross-linking for shape persistence/longevity on cadaver corneas. Materials and methods: Ten cadaver corneas were used in this study. During use, all were affixed in an artificial chamber. Thermal delivery entailed a continuous wave laser at 2013 nm wavelength, approximately 650 mW power under scanner control (about 3 mm/sec linear draw speed), with a <b>planoconcave</b> sapphire applanation <b>lens</b> cooled to 8 &deg;C. Group 1 (n = 5, myopic treatment) eyes were exposed to three concentric annuli with diameters of 3 mm, 4 mm, and 5 mm. Group 2 (n = 5, hyperopic treatment) eyes were exposed to three concentric annuli with diameters of 6 mm, 7 mm, and 8 mm. The clinical change in shape of the cornea was visualized immediately under a slit-lamp. A transepithelial higher fluence corneal collagen cross-linking step followed each thermal treatment, comprising 0. 1 % riboflavin drops with 0. 02 % benzalkonium chloride and 0. 2 % carboxymethlycellulose in deuterated water (D 2 O) applied on the epithelium corneal surface for 10 minutes. Next, each cornea was exposed to 10 mW/cm 2 of ultraviolet A (365 nm) light for 10 minutes. The corneas were evaluated before and after thermal remodeling and cornea collagen cross-linking for corneal topography, corneal optical coherence tomography, cornea Scheimpflug tomography, and clinical photographs. Results: The histopathology effect was noted clinically as concentric white rings underneath the epithelium and Bowman&# 39;s membrane, with the lesion depth extending down to 400 &micro;m in the mid stroma of the cornea. This was confirmed by corneal anterior segment optical coherence tomography. The topographic change noted was a 4 &ndash; 8 diopter hyperopic shift in group 1 and a 2 &ndash; 6 diopter myopic shift in group 2. Conclusion: This novel refractive surgery technique appears to generate a significant refractive change (+/-) in the cornea, without affecting the epithelium or Bowman&# 39;s membrane and without any visible epithelial defect. The transepithelial collagen cross-linking used as a second step in the same procedure aims to stabilize this effect in the long term. Further clinical studies are planned to validate these initial clinical results. Keywords: cornea collagen shrinkage, refractive cornea change, cornea collagen cross-linking, infrared lase...|$|R
