25|$|Hunting may be {{threatening}} {{populations of}} the tapir (Tapirus terrestris) and large primates in the north. Some habitat is threatened by expansion of the agricultural and pastoral frontier, gold mining, and selective logging that erodes the genetic diversity of a few valuable timber species. The economically important palm Euterpe precatoria is being depleted in some areas by unsustainable <b>palm</b> <b>heart</b> extraction. A dramatic problem {{that exists in the}} Brazilian State of Acre and in the adjacent area of Peru is the spread of the invasive Guadua bamboo forests. This highly competitive bamboo invades and dominates abandoned clearings and threatens to dominate the disturbed areas in this region. Logging along major rivers and near urban centers has decimated populations of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), tropical cedar (Cedrela odorata), and kapok (Ceiba pentandra).|$|E
500|$|Aiphanes {{species have}} a long history of human use. The remains of {{carbonised}} seeds thought to belong to A.horrida have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to about 2800 BP; seeds of this species are still consumed and are traded in local markets. Aiphanes horrida is also widely planted as an ornamental, as is A.minima. [...] The fruit or seeds of A.deltoidea, [...] A.eggersii, A.linearis and A.minima are all consumed locally. [...] The <b>palm</b> <b>heart</b> of A.macroloba is consumed by the Coaiquer people of northwestern South America. Aiphanol, a compound isolated from A.horrida, has shown significant inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenases; inhibition of these enzymes can provide relief from the symptoms of inflammation and pain.|$|E
500|$|Carl Ludwig Willdenow {{coined the}} name Aiphanes in 1801. Before that, species {{belonging}} to the genus {{had been placed in}} Bactris or Caryota. [...] The name Martinezia had also been applied to the genus, and between 1847 and 1932 it was generally used in place of Aiphanes. Max Burret resurrected the name Aiphanes in 1932, and laid the basis for the modern concept of the genus. [...] Aiphanes is most closely related to several other genera of spiny palms—Acrocomia, Astrocaryum, Bactris and Desmoncus. [...] Two species are widely planted as ornamentals and the fruit, seeds or <b>palm</b> <b>heart</b> of several species have been eaten by indigenous peoples of the Americas for millennia.|$|E

50|$|Mexican {{palmetto}} {{is grown}} as an ornamental for its robust, stately form, drought tolerance, and hardiness to USDA Zone 8.

50|$|The Barbel palm is {{endangered}} due to {{habitat destruction}} {{to make way}} for sugarcane plantations, and its high value as edible and medicinal plant. The <b>palm</b> <b>heart</b> is a delicacy. About 150 individuals occur in the wild on Mauritius. It is widely grown in cultivation.|$|E
50|$|Despite these obstacles, {{many farmers}} have embraced {{alternative}} crops. In 2006, Bolivia, {{as a result}} of alternative development programs, exported US$28 million of banana, US$1.9 million of pineapple, and US$7.0 million of <b>palm</b> <b>heart.</b> These industries now employ more than 20,000 people in the Chapare region.|$|E

50|$|As many {{anthropologists have}} noted, the Chaco groups, {{including}} the Pilagá, have been hunter-gatherers. Hunting includes fishing and collection of honey. Hunting is exclusively {{the domain of}} men, while gathering of wild fruits, <b>palm</b> <b>hearts,</b> mesquite (prosopis sp.) and firewood is done regularly by women. The major animals hunted are species of deers and armadillos. Among the fish specimens are surubí (Pseudoplatysoma coruscans), pacú (colossoma mitrei) and dorado (salminus maxillosus).|$|R
50|$|When this palm is {{cultivated}} {{it demands}} generous water, and rich, acidic soil and shade or filtered light.

50|$|Unsustainable {{harvesting}} of Metroxylon vitiense without replanting {{has resulted}} in a reduction of almost 50% in the size and distribution of the surviving species population. Rats also feed on young shoots, killing potential new growth. Bactris gasipaes, also known as the peach palm, is being considered and tested as a replacement crop for harvesting <b>palm</b> <b>hearts,</b> also having the added benefit of producing a drupe (or palm peach) with edible pulp surrounding its single seed.|$|R

50|$|Voanioala gerardii is {{critically}} endangered {{because of its}} scarcity. Only 10-15 trees are found. They are cut down for their edible <b>palm</b> <b>hearts</b> and their seeds are used for market trade. They are also rare because of its poor dispersal of seeds. Habitat loss through agricultural logging threatens forest coconuts as well. The national park in Masoala Peninsula is protecting the forest coconuts on its property, and its future depends greatly on the effort of the national park. Its population is currently decreasing.|$|R

50|$|It is a palm tree, {{growing to}} {{a height of}} 40 meters. In the wild, it is found {{intermittently}} in lowland forests, at elevations up to 600 metres. It is in decline due to unregulated or illegal over-harvesting of the edible <b>palm</b> <b>hearts,</b> but certain stands growing on rocky crags and outcrops are very difficult for humans to reach, which tentatively affords them natural protection. Also, some new growth is attributable to tree nurseries on the Seychelles, which raise D. nobilis seedlings and distribute them to the local populace for planting.|$|R
