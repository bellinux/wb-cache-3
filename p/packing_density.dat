We also provide rigorous upper bounds for the <b>packing</b> <b>densities</b> of 1324, 1342, and 2413. All our bounds are within $ 10 ^{- 4 }$ of the true <b>packing</b> <b>densities.</b> Together with the known bounds, this gives us a fairly complete picture of all 4 -point <b>packing</b> <b>densities.</b> We also provide new upper bounds for several small permutations of length at least five.

25|$|The final {{structure}} of the SAM is also dependent on the chain length and the {{structure of}} both the adsorbate and the substrate.

25|$|In the {{processing}} of fine ceramics, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in <b>packing</b> <b>density</b> variations in the powder compact.

25|$|The {{thylakoid}} membranes of the cyanobacteria are not differentiated into granum and stroma regions as {{observed in}} plants. They form stacks of parallel sheets {{close to the}} cytoplasmic membrane with a low <b>packing</b> <b>density.</b> The relatively large distance between the thylakoids provides space for the external light harvesting antennae, the phycobilisomes.

40|$|Using light microscopy, we {{examined}} Hunter-Schreger Band (HSB) {{patterns on the}} axial and occlusal/incisal surfaces of 160 human teeth, sectioned in both the buccolingual and mesiodistal planes. We found regional variations in HSB <b>packing</b> <b>densities</b> (number of HSBs per mm of amelodentinal junction length) and patterns throughout the crown of each class of tooth (maxillary and mandibular: incisor, canine, premolar, and molar) examined. HSB <b>packing</b> <b>densities</b> were greatest in areas where functional and occlusal loads are greatest, such as the occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth and the incisal regions of incisors and canines. From this {{it is possible to}} infer that the behaviour of ameloblasts forming enamel prisms during amelogenesis is guided by genetic/evolutionary controls that act to increase the fracture and wear resistance of human tooth enamel. It is suggested that HSB <b>packing</b> <b>densities</b> and patterns are important in modern clinical dental treatments, such as the bonding of adhesive restorations to enamel, and in the development of conditions, such as abfraction and cracked tooth syndrome...|$|R
40|$|We present {{laboratory}} experiments on {{the formation of}} macroscopic dust aggregates. The centimeter-sized highly porous bodies are produced by random ballistic deposition from individual micrometer-sized dust particles. We find <b>packing</b> <b>densities</b> between 0. 07 and 0. 15 for uncompressed samples, dependent on the shape and size distribution of the constituent dust grains. Impacts into these bodies are simulated by uniaxial compression experiments. We find that themaximum compression, equivalent to the highest protoplanetary impact velocities of 50 m s 1, increases the pack-ing density to 0. 20 – 0. 33. Tensile strength measurements with our laboratory samples yield values in the range 200 – 1100 Pa for slightly compressed samples. We review <b>packing</b> <b>densities</b> and tensile strengths found for primitive solar system bodies, e. g., for comets, primitive meteorites, and meteoroids. We find a consistency between <b>packing</b> <b>densities</b> and tensile strengths of our laboratory samples with those from cometary origin.

25|$|MWNTs have mesopores {{that allow}} for easy access of ions at the electrode–electrolyte interface. As the pore size {{approaches}} {{the size of the}} ion solvation shell, the solvent molecules are partially stripped, resulting in larger ionic <b>packing</b> <b>density</b> and increased faradaic storage capability. However, the considerable volume change during repeated intercalation and depletion decreases their mechanical stability.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis is}} presented {{for the two}} stage thermal compression process for an adsorption refrigeration cycle with HFC- 134 a as the working fluid and activated carbon as the adsorbent. Three specimens of varying achievable <b>packing</b> <b>densities</b> were evaluated. The influence of evaporating, condensing/adsorption and desorption temperatures was assessed through three performance indicators, namely,the uptake efficiency, the coefficient of performance and the exergetic efficiency. Conditions under which a two stage thermal compression process performs better than the single stage unit are identified. It is concluded that two stage thermal compression will be a viable proposition when the heat source temperature is low or when adsorption characteristics are weak or when adequate <b>packing</b> <b>densities</b> are difficult to realize.

25|$|Because {{the moving}} parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to {{accurately}} reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through the coil can cause it to overheat (see ohmic heating). Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher <b>packing</b> <b>density</b> in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing knocking and distortion.|$|E

40|$|Spiral-wound modules {{generally}} have high <b>packing</b> <b>densities,</b> low costs, but require extensive feedwater pretreatment {{and have a}} high fouling potential. Tubular membrane modules have beneficial fouling properties, can be backflushed, but have low <b>packing</b> <b>densities</b> and are expensive. Both module types exist for the nanofiltration process. However, the membrane module type combining the superior properties of both types, namely capillary hollow fiber membrane modules, have not been developed yet. This paper presents the flux and retention performance data of new developed nanofiltration capillary hollow fiber membrane modules. The new modules show retention performances comparable with those of best-performing spiral-wound modules. They can typically be applied for water softening and decoloring. Continuous experiments on surface water and nanofiltration whey permeate demonstrate that the fouling behavior of the new capillary modules is indeed better than the spiral-wound modules due to its well-defined feed channel geometry...|$|R
