The case displayed actual physical light bulbs made by Thomas Edison and others from 1878 to 1883. Edison's earliest steps in the bamboo filament and graphite filament lamps are displayed in this case. The first lamp made in a <b>pear</b> <b>shape</b> was in this display, which was the universal shape for electric light bulbs for decades. These in this display case contained numbers that ranged from 1 – 109.|$|E
25|$|Pear-shaped {{diamonds}} {{are also}} known as the teardrop shape owing to their resemblance and is considered as a hybrid between the marquise cut and the round brilliant diamond. The stone has one end rounded while the other end is pointed. <b>Pear</b> <b>shape</b> diamonds can opt between varying length and width ratios for the ideal looking pear-shaped diamond. Length to width ratios between 1.45 and 1.75 are most common.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to changes}} in market {{desirability}} and popularity, the value of different styles of diamond fluctuate. All diamonds can be recut into new shapes that will increase value {{at that time in}} the market and desirability. An example of this is the marquise cut diamond which was popular in the 1970s to 1980s. In later decades, jewelers had little success in selling this shape in comparison to other shapes like the oval or <b>pear</b> <b>shape.</b> The marquise can be cut into an oval diamond by any diamond cutter with a loss of 5-10% in total weight. For example a 1.10 carat marquise shape would be a 1.00 oval cut diamond by rounding the sharp points and creating an oval which currently in the market has a much greater desirability and resale value. The same marquise shape also could become a <b>pear</b> <b>shape</b> instead by only trimming and rounding the side which will be turned into the base of the <b>pear</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A second theory, more {{complicated}} than triaxiality, proposed that observed long periodic orbital variations of the first Earth satellites indicate an additional depression {{at the south pole}} accompanied by a bulge of the same degree at the north pole. It is also contended that the northern middle latitudes were slightly flattened and the southern middle latitudes bulged in a similar amount. This concept suggested a slightly pear-shaped Earth and was the subject of much public discussion. Modern geodesy tends to retain the ellipsoid of revolution and treat triaxiality and <b>pear</b> <b>shape</b> {{as a part of the}} geoid figure: they are represented by the spherical harmonic coefficients [...] and , respectively, corresponding to degree and order numbers 2.2 for the triaxiality and 3.0 for the <b>pear</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|E
