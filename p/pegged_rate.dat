He had a pony {{as a child and}} became {{interested}} in thoroughbred racing at age 11 when his father, James, a dentist, claimed some horses at nearby Sunland Park Racetrack in New Mexico. Bailey took his first racetrack job at Sunland a few years later as a groom for trainer J.J. Pletcher and an occasional babysitter for Pletcher's son, Todd, then in the second grade, who later would follow in his father's footsteps and eventually become America's most successful trainer. Bailey's first official ride came on November 2, 1974, on <b>Pegged</b> <b>Rate</b> at Sunland. That horse finished unplaced, but Bailey won with both his mounts the next day, scoring his first career victory aboard Fetch. He had no grand ambitions: [...] "I didn't think I'd ever leave New Mexico," [...] he says. The next year, Bailey was the leading apprentice jockey at Sunland and Ak-Sar-Ben, where he rode his first stakes winner, Pletcher-trained 3-year-old filly Bye Bye Battle, in the $25,000 His Majesty's Council Handicap on May 24, 1975. After briefly attending college that fall at the University of Texas at El Paso, Bailey returned to the saddle to be leading apprentice at Oaklawn Park in 1976. In the fall of 1976, Bailey moved his tack to the south Florida circuit of Calder Race Course, Gulfstream Park and Hialeah Park, and {{over the next few years}} he also made stops at Hollywood Park, Monmouth Park, Hawthorne Race Course and Arlington Park. In 1982, Bailey began riding regularly at the major New York tracks - Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga - while returning to Florida in the winters, a popular circuit he would continue riding the remainder of his career, and would later dominate.|$|E

A third period, beginning in the early 1990 s, was notable for exchange rate stability, based on the Convertibility Plan, as a broad consensus emerged that the exchange rate should be used for containing inflation rather than engaging in redistribution among domestic interest groups. The authors conclude that additional innovations in Argentina`s monetary and exchange rate policies may eventually be necessary. ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{a mistake}} to debate the merits of {{alternative}} exchange rate regimes for Canada independently of other features of the monetary order. A coherent order requires a well-defined goal for monetary policy, one that the authorities are capable of achieving, and that anchors private sector expectations. For it to be liberal, the relevant authorities should be accountable to the electorate for their performance. These criteria are applied in comparing the merits of: (i) Canada’s current monetary order, based on inflation targets and a flexible exchange rate; (ii) a North American monetary union; (iii) a Canadian currency board; (iv) a legislatively fixed exchange rate; and (v) an adjustably pegged exchange rate. The paper concludes that the current order is well-conceived because cross-border labour mobility is limited, Canadian money wages and prices are sticky, and the real exchange rate between Canada and the United States is subject to real shocks. Among the fixed exchange rate options, all of which are inferior to current arrangements, a full monetary union is judged the most economically viable, though politically illiberal, while a <b>pegged</b> <b>rate</b> seems to provide an untrustworthy basis for a coherent monetary order.

40|$|This paper extends {{earlier work}} (Kenen, 1987 a, 1987 b) on the ranking of {{exchange}} rate regimes. Using a two-country portfolio-balance model, it asks how pegged and floating exchange rates affect each country's {{ability to achieve}} its domestic policy objectives independently, without having to coordinate its monetary policy {{with that of the}} other country. In other words, it uses the game-theoretic framework commonly employed to study policy coordination to look anew at an old question, whether a floating exchange rate can confer policy autonomy on the governments of interdependent economies. I find that it cannot. On the contrary, a pegged but adjustable exchange rate dominates a floating rate, by minimizing the need for policy coordination. In the earlier papers cited above, the two countries were identical in size and perfectly symmetrical in behaviour. Here, they differ in size and behaviour. But the differences do not matter for most of the main results. In three of the five cases studied - a permanent switch in demand between the countries' bonds, a balanced-budget change in one government's spending, and a permanent change in desired wealth leading to a temporary change in saving - a pegged exchange rate is fully optimal. Each government is able to stabilize its country's output and price level by a once-and-for-all open-market operation. There is no need for policy coordination. In the other two cases - a temporary tax change leading to a permanent change in the stock of debt, and a switch in demand between the countries' goods a <b>pegged</b> <b>rate</b> is not optimal (and does not facilitate the use of tax or exchange rate changes to offset the effects of those two disturbances, which it did when the two countries were perfectly symmetrical). But a floating rate is never fully optimal; policy coordination is clearly required for governments to minimize the welfare losses resulting from the output and price effects of all five disturbances. The paper extends the earlier analysis in two other ways. It examines the workings of the symmetrical model under conditions of perfect capital mobility, showing that fiscal policies can sometimes substitute for monetary policies when the latter must be used exclusively for exchange rate stabilization. It also compares the price and output effects of fiscal disturbances under pegged and floating rates, showing that a tax change in one country will have more effect on the other country's output under a floating rate, but more effect on its price level under a <b>pegged</b> <b>rate.</b> Capital Mobility; Exchange Rates Regimes; Fiscal Policy; Monetary Policy; Policy Coordination...|$|E
40|$|In this working paper, John Williamson, {{senior fellow}} at the Institute for International Economics, evaluates {{proposals}} to create a short-term financing facility within the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The emphasis of this facility would be on the time period within which the IMF would respond to a request for assistance, rather than on the duration of the loan. According to Williamson, there are two situations in which existing arrangements within the IMF do not allow for a response quick enough to be effective: when a country is attempting to defend a pegged exchange rate and when default is imminent. Some have suggested that any new facility be able to lend to alleviate these circumstances. Those who support freely floating exchange rates, however, are opposed to supporting a <b>pegged</b> <b>rate</b> regime and favor restricting such activity by any new facility. Others would support the activities of a new facility only in cases that pose a systemic threat. Williamson focuses on the broadest of the purpose that could be fulfilled by a new facility: assisting countries to finance capital flows "judged to be unjustified by the fundamentals and therefore destabilizing. " Proposals fitting this purpose (which date back some years and have been enjoying a recent resurgence) stipulate the countries that should have access to such a facility, the terms and level of access, maturity, and the source of the facility's financing. ...|$|E

Among the most important questions is why have some countries adopted rigid, including fixed, exchange-rate paper addresses this question from a political economy perspective both theoretically and empirically. The model assumes that the monetary authority minimizes a quadratic loss function that captures the trade-off between infla- tion and unemployment. This framework is initially applied to the case where monetary authorities must choose between a (permanently) fixed and a flexible exchange-rate regime. In choosing the regime it is assumed authorities compare the expected losses under each scenario. The model is subsequently extended extended to cover the somewhat more complicated case where the authoriities must choose between fixed-but-adjustable and flexible exchange-rate regimes. In this latter case, potential political costs of abandoningithe <b>pegged</b> <b>rate</b> are taken into account. In the empirical section, an unbalanced panel data set of 63 countries from 1980 - 1992 is used to estimate a series of probit models, with a binary exchange-rate regime index as the dependent variable. Among the most important explanatory variables were measures of countries' historical degree of political instability, measures of the probability of abandoning pegged rates, and variables related to {{the relative importance of}} real (unemployment) targets in the preferences of monetary authorities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fiscal theory of exchange rate crises. When the fiscal authority allows {{the present value}} of primary surpluses inclusive of seigniorage to differ from the current real value of government debt at the pegged exchange rate and a constant expected future interest rate, then the <b>pegged</b> <b>rate</b> is no longer viable. According to the fiscal theory of the price level, the current exchange rate (equivalently the price level) and the price of long-term government bonds, must equate the real value of government debt and {{the present value of}} primary surpluses. In the absence of long-term government bonds, the exchange rate must do the job, and collapse is instantaneous with the change in the present value of primary surpluses. In the presence of a sufficient quantity of long-term bonds, the price of long-term bonds can adjust the real value of government debt, and the collapse can be delayed. Whether collapse is instantaneous or delayed is at the discretion of the monetary authority. The paper shows that while fiscal policy is responsible for generating the crisis, monetary policy is responsible for its characteristics. These include the timing of the crisis and the magnitude of the collapse- period depreciation. This is a fundamentals theory of exchange rate crises. However, the theory shifts the focus for the cause of collapse away from monetary policy toward fiscal policy. And it demonstrates that fundamentals-generated collapse need not occur following a sustained period of policy misalignment and reserve loss. It can explain other types of exchange rate crises, including those, which surprise markets, as with the ERM crises in 1993, and crises caused by expectations of future fiscal expenditures with no sustained reserve loss, as in the Southeast Asian crises of 1997. ...|$|E
