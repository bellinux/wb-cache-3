50|$|Touring {{licensed}} Charles Weymann's {{system of}} fabric-covered lightweight frames, {{which led to}} Touring’s own superleggera construction.Patented by Carrozzeria Touring in 1936, the superleggera system consists of a structural framework of small-diameter steel tubes that conform to an automobile body's shape and are covered by thin alloy body panels that strengthen the framework. Aside from light weight, the superleggera construction system allows great design and manufacturing flexibility, enabling coachbuilders to quickly construct innovative body shapes. The superleggera tubes were brazed to shape on a jig and the panels were then fitted over this. The panels are only attached at their edges, mostly by swaging the <b>panel</b> <b>edges</b> over angle-section strips on the steel framework. Most of the panel has no rigid or metal-to-metal contact with the framework, it merely rests on it, with the tubes wrapped in hessian or with a rubber spacer.|$|E
50|$|The tableau, tab, or tabbed curtain, {{also called}} opera drapes, though iconic {{of the theater}} setting, is the rarest of {{curtains}} to actually be employed on the stage. It consists of two overlapping panels (often but not always pleated) secured along the top to a batten, with the lower onstage corners or center points of the <b>panel</b> <b>edges</b> attached to lines or cables. These lines run through series of rings behind each curtain diagonally, and then through pulleys in the batten {{and down to the}} floor. When the cord is pulled, the fabric is lifted diagonally up and out, away from the center. In this position, it does not fully clear the stage, instead creating a frilled tent-like viewing frame for the performance- it is because of this tendency to limit the audience's view that it is rarely used except in very small venues. However, as the top of the curtain never moves, it requires no track (like a traveler curtain) and as the curtain itself is never actually raised, neither does it require any sandbag counterweights (like an oleo or an Austrian).|$|E

50|$|After {{moving the}} panel {{to the proper}} {{deployment}} location as indicated on the Panel Layout Diagram for the project, the panel is unfolded or unrolled from the shipping pallet. The pallet is usually on a front-end loader or forklift which moves backwards to facilitate unfolding or unrolling of the panel. Pulling the geomembrane panel off the pallet or the roll by a chain is not recommended because it may damage the geomembrane. Deployment personnel are then positioned approximately 4.6 m apart along the <b>edges</b> of the <b>panel</b> to unfold and move the panel into the proper location. If the edge to be gripped is to be subsequently welded or bonded, the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> is folded back about 0.6 to 1.0 m, creating a fold. The fold is gripped using the 0.3 m long by 10 mm (1-foot long by 2 inch) diameter smooth wooden dowel or a smooth grade stake rather than the edge itself. This is to avoid stretching the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> where {{it is to be}} bonded to another panel. As the panel is pulled out, it is necessary to maintain air under the geomembrane to reduce friction with the ground surface. This can be accomplished by holding the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> and advancing at a rate fast enough to create air under the geomembrane as it is unfolded. Another method is to “fan” air under the geomembrane by raising and lowering the <b>edge</b> of the <b>panel</b> to create a wave-like action across the liner as it is being spread. After the panel is set in the exact position, it is welded or bonded to adjacent panels.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the "interior noise" produced by high, subsonic turbulent flow over a thin elastic plate partitioned into "panels" by straight edges transverse to the mean flow direction. This configuration models a section of an aircraft fuselage that may be regarded as locally flat. The analytical problem can be solved in closed form to represent the acoustic radiation in terms of prescribed turbulent boundary layer pressure fluctuations. Two cases are considered: (i) the production of sound at an isolated <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> (i. e., in the approximation in which the correlation between sound and vibrations generated at neighboring edges is neglected), and (ii) the sound generated by a periodic arrangement of identical panels. The latter problem is amenable to exact analytical treatment provided the <b>panel</b> <b>edge</b> conditions are {{the same for all}} panels. Detailed predictions of the interior noise depend on a knowledge of the turbulent boundary layer wall pressure spectrum, and are given here in terms of an empirical spectrum proposed by Laganelli and Wolfe.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of two-dimensional Tollmien-Schlichting waves propagating along a wall shear layer {{as it passes}} over a compliant panel of finite length is investigated by means of numerical simulation. It is shown that the interaction of such waves with {{the edges of the}} panel can lead to complex patterns of behaviour. The behaviour of the Tollmien-Schlichting waves in this situation, particularly the effect on their growth rate, is pertinent to the practical application of compliant walls for the delay of laminar-turbulent transition. If compliant panels could be made sufficiently short whilst retaining the capability to stabilize Tollmien-Schlichting waves, there is a good prospect that multiple-panel compliant walls could be used to maintain laminar flow at indefinitely high Reynolds numbers. We consider a model problem whereby a section of a plane channel is replaced with a compliant panel. A growing Tollmien-Schlichting wave is then introduced into the plane, rigid-walled, channel flow upstream of the compliant panel. The results obtained are very encouraging from the viewpoint of laminar-flow control. They indicate that compliant panels as short as a single Tollmien-Schlichting wavelength can have a strong stabilizing effect. In some cases the passage of the Tollmien-Schlichting wave over the <b>panel</b> <b>edges</b> leads to the excitation of stable flow-induced surface waves. The presence of these additional waves {{does not appear to be}} associated with any adverse effect on the stability of the Tollmien-Schlichting waves. Except very near the <b>panel</b> <b>edges</b> the panel response and flow perturbation can be represented by a superposition of the Tollmien-Schlichting wave and two other eigenmodes of the coupled Orr-Sommerfeld/compliant-wall eigensystem. The numerical scheme employed for the simulations is derived from a novel vorticity-velocity formulation of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations and uses a mixed finite-difference/spectral spatial discretization. This approach facilitated the development of a highly efficient solution procedure. Problems with numerical stability were overcome by combining the inertias of the compliant wall and fluid when imposing the boundary conditions. This allowed the interactively coupled fluid and wall motions to be computed without any prior restriction on the form taken by the disturbances...|$|E
