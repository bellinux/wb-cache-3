From a thorough literature review about work done on the relation between DINs and productivity, we found that the theoretical and empirical support for this relation is still inconclusive.

40|$|Secure and {{efficient}} communication between computers {{is becoming more}} essential as companies attempt to utilize the <b>public</b> <b>network</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for supporting communication between their various sites. The IPSEC protocols have been proposed {{as a solution to}} balance the needs of security and networking between computers. The basic IPSEC protocols are based on the end-to-end security model and when used in the most secure mode do not allow any intermediate nodes in the network to access and obtain information from packet headers encrypted by the security end-points. However, with the advent of smart applications {{in the middle of the}} network, which attempt to make it more efficient, a tradeoff is created between security and efficiency. This tradeoff is the result of the need for these intelligent applications to access packet header information which is not possible with secure IPSEC flows. This thesis analyzes and evaluates several possible solutions to this problem and argues why they all involve an unacceptable loss in the level of security or are not practical in any real system. On the basis of these arguments it thenproposes the use of Layered IPSEC to solve the problem. Layered IPSEC adds flexibility to the current IPSEC protocols by providing the ability to use multiple encryption algorithms with separate encryption keys for different parts of a packet. We also describe an experimental implementation of the concept and provide timing measurements from it. On the basis of our experience with the implementation and our experimental measurements we argue for the feasiblity and usefulness of this scheme...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) {{provides}} an economical and efficient solution on communicating private information securely over <b>public</b> <b>network</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> VPNs {{make use of}} tunneling, security mechanisms and other networking devices, e. g. firewalls. It {{is believed to be}} an important technology in the 21 st century. There are a number of VPN products on the commercial market. However, none of them guarantees the establishment of VPN connections as none of them reserves public network resources during the set up of VPNs. In this thesis, we propose a VPN solution that carries out bandwidth reservation during the VPN establishment. The discussion is divided into two parts - the networking aspects and the security aspects. In the first part, we discuss the three-layered logical architecture of our VPN solution and classify the VPN components into three categories -VPN members, VPN managers and VPN administrator. In order for these components to perform VPN functions, a specialized software ("Customer Sited Security Processor") is installed. We discuss the architecture of this software in details. We also discuss the mandatory VPN operations implemented in the processor and the VPN protocol stack that handles the VPN requests/responses. In the second part, we turn to the security aspects. We carry out analysis on three kinds of security attacks - 1) tricking a VPN member to accept an invalid VPN message (message spoofing), 2) acquiring extra public network resources illegally (bandwidth stealing) and 3) interrupting the VPN service (denial of service). The success rates of (1) and (2) depend on the choices of encryption schemes, authentication schemes and accuracy of local clocks. The success rate of (3) depends on security of intermediate routers/ATM switches, VPN managers and security of ATM control plane. We also suggest a simple method to detect these attacks...|$|E
40|$|As {{internet}} usage grows exponentially, {{network security}} issues become increasingly important. Network security measures {{are needed to}} protect data during transmission. Various security controls are used to prevent the access of hackers in networks. They are firewall, virtual private networks and encryption algorithms. Out of these, the virtual private network plays {{a vital role in}} preventing hackers from accessing the networks. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) provides end users with a way to privately access information on their network over a <b>public</b> <b>network</b> <b>infrastructure</b> such as the internet. Using a technique called “Tunneling”, data packets are transmitted across a public routed network, such as the internet that simulates a point-to-point connection. Virtual private networks provide customers with a secure and low-cost communication environment. The basic structure of the virtual circuit is to create a logical path from the source port to the destination port. This path may incorporate many hops between routers for the formation of the circuit. The final, logical path or virtual circuit acts {{in the same way as}} a direct connection between the two ports. Our proposed Provisioning Restorable Virtual Private Networks Algorithm (PRA) is used to combine the provisioning and restoration algorithms to achieve better results than the ones obtained by independent restoration and provisioning. In order to ensure service quality and availability in Virtual Private Networks, seamless recovery from failures is essential. The quality of service of the Virtual Private Networks is also improved due to the combination of provisioning and restoration. The bandwidth sharing concept is also applied in link to improve the quality of service in the Virtual Private Network. The performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out in terms of cost, the number of nodes, the number of VPN nodes, delay, asymmetric ratio and delay with constraints with Disjoint Path Algorithm and Approximation Restoration Virtual Private Networks Algorithm.

We develop a framework for comparing the survivability and resiliency of different space architectures, namely that of a monolithic design and a distributed (or networked) space system architecture. There are multiple metrics along which different space architectures can be benchmarked and compared. We argue that if survivability and resiliency are not accounted for, then the evaluation process is likely to be biased in favor of monolithic spacecraft.

We support the first part of our study on the existing literature about the effective size of labor market. Under the specification of a conceptual model, we want to demonstrate the significant correlation (even causality) between accessibility and type of jobs in Bogot 1. In order to capture the possible endogeneity among transport' accessibility and type of jobs we will use a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).

The performance of m-health services perceived by endusers depends on the serviceableness of 3 G networks to support these services.
