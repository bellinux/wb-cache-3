40|$|International audienceBesides {{well-known}} benefits, commodity {{cloud storage}} also raises concerns that include security, reliability, and consistency. We present Hybris key-value store, the first robust hybrid cloud storage system, aiming at addressing these concerns leveraging {{both private and}} public cloud resources. Hybris robustly replicates metadata on trusted <b>private</b> <b>premises</b> (<b>private</b> cloud), separately from data which is dispersed (using replication or erasure coding) across multiple untrusted public clouds. Hybris maintains metadata stored on <b>private</b> <b>premises</b> at the order of few dozens of bytes per key, avoiding the scalability bottleneck at the private cloud. In turn, the hybrid design allows Hybris to efficiently and robustly tolerate cloud outages, but also potential malice in clouds without overhead. Namely, to tolerate up to f malicious clouds, in the common case of the Hybris variant with data replication, writes replicate data across f + 1 clouds, whereas reads involve a single cloud. In the worst case, only up to f additional clouds are used. This is considerably better than earlier multi-cloud storage systems that required costly 3 f + 1 clouds to mask f potentially malicious clouds. Finally, Hybris leverages strong metadata consistency to guarantee to Hybris applications strong data consistency without any modifications to the eventually consistent public clouds. We implemented Hybris in Java and evaluated it using a series of micro and macro-benchmarks. Our results show that Hybris significantly outperforms comparable multi-cloud storage systems and approaches the performance of bare-bone commodity public cloud storage...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to review}} {{the current state of}} {{building}} decay in Hong Kong, and attempts to identify and analyze the perceived benefits of implementing the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme (MBIS) via an industry-wide empirical questionnaire survey. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 340 professional respondents who have gained hands-on experience in either new building works or building management or building repair/maintenance were requested to complete a survey questionnaire to indicate the relative importance of those benefits identified in relation to MBIS. The perceived benefits were measured, ranked and compared according to the different roles of industrial practitioners, and between the residents in <b>private</b> <b>premises</b> and those in public estates. Findings – The survey findings suggested the most significant benefits derived from implementing MBIS to be: raise the overall building safety toward residents and the general public; create more job openings and business opportunities in building repair and maintenance services; and MBIS is an effective solution to address the problems with building decay (e. g. dilapidation and control over the existing unauthorized building works). The results of factor analysis indicated that the 13 perceived benefits of implementing MBIS were consolidated under three underlying factors: addressing building dilapidation and assuring building safety; improving the living environment and upgrading property values; and creating more job openings and business opportunities. Social implications – As MBIS was officially launched on June 30, 2012, it is expected {{to be one of the}} proposed effective measures in resolving the long-standing problems of building neglect and deterioration in Hong Kong and overseas, especially to those existing old <b>private</b> <b>premises.</b> Originality/value – In the long run, the number of prematurely ageing buildings would be reduced, and the service life span of existing <b>private</b> <b>premises</b> would be prolonged. This is in line with the sustainability principle of providing a better living and the working environment within the community as a whole. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|R
50|$|Since dumpsters {{are usually}} located on <b>private</b> <b>premises,</b> divers may {{occasionally}} {{get in trouble}} for trespassing while dumpster diving, though the law is enforced {{with varying degrees of}} rigor. Some businesses may lock dumpsters to prevent pickers from congregating on their property, vandalism to their property, and to limit potential liability if a dumpster diver is injured while on their property. Dumpster diving is often not prohibited by law. Abandonment of property is another principle of law that applies to recovering materials via dumpster diving.|$|R
