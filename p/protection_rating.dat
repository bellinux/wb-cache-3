2500|$|The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) {{awarded the}} Camry sedan an overall rating of [...] "good" [...] in both frontal offset and side impact crash tests. Both tests also receive the [...] "good" [...] rating in all 14 {{measured}} categories, {{and is also}} rated [...] "good" [...] in the roof strength test with a 5.31 strength-to-weight ratio withstanding a peak force of [...] The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) originally rated the XV40 the full five-star rating for the frontal driver, frontal passenger, side driver, and side rear passenger tests, and a four-star rating for the rollover test. However, under the new NHTSA testing methodology introduced in 2010, the 2011 model year XV40 was downgraded to a three-star rating. This overall vehicle score was broken down into the frontal barrier crash rating of four-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), giving an overall front-impact <b>protection</b> <b>rating</b> of three-stars. A side barrier rating of five-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), gave for an overall side-impact <b>protection</b> <b>rating</b> of three-stars. The third testing component, the rollover rating, resulted in a grading of four-stars. Subsequently, the NHTSA tested a later release of the 2011 model year Camry with enhanced safety. This resulted in an increase to the side barrier rating from two- to four-stars for the front female passenger, thus increasing the Camry's overall score to four-stars.|$|E
2500|$|Testing {{conducted}} by the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) resulted in the Camry XV40 receiving a four-star safety rating or a score of 27.53 out of 37. Dual frontal airbags were fitted to the model tested. ANCAP later tested the hybrid variant fitted with additional side and curtain airbags. The hybrid also scored four-stars, although did achieve a higher 28.22-point grading. Prompted by the five-star ANCAP safety rating mandate for all passenger cars purchased by the Australian federal government from 1 July 2011, Toyota Australia revised the XV40 specification including the fitment of a front passenger seatbelt reminder. This resulted in an upgraded five-star result for Australian models produced from May 2011. While the regular version scored 33.13 points, the hybrid rated marginally better at 33.22 out of 37. The offset crash yielded 14.29 out of 16, with 14.84 out of 16 for the side impact crash test. An additional two points came from completing the pole test, while the seatbelt reminders yielded the qualifying two points required for the five-star result. The hybrid fared identically except in the offset crash test where it gained 0.08 points then picking up 0.01 in the side impact crash. Both cars also scored a [...] "marginal" [...] pedestrian <b>protection</b> <b>rating</b> at 14.5 out of 36.

Plant level productivities are estimated for the 1983 - 96 period following the procedure of Olley and Pakes (1996). Industry averages indicate that productivity gains are largest in import competing industries with highest gains reaching to 8 % per year during periods of rapid decline in <b>protection</b> <b>rates.</b> A decomposition of industry level productivity gains also suggests important differences across sectors by trade orientation. Though reallocation of market shares to more productive plants are important in both export oriented, and import competing sectors, within plant productivity improvements are significant only in export-oriented sectors. We also investigate the effects of changes in <b>protection</b> <b>rates</b> on plant level productivities using regressions that control for endogeneity of <b>protection</b> <b>rates</b> (tariff and non-tariff). We find that productivity improvements resulting from declining protection levels are statistically significant and economically important, especially in import competing sectors.

40|$|Abstract Background Praziquantel {{has been}} used as {{first-line}} drug for chemotherapy of schistosomiasis since 1984. Besides praziquantel, artemether and artesunate have also been used for the control of this infectious disease since late 1990 s. In this article, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the antischistosomal efficacy of different medication strategies including monotherapy or combination therapies of these drugs. Results A number of 52 trials from 38 articles published in peer-reviewed journals before July 2011 were selected for analysis after searching the following literature databases: the Cochrane Library, PubMed/Medline, ISI Web of Science, Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Our meta-analyses showed that a dosage of 30 - 60 mg/kg praziquantel compared with placebo produced a <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> of about 76 % (95 % CI: 67 %- 83 %) for treating human schistosomiasis, which varied from 70 % to 76 % with no significant differences among the subspecies S. haematobium, S. japonicum or S. mansoni. <b>Protection</b> <b>rates</b> were higher when praziquantel doses were elevated, as concluded from the nRCTs results: the <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> of praziquantel at 40 mg/kg was 52 % (95 % CI: 49 %- 55 %), and it increased to 91 % (95 % CI: 88 %- 92 %) when the dosages were elevated to 60 / 80 / 100 mg/kg divided two or more doses. Multiple doses of artemether or artesunate over 1 - or 2 -week intervals resulted in <b>protection</b> <b>rates</b> of 65 % to 97 % for preventing schistosomiasis, and increased doses and shorter medication intervals improved their efficacies. Praziquantel and artemisinin derivatives (artemether or artesunate) in combination resulted in a higher <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> of 84 % (95 % CI: 64 %- 91 %) than praziquantel monotherapy for treatment. praziquantel and artesunate in combination had a great <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> of 96 % (95 % CI: 78 %- 99 %) for preventing schistosomes infection. Conclusions According to the results, praziquantel remains effective in schistosomiasis treatment, and multiple doses would improve its efficacy; meanwhile, praziquantel is also a good drug for preventing acute schistosomiasis morbidity. It's better to use multiple doses of artemether or artesunate with 1 - or 2 -week intervals for prevention against schistosome infection. Praziquantel and artemether or artesunate in combination perform better in treatment than praziquantel monotherapy, and they are especially suitable for treating the patients with repeated exposure to infected water. </p...|$|R

The frequently encountered risk groups last-minute travellers, solo-travellers, business travellers, travellers {{visiting friends and relatives}} (VFR) and elderly travellers were specifically studied. Results A total of 3045 respondents were included in the survey. Travellers to destinations with a high risk for hepatitis B had significantly less accurate risk perceptions (knowledge) than travellers to low-risk destinations but no differences were observed in past risk-taking attitude. <b>Protection</b> <b>rates</b> against hepatitis B were significantly higher in travellers to high-risk destinations.

40|$|This {{paper has}} two aims. A {{specific}} {{goal is to}} examine the determinants of protection policy in Turkey. A second, broader goal is to test the recent insights of the political economy models of trade policy and assess their contribution to the empirical investigation of associations between <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> and industry characteristics. The paper develops a stylized model that captures the key common results of the new political economy models of trade policy, which show that import penetration and price elasticity of import demand act as weights in the relationship between an industry's <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> and its political characteristics. We find that adhering to the specific functional form that the theory generates substantially improves the explanatory power of industry characteristics in our econometric work on Turkish data. The results show that <b>protection</b> <b>rate</b> is higher for industries with smaller, less capital-intensive firms and low wage workers. Interestingly, these effects vanish when such firms are publicly owned. These outcomes suggest that the risk-mitigating role of trade barriers is an important factor driving government policy in Turkey. The finding implies that continued move toward openness to international trade require progress in fiscal systems or domestic and international institutions that can deal with the economic insecurities generated by globalization. ...|$|R
