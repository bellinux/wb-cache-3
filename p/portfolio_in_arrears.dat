However, by its first birthday, the Bank was able to declare a consolidated profit and had reduced the loan <b>portfolio</b> <b>in</b> <b>arrears</b> to 33% by August 1994 (it had been 62% in September 1993).

40|$|We will {{investigate}} valuation of derivatives with payoff {{defined as a}} nonlinear though close to linear function of tradable underlying assets. Derivatives involving Libor or swap rates <b>in</b> <b>arrears,</b> i. e. rates paid in a wrong time, are a typical example. It is generally tempting to replace the future unknown interest rates with the forward rates. We will show rigorously that indeed this is not possible {{in the case of}} Libor or swap rates <b>in</b> <b>arrears.</b> We will introduce formally the notion of plain vanilla derivatives as those that can be replicated by a finite set of elementary operations and show that derivatives involving the rates <b>in</b> <b>arrears</b> are not plain vanilla. We will also study the issue of valuation of such derivatives. Beside the popular convexity adjustment formula, we will develop an improved two or more variable adjustment formula applicable in particular on swap rates <b>in</b> <b>arrears.</b> Finally, we will get a precise fully analytical formula based on the usual assumption of log-normality of the relevant tradable underlying assets applicable to a wide class of convexity related derivatives. We will illustrate the techniques and different results on a case study of a real life controversial exotic swap. interest rate derivatives, Libor <b>in</b> <b>arrears,</b> constant maturity swap, valuation models, convexity adjustment...|$|R
