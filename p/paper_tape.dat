5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the three Americans' system for telegraphy, which {{was first used}} in about 1844, was {{designed}} to make indentations on a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> when electric currents were received. Morse's original telegraph receiver used a mechanical clockwork to move a <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> When an electrical current was received, an electromagnet engaged an armature that pushed a stylus onto the moving <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> making an indentation on the tape. When the current was interrupted, a spring retracted the stylus, and {{that portion of the}} moving tape remained unmarked.|$|E
25|$|At the seminar, a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{containing}} a pre-release version of Altair BASIC disappeared. The tape {{was given to}} Steve Dompier who {{passed it on to}} Dan Sokol who had access to a high speed tape punch. At the next Homebrew Computer Club meeting, 50 copies of Altair BASIC on <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> appeared in a cardboard box.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In {{embroidery}} factories {{the designs}} are coded on punched <b>paper</b> <b>tapes.</b> The code (punched holes or no holes) is proprietary by the manufacturer. This paper describes {{a method that}} reads those <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> into files, converts them to graphical representation, modifies and exports them to the required needlework format. The production stages benefit from this, since the produced outcome (graphic design) will be known in real time, enabling the user to perform corrections or alterations, {{with the aid of}} standard graphical tools available in the toolbars of the original design, including creation of new designs. The new or modified designs are saved in the appropriate code format required from each different embroidery machine.

25|$|Some {{linotype}} machines {{included a}} <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader. This allowed {{the text to}} be typeset to be supplied over a telegraph line (TeleTypeSetter). It also allowed for several tape perforator operators to prepare <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> to be processed by a single linotype machine, essentially decoupling the typing speed of the operators from the operating speed of the linotype machine.|$|E

25|$|After {{the program}} {{finished}} executing, the output {{may have been}} printed, or {{it may have been}} punched onto <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> or cards for later processing.|$|E
50|$|The DUDEK series used random {{symmetric}} keys {{provided on}} <b>paper</b> <b>tapes,</b> which were XORed {{by the unit}} with the plaintext provided from the teleprinter or recorded on different <b>paper</b> <b>tapes.</b> The DUDEK sets were {{to be used in}} conjunction with teleprinters like the Siemens/Ceska Zbrojovka T-100 or the RFT T-51. The maximum transmission speed was at 50 or 75 Baud. The system was cleared up to the top secret level by the Poles provided that it served within the Tempested environment.|$|R

50|$|Examples of {{machine-readable}} media include {{magnetic media}} such as magnetic disks, cards, tapes, and drums, punched cards and <b>paper</b> <b>tapes,</b> optical discs, barcodes and magnetic ink characters.|$|R
25|$|In 1804, Joseph-Marie Jacquard {{developed}} a loom {{in which the}} pattern being woven was controlled by a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> constructed from punched cards. The <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> could be changed without changing the mechanical design of the loom. This was a landmark achievement in programmability. His machine was an improvement over similar weaving looms. Punched cards were preceded by punch bands, as in the machine proposed by Basile Bouchon. These bands would inspire information recording for automatic pianos and more recently numerical control machine tools.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Morse telegraphs, the receiver's armature made a clicking noise {{as it moved}} {{in and out of}} position to mark the <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> The telegraph operators soon learned that they could translate the clicks directly into dots and dashes, and write these down by hand, thus making the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> unnecessary. When Morse code was adapted to radio communication, the dots and dashes were sent as short and long tone pulses. It was later found that people become more proficient at receiving Morse code when it is taught as a language that is heard, instead of one read from a page.|$|E

25|$|Before {{computers}} were affordable, most machine embroidery {{was completed by}} punching designs on <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> that then ran through an embroidery machine. One error could ruin an entire design, forcing the creator to start over.|$|E
25|$|Computers used <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{and punched}} cards for data and {{programming}} input until the 1980s {{when it was}} still common to receive monthly utility bills printed on a punched card that was returned with the customer’s payment.|$|E
25|$|In 1846, Alexander Bain {{patented}} {{a chemical}} telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current made a readable mark on a moving <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> soaked {{in a mixture}} of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, which gave a blue mark when a current was passed through it.|$|E

25|$|In computing, a {{computer}} keyboard is a typewriter-style device which uses {{an arrangement of}} buttons or keys {{to act as a}} mechanical lever or electronic switch. Following the decline of punch cards and <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input device for computers.|$|E
25|$|Self-acting {{machine tools}} that {{displaced}} hand dexterity {{so they could}} be operated by boys and unskilled laborers were developed by James Nasmyth in the 1840s. Machine tools were automated with Numerical control (NC) using punched <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> in the 1950s. This soon evolved into computerized numerical control (CNC).|$|E
25|$|Although {{electric}} typewriters {{would not}} achieve widespread popularity until {{nearly a century}} later, the basic groundwork for the electric typewriter was laid by the Universal Stock Ticker, invented by Thomas Edison in 1870.

25|$|Purely {{electronic}} circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, {{at the same}} time that digital calculation replaced analog. Machines such as the Z3, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, the Colossus computers, and the ENIAC were built by hand, using circuits containing relays or valves (vacuum tubes), and often used punched cards or punched <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> for input and as the main (non-volatile) storage medium.|$|E
25|$|For {{acoustic}} hydrography and bathymetry, {{the ship}} had a deep-water echosounder, a shallow-water echosounder-lOOKhz, and a hydrographic survey sounder. To process data, she had the National Ocean Services Hydrochart system, which employed a PDP/8E computer to acquire and process hydrographic data in real time, generate a real-time position-corrected plot of sounding data, provide steering commands to the helmsman, and generate a punched <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> for shore-based processing of sounding dara.|$|E
25|$|When {{the machine}} first shipped, {{flipping}} {{switches on the}} front panel {{was the only way}} to get programs or data into the machine, and the only output from the programs was the patterns of lights on the panel. Nevertheless, many were sold in this form. Roberts was already hard at work on additional cards, including a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader for storage, additional RAM cards, and a RS-232 interface to connect to a proper Teletype terminal.|$|E
5000|$|A {{family of}} {{machines}} known as [...] "Robinsons" [...] were {{built for the}} Newmanry. These used two <b>paper</b> <b>tapes,</b> along with logic circuitry, to find the settings of the χ pin wheels of the Lorenz machine. The Robinsons had major problems keeping the two <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> synchronized and were relatively slow, reading only 2000 characters per second.The most important machine was the Colossus of which ten were in use by the war's end, the first becoming operational in December 1943. Although not fully programmable, they were far more efficient than their predecessors, representing advances in electronic digital computers. The Colossus computers were developed and built by Tommy Flowers, of the Dollis Hill Post Office Research Station, using algorithms developed by W.T. Tutte {{and his team of}} mathematicians. Colossus proved to be efficient and quick against the twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine.|$|R
