50|$|A {{historical}} {{trend of}} a {{sharp decline in}} numbers, <b>particularly</b> in <b>the</b> general vicinity of Zumberak, is explained by a number of factors including emigration, <b>particularly</b> to <b>the</b> United States (including Cleveland, Chicago and Pittsburgh), and rural depopulation, <b>particularly</b> in <b>the</b> period following the second world war.|$|R
50|$|<b>Particularly</b> in <b>the</b> Russian literature, a subtype of dysautonomia which <b>particularly</b> affects <b>the</b> {{vascular}} {{system has been}} called vegetative-vascular dystonia. The term vegetative reflects an older name for the autonomic nervous system: the vegetative nervous system.|$|R
50|$|The outer rim of King {{is roughly}} {{circular}} {{but with a}} slightly irregular appearance, <b>particularly</b> at <b>the</b> northern end. The crater displays little appearance of wear.

5|$|A {{large number}} of strains {{belonging}} to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), they can be classified according to their phylogeny, i.e. the inferred evolutionary history, as shown below where the species is divided into six groups. <b>Particularly</b> <b>the</b> use of whole genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. Based on such data, five subspecies of E. coli were distinguished.|$|E
5|$|A {{major source}} of zircon (and hence hafnium) ores is heavy mineral sands ore deposits, pegmatites, {{particularly}} in Brazil and Malawi, and carbonatite intrusions, <b>particularly</b> <b>the</b> Crown Polymetallic Deposit at Mount Weld, Western Australia.

5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. <b>Particularly,</b> <b>the</b> fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis.
