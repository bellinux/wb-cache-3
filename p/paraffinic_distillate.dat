40|$|Scale model fuel {{heating systems}} {{for use with}} {{aviation}} hydrocarbon fuel at low temperatures were investigated. The effectiveness of the heating systems in providing flowability and pumpability at extreme low temperature when some freezing of the fuel would otherwise occur is evaluated. The test tank simulated a section of an outer wing tank, and was chilled on {{the upper and lower}} surfaces. Turbine engine lubricating oil was heated, and recirculating fuel transferred the heat. Fuels included: a commercial Jet A; an intermediate freeze point distillate; a higher freeze point distillate blended according to Experimental Referee Broadened Specification guidelines; and a higher freeze point <b>paraffinic</b> <b>distillate</b> used in a preceding investigation. Each fuel was chilled to selected temperature to evaluate unpumpable solid formation (holdup). Tests simulating extreme cold weather flight, without heating, provided baseline fuel holdup data. Heating and recirculating fuel increased bulk temperature significantly; it had a relatively small effect on temperature {{near the bottom of the}} tank. Methods which increased penetration of heated fuel into the lower boundary layer improved the capability for reducing holdup...|$|E
