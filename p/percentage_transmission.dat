TAPPI Provisional Method T 567 pm- 97 is based on application of the Kubelka Munk (KM) theory to diffuse reflection from papers measured once with the black backing and again with a thick backing of the same papers. At high opacities the two results become indistinguishable, leading to an undetermined value for ERIC when the full KM theory is applied.

Reading rates for 12 subjects with non-exudative AMD, associated with a relative scotoma and central fixation (mean age 81 years, SD 5. 07 years) were determined using the Rate of Reading Test® (printed, nonsense, lower case sans serif, stationary text) with 10 different, coloured light filter overlays (Intuitive Overlays®; figures in brackets are <b>percentage</b> <b>transmission</b> values); rose (78 %), pink (78 %), purple (67 %), aqua (81 %), blue (74 %), lime-green (86 %), mint-green (85 %), yellow (93 %), orange (83 %) and grey (71 %). A clear overlay (Roscolene # 00) (360 cdm- 2) with 100 % transmittance was used as a control. Results: ANOVA indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in reading rates with the coloured light filter overlays compared to the clear filter. Furthermore, chi-squared analysis indicated that the rose, purple and blue filters had a significantly poorer overall ranking in terms of reading rates compared to the other coloured and clear light filters. Conclusion: Coloured light filter overlays are unlikely to provide a clinically significant improvement in reading rates for people with non-exudative AMD associated with a relative scotoma and central fixation.

Spectroradiometric and dosimetric techniques were employed in the experimental approach. The percentage of the glass-filtered solar UV compared to the unfiltered UV ranged from 59 % to 70 % and was influenced to a small extent by the glass thickness and the SZA. The laminated glass transmitted 11 - 12 % and the windscreen glass transmitted 2. 5 - 2. 6 %. The influence of the SZA was less for the thicker glass than it was for the thinner glass. The change in transmission was less than 14 % for the SZA between 48 ° and 71 °. There was a negligible influence due to the SZA on the glass-transmitted UV of the laminated and windscreen glass.

40|$|Whether {{to assess}} the {{functionality}} of equipment or as a determinate for the accuracy of assays, reference standards are essential {{for the purposes of}} standardisation and validation. The ELISPOT assay, developed over thirty years ago, has emerged as a leading immunological assay in the development of novel vaccines for the assessment of efficacy. However, with its widespread use, there is a growing demand for a greater level of standardisation across different laboratories. One of the major difficulties in achieving this goal has been the lack of definitive reference standards. This is partly due to the ex vivo nature of the assay, which relies on cells being placed directly into the wells. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to produce an artificial reference standard using liposomes, for use within the assay. Liposomes are spherical bilayer vesicles with an enclosed aqueous compartment and therefore are models for biological membranes. Initial work examined pre-design considerations in order to produce an optimal formulation that would closely mimic the action of the cells ordinarily placed on the assay. Recognition of the structural differences between liposomes and cells led to the formulation of liposomes with increased density. This was achieved by using a synthesised cholesterol analogue. By incorporating this cholesterol analogue in liposomes, increased sedimentation rates were observed within the first few hours. The optimal liposome formulation from these studies was composed of 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DPPC), cholesterol (Chol) and brominated cholesterol (Brchol) at a 16 : 4 : 12 µMol ratio, based on a significantly higher (p< 0. 01) sedimentation (as determined by a <b>percentage</b> <b>transmission</b> of 59 ± 5. 9 % compared to the control formulation at 29 ± 12 % after four hours). By considering a range of liposome formulations ‘proof of principle’ for using liposomes as ELISPOT reference standards was shown; recombinant IFN? cytokine was successfully entrapped within vesicles of different lipid compositions, which were able to promote spot formation within the ELISPOT assay. Using optimised liposome formulations composed of phosphatidylcholine with or without cholesterol (16 µMol total lipid) further development was undertaken to produce an optimised, scalable protocol for the production of liposomes as reference standards. A linear increase in spot number by the manipulation of cytokine concentration and/or lipid concentrations was not possible, potentially due to the saturation that occurred within the base of wells. Investigations into storage of the formulations demonstrated the feasibility of freezing and lyophilisation with disaccharide cryoprotectants, but also highlighted the need for further protocol optimisation to achieve a robust reference standard upon storage. Finally, the transfer of small-scale production to a medium lab-scale batch (40 mL) demonstrated this was feasible within the laboratory using the optimised protocol...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} rate equation {{model has}} been developed to describe the dynamics of a solid-state laser during continuous wave or Q-switched operation. The model allows the optimization of parameters such as the output coupler <b>transmission</b> <b>percentage,</b> crystal length and beam diameters, {{with the aim of}} improving the laser output performance. To validate the model, it was applied to a Nd:YLF laser, and proved successful in predicting and explaining the laser dynamics. It also satisfied our objective of creating a useful laser design tool.

40|$|Abstract — This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in an attempt to determine whether “healing with intent ” could be shown to exert an effect on pepsin enzyme ac-tivity which, if proven, might serve to raise the credibility of healing as a bona fide therapy. The ability of healing to influence enzyme activity was chosen as a method of assessment as it eliminated the possibility of the placebo ef-fect, which is often encountered when using human subjects. The rate of breakdown of egg albumen by a 1 % pepsin solution was followed using a Jenway 6051 Colorimeter at a wavelength of 470 nm. An effect due to heal-ing was indicated by experiments using <b>percentage</b> light <b>transmission</b> (%T) as an indicator of reaction rate. Across 20 separate trials the reaction rate of the enzyme sample “healed with intent ” was found to be significantly greater than the unhealed sample (P = 0. 03) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of a combined system of a polyelectrolyte, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and highly fibrillated fibrous materials, cellulose triacetate fibrets (CTF), for the recovery of proteins and other biological compounds from model and actual biological systems has been demonstrated. In the present work, reaction batches were scaled-up to a one-liter agitated vessel, with a standard configuration. The effect of mixing conditions on the adsorption and flocculation process was studied. It was observed that flocculation time was very fast, occurring within the period of polymer addition. Long term shearing {{did not result in}} floc breakage and the values of <b>percentage</b> light <b>transmission</b> and protein concentration of the final filtrate remained the same during the incubation period. Increasing the shear rate resulted in improved process efficiency, up to an optimum value, above which performance was poorer. Perikinetic and orthokinetic rate parameters were calculated and results analyzed in view of these parameters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} a game theoretic setting for prevention of {{denial of service}} (DoS) attack in wireless sensor networks consisting of malicious nodes. We propose a protocol based on game theory which achieves the design objectives of truthfulness by recognizing the presence of nodes that agree to forward packets but fail to do so. This approach categorizes different nodes based upon their dynamically measured behavior. Through simulation we evaluate proposed protocol using packet throughput, <b>percentage</b> of overhead <b>transmissions</b> and the accuracy of misbehaving node detection. I...|$|R
