25|$|The Highest Astronomical <b>Tide</b> is the <b>perigean</b> spring <b>tide</b> {{when both}} {{the sun and}} moon are closest to the Earth.|$|R
50|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is elliptical, which causes the Moon {{to be closer to}} the Earth and farther away at {{different}} times. The Moon and the Sun are aligned every two weeks, which results in spring tides - tides that are 20% higher than normal. During the period of the new moon, the Moon and Sun are {{on the same side of}} the Earth, so the high tides or bulges produced independently by each reinforce each other (and has nothing to do with the season called spring). Tides of maximum height and depression produced during this period are known as spring tide. Even higher than a normal spring <b>tide</b> are the <b>perigean</b> <b>tides.</b> <b>Perigean</b> spring <b>tides</b> can produce unusually intense flooding along the coastal regions. Low amplitude tides are known as neap tides.|$|R
50|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} the Sun and Moon on the Earth's oceans, the tide, is greatest when the Moon is either new or full. At a lunar perigee, the tidal force is somewhat stronger, resulting in <b>perigean</b> spring <b>tides.</b> But, even at its most powerful, this force is still relatively weak, causing tidal differences of inches at most.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>perigean</b> spring <b>tide</b> is a tide {{that occurs}} {{three or four}} times a year when the Moon's perigee (its closest point to Earth during its 28-day {{elliptical}} orbit) coincides with a spring tide (when the Earth, Sun and Moon are nearly aligned every two weeks). [...] This tide usually adds only a couple of inches to normal spring tides.|$|R

25|$|The Pacific (inter-)decadal {{oscillation}} is {{a climate}} switch phenomenon {{that results in}} changes from periods of La Niña to periods of El Niño. This {{has an effect on}} sea levels. For example, in 2000 there was a switch from periods of downward pressure of El Niño on sea levels to an upward pressure of La Niña on sea levels, which upward pressure causes more frequent and higher high <b>tide</b> levels. The <b>Perigean</b> spring <b>tide</b> (often called a king tide) can result in seawater flooding low-lying areas of the islands of Tuvalu.|$|R
5000|$|... "King tide" [...] is a colloquial {{term for}} an {{especially}} high spring tide, {{such as a}} <b>perigean</b> spring <b>tide.</b> [...] "King tide" [...] is not a scientific term, nor is it used in a scientific context. Use of the term [...] "king tide" [...] originated in Australia, New Zealand and other Pacific nations to refer to an especially high tide that occurs {{only a few times}} per year. The term has now come to be used in North America as well, particularly in low-lying South Florida, where they cause sunny day tidal flooding.|$|R

50|$|On March 6, 1962, the Ash Wednesday Storm surge {{coincided with}} <b>perigean</b> spring <b>tide,</b> {{and for the}} {{following}} 65 hours inundated the entire Atlantic coastline of the United States from the Carolinas to Cape Cod. This disastrous event resulted {{in a loss of}} 40 lives and over 500 million dollars of property damage. On January 4, 1912 a full moon and a lunar perigee occurred, with these two events separated by only a few minutes of time and with the Earth near perihelion. The resulting lunar distance (356,375 km) on that date stands as the closest approach of the Moon to the Earth in an interval of more than 1400 years.|$|R

50|$|The idea of {{constructing}} a {{tidal power plant}} on the Rance dates to Gerard Boisnoer in 1921. The site was attractive because of the wide average-range between low and high tide levels, 8 m with a maximum <b>perigean</b> spring <b>tide</b> range of 13.5 m. The first studies which envisaged a tidal plant on the Rance were done by the Society for the Study of Utilization of the Tides in 1943. Nevertheless, work did not actually commence until 1961. Albert Caquot, the visionary engineer, {{was instrumental in the}} construction of the dam, designing an enclosure in order to protect the construction site from the ocean tides and the strong streams. Construction necessitated draining the area where the plant was to be built, which required construction of two dams which took two years. Construction of the plant commenced on 20 July 1963, while the Rance was entirely blocked by the two dams.|$|R
40|$|The precise {{environmental}} {{conditions under which}} broadcast spawners spawn in the field remain largely unknown. We investigated this issue in the oyster Crassostrea gigas using three different methods at different time scales in two traditional oyster farming areas of the French Atlantic Coast, the Bay of Arcachon and Marennes-Oléron. We directly recorded spawning at high temporal resolution using high-frequency non-invasive (HFNI) valvometry from 2007 – 2014 and measured the dry mass and oyster larvae abundance in 2008 and 2009. We analyzed a 29 -yr series of oyster D-larvae numbers in the Bay of Arcachon (1982 – 2010). By combining these three approaches, we demonstrated that {{during the summer months}} at both sites, spawning in C. gigas occurs in the morning or during the evening, essentially at high <b>tide</b> of <b>perigean</b> spring <b>tides,</b> independent of the positions of these oysters, above or below the lowest water level. We characterized the associated water currents at the spawning location in the Bay of Arcachon and observed that spawning systematically occurs during the early phase of a water current peak, at the beginning of ebbing. We propose that this water current peak acts as a final trigger for spawning. These results have ecological consequences associated with gamete encounters and the dispersal of fertilized eggs (zygotes) ...|$|R
5000|$|Sea glass can {{be found}} all over the world, but the beaches of the {{northeast}} United States, Bermuda, Fort Bragg, California, Benicia, California, North Carolina beaches, Scotland, northwest England, Mexico, Hawaii, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Nova Scotia, Australia, Italy and southern Spain are famous [...] for their bounty of sea glass, bottles, bottle lips and stoppers, art glass, marbles, and pottery shards. The best times to look are during spring <b>tides</b> especially <b>perigean</b> and proxigean <b>tides,</b> and during the first low tide after a storm.Glass from inland waterways such as the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes is known as beach glass. It is similar to sea glass, but {{in the absence of}} wave rigor and oceanic saline, content is typically less weathered. Beach glass from inland regions often has prominently embossed designs or letters on it, which can make tracing its origin less challenging. The outer surface of beach glass shards may also be texturally varied, with one side frosty and the other shiny. This is most likely because they are pieces broken off from larger glass objects which are themselves still embedded in mud, silt or clay, slowly being exposed by wave action and erosion.|$|R
