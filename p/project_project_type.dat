The CDM <b>project</b> data is collected for 11 years (2004 - 2014) from the Institute of Global Environmental Strategies whereas the JCM pilot <b>project</b> data covers 2 years (2013 - 2014) from Global Environment Centre Foundation. Result of this study shows that regarding JCM pilot <b>projects,</b> <b>project</b> <b>type</b> is a crucial determinant for environmental outcome. Meanwhile, regarding CDM <b>projects,</b> statistically significant determinants of environmental outcome are host party, <b>project</b> <b>type,</b> and <b>project</b> status. In terms of CDM financial outcome, only <b>project</b> <b>type</b> and <b>project</b> status show significant effects. It implies {{that there is no}} need for considering which country to implement CDM <b>projects</b> if the target is financial outcome.

Literature places significant emphasis on success criteria and success factors for determining <b>project</b> success, {{but this is a}} unilateral view as the level of complexity involved is underestimated. ICT <b>projects,</b> however, are multifaceted as {{there are a number of}} dimensions that influence the management and outcome of a <b>project.</b> Objectives: This article aimed to illuminate how the dimensions are interdependent and interconnected through the construction of a conceptual model of ICT <b>project</b> complexity.

The main goal of thesis is creating a compact overview of currently known and used methods and approaches to constructing estimates. As a secondary target comes an example of practical use of estimate on a simulated <b>project,</b> where the way of choosing estimating method is presented, based on <b>project</b> attributes such as size, current stage of <b>project</b> or <b>project</b> <b>type.</b> For achieving these intentions, it is important to first set up basic framework of basic terms such as estimate, estimating, <b>project</b> and software <b>project.</b> Apart from just defining these terms, there are some necessary interrelations which must be explained before anything else. Another step is creating categorization of particular methods, their description, restrictions and suitable uses. The quality of an estimate, including factors which may bias, degrade or improve it, is another step towards final goal. Consequences, which may arise when wrong estimate has been provided, are one more piece of mosaic to this work.

40|$|PPP is {{a general}} term {{covering}} all contracted relationships {{between the public and}} private sectors to produce a public asset or to deliver a public service. Its major advantage lies in utilising resources from the private sector to alleviate some of the financial burdens of the government. The Asian financial turmoil in the late 1990 s has imposed enormous pressure on the budget of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. With a continuous outcry for better public services due to the rapid development of Hong Kong, alternative financing models need to be sought to ensure sustainability. Hong Kong has the advantage of being the international gateway to Mainland China, and with this benefit has attracted overseas enterprises to base their offices in Hong Kong for the Asian market. Obviously the private sector has much to contribute. The HKSAR Government has realised the benefits of using PPP in Hong Kong as well as the success achieved overseas. But a more thorough research is needed to develop the most suitable practice of PPP in terms of <b>project</b> nature, <b>project</b> complexity, <b>project</b> <b>type</b> and <b>project</b> scale under which PPP is most appropriate for Hong Kong.

40|$|Research and Development {{investments}} in the pharmaceutical industry are continuously increasing, resulting in mounting pressure to improve efficiency in terms of output versus cost. Overall, traditional cost accounting methods do not improve effectiveness of pharmaceutical development activities. In drug discovery, cost control is often not based on any objectively measured data. This study describes the design and implementation of an activity-based costing (ABC) system related to drug discovery activities in a large pharmaceutical company. Both the theoretical model adapted to the specifics of drug discovery {{as well as the}} outcome of the data collection during one quarter are described. The methodological approach is based on a two-step allocation process: allocation of resource costs to the actual processes (activities) using these costs based on resource drivers, and allocation of activity costs to the cost objects (<b>projects)</b> based on activity drivers. Activity-based management (ABM) has been applied to the collected data. ABM refers to the entire set of actions and decisions that can be taken with activity-based cost information. Major and unexpected cost differences per <b>project</b> were observed. Causes for these cost differences are <b>project</b> stage, <b>project</b> <b>type,</b> activity <b>type,</b> complexity of the <b>project,</b> number of employees involved, and type of molecular target. The cause analysis on cost differences guides management decisions such as strategic <b>project</b> portfolio management based on <b>project</b> cost, benchmarking, identifying value-adding versus non-value-adding activities, outsourcing, and budgeting decisions.

From a theoretical perspective, a traditional distinction between radical and incremental innovation has often been used in the literature of innovation, and has created the basis for many classical contingency studies. Similar concepts, however, did not become standard in the literature of <b>projects,</b> and it seems that theory development in <b>project</b> management is still in its early years. As a result, most <b>project</b> management literature still assumes that all <b>projects</b> are fundamentally similar and that "one size fits all.

40|$|ABSTRACT Results {{from the}} first {{statistically}} significant study {{of the causes of}} cost escalation in transport infrastructure <b>projects</b> are presented. The study is based on a sample of 258 rail, bridge, tunnel and road <b>projects</b> worth US$ 90 billion. The focus is on the dependence of cost escalation on: (1) the length of the project-implementation phase, (2) the size of the <b>project</b> and (3) the <b>type</b> of <b>project</b> ownership. First, it was found, with very high statistical significance, that cost escalation was strongly dependent on the length of the implementation phase. The policy implications are clear: decision-makers and planners should be highly concerned about delays and long implementation phases because they translate into risks of substantial cost escalations. Second, <b>projects</b> have grown larger over time, and for bridges and tunnels larger <b>projects</b> have larger percentage cost escalations. Finally, by comparing the cost escalation for three <b>types</b> of <b>project</b> ownership—private, state-owned enterprise and other public ownership—it was shown that the oft-seen claim that public ownership is problematic and private ownership effective in curbing cost escalation is an oversimplification. The type of accountability appears to matter more to cost escalation than type of ownership. Cost Escalation and Its Causes On the basis of the first statistically significant study of cost escalation in transport infrastructure <b>projects,</b> in a previous paper (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003 b) we showed that cost escalation is a pervasive phenomenon in transport infrastructure <b>projects</b> across <b>project</b> <b>types,</b> geographical location and historical period.

Technology transfer is very heterogeneous across <b>project</b> <b>types</b> and usually involves both knowledge and equipment. As the number of <b>projects</b> increases, technology transfer occurs beyond the individual <b>projects.</b> This is observed for several {{of the most common}} <b>project</b> <b>types</b> in China and Brazil with the result that the rate of technology transfer for new <b>projects</b> in those countries has fallen significantly. Clean development mechanism CDM Technology transfer...|$|R
