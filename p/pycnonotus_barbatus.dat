50|$|Some {{authorities}} {{treat the}} Somali bulbul as a subspecies {{of the common}} bulbul and formerly {{it has also been}} considered as a subspecies of the dark-capped bulbul. The alternate name, Abyssinian bulbul, is also used as the name for <b>Pycnonotus</b> <b>barbatus</b> schoanus.|$|E
50|$|Notable animals {{found here}} include the Djibouti {{francolin}} (Pternistis ochropectus), {{a population of}} green-winged pytilia that may actually be a distinct species or subspecies (Pytilia (melba) flavicaudata), {{as well as the}} mysterious and undescribed Tôha sunbird or Djibouti sunbird (Chalcomitra sp. indet.). All of these birds do not occur outside Djibouti, and except for the francolin they have only ever been found in Day Forest. More widespread birds inhabiting the forest are Gambaga flycatcher (Muscicapa gambagae), Somali bulbul (<b>Pycnonotus</b> (<b>barbatus)</b> somaliensis) and Somali starling (Onychognathus blythii). The rare colubrid snake Platyceps afarensis is also found here.|$|E
50|$|In the {{breeding}} season, birds call from prominent perches and chase {{each other with}} slow wing-beats and pigeon like clapping flight. Courtship feeding has been observed in Africa. The species is a brood parasite and in India the host is mainly species of babblers in the genus Turdoides. The colour of the eggs matches those of the host, typically turquoise blue. The eggs are slightly larger {{than those of the}} common babbler (T. caudatus) or the jungle babbler (T. striata). Other hosts include the red-vented bulbul, and the eggs laid are then mostly white. Eggs are laid hurriedly in the morning into the nest of the host often dropped from while the bird perches {{on the rim of the}} nest and over the host eggs often resulting in the cracking of one or more host eggs. In Africa, the males distract the host while the female lays the egg. Multiple eggs may be laid in the nest of a host and two young cuckoos were found to fledge successfully in several occasions. In Africa, the hosts include <b>Pycnonotus</b> <b>barbatus,</b> P. capensis, Turdoides fulvus, Turdoides rubiginosus, Lanius collaris, Andropadus importunus, Terpsiphone viridis, Dicrurus adsimilis and a few other species. Babblers in the genus Turdoides are communal breeders and cuckoo chick are raised by several members of the group. A pied cuckoo chick was observed to be fed by four jungle babblers.|$|E
40|$|Observations made in Mali {{strongly}} suggest that Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) is spread by weaverbirds (Quelea quelea) below and around baobab trees (Adansonia digitata) in which they nest. Rice leaves in bird nests appeared to be infected. In Spain, an infection of Southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV) in string (climbing) beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) was apparently introduced and spread by sparrows (Passer domesticus) judging from the damage caused on flowers and bean pods. Damaged leaves and pods on SBMV-infected plants were also found in a screenhouse visited by sparrows and bulbuls (<b>Pycnonotus</b> <b>barbatus)</b> in Morocco. These observations showed that both viruses could be spread by birds when either collecting infected leaves for nesting or feeding on infected plant...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Four {{new species}} of feather mites {{belonging}} to three different genera of the family Pteronyssidae are described from passerine birds of South Africa: Pteroherpus africanus sp. n. from the garden bulbul <b>Pycnonotus</b> <b>barbatus</b> (Desfontaines) (Pycnonotidae), Pteroherpus cysticolae sp. n. from the wing-snapped cisticola Cisticola ayresii Hartlaub (Sylviidae), Pteronyssoides promeropis sp. n. from the Gurney’s sugarbird Promerops gurneyi Verreaux (Promeropidae), and Sturnotrogus creatophorae sp. n. from the wattled starling Creatophora cinerea Menschen (Sturnidae). A brief review of recent publications on the taxonomy of the family Pteronyssidae is given. The present paper continues the series of our publications dedicated to feather mites associated with South African passerines (Mironov and Kopij 1966 a, b, 1997, 2000) and includes descriptions of four new feather mite species of the family Pteronyssidae Oudemans, 1941. The family Pteronyssidae currently includes 18 genera and about 130 described species. The representatives of this family are mostly associated with different bird families of Piciformes and Passeri-formes and only one genus, Cleyastobius Gaud, 1981, occurs on the wooden hoopoes Phoeniculidae (Coracii-formes). A detailed generic revision of the family Pteronyssidae (considered in a status of subfamily) {{was carried out by}} Faccini and Atyeo (1981).

40|$|This {{report by}} the Slovenian Rarities Committee {{presents}} records of rare bird species in Slovenia in 2013, with some addenda for previous years. The numbers in brackets refer {{to the number of}} records (first number) and individuals (second number), recorded between 1 Jan 1950 and 31 Dec 2012. Since 1 Jan 2013, submission to the Committee is required for 37 additional species, 17 of which are regional rarities. Records of these species are not numbered, since records from previous years were not collected by the Committee. Four new species were recorded in category A: White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala, Baillon’s Crake Porzana pusilla, Audouin’s Gull Larus audouinii and Siberian Rubythroat Calliope calliope. Three species, Helmeted Guineafowl Numida meleagris, Chukar Alectoris chukar and Common Bulbul <b>Pycnonotus</b> <b>barbatus,</b> were added to category E. Other notable observations were the second and third records of Bewick’s Swan Cygnus columbianus and fourth record of Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus. The list of birds recorded in Slovenia (as of 31 Dec 2013) contains 384 species (369 in category A, 7 in category B, 8 exclusively in category C; 4 species are both in categories A and C). Category D contains 6 species, while category E contains 33. These two categories {{are not part of the}} lis...|$|E
40|$|The {{avifauna}} of lowland Ethiopia {{consisting of}} grassland and bushland was investigated {{during the dry}} season from November 1981 to February 1982 in Omo National Park. One hundred and thirty-eight species of 48 families were observed in the whole area of the Park. One hundred and seven of these species were observed in the bushland around a small river and 45 species in the grassland and a small swamp. In the bushland area, dominant species were Turtur chalcospilos, Lamprotornis purpuropterus, <b>Pycnonotus</b> <b>barbatus,</b> Streptoperia decipiens, S. capicola, Tockus jacksoni, Corythaixoides leucogaster, Dicrurus adsimilis, and Francolinus sephaena. In the vicinity of the river, Burhinus senegalensis, Butorides striatus, Megaceryle maxima and Ceryle rudis were commonly found. In the grassland area, Struthio camelus, Ardeotis kori, some species of Bustards, Oenanthe sp. and Cisticola sp. were commonly found. At the swamp in the grassland, Hoplopterus spinosus and Himantopus himantopus dominated. Comparing the savanna bushland with the grassland, the number of species and the density of birds in the former were three to five times and about thirty times respectively as many as those in the latter. In the savanna bushland, frugivores (19. 5 % of total number of species) accounted for 43. 4 % of total observed individuals and graminivores were next. In the grassland, number and density of species of insectivores were considerably higher than species with other food habits...|$|E
40|$|Birds should store body {{reserves}} if starvation risk is anticipated; this {{is known}} as an ‘interrupted foraging response’. If foraging remains unrestricted, however, body mass should remain low to limit the predation risk that gaining and carrying body reserves entails. In temperate environments mass gain in female birds during breeding is often attributed to egg formation and mass loss after incubation to flight adaptation or the effect of reproductive workload, rather than {{as a result of an}} adaptive interrupted foraging response to the limited foraging time or unpredictable foraging conditions that breeding demands. In tropical environments, foraging conditions vary more within the breeding season than in temperate environments, and so studies in tropical environments are more suited to decouple the potentially confounded effects of increase in body reserves versus egg formation on the body mass of breeding birds. In this study, we test whether breeding results in an interrupted foraging response in a tropical savannah system using body mass data collected over a 15 -year period from female Common Bulbuls <b>Pycnonotus</b> <b>barbatus.</b> This species breeds both in the wet and dry season, despite fewer resources being available in the dry season. Breeding stage predicted female body mass: body mass peaked abruptly during incubation, but was not closely associated with the egg-laying stage, and declined during brood rearing. Breeding females were heavier in the dry season than in the wet season. In the dry season, heavier birds were more likely to incubate eggs or brood chicks. These observations suggest that increased body reserves are required to buffer the consequence of limited foraging time or impoverished foraging conditions, which may be most pronounced during incubation and in the dry season, respectively. Such mass increases are consistent with an interrupted foraging response, which may apply to temperate zone birds experiencing foraging restrictions during breeding...|$|E
