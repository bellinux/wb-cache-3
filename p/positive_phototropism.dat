50|$|Phototropism is {{the growth}} of an {{organism}} which responds to a light stimulus. It is most often observed in plants, but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs. This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light. Phototropism {{is one of the}} many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli. Growth towards a light source is called <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism,</b> while growth away from light is called negative phototropism (skototropism). Most plant shoots exhibit <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism,</b> and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth. Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism, although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth. Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism, which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them. The combination of phototropism and gravitropism allow plants to grow in the correct direction.|$|E
5000|$|In zygomycetes, mitospores (sporangiospores) {{are formed}} asexually. They are formed in {{specialized}} structures, the mitosporangia (sporangia) that contain few to several thousand of spores, {{depending on the}} species. Mitosporangia are carried by specialized hyphae, the mitosporangiophores (sporangiophores). These specialized hyphae usually show negative gravitropism and <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> allowing good spore dispersal. The sporangia wall is thin and is easily destroyed by mechanical stimuli (e.g. falling raindrops, passing animals), leading to the dispersal of the ripe mitospores. The walls of these spores contain sporopollenin in some species. Sporopollenin is formed out of β-carotene and is very resistant to biological and chemical degradation. Zygomycete spores may also be classified in respect to their persistence: ...|$|E
50|$|Phototropism {{in plants}} such as Arabidopsis thaliana is {{directed}} by blue light receptors called phototropins. Other photosensitive receptors in plants include phytochromes that sense red light and cryptochromes that sense blue light. Different organs of the plant may exhibit different phototropic reactions to different wavelengths of light. Stem tips exhibit positive phototropic reactions to blue light, while root tips exhibit negative phototropic reactions to blue light. Both root tips and most stem tips exhibit <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> to red light.Cryptochromes are photoreceptors that absorb blue/ UV-A light, and they help control the circadian rhythm in plants and timing of flowering. Phytochromes are photoreceptors that sense red/far-red light, but they also absorb blue light. The combination of responses from phytochromes and cryptochromes allow the plant to respond to various kinds of light. Together phytochromes and cryptochromes inhibit gravitropism in hypocotyls and contribute to phototropism.|$|E
50|$|Gravitropism is {{a turning}} or growth {{movement}} by a plant or fungus {{in response to}} gravity. It is equally widespread in both kingdoms. Statolites are required in both fungi and plants for the mechanism of gravity-sensing. The Zygomycota sporangiophores originate from specialized “basal hyphae” and pass through several distinctive developmental stages until the mature asexual spores are released. In addition to the <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism,</b> the sporangiophores are directed by a negative gravitropic response into a position suitable for spore dispersal and distribution. Both responses are growth reactions i.e. the bending is caused by differential growth on the respective opposite flanks of the sporangiophore, and influence each other. The only model for the mechanism of the gravitropic reaction of Phycomyces {{is based on the}} floatability of the vacuole within the surrounding cytoplasm. The resulting asymmetric distribution of the cytoplasm is proposed to generate increased wall growth on the lower side of horizonally placed sporangiophores as in the thicker cytoplasmic layer forming there the number of vesicles secreting cell-wall material would be higher than on the upper side. Gravitropic bending starts after approximately 15 - 30 min in horizontally placed sporangiophores and continues until after, approximately 12 - 14 hours, the sporangiophore tip has recovered its original vertical position. Usually, the gravitropic response is weaker compared to the phototrophic one. However, in certain conditions, equilibrium could be established and the responses are comparable. In plants and fungi, phototropism and gravitropism interact in a complex manner. During continuous irradiation with unilateral light, the sporangiophore (fruiting body) of the zygomycete fungus, Phycomyces blakesleeanus reach a bending angle of photogravitropic equilibrium at which the gravitropic and phototropic stimuli balance each other (Fig. 1, bending angle +α, due to light irradiation).|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between the amount of}} light and the amount of response for any photobiological process can be {{based on the number of}} incident quanta per unit time (fluence rate-response) or on the number of incident quanta during a given period of irradiation (fluence-response). Fluence-response and fluence rate-response relationships have been measured for second <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> by seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana. The fluence-response relationships exhibit a single limiting threshold at about 0. 01 micromole per square meter when measured at fluence rates from 2. 4 × 10 − 5 to 6. 5 × 10 − 3 micromoles per square meter per second. The threshold values in the fluence rateresponse curves decrease with increasing time of irradiation, but show a common fluence threshold at about 0. 01 micromole per square meter. These thresholds are the same as the threshold of about 0. 01 micromole per square meter measured for first <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism.</b> Based on these data, it is suggested that second positive curvature has a threshold in time of about 10 minutes. Moreover, if the times of irradiation exceed the time threshold, there is a single limiting fluence threshold at about 0. 01 micromole per square meter. Thus, the limiting fluence threshold for second <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> is the same as the fluence threshold for first <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism.</b> Based on these data, we suggest that this common fluence threshold for first positive and second <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> is set by a single photoreceptor pigment system...|$|E
40|$|The {{elongation}} {{rates of}} two {{opposite sides of}} hypocotyls of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were measured during phototropism by using an infrared imaging system. In first <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism,</b> second <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism,</b> and red light-enhanced first <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism,</b> curvature toward the light source {{was the result of}} an increase in the rate of elongation of the shaded side and a decrease in the rate of elongation of the lighted side of the seedlings. The phase of straightening that followed maximum curvature resulted from a decrease in the elongation rate of the shaded side and an increase in the elongation rate of the lighted side. These data for the three types of blue light-induced phototropism tested in this study and for the phase of straightening are all clearly consistent with the growth rate changes predicted by the Cholodny-Went theory...|$|E
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} whereby the second <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> can be observed separately from the first positive and negative phototropic responses which also occur in oat coleoptiles. Although the second positive phototropic response has often {{been referred to as}} the base response, photoreception for it is shown to occur mainly in the apical 3 mm of the coleoptile. The Bunsen-Roscoe reciprocity law, so typical of first <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism,</b> does not apply to the second positive responses, and the amount of curvature increases linearly with the duration of the stimulus. However, although this linear proportionality between stimulus duration and response is the major factor determining response at all intensities tested, the intensity of the stimulus does influence the response somewhat. The action spectrum for the response shows no activity above 510 nm and has peaks at 375 and 450 nm. In all but one particular it closely resembles the action spectrum for the first <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism,</b> and it is concluded that the same, or similar, pigments may well be the photoreceptors for both types of response. The identity of this blue light absorbing pigment is not known...|$|E
40|$|A {{physical}} {{basis is}} demonstrated, {{in the case}} of a cylindrical cell illuminated with parallel light from one side, for greater photochemical action in the half of the cell farthest from the source of light, when the cell is surrounded by a medium of refractive index less than that of the cell. Factors governing the balance and magnitude of unequal action of light in the two halves of the cell are: the refractive index of the cell, the cell radius, and the absorption coefficient of the intracellular pigment. A limiting value of absorption coefficient is deduced which cannot be exceeded in cells of a particular size showing <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism.</b> In terms of this mechanism the <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> of Phycomyces in air is explained...|$|E
40|$|Phototropism is {{induced by}} blue light, which also induces desensitization, a partial or total loss of phototropic responsiveness. The fluence and fluence-rate {{dependence}} of desensitization and recovery from desensitization have been measured for etiolated and red light (669 -nm) preirradiated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. The extent of desensitization increased as the fluence of the desensitizing 450 -nm light was increased from 0. 3 to 60 micromoles m- 2 s- 1. At equal fluences, blue light caused more desensitization when given at a fluence rate of 1. 0 micromole m- 2 s- 1 than at 0. 3 micromole m- 2 s- 1. In addition, seedlings irradiated with blue {{light at the}} higher fluence rate required a longer recovery time than seedlings irradiated at the lower fluence rate. A red light preirradiation, probably mediated via phytochrome, decreased the time required for recovery from desensitization. The minimum time for detectable recovery was about 65 s, and the maximum time observed was about 10 min. It is proposed that the descending arm of the fluence-response relationship for first <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> {{is a consequence of}} desensitization, and that the time threshold for second <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> establishes a period during which recovery from desensitization occurs...|$|E

When mutants (white collar- 1 and white collar- 2) which are blocked in the light induction of enzymes in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway were used as the protoperithecial parent in crosses, the resulting perithecial beaks did not show a phototropic response. However, when wild type, albino- 1, albino- 2, or albino- 3 strains were used as the protoperithecial parent, phototropism occurred...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of tropisms {{is important in}} determining the final growth form of the plant body. In roots, gravitropism is the predominant tropistic response, but phototropism also {{plays a role in}} the oriented growth of roots in flowering plants. In blue or white light, roots exhibit negative phototropism that is mediated by the phototropin family of photoreceptors. In contrast, red light induces a <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> in Arabidopsis roots. Because this red-light-induced response is weak relative to both gravitropism and negative phototropism, we used a novel device to study phototropism without the complications of a counteracting gravitational stimulus. This device is based on a computer-controlled system using real-time image analysis of root growth and a feedback-regulated rotatable stage. Our data show that this system is useful to study root phototropism in response to red light, because in wild-type roots, the maximal curvature detected with this apparatus is 30 ° to 40 °, compared with 5 ° to 10 ° without the feedback system. In positive root phototropism, sensing of red light occurs in the root itself and is not dependent on shoot-derived signals resulting from light perception. Phytochrome (Phy) A and phyB were severely impaired in red-light-induced phototropism, whereas the phyD and phyE mutants were normal in this response. Thus, PHYA and PHYB {{play a key role in}} mediating red-light-dependent <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> in roots. Although phytochrome has been shown to mediate phototropism in some lower plant groups, this is one of the few reports indicating a phytochrome-dependent phototropism in flowering plants...|$|E
40|$|A second {{positive}} phototropic {{response is}} exhibited by a plant after {{the time of}} irradiation has exceeded a time threshold. The time threshold of dark-grown seedlings is about 15 minutes for Arabidopsis thaliana. This threshold is decreased to about 4 minutes by a 669 -nanometer preirradiation. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) seedlings show a similar response. The time threshold of dark-grown seedlings is about 60 minutes for tobacco, and is decreased to about 15 minutes after a preirradiation with either 450 - or 669 - nanometer light. The existence of a time threshold for second <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> and the dependence of this threshold on the irradiation history of the seedling contribute {{to the complexity of}} the fluence response relationship for phototropism...|$|E

These methods are developed and applied using a modular neuro-dynamics approach to behavior control of autonomous mobile robots. Evolved neuro-controllers which solve an obstacle avoidance task are expanded to show in addition a <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism.</b> All resulting neuro-modules produce a robust light seeking behavior. These neuro-modules use recurrent connectivity structures and non-trivial dynamical features to enable the robot to solve its task. For each neuro-module the structure-function-relation is analyzed.

40|$|Gravitropism and {{phototropism}} of {{the primary}} inflorescence stems were examined in a dominant Aux/IAA mutant of Arabidopsis, axr 2 /iaa 7, which did not display either tropism in hypocotyls. axr 2 - 1 stems completely lacked gravitropism in the dark but slowly regained it in light condition. Though wild-type stems showed <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism,</b> axr 2 stems displayed negative phototropism with essentially the same light fluence-response curve as the wild type (WT). Application of 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid-containing lanolin to the stem tips enhanced the <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> of WT, and reduced the negative phototropism of axr 2. Decapitation of stems caused a small negative phototropism in WT, but {{did not affect the}} negative phototropism of axr 2. p-glycoprotein 1 (pgp 1) pgp 19 double mutants showed no phototropism, while decapitated double mutants exhibited negative phototropism. Expression of auxin-responsive IAA 14 /SLR, IAA 19 /MSG 2 and SAUR 50 genes was reduced in axr 2 and pgp 1 pgp 19 stems relative to that of WT. These suggest that the phototropic response of stem is proportional to the auxin supply from the shoot apex, and that negative phototropism may be a basal response to unilateral blue-light irradiation when the levels of auxin or auxin signaling are reduced to the minimal level in the primary stems. In contrast, all of these treatments reduced or did not affect gravitropism in wild-type or axr 2 stems. Tropic responses of the transgenic lines that expressed axr 2 - 1 protein by the endodermis-specific promoter suggest that AXR 2 -dependent auxin response in the endodermis plays a more crucial role in gravitropism than in phototropism in stems but no significant roles in either tropism in hypocotyls...|$|E
40|$|The {{light-sensitive}} sporangiophores of {{the fungus}} ~Phycomyces respond to sudden illumination by an acceleration of growth. If the illumination is {{from one side}} only, unequal growth {{on opposite sides of}} the sporangiophore typically causes bending toward the source of light [...] a "positive " phototropic reaction. Such bending has been generally explained as due to greater photic action on the side more remote from the light, due to refraction and total reflection within the clear, cylindrical sporangiophore (Blaauw, 1914; Oehlkers, 1926). Senn's (1908) careful determination of the light paths within structurally comparable plant cells, such as Vaucheria, supports this view. Reversal of the usual <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> of Phycomyces has been described as occurring in two cases: (1) Buder (1920) immersed the sporangiophores in oil of high refractive index, and obtained "negative " bending (away from the source of light) following one-sided illumination. This experiment has been repeated with confirmation of Buder's findings. It is surprising that growth and bending of the sporangiophore continue for over an hour in spite of the unfavorable circumstances. (2) Oltmanns (1897) and Blaauw (1909) obtained negative bendings with long exposures to high intensities of light from one source. Both investigators found <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> at low intensities, phototropic "indifference " or absence of bending at intermediate intensities, and at high intensities reversal of the usual phototropism. Both Oltmanns and Blaauw regarded these results as significant for the theory of phototropism: the former spoke of "optimum " intensities of light for the several phototropic reactions; the latter of a constant quantity of light (intensity X time) necessary to evoke each type of reaction. Blaauw further described phototropi...|$|E

Following a pulse of blue light, stationary seedlings curved to a maximum of approximately 16 ° about 80 minutes after stimulation. The seedlings then curved upward again or straightened by about 6 ° during the subsequent 100 minutes. Seedlings rotated on a clinostat reached a similar maximum curvature following photostimulation. These seedlings maintained that curvature for 30 to 40 minutes before subsequently straightening to the same extent as the stationary seedlings. It is concluded that straightening is not a consequence of gravitropism, although gravity has some effect on the phototropism kinetics...|$|E

Here we investigated {{the extent to which}} the isolation of sick ants correlates with changes in their behavioural responses to environmental stimuli that serve as nest-related cues, including light, colony odour and physical presence of nestmates. Myrmica rubra ant workers infected by Metarhizium brunneum fungus showed a weak but constant attraction to light. By contrast, the progressive withdrawal of moribund workers from the nest appeared to be concomitant with a decline in their attraction towards nestmates or colony odour, which started on the third day after infection. We hypothesized that the fungus impaired the olfactory system of infected ants, preventing them from adequately reacting to chemical blends involved in colony marking and nestmate recognition. Instead of being an active behaviour, the social seclusion of sick ants appears to be the simple outcome of their increasing difficulty in orienting themselves towards nest-related cues.

The phototropic response is present not only in terrestrial plants but also in water-living algae. However, knowledge about phototropism in Bangiophycean seaweeds is limited. Here, we examined the phototropic response of the red alga Pyropia yezoensis to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of phototropism in Bangiophyceae. When leafy gametophytes and filamentous sporophytes of P. yezoensis were cultured under directional light, phototropism was observed in the gametophytes. Conchosporangia on the sporophytes also exhibited phototropism. Phototropism was positive in the majority of gametophytes and conchosporangia but in some cases was negative. In addition, a strong phototropic response occurred under white light, whereas blue and red light elicited minor and no responses, respectively. This observation is in contrast with the phototropic response in terrestrial plants and several algae, in which blue light is responsible for <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism.</b> Surprisingly, the genome of P. yezoensis has no homologues of the photoreceptors for blue and red light, revealing differences in the regulation of phototropism between terrestrial plants and P. yezoensis. Studies on the phototropism in P. yezoensis could shed light on the evolutional divergence of phototropic responses in plants...|$|E
40|$|Phototropin photoreceptors (phot 1 and phot 2 in Arabidopsis thaliana) enable {{responses}} to directional light cues (e. g., <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> in the hypocotyl). In Arabidopsis, phot 1 {{is essential for}} phototropism in response to low light, a response that is also modulated by phytochrome A (phyA), representing a classical example of photoreceptor coaction. The molecular mechanisms underlying promotion of phototropism by phyA remain unclear. Most phyA responses require nuclear accumulation of the photoreceptor, but interestingly, it has been proposed that cytosolic phyA promotes phototropism. By comparing the kinetics of phototropism in seedlings with different subcellular localizations of phyA, we show that nuclear phyA accelerates the phototropic response, whereas in the fhy 1 fhl mutant, in which phyA remains in the cytosol, phototropic bending is slower than in the wild type. Consistent with this data, we find that transcription factors needed for full phyA responses are needed for normal phototropism. Moreover, we show that phyA is the primary photoreceptor promoting the expression of phototropism regulators in low light (e. g., PHYTOCHROME KINASE SUBSTRATE 1 [PKS 1] and ROOT PHOTO TROPISM 2 [RPT 2]). Although phyA remains cytosolic in fhy 1 fhl, induction of PKS 1 and RPT 2 expression still occurs in fhy 1 fhl, indicating that {{a low level of}} nuclear phyA signaling is still present in fhy 1 fhl...|$|E
40|$|Blue {{light is}} known to cause rapid {{phosphorylation}} of a membrane protein in etiolated seedlings of several plant species, a protein that, at least in etiolated pea seedlings and maize coleoptiles, {{has been shown to}} be associated with the plasma membrane. The light-driven phosphorylation has been proposed on the basis of correlative evidence to be an early step in the signal transduction chain for phototropism. In the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant JK 224, the sensitivity to blue light for induction of first <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> {{is known to}} be 20 - to 30 -fold lower than in wild type, whereas second positive curvature appears to be normal. While light-induced phosphorylation can be demonstrated in crude membrane preparations from shoots of the mutant, the level of phosphorylation is dramatically lower than in wild type, as is the sensitivity to blue light. Another A. thaliana mutant, JK 218, that completely lacks any phototropic responses to up to 2 h of irradiation, shows a normal level of light-induced phosphorylation at saturation. Since its gravitropic sensitivity is normal, it is presumably blocked in some step between photoreception and the confluence of the signal transduction pathways for phototropism and gravitropism. We conclude from mutant JK 224 that light-induced phosphorylation plays an early role in the signal transduction chain for phototropism in higher plants...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the stomatal and phototropic responses to blue light {{of a number of}} single and double mutants at various loci that encode proteins involved in blue-light responses in Arabidopsis. The stomatal responses of light-grown mutant plants (cry 1, cry 2, nph 1, nph 3, nph 4, cry 1 cry 2, and nph 1 cry 1) did not differ significantly from those of their wild-type counterparts. Second positive phototropic responses of etiolated mutant seedlings, cry 1, cry 2, cry 1 cry 2, and npq 1 - 2, were also similar to those of their wild-type counterparts. Although npq 1 and single and double cry 1 cry 2 mutants showed somewhat reduced amplitude for first <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism,</b> threshold, peak, and saturation fluence values for first positive phototropic responses of etiolated seedlings did not differ from those of wild-type seedlings. Similar to the cry 1 cry 2 double mutants and to npq 1 - 2, a phyAphyB mutant showed reduced curvature but no change in the position or shape of the fluence-response curve. By contrast, the phototropism mutant nph 1 - 5 failed to show phototropic curvature under any of the irradiation conditions used in the present study. We conclude that the chromoproteins cry 1, cry 2, nph 1, and the blue-light photoreceptor for the stomatal response are genetically separable. Moreover, these photoreceptors appear to activate separate signal transduction pathways...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} the tip of maize (Zea mays L.) coleoptiles has the localized functions of producing auxin for growth and perceiving unilateral light stimuli and translocating auxin laterally for phototropism. There {{is evidence that the}} auxinproducing function of the tip is restored in decapitated coleoptiles. We examined whether the functions for phototropism are also restored by using blue-light conditions that induced a first pulse-induced <b>positive</b> <b>phototropism</b> (fPIPP) and a time-dependent phototropism (TDP). When the apical 5 mm, in which photosensing predominantly takes place, was removed, no detectable fPIPP occurred even if indole- 3 -acetic acid (lanolin mixture) was applied to the cut end. However, when the blue-light stimulation was delayed after decapitation, fPIPP became inducible in the coleoptile stumps supplied with indole- 3 -acetic-acid/lanolin (0. 01 mg g- 1), indicating that phototropic responsiveness was restored. This restoration progressed 1 to 2 h after decapitation, and the curvature response became comparable to that of intact coleoptiles. The results for TDP were qualitatively similar, but some quantitative differences were observed. It appeared that the overall TDP was based on a major photosensing mechanism specific to the tip and on at least one additional mechanism not specific to the tip, and that the tip-specific TDP was restored in decapitated coleoptiles with kinetics similar to that for fPIPP. It is suggested that the photoreceptor system, which accounts for fPIPP and a substantial part of TDP, is regenerated in decapitated coleoptiles, perhaps together with the mechanism for lateral auxin translocation...|$|E
