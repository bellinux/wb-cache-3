50|$|Instantiation {{questions}} {{are composed of}} both the existence and the uniqueness questions, {{but it is the}} uniqueness questions that actually instantiate an object if they get a positive response. So if the query generator has to randomly <b>pick</b> <b>an</b> instantiation question, it prefers to <b>pick</b> <b>an</b> unpredictable uniqueness question if present. If such a question is not present, the query generator <b>picks</b> <b>an</b> existence question such that it will lead to a uniqueness question with a high probability in the future. Thus the query generator performs a look-ahead search in this case.|$|R

5|$|With a {{strengthening}} of the defence, City's form improved further the next season, in 1913–14, coming fourth, two points outside the promotion places. Despite having failed on his promise to get the team promoted within two years, City's rising attendances and resulting better profits for the club kept the directors happy, and the club were confident of promotion in 1914–15. However, the declaration of World War I disrupted Leeds City's season, with attendances down as men signed up to fight. Chapman by now had amassed a very large squad {{and was unable to}} <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> consistent side, continually changing his first-choice lineup. Leeds City lost six of their last eight games of the season to finish just fifteenth.|$|E
5|$|Kamara's main {{selection}} dilemma was in attack {{where he}} had to <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> strike partner for Stallard, a player who had joined from Derby County in January for £120,000 and gone on to score ten goals. Kamara opted for Shutt, who was given only a 50 per cent of playing {{in the run-up to}} the match because of a slight knock, with Ian Ormondroyd, a veteran of three play-off finals with his previous club Leicester City, selected as substitute. Captain Eddie Youds, who overcame a knee problem to return to the side in defence in place of David Brightwell, was the only player not to have played in the second leg against Blackpool. Notts County's side featured only two of the players that had been relegated the previous season – Tony Agana and Shaun Murphy. Their side also contained Darren Ward, who was selected for the Second Division PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) representative side, and Steve Finnan, on loan from First Division Birmingham City.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1999, Warnock {{announced}} her departure {{at the next}} election for personal reasons, and threw her support behind former Town of Vincent mayor John Hyde, {{a member of the}} Centre faction of the Labor Party who had the support of the Left faction and some Centre members of Parliament. However, the key Centre unions had backed former ministerial adviser Adele Farina for the post, and Labor's affirmative action policy for candidates in winnable seats meant that failing to <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> female candidate would risk sitting male MPs. A week later, the Centre faction openly split, with a breakaway group endorsing Hyde. On 5 November, Farina withdrew from the contest, leaving Hyde to be preselected unopposed ahead of the 2001 election. He maintained the seat for Labor at the election, becoming the first openly gay man to sit in the Western Australian parliament.|$|E

5|$|Ralph Klein, {{the former}} mayor of Calgary, led the party into the 1993 election, {{promising}} a new era of debt reduction and fiscal accountability. He walked away with a slim majority. Ralph Klein's folksy appeal helped the Progressive Conservatives renew themselves. He led the party through two elections, gaining in popularity each time. The price of oil rebounded and the government, despite low rates of taxes on the wealthy and corporations, was showing a surplus of $3 billion every year. In early 2004, Klein announced that the Alberta debt had been paid in full. He was rewarded by voters in the 2004 election, despite running a campaign with no new policies. His party lost a number of seats, and during the campaign he stated this would be his last election. In 2006 at a Progressive Conservative convention delegates forced him to <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> retirement date by giving him relatively low numbers in a leadership review.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around colonialism of India. Before starting the game, the player must <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> player-character and the respective faction they wish to side with. The choices include a viceroy of the British East India Company, a consul of the French East India Company, a Mogul emperor, a Maharajah of the Maruthras, chief of the Gurkhas or a Maharajah of the Sikhs. At {{the beginning of the}} game, the player-character is kidnapped by an assassin and is imprisoned inside a prison cell. A woman soon frees the player-character, and informs them of their task to either conquer India or persuade rival political factions to unite through diplomacy. The game begins in 1800, when the Mogul empire lost control of India. The majority of the game is presented through an in-game headquarters screen which displays a map of India, a book detailing information of individual Indian states, and a group of icons which allows the player to issue commands.|$|E
5|$|Angelica tasks Chuckie to <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> {{dandelion}} {{to decorate}} her sculpture. He {{is unable to}} obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys {{a majority of the}} lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a spade, a journal of pressed flowers, and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she was in the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.|$|E
