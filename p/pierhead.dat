5|$|In 2008, Elis-Thomas {{announced}} that the <b>Pierhead</b> Building would display {{the history of the}} black community in Butetown, Cardiff Docks and Welsh devolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, the <b>pierhead</b> was {{extended}} {{under the supervision}} of Birch's nephew, Peregrine, who added a pavilion with a capacity for 1400 people. After the Royal Suspension Chain Pier was demolished following a storm in 1896, the West Pier became the only one on Brighton's seafront until the construction of the Palace Pier.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pierhead</b> Building {{was opened}} in 1897 and {{designed}} by William Frame. It was originally {{the headquarters of}} the Bute Dock Company and by 1947 it was the administrative office for the Port of Cardiff. The building was reopened in May 2001 as 'The Assembly at the Pierhead', which was a visitor and education centre for the National Assembly. The exhibition provided visitors with information on the National Assembly. On 1 March 2010, the building was again reopened to the public as a Welsh history museum and exhibition.|$|E
50|$|The pier stems are {{founded on}} {{concrete}} pilecaps, whose shells were precast and infilled with in-situ reinforced concrete. The reinforced concrete pier stems support <b>pierheads</b> which contain bearings and seismic devices. These allow {{movement of the}} deck under normal loading conditions but lock {{in the event of}} an earthquake to limit overall seismic loads through the structure and minimise damage.|$|R
60|$|And {{what of the}} lifeboat-men {{during all}} this time? Were they asleep? Nay, verily! Everywhere they stood at <b>pierheads,</b> almost torn from their holdfasts by the furious gale, or they cowered under the lee of boats and boat-houses on the beach, trying to gaze seaward through the {{blinding}} storm, but nothing whatever could they see of the disasters on these outlying sands.|$|R
60|$|Where {{and how do}} our coast heroes fight? I answer--{{sometimes}} on the cliffs, {{sometimes on}} the sands, sometimes on the sea, and sometimes even on the <b>pierheads.</b> Their operations are varied by circumstances. Let us draw nearer {{and look at them}} while in action, and observe how the enemy assails them. I shall confine myself at present to a skirmish.|$|R
5|$|On 28 March 2003 the {{pavilion}} at the <b>pierhead</b> caught fire. Fire crews {{were unable to}} save the building from destruction because the collapsed walkway prevented them from reaching it. The cause of the fire remains unknown, since fire investigators were unable to access the site for safety reasons, although it {{is thought to have}} been arson. A more severe fire burned through 11 and 12 May 2003, consuming most of {{what was left of the}} concert hall. On 23 June 2004, high winds caused the middle of the pier to collapse completely. The following month, English Heritage declared the pier to be beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|The Senedd {{is part of}} the National Assembly {{estate in}} Cardiff Bay, along with Tŷ Hywel (Howell House) and the Grade 1 listed <b>Pierhead</b> Building in Cardiff Bay. Tŷ Hywel houses staff of the Assembly Commission, AMs, the First Minister and other ministers. Tŷ Hywel is named after Hywel Dda (Howell the Good), King of Deheubarth in South West Wales. On 26 June 2008, the Prince of Wales officially opened Siambr Hywel, the National Assembly's youth debating chamber and {{education}} centre. It is based in the debating chamber that was used by the National Assembly between 1999 and 2006, while the Senedd was being constructed. Two covered link bridges connect the Senedd to Tŷ Hywel. Construction of the link bridges began in September 2004 and they were completed by December 2005.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, the Welsh Office invited {{proposals}} from Wales for the National Assembly building. 24 {{proposals were}} received, 14 {{came from the}} private sector and government-owned corporations including HTV Group, Grosvenor Waterside (owned by Associated British Ports), Tarmac Developments, Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and Cardiff Airport. Nine local authorities in Wales made proposals including the Guildhall proposed by Swansea Council, Cardiff City Hall by Cardiff Council, Margam Castle by Neath Port Talbot Council, Cyfarthfa Castle by Merthyr Tydfil Council, proposals also came from Wrexham Council, Flintshire County Council who proposed two sites at Ewloe and Mold, Rhondda Cynon Taf Council, Powys County Council and five sites from Bridgend Council The Grosvenor Waterside proposal, known as Capital Waterside, included the <b>Pierhead</b> Building, Crickhowell House and Site 1E, which would become the site of the new debating chamber.|$|E
60|$|The pistol was {{the outcome}} of that search. It could only be used on the muddiest {{foreshore}} of the beach, {{far away from the}} bathing-machines and <b>pierheads,</b> below the grassy slopes of Fort Keeling. The tide ran out nearly two miles on that coast, and the many-coloured mud-banks, touched by the sun, sent up a lamentable smell of dead weed. It was late in the afternoon when Dick and Maisie arrived on their ground, Amomma trotting patiently behind them.|$|R
6000|$|Just {{without the}} water-gate, is a basin, always {{connecting}} with the open river, {{through a narrow}} entrance between <b>pierheads.</b> This basin forms a sort of ante-chamber to the dock itself, where vessels lie waiting their turn to enter. During a storm, the necessity of this basin is obvious; for {{it would be impossible}} to [...] "dock" [...] a ship under full headway from a voyage across the ocean. From the turbulent waves, she first glides into the ante-chamber between the pier-heads and from thence into the docks.|$|R
50|$|During World War II {{he was a}} major {{with special}} forces in France, Iran and Iraq. After {{returning}} to Britain late in 1943, he {{became involved in the}} Mulberry harbour project for the D-Day landings. When construction began off the Normandy coast immediately after D-day (6 June 1944) Mais, now a lieutenant-colonel, was in charge of constructing the <b>pierheads</b> and floating roadways at the British harbour under Colonel S. K. Gilbert of the Royal Engineers, who commanded the port construction force. He then joined the Canadians in the advance to the Rhine and, promoted full colonel, became deputy chief engineer in Antwerp.|$|R
5|$|The {{concert hall}} was {{converted}} into a tea room and the theatre redesigned as a restaurant in the early 1950s. A funfair was added around the same time. By the 1960s, the pier was suffering from serious financial difficulties. In 1965, it was bought by a company that owned some seafront hotels and entertainment venues. They had ambitions for the pier but were unable to cope with increasing maintenance costs. Some portions of wood and iron from the pier fell on the beach, and the <b>pierhead</b> was closed in 1970 due to safety concerns. The pier was Grade II listed in 1969 and the council served compulsory repair notices, but the company was unable to afford them and opted for voluntary liquidation. The remainder of the pier was closed in 1975 when the Brighton Corporation declined to buy it, passing control to the Crown Estate Commissioners.|$|E
25|$|Cardiff {{has many}} {{landmark}} buildings {{such as the}} Principality Stadium, <b>Pierhead</b> Building the Welsh National Museum and the Senedd, {{the home of the}} National Assembly for Wales. Cardiff is also famous for Cardiff Castle, St David's Hall, Llandaff Cathedral and the Wales Millennium Centre.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 Poet in the City {{produced}} {{its first}} national poetry tour, delivered {{in partnership with}} Apples and Snakes. Taking {{half a dozen of}} the UK’s most accomplished spoken word artists, Kat Francois, Kate Tempest, El Crisis, OneNess and Chris Redmond (ventriloquist), accompanied by the jazz saxophonist Jason Yarde, the charity produced a new show designed to promote them and their work to new audiences all over the UK. Launched at Latitude in July 2010, the show appeared at a number of top venues all over the country during 2010 and 2011, including the Bluecoat in Liverpool, Contact in Manchester, Kings Place in London, MAC in Birmingham, Lakeside Arts Centre in Nottingham, the <b>Pierhead</b> Building in Cardiff, Theatre in the Mill in Bradford, and as part of the Bristol Spring Poetry Festival at the Arnolfini. The Tour was also the subject of a Sky Arts documentary.|$|E
50|$|In American usage, a {{sparkplug}} lighthouse, sometimes {{known as}} a bug light, {{is a type of}} caisson lighthouse so named because of its shape. Generally speaking, a sparkplug lighthouse consists of a three-story living area, with the lantern on top; the whole is then placed upon a concrete or metal caisson. The superstructure was usually prefabricated and then lifted onto the caisson by crane. The classic sparkplug light sits in open water, with only the caisson below it and no dry land, but the term is also applied to lights on land or <b>pierheads</b> that are constructed in the same fashion.|$|R
2500|$|A four-day San Francisco General strike {{took place}} after [...] "Bloody Thursday" [...] on July 5, when police aided the Waterfront Employers Association in {{trucking}} cargo from the <b>pierheads</b> to the warehouses through the union's picket line. Scores of strikers were beaten or wounded by gunfire during the battle. During a coordinated {{raid on the}} union mess hall {{at the corner of}} Steuart and Mission, San Francisco Police shot and killed Howard Sperry, a striking sailor, and Nick Counderakis (AKA Nick Bordoise), member of the cook's union and a strike sympathizer helping out at the mess hall. Scores of other men were wounded by police gunfire as well, including a number of bystanders, as the ensuing battle quickly spilled into the nearby downtown area.|$|R
50|$|On 7 July 1923, {{in a thick}} fog, Caesarea {{struck a}} rock off Corbière as she was making passage from Jersey. Water began to enter the stokehold and engine room, whilst the stern began to fill, leading to the ship {{beginning}} to founder. She was able to turn round and almost {{made it back to}} St Helier Harbour, but sank just outside the <b>pierheads.</b> Caesarea was stuck fast for almost two weeks, but was refloated on 20 July on a spring tide. Nobody was injured. Following her salvage, Caesarea was taken under tow to Southampton for initial repair, and from there to Birkenhead at where her repairs were completed and she was acquired by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company.|$|R
500|$|The pier had {{a length}} of [...] and a width of [...] at the <b>pierhead.</b> It was built with cast iron {{threaded}} columns screwed into the seabed. The superstructure's ironwork was manufactured by Robert Laidlaw, featuring an [...] "oriental" [...] style. Upon opening, the pier was fitted with gas lamps with ornamental serpent designs, which had been directly influenced by similar examples inside the nearby Royal Pavilion. The pier had ornamental houses, two toll houses and glass screens at the <b>pierhead</b> to protect visitors from the weather. A New Scientist report covering Britain's piers called the pier Birch's [...] "masterpiece".|$|E
500|$|The Senedd ( [...] ; [...] ), {{also known}} as the National (or Welsh) Assembly building, houses the debating chamber and three {{committee}} rooms for the National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff. The [...] Senedd building was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 March 2006 and the total cost was £69.6 million, which included £49.7M in construction costs. The Senedd is part of the National Assembly estate that includes Tŷ Hywel and the <b>Pierhead</b> Building.|$|E
500|$|Birnbeck Pier is a pier {{situated}} on the Bristol Channel in Weston-super-Mare, North Somerset, England, approximately [...] south-west of Bristol. It is the only pier in the country which links the mainland to an island, linking to Birnbeck Island, a [...] rocky island just {{to the west of}} Worlebury Hill. The grade II* listed pier was designed by Eugenius Birch and opened in 1867. The gothic toll house and <b>pierhead</b> buildings were designed by local architect Hans Price. The pier has been closed to the public since 1994 and is now on the Buildings at Risk Register.|$|E

50|$|Work {{began in}} late 1862 on the single track Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway {{branching}} {{from the main}} Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway at Port Glasgow and taking an inland route across to the coast at Inverkip before descending to Wemyss Bay. This was to connect to Clyde steamer services for Rothesay, Largs and Millport, Isle of Cumbrae, allowing a combined train and steamer journey time of {{an hour and a}} half, compared with a typical time of three hours by steamer from Glasgow. The Wemyss Bay Steamboat Company was formed to own the connecting steamers, competing with the private owners of other Clyde steamer services. The route opened on 15 May 1865, but over-ambitious timetables led to severe delays during the first year, damaging the company's reputation, and the route subsequently faced strong competition from other <b>pierheads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 17 September, Battle of Britain Day, {{supporters}} {{blocked the}} <b>pierheads</b> at Holy Loch and the approaches to Trafalgar Square. (Picture) The September demonstration {{is regarded as}} the high-water mark of the Committee of 100. [...] A week before the demonstration, the hundred committee members were summoned to court without charge under the Justices of the Peace Act of 1361 because they [...] "incited members of the public to commit breaches of the peace" [...] and were likely to continue to do so. The court bound them to a promise of good behaviour for twelve months; thirty-two, including Bertrand Russell, then aged 89, refused and chose to go to prison instead. It is estimated that 12,000 to 15,000 attended the demonstration despite the invocation of the Public Order Act, which effectively made it illegal to be in the vicinity of central London that day. Several thousand sat down and there were 1,314 arrests, but no violence from demonstrators despite allegations of police brutality.|$|R
500|$|Today the Albert Dock {{is one of}} Liverpool's most {{important}} tourist attractions and a vital component of the city's UNESCO world heritage Maritime Mercantile City. As well as being the number one tourist attraction in Liverpool, the Albert Dock {{is also the most}} visited multi-use attraction in the United Kingdom outside London, with in excess of four million visitors per year. Amongst the many attractions at the Albert Dock are the Merseyside Maritime Museum, the Beatles Story [...] and the Tate Liverpool. There are also two hotels within the Albert Dock: a Holiday Inn and Premier Inn both located in the Britannia Pavilion. All the five warehouses around the dock, referred to as A, B, C, D and E, are GradeI listed buildings. [...] Also listed GradeI is the former dock traffic office. [...] Other buildings around the dock are listed GradeII; they are the former hydraulic pumping station, and the swing bridge leading from the dock towards the <b>Pierhead.</b>|$|E
500|$|Davies {{announced}} on 13 March 1998 {{that the new}} National Assembly building would be in Cardiff. He said that the Cardiff proposals were [...] "too compelling to resist", because [...] "in making this decision, I am mindful that Wales has invested 40 years in promoting Cardiff as our capital city." [...] The National Assembly building would be either in Bute Square or Capital Waterside. The Welsh Office decided that the Capital Waterside proposal carried less risk and would cost less than the Bute Square proposal. Capital Waterside would cost £43.9M, while Bute Square would cost £52.5M. On 28 April 1998, Davies announced that {{the site of the}} National Assembly building would be Capital Waterside. The site was acquired by the National Assembly from Grosvenor Waterside Investments Ltd, which was owned by Associated British Ports. The agreement covered extending the lease of Crickhowell House, later known as Tŷ Hywel, until 2023, renting the <b>Pierhead</b> Building for 15 years and purchasing Site 1E for £1, which would be where the Senedd was built.|$|E
500|$|After a long {{campaign}} by local people {{to raise funds}} for restoration (supported by Sir John Betjeman, who described Clevedon as [...] "the most beautiful pier in England"), the pier eventually reopened. Some funds were raised by [...] "sponsored planks"– small brass plaques with names or messages are inlaid on the wooden planks and benches, recording donations. Reconstruction of the pier spans and decking was completed on 27 May 1989, and the pier was reopened to great enthusiasm. The <b>pierhead</b> was still shut, however, and it was not until 23 May 1998 that it was finally restored and opened to the public, as a result of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. In 1999 the National Piers Society awarded Clevedon Pier the title of Pier of the Year, and it also won a Civic Trust Award. The pier was re-designated a Grade 1 listed building in 2001, the only other pier with this status being Brighton's West Pier (largely destroyed by fire and storms between 2002 and 2004).|$|E
60|$|Before {{we could}} raise our eyes from that {{engaging}} spectacle the schooner had slipped betwixt the <b>pierheads</b> of the reef, and was already quite {{committed to the}} sea within. The containing shores are so little erected, and the lagoon itself is so great, that, for the more part, it seemed to extend without a check to the horizon. Here and there, indeed, where the reef carried an inlet, like a signet-ring upon a finger, {{there would be a}} pencilling of palms; here and there, the green wall of wood ran solid for a length of miles; and on the port hand, under the highest grove of trees, a few houses sparkled white--Rotoava, the metropolitan settlement of the Paumotus. Hither we beat in three tacks, and came to an anchor close in shore, in the first smooth water since we had left San Francisco, five fathoms deep, where a man might look overboard all day at the vanishing cable, the coral patches, and the many- coloured fish.|$|R
500|$|The {{landing stage}} {{at the end of}} the pier is used {{throughout}} the summer season (June to September) by the Waverley and her sister ship, the Balmoral, and is a popular spot for angling. There is a cafe at the <b>pierhead,</b> and a souvenir shop at the toll house. The upper floor of the toll house is an art gallery with a different exhibition every month. The pier is open every day of the year except Christmas Day. Scenes from the 2010 film, Never Let Me Go, starring Keira Knightley were filmed near Clevedon pier during 2009, and the pier also featured on the promotional posters. One Direction's music video for their single [...] "You & I" [...] was filmed on Clevedon Pier. An appeal was launched in 2012 to raise £1.6 million for a new visitor centre and educational facility, an additional £800,000 of grants have been applied for to cover the cost of repainting the legs of the structure. In December 2012 it was announced that the pier had received £720,000 of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund to improve the visitor centre.|$|E
500|$|The {{main pier}} was {{originally}} [...] long, {{and it is}} [...] wide with a cantilever construction. However the low water jetty was damaged in a storm in 1903, rebuilt in 1909 and finally dismantled in 1923 meaning that the pier is now [...] long, Due to architectural features such as abutments {{at either end of}} the pier, the pier resembles a bridge more than other pleasure piers. Fifteen groups of piles support a continuous lattice girder, each set comprising four piles screwed into the river bed at an angle with an X-brace between each adjacent pair. The fitting of screw blades to iron piles, as opposed to the then accepted wooden pile, created a deeper and far more resilient base support. This was one of the innovations brought by Eugenius Birch which have enabled many of the piers he designed to survive. There were problems with oscillations in the structure when bands marched on the pier, both on the opening day and again in 1886. As a result, further horizontal cross braces were added to the piles, and a law was passed banning marching on the pier. The gothic toll house and <b>pierhead</b> buildings were designed by local architect Hans Price.|$|E
2500|$|The Aquabus runs {{every hour}} {{between the city}} centre (Taff Mead Embankment) and Cardiff Bay (Mermaid Quay), and between Cardiff Bay and Penarth (Cardiff Bay barrage). Throughout the year Cardiff Waterbus [...] sail between the <b>Pierhead</b> on Cardiff's Waterfront and the Penarth end of the Cardiff Bay Barrage with short {{sightseeing}} cruises.|$|E
2500|$|The debating chamber was {{initially}} based in Tŷ Hywel, {{next to the}} site of the present building. The offices of Assembly Members are still in this building which is connected to the Senedd by a skyway. The National Assembly for Wales Commission is also responsible for the <b>Pierhead</b> Building, which is the location of [...] "The Assembly at the Pierhead" [...] exhibition, and is the Visitor and Education Centre for the National Assembly for Wales as well as housing a small giftshop. The exhibition (currently still in the process of being updated following May's election) provides visitors with a unique opportunity to access the most up-to-date information on who's who, what's happening and how the Assembly works.|$|E
2500|$|After {{years of}} fierce {{competition}} between all the fleets, the Caledonian and G & SW were merged in 1923 into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and their fleets were amalgamated into the Caledonian Steam Packet Company. Their funnels were painted yellow {{with a black}} top. At {{the same time the}} North British Railway fleet became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (which built the [...] in 1947). With nationalisation in 1948 the LMS and LNER fleets were amalgamated under British Railways with the name Clyde Shipping Services. In 1957 a reorganisation restored the CSP name, and in 1965 a red lion was added to each side of the black-topped yellow funnels. The headquarters remained at Gourock <b>pierhead.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to popular demand, the pier company applied to Parliament in 1890 for powers {{to construct a}} deep-sea pier, and this was granted in 1891. In the August of that year, a temporary pier head was constructed, and in 1892 experimental visits were made by steamer Glen Rosa, but no further construction work took place, and the Parliamentary powers lapsed. In 1895 the pier company re-applied and was granted powers again, so by July 1896 the short pier was rebuilt {{to the design of}} Ewen Matheson of Walbrook in London. On 26 August of that year the first pile of the deep-sea extension was screwed. The third pier was built of iron and designed by Head, Wrighton & Company of Thornaby-on-Tees at a cost of £60,000 including fittings. During construction it survived the great storm of 28−29 November 1897 which destroyed the promenade and damaged houses. It was completed in 1899, and at [...] was the second longest in England. In the first year the tram fares made £488. The pier was used by paddle steamers until the last visit by PS Medway Queen in 1963. The new 1899 restaurant at the <b>pierhead</b> later became a ticket office and cafe, and still stands today: wooden, octagonal and domed. It had a promenade deck on the roof, but this may now be gone, as it is not visible in photographs. The theatre was retained, and the public was first admitted to the landing stage and Pier Head Restaurant at Easter 1899. On 14 September it was formally opened by Mrs C. Prescott-Westcar of Strode Park House in Herne Bay. At a short distance from the entrance was a large concert marquee for the local Cremona orchestra, and an electric tram provided transport {{from one end to the}} other for a penny.|$|E
60|$|A gateman on the <b>pierhead</b> {{began to}} shout to the captain, and Cartwright gave Lister his hand.|$|E
60|$|He saw {{the sea of}} waves, {{long dark}} waves rising and falling, dark under the moonless night. A tiny light twinkled at the <b>pierhead</b> where the ship was entering: and he saw a {{multitude}} of people gathered by the waters' edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour. A tall man stood on the deck, looking out towards the flat dark land: and by {{the light at the}} <b>pierhead</b> he saw his face, the sorrowful face of Brother Michael.|$|E
