40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{applying}} {{the rule of}} non-inquiry {{to the issue of}} whether the requested person has been charged is analytically incorrect where the relevant treaty defines as extraditable persons who have been charged or convicted of certain offenses, thus requiring a judicial determination as to whether the person requested has been charged as part of the initial inquiry into extraditability. By contrast, the rule of non-inquiry is typically used to reject arguments of persons who are otherwise extraditable. This issue has not received much analysis perhaps because federal courts are reluctant to look beyond an arrest warrant issued by a foreign judge for fear that they lack the knowledge needed to evaluate such an order. This paper argues several reasons why courts should consider whether the <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extradited</b> will face trial proceedings. In addition to this procedural analysis regarding at what point the rule of non-inquiry is applicable, this paper also stresses why it is necessary for U. S. federal judges to understand the criminal justice systems of other countries, and to engage in an analysis of such systems. This paper first discusses the importance of understanding the criminal justice systems of other countries to explain why, as a matter of general policy, the rule of non-inquiry should not apply. Next, this paper briefly outlines the extradition process and asserts that as a matter of method of analysis, {{the question of whether the}} relator has been charged for purposes of the extradition treaty must be answered as a first step in determining whether the relator is extraditable at all, thus before the rule of non-inquiry enters the analysis. The focus of this paper then shifts to the meaning of the word charged in extradition treaties, and whether, as a matter of treaty interpretation, that term includes one who is sought by a foreign country for the purpose of preventive detention. The point of this paper is not necessarily to criticize the code provisions permitting preventive detention in certain countries, but rather to demonstrate that an order of preventive detention does not constitute a charge under U. S. extradition treaties, and further that U. S. federal courts should make an effort to examine the procedure of the requesting country to determine whether the requested person has been charged. Finally, this paper discusses some recent cases which indicate that federal courts might be beginning to seriously consider the issue raised in this paper...|$|E
40|$|ES piliečių ekstradiciją tarp valstybių narių reguliuoja Europos arešto orderis, o konkrečių ES teisės normų, kurios reguliuotų ES piliečių ekstradiciją į trečiąsias šalis, nėra. Dvišalės valstybių sutartys paprastai reguliuoja tik pasirašiusiųjų valstybių piliečių ekstradicijos procesą, tad ES piliečių ekstradicija į trečiąsias šalis šiuo metu yra „pilkojoje zonoje“. Jei apsauga nuo ekstradicijos taikoma tik šalies piliečiams, atsiranda skirtingas požiūris, palyginti su kitų ES valstybių narių piliečiais, o tai galimai pažeidžia SESV 18 str. įtvirtintą nediskriminacijos principą, kuris draudžia bet kokią diskriminaciją dėl pilietybės, bei SESV 21 str. principą dėl laisvo žmonių judėjimo, kuriuo remiantis kiekvienas ES pilietis turi teisę laisvai judėti ir apsigyventi valstybių narių teritorijoje. Siekiant išsiaiškinti, ar ES valstybių narių ekstradicijos praktika atitinka ES teisės principus, darbe išanalizuota Europos Sąjungos Teisingumo Teismo praktika ir išsiaiškinta, jog ES piliečių teisių apribojimas gali būti pateisinamas objektyviomis priežastimis, tik jeigu jos yra būtinos interesų, kuriuos jomis siekiama užtikrinti, apsaugai ir tik tiek, kiek šių tikslų negalima pasiekti mažiau ribojančiomis priemonėmis. ES valstybėms narėms siūloma tokioje situacijoje teikti pirmenybę keitimuisi informacija su ES valstybe nare, kurios pilietis yra asmuo dėl kurio pateiktas trečiosios šalies ekstradicijos prašymas, ir suteikti gimtosios ES valstybės narės valdžios institucijoms galimybę išduoti Europos arešto orderį, jeigu pagal nacionalinę teisę jos gali vykdyti šio asmens baudžiamąjį persekiojimą už nusikaltimus, padarytus už šios valstybės teritorijos ribų. Tokiu atveju, kai teikiama pirmenybė galimam kaltinamojo asmens gimtosios ES valstybės narės Europos arešto orderiui, palyginti su trečiosios šalies ekstradicijos prašymu, priimančioji ES valstybė narė veiktų mažiau ribodama naudojimąsi teise laisvai judėti ir kartu kiek įmanydama pašalintų riziką, kad asmuo liks nenubaustas už nusikaltimą, už kurį yra persekiojamas. Tačiau pažymėtina, kad kreipimasis į ES piliečio kilmės valstybę narę ir siūlymas pasinaudoti Europos arešto orderiu tėra ES valstybėms narėms pasiūlyta „galimybė“, o ne pareiga. Todėl darytina išvada, jog ES piliečių ekstradicija į trečiąsias šalis nepažeidžia nediskriminacijos ir laisvo žmonių judėjimo principų. Extradition between EU {{members is}} governed by European Arrest Warrant, while rules on extradition, in a {{situation}} in which EU has not concluded an agreement on extradition with a third State, falls within the competence of the Member States. In most cases Member States have a nationality exception in their extradition agreements with third States and protect their citizens against foreign punitive systems. But these protective provisions do not include EU citizens of other Member States, therefore it creates situation in which principles of non-discrimination and freedom of movement might be violated. This work analyzes EU citizens extradition regulation and Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) practice in relevant cases in order to find out whether Article 18 TFEU and Article 21 TFEU should be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of extradition of a citizen of any Member State of the European Union to a non-Member State under an extradition agreement concluded between a Member State and a third country, the same level of protection must be guaranteed as is guaranteed to a citizen of the Member States in question? Three cases have reached CJEU for preliminary rulings and two of them are analyzed in this work in detail, in particular CJEU judgment on 6 September 2016 in Petruhhin case. The questions discussed in Petruhhin case concern the balance between the objectives of extradition agreements (the need to combat impunity), on the one hand, and the need {{to protect the rights of}} the <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extradited</b> (the EU citizen) under the Treaties. In that case Advocate General Bot delivered an opinion that nationality exception certainly constitutes a difference in treatment prohibited under Art. 18 TFEU. However, it also stated that the risk of impunity is a legitimate objective in EU law, which has to be attained by Member States according to the principle of necessity and proportionality, and thus by “less restrictive measures”. Principle aut dedere aut judicare provides a guidance to identify less restrictive measures, in so far as it allows to extend the protection against extradition to other EU citizens provided that at least one Member State has the jurisdiction to prosecute the offender. Finally, CJEU ruled that when a Member State to which a Union citizen, a national of another Member State, has moved receives an extradition request from a third State with which the first Member State has concluded an extradition agreement, it must inform the Member State of which the citizen in question is a national and, should that Member State so request, surrender that citizen to it, in accordance with the provisions of European Arrest Warrant, provided that that Member State has jurisdiction, pursuant to its national law, to prosecute that person for offences committed outside its national territory. However, it is uncertain how such an approach will function in practice, as further questions arise. For example, whether the State of nationality will actually perform the criminal proceedings in a satisfactory way? Difficulties may arise due to a possible lack of evidence, especially if there is no cooperation with the third State in question on that matter. Furthermore, it is not possible to bind the State of nationality to any specific conclusion of the criminal proceedings in a particular case, and the case may be closed for various reasons before it comes before the court of that State. Even though CJEU has refrained from expressly qualifying the relationship between the principle of non-discrimination and the nationality exception of the extradition agreement as a conflicting one, it confirmed that EU law may still apply to issues falling within the competence of the Member State, such as a bilateral extradition agreement between a Member State and a third State. Furthermore, the CJEU accepts that the host Member State may not need to extend its national provisions protecting its own citizens from extradition to another Member State, if this is necessary to promote the legitimate objective of prevention of impunity. However, host Member State should seek less restrictive ways to achieve this objective and highlights how impunity in such cases may be combated by making use of cooperation mechanisms available in EU, such as the European Arrest Warrant, which enables extradition to the home Member State and thereby avoids unduly compromising citizens’ right to free movement within the EU. Since CJEU did not state that the Member State of nationality is obliged to issue a European Arrest Warrant when it has jurisdiction to prosecute, but merely that it must be given the „opportunity“ to do so, the conclusion of this work is that Member States who extradite EU citizens to third states do not violate principles of non-discrimination and freedom of movement...|$|E
