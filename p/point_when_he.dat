5|$|The Rise of Scourge was {{released}} on 24 June 2008 and, unlike the other manga which form trilogies, is a standalone volume. The story details the early life of BloodClan leader Scourge, one of the antagonists in The Darkest Hour, who is bullied in his youth for being small. The book chronicles his story up to the <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> kills Tigerstar, who once attacked Scourge when he ventured into the forest as a kitten.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly won a {{scholarship}} to the Sydney Teachers College at Sydney University, to train as a schoolmaster. However, the financial assistance was only {{for two years and}} merely sufficient for O'Reilly's rent at Glebe <b>Point.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> was in Sydney, O'Reilly received an invitation to join an athletics club based on his performances in Goulburn, but was only able to join after the secretary Dick Corish waived his membership fee. Jumping 47feet, he came second in a triple jump competition behind Nick Winter, who went on to win gold in the event at the 1924 Summer Olympics with a world record of 50ft. O'Reilly also placed second in a high jumping competition, clearing six feet. Corish was also a cricket administrator and invited O'Reilly to play in a David Jones Second XI. Not knowing anything of his new recruit's abilities, Corish did not allow O'Reilly to bowl until he explicitly complained of only being allowed to field. O'Reilly promptly finished off the opposition's innings by removing the middle and lower order. After an encounter with journalist Johnny Moyes, who wrote glowingly about O'Reilly's skills.|$|E

25|$|Ince's {{second season}} with Liverpool was again trophyless (seventh {{place in the}} league meant they would not even be {{competing}} in the UEFA Cup the following season) but he achieved a personal high <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> scored a late equaliser against Manchester United at Anfield and celebrated with some ferocity {{in front of the}} Kop, though it wasn't enough to deprive United of the Premier League title that formed part of their treble success.|$|E
25|$|Tap Dance City won two of {{his nine}} races a three-year-old in 2000, but failed to win in six races in 2001. He emerged as a top-class {{performer}} in 2002 {{when he won the}} Grade 3 Asahi Challenge Cup. In December 2002, as an 85/1 outsider, he produced his best performance up to that <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finished second to Symboli Kris S in the Grade 1 Arima Kinen at Nakayama Racecourse.|$|E
25|$|He {{was able}} to bounce back from this loss by {{recording}} back-to-back wins, a third-round TKO of Sadio Cissoko on March 17, 2007 and a unanimous decision over Arslan Magomedov on April 14, 2007 at K-1 Italy Oktagon 2007, both fights taking place in Milan, Italy. From there, he was offered the biggest fight of his career at that <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> replaced John Wayne Parr, who withdrew after injuring his ribs training with Nathan Corbett, to challenge Buakaw Por. Pramuk for his WMC World Junior Middleweight (-69.8kg/154lb) Championship at K-1 Fighting Network Scandinavian Qualification 2007 in Stockholm, Sweden on May 19, 2007. After five rounds, the fight was ruled a split draw and, consequently, Buakaw retained his title.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, Fry's {{mental health}} started to {{deteriorate}} severely. He had encountered {{mental health problems}} earlier in his life, experiencing a breakdown during his final year at Oxford, which meant that, although academically brilliant, he achieved a poor degree. In the late 1920s, he had a major breakdown and became deeply paranoid. He reached breaking point in 1928 {{during a visit to}} India, becoming convinced that an Indian had cast a spell on him. For the rest of his life, he dressed in bizarrely unconventional clothes. He did recover enough to become a popular writer on cricket and other sports, and even into his sixties he entertained hopes of becoming a Hollywood star. At one <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was staying in Brighton he was supposed to have gone for a walk along the beach {{early in the morning and}} suddenly shed all his clothes, trotting around stark naked.|$|E
25|$|His initial {{contributions}} to science {{came from his}} study of light bulbs (a continuation of his Ph.D. work). His first major development was {{the improvement of the}} diffusion pump, which ultimately led to the invention of the high-vacuum rectifier and amplifier tubes. A year later, he and colleague Lewi Tonks discovered that the lifetime of a tungsten filament could be greatly lengthened by filling the bulb with an inert gas, such as argon, the critical factor (overlooked by other researchers) being the need for extreme cleanliness in all stages of the process. He also discovered that twisting the filament into a tight coil improved its efficiency. These were important developments {{in the history of the}} incandescent light bulb. His work in surface chemistry began at this <b>point,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> discovered that molecular hydrogen introduced into a tungsten-filament bulb dissociated into atomic hydrogen and formed a layer one atom thick on the surface of the bulb.|$|E
25|$|Von Kluck sent von der Marwitz's II Cavalry Corps (3 cavalry divisions) {{around the}} British west flank {{to prevent a}} British retreat on the Channel ports. Sir John French sent a message (24 August), with an unmistakable tone of pique, to Lanrezac, which Spears insisted on writing down, warning that the BEF might have to retreat {{southwest}} towards Amiens on its lines of communication, although it is unclear that this would actually have been practicable if the Germans had actually been moving in force around the British left flank. However, Sir John agreed to Joffre's request that the BEF, now numbering 5 divisions {{as it had been}} joined by the 4th Infantry Division, would instead fall back on Cambrai if it had to, so that the BEF could still protect the French left flank. Joffre also sent a further two French reserve divisions to the British left flank, the beginning of the redeployment of French forces which would see Maunoury's Sixth Army form around Amiens and then fight near Paris. French considered, but rejected, the option of sheltering the BEF in the fortified town of Maubeuge, partly out of instinct that the Germans were hoping to tempt him into allowing himself to be besieged there and partly because he remembered that Edward Hamley had likened Bazaine allowing himself to be besieged in Metz in 1870 to a shipwrecked man taking hold of the anchor. French himself issued no direct written orders between 11.15pm on 21 August and 8.25pm on 24 August; Terraine argued that this, along with his absence during the battle of Mons (although on the German side von Kluck also played little direct role in the battle), marks the <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> and GHQ began to disengage from active command of the BEF, leaving Smith-Dorrien and Haig in effective control of their corps.|$|E
50|$|Thomas played another {{seven games}} for his country, {{including}} all {{games in the}} 1889 tournament and 1890 tournament. In 1890 Thomas scored his only international <b>points,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> scored a try in a draw against Ireland at Landsdowne Road.|$|R

500|$|Expensive {{ingredients}} {{would replace}} the common ingredients, making the dishes much less humble. The third source of recipes was Escoffier himself, who invented many new dishes, such as pêche Melba and crêpes Suzette. [...] Escoffier updated Le Guide Culinaire four times during his lifetime, noting in the foreword to the book's first edition that even with its 5,000 recipes, the book {{should not be considered}} an [...] "exhaustive" [...] text, and that even if it were at the <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wrote the book, [...] "it would no longer be so tomorrow, because progress marches on each day." ...|$|E
500|$|Although giving [...] "sporadic" [...] {{comments}} {{during the}} interview, no answers {{had been given}} that touched upon the case. The Court had not previously considered [...] "whether a suspect can invoke {{the right to remain}} silent by remaining uncooperative and nearly silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes" [...] and the dissent considered that silence throughout a lengthy interrogation [...] "long past the <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> could be deciding whether to respond cannot reasonably be understood other than as an invocation of the right to remain silent". Butler also distinguished between a [...] "sufficient course of conduct" [...] and mere [...] "inculpatory statements".|$|E

500|$|Fillmore {{received}} {{praise for}} the tariff, but in July 1842 he announced he would not seek re-election. [...] The Whigs nominated him anyway, but he refused it. Tired of Washington life and the conflict that had revolved around President Tyler, Fillmore sought {{to return to his}} life and law practice in Buffalo. Fillmore continued to be active in the lame duck session of Congress that followed the 1842 elections and returned to Buffalo in April 1843. According to his biographer, Scarry: [...] "Fillmore concluded his Congressional career at a <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had become a powerful figure, an able statesman {{at the height of his}} popularity". Thurlow Weed deemed Congressman Fillmore [...] "able in debate, wise in council, and inflexible in his political sentiments".|$|E
500|$|Blanchard {{was born}} on December 11, 1924 in McColl, South Carolina [...] His father was a doctor and had played college {{football}} at Tulane University and Wake Forest University. The Blanchards moved from McColl, South Carolina to Dexter, Iowa in 1929. [...] The Blanchards then moved to Bishopville, South Carolina two years later. [...] Blanchard, nicknamed [...] "Little Doc" [...] due to his father's occupation, attended high school at Saint Stanislaus College in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He led the school's football team, the Rockachaws, to an undefeated season during his senior year in 1941. Blanchard was recruited to play college football by Army, Fordham University and the University of Notre Dame, among others. Blanchard said in 1985 {{that he had been}} contacted about going to West <b>Point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was in high school. He said, [...] "At that point in time, I really wasn’t interested. Academically, I never was too hot, so I never had any idea I would pass the entrance examination and go to West Point." ...|$|E
500|$|The filming {{schedule}} {{was intended to}} last 138 days but grew to 160. Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned [...] "a lot of money". Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio {{said there was no}} <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think {{you have to have a}} fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.|$|E

500|$|The {{match was}} a see-saw five setter with Nadal {{prevailing}} 9–7 {{in the fifth}} after 4 hours and 37 minutes. [...] Analyst Steve Tignor summed it up: [...] "This epic was {{a mirror image of}} their last one, in the 2012 Australian Open final. That day it had been Nadal who had survived a near-death experience in the fourth set, won it in a tiebreaker, and taken a 4–2 lead in the fifth before watching Djokovic storm back for the title. Today it was Nole who broke Rafa at 3–4 in the fourth and again at 5–6, grabbed that set in a tiebreaker, and led 4–2 in the fifth before watching Nadal take it all away. In each of those matches, the loser was haunted by a stunning, crucial lapse. In Australia, with a chance to go up 5–2 in the fifth, Nadal had missed the easiest of backhand passing shots. In Paris, serving at 4–3 in the final set, Djokovic gave away a <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> ran into the net after hitting what would have been a winning overhead." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1993, the {{relationship}} between Jackson and the press reached a boiling <b>point</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was accused of child sexual abuse. Although never charged with a crime, Jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place. Complaints about the coverage included the media using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself {{did not support the}} headline, accepting leaked material from the police investigation and of Jackson's alleged criminal activity in return for money, a lack of objectivity and using headlines that strongly implied Jackson's guilt. At the time, Jackson said of the media coverage, [...] "I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions." [...] Jackson began taking painkillers, Valium, Xanax and Ativan to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him. When he left the United States to go into rehabilitation, the media showed him little sympathy.|$|E
500|$|On October 4, 2010, {{the release}} date was {{announced}} as November 22, 2010. Prior to its release, West initiated the free music program GOOD Fridays through his website on August 20, 2010, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday of the week, {{a portion of}} which were included on the album. Titled after his imprint label GOOD Music, the program generated considerable publicity {{in the months leading}} up to the album's release. Online marketing coordinator Karen Civil said of the program in retrospect, [...] "It's a genius idea.
