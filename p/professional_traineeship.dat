The French BTS is a short Vocational Diploma prepared in {{two years after the}} “baccalauréat”, with national programs and evaluation criteria. The successful candidates are supposed to be immediately employable, especially in their local geographical environment. Thus, there exists a paradox between the national definition of the diploma and the local contexts of teaching and (supposed) professional integration. However, the <b>professional</b> <b>traineeship</b> plays a great part in this diploma. For this reason, it seems interesting to investigate how the conception of students evolve, with respect to the aforementioned paradox, during and after <b>professional</b> <b>traineeship.</b> For this purpose, questionnaire surveys have been carried out at various moment of the scholar during two years (two cohorts). The main results can be summarized as follows. The <b>professional</b> <b>traineeship</b> is positively perceived by the students {{at the beginning of the}} training. They consider it as very important for the development of professional skills. Over time, this positive representation progresses homogeneously.

40|$|AbstractA {{model of}} Innovation Schools was {{developed}} to strengthen systematic collaboration between schools and universities as teacher educators. It adopts a teacher education paradigm of the clinician-professional model in order to initiate and disseminate educational innovation and respond to changes in society. The model specifies four dimensions of collaboration between a network of schools and universities: <b>traineeship,</b> <b>professional</b> development, team teaching, research and development. After one full school year of piloting in one practice school, {{it can be concluded}} that the synergy between these dimensions may lead to innovation. Therefore, a continuation with large-scale implementation of the model is needed...|$|R
