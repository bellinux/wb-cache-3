40|$|Abstract Background The {{emergence}} of <b>physician</b> owned specialty hospitals focusing on high margin procedures has generated significant controversy. Yet, {{it is unclear}} whether <b>physician</b> owned specialty hospitals differ significantly from non <b>physician</b> owned specialty hospitals and thus merit the additional scrutiny that has been proposed. Our objective was to assess whether <b>physician</b> owned specialty orthopedic hospitals and non <b>physician</b> owned specialty orthopedic hospitals differ with respect to hospital characteristics and patient populations served. Methods We conducted a descriptive study using Medicare data of beneficiaries who underwent total hip replacement (THR) (N = 10, 478) and total knee replacement (TKR) (N = 15, 312) in 29 <b>physician</b> owned and 8 non <b>physician</b> owned specialty orthopedic hospitals during 1999 â€“ 2003. We compared hospital characteristics of <b>physician</b> owned and non <b>physician</b> owned specialty hospitals including procedural volumes of major joint replacements (THR and TKR), hospital teaching status, and for profit status. We then compared demographics and prevalence of common comorbid conditions for patients treated in <b>physician</b> owned and non <b>physician</b> owned specialty hospitals. Finally, we examined whether the socio-demographic characteristics of the neighborhoods where <b>physician</b> owned and non <b>physician</b> owned specialty hospitals differed, as measured by zip code level data. Results <b>Physician</b> owned specialty hospitals performed fewer major joint replacements on Medicare beneficiaries in 2003 than non <b>physician</b> owed specialty hospitals (64 vs. 678, P Conclusion <b>Physician</b> owned specialty orthopedic hospitals differ significantly from non <b>physician</b> owned specialty orthopedic hospitals and may warrant the additional scrutiny policy makers have proposed. </p...|$|R

5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning <b>physicians</b> {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by <b>physicians</b> rights groups, who said that it would promote accountability in the investigations of <b>physicians.</b> Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against <b>physicians.</b> The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conduit for}} the {{transfer}} of knowledge is the International Conference on Emergency Medicine, a conference held every two years for worldwide emergency <b>physicians</b> by the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM). In 2012, the conference took place in Dublin, Ireland. The organization was founded in 1991 by four national emergency physician organizations: the American College of Emergency <b>Physicians,</b> the British Association for Emergency Medicine, the Canadian Association of Emergency <b>Physicians,</b> and the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine. The conference rotated between the founding members until 2010, when it was held in Singapore. Many new members have been accepted since the mid-1990s, when the IFEM decided to open up membership to other nations' emergency medicine organizations; the conference will rotate to them as well. For instance, in 2014 the conference will be hosted in Hong Kong and in 2016 it {{will be held in}} Cape Town, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} <b>physicians</b> (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality.

Although less than half (40%) of the <b>physicians</b> reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E
