Previous research in 3 D printing focused on attack vector identification and intellectual property protection. This research develops and implements malicious code using Printrbot’s branch of the open source Marlin 3 D printer firmware. Implementations of the malicious code were activated based on a specified printer command sent from a desktop application. The malicious firmware successfully ignored incoming <b>print</b> <b>commands</b> for a <b>printed</b> 3 D model, substituted malicious <b>print</b> <b>commands</b> for an alternate 3 D model, and manipulated extruder feed rates. The research contribution is three-fold. First, this research provides an initial assessment of potential effects malicious firmware can have on a 3 D printed object. Second, it documents a potential vulnerability that impacts 3 D product output using 3 D printer firmware. Third, it provides foundational grounding for future research in malicious 3 D printing process activities...|$|R

50|$|DOS {{is not a}} {{multitasking}} operating system. DOS did however {{provide a}} Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) function which allowed programs to remain resident in memory. These programs could hook the system timer and/or keyboard interrupts to allow themselves to run tasks in the background or to be invoked at any time preempting the current running program effectively implementing a simple form of multitasking on a program-specific basis. The <b>PRINT</b> <b>command</b> did this to implement background print spooling. Borland Sidekick, a popup personal information manager (PIM), also used this technique.|$|E

NR % 4 == 1 is true for the 1st, 5th, 9th, etc., lines of input. Likewise, NR % 4 == 3 is true for the 3rd, 7th, 11th, etc., lines of input.

In view {{of contributing}} to the advancements {{in the field of}} e-teaching using modern mapping techniques, the Interactive Map Teaching Tool (IMTT) has been created for the History Department at San Diego State University (SDSU) by Ravali Yadavalli. IMTT would aid in teaching student geographic locations that are part of History 101 / 100 / 411 course curriculum of the SDSU History Department. GIS technology has been used in creation of geographic location types such as selected cities, oceans and seas, straits and passes, rivers, and mountain ranges. Each of the geographic location types was established as a layer on a world map. Based on the requirement, the layer created was a point layer or polygon layer or a line layer. Generally, the selection of the layer type is dependent on the shape and total area of the location type to be mapped. A user interface created using JAVA and MOJO software packages has been included in this tool for effective learning of users. Some of the user interface features provided in this tool includes zoom-in, zoom-out, legend editing, location identifier, <b>print</b> <b>command,</b> and a tool menu...|$|E

Computer aided teaching enables teachers to engage the students better by increasing desire and motivation to learn. This thesis focuses on creating a GIS multimedia teaching tool about the Africa continent. The tool provides interactive graphical information of colonial history, independence history, points of interests, demographics and physiography of Africa. Students can switch between various European countries (Belgian, French or UK) to see which countries were colonized when and by whom and when students use the hotlink tool on a particular country, a pop up window describes the country name, capital city, independence date, population, area, and government type. If the user wants {{to know more about}} a particular country, a Wikipedia link is also provided. Hotlink tool works the same way for the points of interest layer.

40|$|The Tree Interface is a {{graphical}} tool {{specially designed}} to draw binary and general rooted trees, as they occur during an algorithmic process. It {{can be used}} in three different contexts. Simple drawing of trees. As a result of an algorithmic process, a non ordered, rooted tree may have been stored in a file, along with some information for every node. In order {{to take a look at}} the tree simply load the file into the Tree Interface. The interface draws the tree and offers the ability to display the information of the nodes and to display different types of nodes in different shapes and colours. Drawing a tree during a computational process. This is the most interesting feature of the Tree Interface and {{can be used in}} two different ways. Piping the output of any process that specifies a tree to the Tree Interface. Adapting one or more algorithms to the Tree Interface, start them via a mouse button click in the menu bar of the interface window and instantly pursue the growth of the tree. Both features are easy to realize. The first one needs only the adaption of the users program output. It uses identifiers to indicate if a new node is added to the tree, a node changes its type and should be drawn in a different colour or a node receives new or extra information. The second option means including the users program into the environment of the Tree Interface such that the program can be started by clicking on a button in the menu bar. The necessary adaptions that need to be programmed are described in detail in the User Manual. Emulating a tree growing process after the computation is finished. The Tree Interface includes a tool for emulating the process that grew the tree after the process is finished. This is useful, if the process cannot be accessed online (e. g. parallel algorithms that are run on multiple processor machines) or if the process is way to fast or to slow to follow the action that takes place. The Tree Interface provides a comfortable tool that enables the user to emulate a process, including features for speeding up or slowing down the process. The Tree Interface provides all necessary features of a graphical interface, such as area zoom, mouse dragging, <b>print</b> <b>command</b> and a colour, font and size chooser.
