The battle was very bloody and although Travers' side was victorious, he was killed.|$|R
50|$|Among {{those whom}} {{prosecutors}} sought to charge in 1994 were foreign minister Willy Claes, former Brussels region Premier Philippe Moureaux and former defense minister Guy Coëme. A <b>parliamentary</b> panel <b>judged,</b> however, that sufficient evidence {{was available to}} charge only Coëme. He was convicted in 1996 in a Supreme Court trial, but a later decision by the European Court of Human Rights judged his trial to be unfair.|$|R

5000|$|In every province, {{there is}} one High Court. Currently all four provinces Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have High courts, {{respectively}} called Lahore High Court, Sindh High Court, Peshawar High Court, and Balochistan High Court. After the approval of 18th Constitutional Amendment in April 2010, a new High court is established at Federal Capital Islamabad {{with the name of}} Islamabad High Court. In 18th Amendment, judges appointments are proposed by a <b>Parliamentary</b> Commission. <b>Judges</b> of the provincial high courts were, previously appointed ( [...] The seventeenth amendment give these powers to the president, previously Prime minister exercised them) by the president after consultation with the chief justice of the Supreme Court, as well as the governor of the province and the chief justice of the high court to which the appointment is being made. High courts have original and appellate jurisdiction.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the pronouncements and positions of the leading political parties on the Human Rights Act and the proposals for a new British Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. It analyses the main arguments made {{in support of a}} British Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, which are advanced around five main issues: security, the <b>judges,</b> <b>parliamentary</b> sovereignty, responsibilities and 'British rights'. The article was written before the government published the Green Paper Rights and Responsibilities: developing our constitutional framework in March 2009 and provides a political context with which to analyse it...|$|R
50|$|In January 2017, {{following}} {{a series of}} critical reports by the the European Stability Initiative (ESI) NGO, and concern expressed by {{many members of the}} Assembly, the Assembly's Bureau decided on a three-step response to these allegations, including the setting up of an independent, external investigation body. In May 2017, three distinguished former judges were named to conduct the investigation: Sir Nicolas Bratza, a British former President of the European Court of Human Rights; Jean-Louis Bruguière, a French former anti-terrorist judge and investigator; and Elisabet Fura, a former Swedish <b>parliamentary</b> Ombudsman and <b>judge</b> on the Strasbourg Court.|$|R
50|$|The {{issue of}} a third writ of ship money on 9 October 1636 made it evident that the ancient {{restrictions}} that limited the levying of the tax to the maritime parts of the Kingdom and to times of war (or imminent national danger) had been finally swept away, and that the King intended to convert it into a permanent and general form of taxation without <b>parliamentary</b> sanction. The <b>judges</b> again, at Charles's request, gave an opinion favourable to the prerogative, which was read by Lord Coventry in the Star Chamber and by the judges on assize.|$|R
5000|$|David Cameron was {{reported}} in April 2011 to be [...] "uneasy" [...] {{with the use of}} super-injunctions. The Culture secretary Jeremy Hunt has stated that the Government does not intend to introduce a privacy law and that it would instead look towards clearer guidelines for judges ruling on injunctions. This was reaffirmed by David Cameron on 10 May 2011 when he blamed lack of <b>parliamentary</b> guidance forcing <b>judges</b> to rely on strict European law in their judgements. A spokesman for the Prime Minister welcomed the Neuberger report, stating that [...] "We {{think this is a very}} useful report and it is something we will be considering very carefully." [...] On 23 May 2011, speaking on ITV's Daybreak the Prime Minister stated that the law should be reviewed to [...] "catch up with how people consume media today" [...] and that the situation was [...] "unsustainable". Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition, commented that the law was [...] "not working" [...] and a review would be required.|$|R
25|$|Members of Parliament are {{permitted}} to speak on any subject without fear of censure outside Parliament; the only body that can censure an MP is the House Committee of Privileges. Parliamentary immunity takes effect from the moment a member of Parliament is sworn in, and only applies when that member has the floor; it {{does not apply to}} statements made outside the House. An exception to this rule are portions of the constitution related to the social contract, such as the Articles governing citizenship, Bumiputera (Malays and indigenous people) priorities, the Malay language, etc. — all public questioning of these provisions is illegal under the 1971 amendments to the Sedition Act, which Parliament passed {{in the wake of the}} 1969 13 May race riots. Members of Parliament are also forbidden from criticising the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and <b>judges.</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> immunity and other such privileges are set out by Article 63 of the Constitution; as such, the specific exceptions to such immunity had to be included in the Constitution by amendment after the 13 May incident.|$|R
50|$|In March 2013, Parliament {{amended the}} {{constitution}} {{for the fourth}} time, on a 265-11 vote, with Fidesz, the Christian Democrats and three independents in favor and the Socialists boycotting the vote; there were also 33 abstentions. Subsequently, President János Áder signed the amendment into law, citing his legal duty {{and the need to}} preserve national unity. The fifteen-page amendment touches on several aspects. It annuls rulings of the Constitutional Court made before the 2011 constitution went into force, while allowing their legal effects to remain. It endows the president of the Kuria and the chief prosecutor with the power to initiate constitutional review of laws. While giving the Constitutional Court the power to review the constitution itself on procedural grounds, it stipulates that the court cannot annul a law passed by a two-thirds <b>parliamentary</b> majority. <b>Judges</b> and prosecutors are obliged to retire at the general retirement age, although that age is left unstated; the Kuria head and the chief prosecutor are exempt. The amendment enshrines freedom of religion and allows constitutional complaints regarding the church law. It allows civil lawsuits for hate speech targeting an individual's community, and declares that communism is condemned. The measure requires students whose education is subsidized by the state to work in Hungary for a period after graduation or reimburse their tuition costs to the state. It allows only public media to air political advertising prior to general and European elections. The importance of the traditional family is stressed, and authorities are empowered to ban living in certain public spaces, although homelessness is not outlawed. A prior proposal on requiring voters to register prior to elections was not included after being earlier voided by the Constitutional Court.|$|R
5000|$|On their {{retirement}} in 1681 they were thanked by {{the grand jury}} for the city, but Bethel was defeated on 5 September in his candidature for the aldermanship of Bishopsgate ward. The sheriffs were accused, with Sir Robert Clayton and others, of having visited Edward Fitzharris in Newgate with a message from Lord Howard that nothing would save his life but a discovery of the popish plot but the accusation was promptly denied in a pamphlet called Truth vindicated, 1681, which is reprinted in the State Trials, viii. 411-25. Several pamphlets were published on {{the conduct of the}} sheriffs in taking the sacrament, and on Bethel's attempt to be returned for Southwark at the election of February 1681. A folio tract published in his interest at this election, entitled The Vindication of Slingsby Bethel (1681), gave an emphatic denial to the assertion of his antagonists that he was a papist, a Jesuit, a cruel soldier in the <b>parliamentary</b> army, a <b>judge</b> of the late king, and an assistant at the scaffold when King Charles was executed. He was defeated at the poll for the borough of Southwark, and in the following October was fined five marks for assaulting a watchman at the election day, the fact being that he had removed two men who were preventing his electors from tendering their votes (The Trial of Slinqsby Bethel (1681), and State Trials, viii. 747-58). In the same month of October 1681, Bethel showed his liberality by a gift of several hundred pounds for the relief of poor prisoners for debt.|$|R
