40|$|ABSTRACT Decomposition o f {{cationic}} photoinitiators in {{the solid}} state {{is used in}} a remote cure process ie. one in which photoinitiator is not present in the <b>polymerisable</b> <b>monomer.</b> An application of this process to a dual cure system is described. Details are given of free radical polymerisation reactions in aqueous solutions which produce latexes via both suspension and emulsion polymerisation processes. Finally, ways of improving the photosensitivity of poly(viny 1 alcohol) modified with styrylpyridinium groups utilising mixed [2 + 2]cycloaddition reactions are described...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{development}} of sensing devices based on molecularly imprinted polymers {{for the detection of}} clinically relevant analytes. Three analytes were considered, metronidazole, creatinine and propofol. A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was computationally designed for metronidazole and tested using SPE techniques. This polymer was then grafted onto a transducer surface using an immobilised initiator. Amperometric and impedance detection of metronidazole were investigated. The capacitive detection of creatinine was reproduced from the literature (Panasyuk- Delaney et al., 2002) as this approach could be applied to other MIPs to form a universal platform for sensor development. However, the sensors produced using this methodology were difficult to reproduce and attempts to improve them were unsuccessful. A model for capacitive electrodes was developed to explain the obtained results. To address the key challenges found in the aforementioned work, a dual <b>polymerisable</b> <b>monomer</b> was used as a conductive anchor for the amperometric and impedance detection of propofol. The developed amperometric sensors demonstrated very high sensitivity (limit of detection was below 5 µM), although the electrodes lacked in selectivity. In conclusion, this thesis illustrates some of the key areas which need to be considered in {{the development of}} MIP-based devices and investigates some innovative solutions to these problems...|$|E

The obtained polymers may be used for separation of biotin and related small molecules, together with larger biotinylated molecules of biological origin, e. g. proteins, from complex mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The study {{described}} in this dissertation examines the synthesis of mainly acrylate-based surfactants and their subsequent use as emulsifiers/stabilisers in the emulsion polymerisation of styrene. Some acrylamide-based surfactants were also studied, for comparison purposes only. Two major types of surfactants, <b>polymerisable</b> (surfactant <b>monomers</b> or surfmers) and polymeric, were synthesised, characterised and used in emulsion polymerisation reactions. The prepared polymerisable surfactants, 12 -acryloyloxydodecanoic acid (12 -ADA) and 11 -acrylamidoundecanoic acid (11 -AAUA), and their sodium salts, had reactive acryloyl functionalities...|$|R
40|$|Molecularly {{imprinted}} polymers (MIPs) are crosslinked polymers containing bespoke functionalised cavities {{arising from}} the inclusion of template molecules in the polymerisation mixture and their later extraction. When the polymers are prepared functional <b>polymerisable</b> <b>monomers</b> are included which {{become part of the}} polymer matrix and serve to decorate the cavities with functionality appropriate to the template molecules. Overall, binding sites are created which have a memory for the template both in terms of shape and matching functionality. Fluorescent molecularly imprinted polymers have the benefit of a fluorophore in their cavities that may respond to the presence of bound test compound by a change in their fluorescence output. The work presented falls into three main areas. A series of fluorescent MIPs was prepared with a view to generating material capable of mimicking the binding characteristics of the metabolically important cytochrome isoform CYP 2 D 6. The MIPs re-bound their templates and various cross-reactivities were encountered for test compound/drug recognition. One MIP in particular exhibited a rational discrimination amongst the related synthetic templates and was reasonably successful in recognising CYP 2 D 6 substrates from the drug set tested. In order to give some insights into binding modes in MIPs, attempts were made to produce functional monomers containing two or more fluorophores that could be interrogated independently. A model compound was prepared which fitted the dual-fluorophore criteria and which will be the basis for future incorporation into MIPs. A further strand to this thesis is the deliberate incorporation of hydrophobic moieties into fluorescent functional monomers so that the resulting imprinted cavities might be biomimetic in their impersonation of enzyme active sites. Thus the imprinted cavities had specific hydrophobic regions as well as the usual polar functionality with which to interact with binding test compounds.

40|$|Supramolecular {{chemistry}} {{involves the}} study of noncovalent interactions that take place between molecules. A supramolecule or host-guest complex is formed when a noncovalent binding or complexation event occurs between two such molecules. Hydrogen bonds, electrostatics, π-stacking, hydrophobic effects and Van der Waals forces are all types of noncovalent interactions. The incorporation of redox active molecules into supramolecular systems is desirable, {{as they can be}} used as a convenient way of observing changes in a systems environment. This study involves the synthesis of a range of different redox active molecules, incorporated into supramolecular or materials devices. Firstly, two novel <b>polymerisable</b> flavin <b>monomers</b> have been synthesised. Attempts to polymerise these monomers, followed by characterisation to determine the physical and electronic properties were carried out. Secondly, a porphyrin system capable of binding to a flavin moiety has been prepared, and these complexes have been studied using physical and electrochemical techniques. This system offers an insight into the relationship between the porphyrin and flavin in nature. Furthermore, it would also serve to show how metals in close proximity to the flavin moiety can affect its supramolecular and electrochemical properties. A redox active ureidopyrimidinone system, capable of forming very strong dimer complexes, has been synthesised. This is able to tautomerise in solution, and using a combination of physical and electrochemical techniques, these supramolecular interactions have been studied. A polymer also displaying these properties has also been prepared and studied to understand the supramolecular properties it possesses. The results of this study will hopefully contribute significantly to the body of chemical research in the area of supramolecular and materials chemistry, with a variety of interesting results and scope for further expansion of these projects...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to prepare a series of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for corticosteroid templates using bulk and precipitation polymerisation strategies. Initially, a systematic study was undertaken, investigating the factors affecting the synthesis of MIPs by precipitation polymerisation. Careful optimisation of polymerisation parameters, including the monomer concentration, initiator type and solvent, allowed for a high degree of control over particle size and morphology. Preequilibrium interactions between the primary target budesonide (BDN) and functional monomers were investigated using NMR studies and showed weak interactions with dissociation constants, kdiss, ranging from 0. 534 - 1. 47 M Due to this weak functional monomer-template interaction, polymers were prepared in bulk format using a target analogue approach utilising hydrocortisone- 17 -butyrate (HCB) as a low-cost alternative to BDN. The HCB imprinted ground bulk polymers demonstrated imprinting factors (IF) as high as 7. 5 for the template. Selectivity studies on six steroidal analogues showed that recognition was driven by shape and size selectivity as well as hydrophobic interactions, with IF values ranging from 1. 2 - 9. 5 in both organic and aqueous based systems. Applications of the imprinted polymers were demonstrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analytical column chromatography. SPE studies utilising HCB imprinted polymers displayed a seven-fold increase in the specific retention of BDN. Precipitated prednisolone imprinted polymers achieved chromatographic separation between the template and hydrocortisone, a close structural analogue. Selectivity factors as high as 1. 4 and a resolution value of 0. 75 were achieved. Two custom functional monomer strategies were utilised towards enhancing MIP performance. The synthesis of tailor-made monomers based on derivatised cyclodextrins (CD) achieved a substitution of 2. 5 polymerisable vinyl groups per CD. This derivatised CD was used to prepare precipitated polymers (0. 3 - 7. 2 μm) in a 40 % aqueous acetonitrile porogen. A <b>polymerisable</b> hydrocortisone methacrylate <b>monomer</b> was successfully synthesised for use in semi-covalent imprinting which produced discrete microspherical beads (1. 2 - 5. 1 μm) using divinylbenzene as the crosslinker...|$|R
