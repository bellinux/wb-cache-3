To estimate this quality together with thermal comfort, we measured in a climatic chamber, thermal comfort parameters and local ventilation effectiveness for temperature, at 12 locations and 3 heights within the occupied zone, for 4 ventilation regimes and 3 thermal configurations of the climatic chamber.

40|$|The {{adaptive}} hypothesis {{predicts that}} contextual factors and past thermal history modify building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. One of {{the predictions of}} the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This {{is contrary to the}} static assumptions underlying the current ASHRAE comfort standard 55 - 92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55 - 92, the ASHRAE RP- 884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21, 000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static <b>predicted</b> <b>means</b> <b>vote</b> (PMV) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in HVAC buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation.

However, the sensor node power supply, through either power lines or battery power, still presents obstacles to {{the distribution of the}} sensing systems. In this study, a novel sensor network, powered by the artificial light, was constructed to achieve wireless power transfer and wireless data communications for thermal comfort measurements. The sensing node integrates an IC-based temperature sensor, a radiation thermometer, a relative humidity sensor, a micro machined flow sensor and a microprocessor for <b>predicting</b> <b>mean</b> <b>vote</b> (PMV) calculation. The 935 MHz band RF module was employed for the wireless data communication with a specific protocol based on a special energy beacon enabled mode capable of achieving zero power consumption during the inactive periods of the nodes. A 5 W spotlight, with a dual axis tilt platform, can power the distributed nodes over a distance of up to 5 meters. A special algorithm, the maximum entropy method, was developed to estimate the sensing quantity of climate parameters if the communication module did not receive any response from the distributed nodes within a certain time limit. The light-powered sensor networks were able to gather indoor comfort-sensing index levels in good agreement with the comfort-sensing vote (CSV) preferred by a human being and the experimental results within the environment suggested that the sensing system could be used in air conditioning systems to implement a comfort-optimal control strategy...|$|R

There are different types of occupants in a care home. They differ {{in the type of}} activities they perform and also in their clothing requirements. This study sought to determine thermal comfort levels for the different groups of occupants. Continuous monitoring of indoor and outdoor parameters was carried out for the summer period. Energy consumption for specific final use and heat delivered to radiators were also measured, as well as spot measurements of air speed. The POE also included structured interviews with the staff who answered questions about their comfort and the operation of the building. Residents were not interviewed due to their poor health. <b>Predicted</b> <b>Mean</b> <b>Votes</b> were calculated from the measurements and the information provided in the interviews. Calculations were carried out for both residents and staff in each of the spaces monitored including a selection of occupied bedrooms, lounge, dining room, nurse station and reception. The results were compared with data from the comfort survey of the staff and showed that most members of the staff are not comfortable and consider the building to be too warm in the summer. However, the PMV calculation showed that while indoor temperatures were too high for staff, they were acceptable to the residents because of their lower activity rate. Staff often accepted this discomfort because they were aware of the needs of the residents and acknowledged that higher temperatures are necessary for their comfort. This suggests complex relations are at work, which would normally be glossed over in conventional comfort studies.

40|$|Thermal comfort {{standards}} ISO 7730 and ASHRAE 55 - 2004 {{are based}} on the experimental results conducted in climatic chambers and the adaptive opportunities are usually limited in these experiments. However, in naturally ventilated buildings, adaptive opportunities are not fixed and occupants always have the liberty to modify the opportunities in order to feel comfortable. A comfort survey has been carried out in three different climatic zones of North-East India in four different seasons of a year. Climatic parameters corresponding to actual mean vote (AMV) are recorded during the survey and the values are used to calculate the <b>predicted</b> <b>mean</b> <b>vote</b> (PMV) using ISO 7730 calculation procedures.

The chip core is a miniature transformer with a nano-ferrofluid magnetic core. The chip embedded transformer can convert harvested energy from its solar cell to variable voltage output for driving multiple loads. This chip system yields a simple, small, and more importantly, a battery-less power supply solution. The sensor node is equipped with multiple sensors that can be enabled by the energy harvesting power supply to collect information about the human body comfort degree. Compared with lab instruments, the nodes with temperature, humidity and photosensors driven by harvested energy had variation coefficient measurement precision of less than 6 % deviation under low environmental light of 240 lux. The thermal comfort was affected by the air speed. A flow sensor equipped on the sensor node was used to detect airflow speed. Due to its high power consumption, this sensor node provided 15 % less accuracy than the instruments, but it still can meet the requirement of analysis for <b>predicted</b> <b>mean</b> <b>votes</b> (PMV) measurement. The energy harvesting wireless sensor network (WSN) was deployed in a 24 -hour convenience store to detect thermal comfort degree from the air conditioning control.

40|$|Today several indices, {{such as the}} <b>Predict</b> <b>Mean</b> <b>Vote</b> (PMV), are {{accepted}} widely and are used to rate a situation's thermal comfort. In the last years {{there have been some}} studies with a focus on a more holistic approach: to find the interactions between comfort votes influenced by the main environmental parameters, e. g. temperature, background noise, air quality, relative humidity, illumination level. Based on data from studies in a simulated aircraft cabin, the Fraunhofer Flight Test Facility (FTF), two models have been developed to investigate whether it is advantageous to use indices for thermal comfort instead of directly measured data to formulate a more holistic comfort model. The technique of structural equation models has been used to combine statistically the measured and/or calculated data with the votes of more than a thousand subjects with respect to the latent (i. e. not directly measurable) variables of comfort. Parameters for thermal and aural environment as well as air quality have been considered for the modelling and linked together with the aim to find some model for the prediction of overall comfort. Both models are based on the same data and the same structure except for the main exogeneous ("input") variables. One model uses measured variables of the physical environment, such as dry bulb temperature, while the other models use climate indices, such as PMV and ET. Since climate indices generally are premised on some model they imply a certain modelling error per se. On the other hand they reduce the degrees of freedom for further modelling and thus a source of unexplainable variance. After evaluating the admissibility of the models the approaches have been compared based on goodness-of-fit indices. Based on these fit measures it is judged whether the models using indices for comfort are suitable to depict the subjects' perception of the indoor environment and thus can compensate the disadvantages because of implicit errors through the benefit of data reduction. The structural equation models hypothesized are admissible and fit the data well. The models using environmental indices have better fit criteria than the one based on environmental comfort models, since indices already carry some information to explain the implied covariance. There is no remarkable difference of the models using PMV or ET...|$|R
