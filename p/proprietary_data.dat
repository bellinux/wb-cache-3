25|$|The Science Archive Operation Group {{receives}} and redistributes ESO and Hubble Space Telescope {{data and}} provides archival support. About 12terabytes of public data are distributed per year through the ESO archive {{in response to}} about 10,000 web requests. Additionally, more than 2,000 CDs and DVDs of <b>proprietary</b> <b>data</b> are sent out annually to principal investigators for service-mode observations. The archive is about 65TB, with an input rate of about 15TB per year; this is being increased {{by a factor of}} 10 or so due to the survey telescopes' data-production rate.|$|E
25|$|Some drives use special {{techniques}}, such as Plextor's GigaRec or Sanyo's HD-BURN, {{to write}} more data onto a given disc; these techniques are inherently {{deviations from the}} Compact Disc (Red, Yellow, and/or Orange Book) standards, making the recorded discs proprietary-formatted and not fully compatible with standard CD players and drives. However, in certain applications where discs will not be distributed or exchanged outside a private group {{and will not be}} archived for a long time, a proprietary format may be an acceptable way to obtain greater capacity (up to 1.2GiB with GigaRec or 1.8GiB with HD-BURN on 99 minute media). The greatest risk in using such a <b>proprietary</b> <b>data</b> storage format, assuming that it works reliably as designed, is that it may be difficult or impossible to repair or replace the hardware used to read the media if it fails, is damaged, or is lost after its original vendor discontinues it.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, a new {{prospective}} rival airliner emerged, {{this time}} from Boeing in the United States, {{in the form of}} the Boeing 727, which also had a tri-jet configuration. Boeing had begun its studies into this sector of the market in 1956, and elected to launch its own tri-jet programme in 1959. Airco executives, who were at the time intensely exploring various alternatives and further partnerships with other aircraft companies, considered the possibility that Boeing might choose to drop the 727 project and instead co-manufacture the Airco D.H.121 in the USA; Lord Douglas was one of the proponents of this initiative. As a result, Airco invited a team of Boeing engineers and executives to Hatfield; (Boeing later permitted a return visit by de Havilland representatives to Seattle); however, Boeing revealed few details of their plans for the 727, while virtually all information on the D.H.121 had been shared with Boeing, an openness that had allegedly [...] "amazed" [...] Boeing. British commentators have tended to interpret this episode as involving the acquisition of sensitive <b>proprietary</b> <b>data</b> on the D.H.121 by a direct competitor. Woods described the action as [...] "de Havilland solemnly handed all its research over to its rivals...the crowning piece of stupidity".|$|E
2500|$|The ranking is {{empirical}} and compiles {{a methodology}} that employs 10 different metrics. The criteria focused on academic papers, which indicate basic research performed at a university, and patent filings, which {{point to an}} institution's interest in protecting and commercializing its discoveries. Compiled by the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters, the list uses <b>proprietary</b> <b>data</b> and analysis tools. The process began by identifying the 500 academic and government organizations that published {{the greatest number of}} articles in scholarly journals, as indexed in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection database. The list was cross referenced against the number of patents filed by each organization during the same time period in the Derwent World Patents Index and the Derwent Innovations Index. Patent equivalents, citing patents and citing articles were included. The timeframe allows for the articles and patent activity to receive citations, thereby contributing to that portion of the methodology. The list was reduced to just those institutions that filed 70 or more patents, the bulk of which were universities. Each candidate university was then evaluated using various indicators including how often a university's patent applications were granted; how many patents were filed with global patent offices and local authorities; and how often the university's patents were cited by others. Universities were also evaluated in terms of how often their research papers were cited by patents; and the percentage of articles that featured a co-author from industry. The ranking has the Asia-Pacific edition featuring top 75 institutions across the region [...] and top 25 most innovative governmental institutions in the world.|$|E
