40|$|This paper {{discussed}} {{the impact of}} experience and expertise on problem solving <b>performance.</b> <b>Interview</b> responses from 22 novice to expert engineers were considered in this paper. The results suggested that experience and expertise though favourably viewed can impact the problem solving process adversely especially when facing new problems. The two main areas discussed in this paper are the impact of experience and expertise on problem identification and learning. Prior experience and expertise may result in narrow problem diagnosis. Expertise may also slow down learning impacting skills and knowledge development. We propose that open-mindedness and self-efficacy can help to negate these detrimental effects. Findings in this paper can add to existing theories on the education and on-going professional development of engineers {{in the field of}} innovative problem solving...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{details the}} use of a style of {{performance}} appraisal, known as 360 degree appraisal, in order to improve employee performance. The paper explores whether {{the use of}} 360 degree appraisal provides better feedback than only using the traditional <b>performance</b> <b>interview.</b> It provides a review of the current literature pertaining to performance appraisal, {{to the development of a}} performance appraisal scale, its implementation, and analysis. The survey instrument was tested on eleven supervisory staff at a major hotel in the Central Business District of Melbourne. Each supervisor was evaluated using up to nine appraisals from peers, subordinates, managers, customers, and their own supervisor. The data were then analysed; factor analysis revealed four underlying factors relating to communication, leadership, teamwork and excellence. A report was developed for each supervisor and used in conjunction with other appraisal methods such as interviews. Interviews were then conducted with the Human Resources (HR) Manager and with some participants in the process to assess the performance of the 360 degree appraisal. Participants who were interviewed, were unanimously supportive of the 360 degree appraisal system believing that being asked to rate the performance of others encouraged them to reflect upon their own performance. Most interviewees, however, felt that more training was needed prior to the process taking place. The HR Manager was firmly of the view that this approach provides a wealth of information to assist with staff development that is not obtained in the more traditional performance appraisal process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Prior to 1999 {{students}} entering our MBBS course {{were selected}} on academic performance alone. We have now evaluated {{the impact on}} the demographics of subsequent cohorts of our standard entry students (those entering directly from high school) of the addition to the selection process of an aptitude test (UMAT), a highly structured interview and a rural incentive program. Methods Students entering from 1985 to 1998, selected on academic performance alone (N = 1402), were compared to those from 1999 to 2011, {{selected on the basis of}} a combination of academic <b>performance,</b> <b>interview</b> score, and UMAT score together with the progressive introduction of a rural special entry pathway (N = 1437). Results Males decreased from 57 % to 45 % of the cohort, students of NE or SE Asian origin decreased from 30 % to 13 %, students born in Oceania increased from 52 % to 69 %, students of rural origin from 5 % to 21 % and those from independent high schools from 56 % to 66 %. The proportion of students from high schools with relative socio-educational disadvantage remained unchanged at approximately 10 %. The changes reflect in part increasing numbers of female and independent high school applicants and the increasing rural quota. However, they were also associated with higher interview scores in females vs males and lower interview scores in those of NE and SE Asian origin compared to those born in Oceania or the UK. Total UMAT scores were unrelated to gender or region of origin. Conclusions The revised selection processes had no impact on student representation from schools with relative socio-educational disadvantage. However, the introduction of special entry quotas for students of rural origin and a structured interview, but not an aptitude test, were associated with a change in gender balance and ethnicity of students in an Australian undergraduate MBBS course. </p...|$|E
40|$|Selecting medical {{students}} {{is a challenge}} for UK universities: there are more applicants than places, limited selection tools upon which to base decisions, and concerns over fair access. In attempt to alleviate such problems, the United Kingdom Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT) was introduced in 2006 to 26 medical schools. This study employed mixed methods to explore issues of fairness and student performance using a sequential explanatory design, Regression analyses were performed first, leading to further research questions addressed through the interpretation of semi-structured interviews with students. The regression analyses served two main purposes: first, to explore the relationship between background factors and admissions scores (including UKCAT), and second, to determine whether background factors and admissions scores were predictive of first and second year medical school examination performance. Privately educated students had significantly higher personal statement scores than state educated students, although personal statements were not predictive of examination <b>performance.</b> <b>Interview</b> scores were unaffected by previous school type and did not predict examination performance. UKCAT scores were not predicted by school type; however, UKCAT was consistently {{a significant predictor of}} examination performance. Despite the predictive ability of the UKCAT, much of the variance in examination scores remained unexplained. Interviews investigated admissions performance differences and factors affecting examination performance. When compared to state educated students, privately educated students described higher levels of economic, social and cultural capital, which facilitated the medical school application process. Factors affecting examination performance were unique to individual students; highlighting the difficulties inherent in predicting performance. While medical schools endeavour to create fair and transparent admissions policies, students who have access to economic, social and cultural capital are unintentionally favoured by traditional selection methods. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the UKCAT is the least biased and most useful selection tool used at Newcastle University. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{functional}} identities of legal witness, legal victim, and legal perpetrator and their co-construction in the forensic interviews that take place after allegations {{of child sexual abuse}} have been made. I argue that while these are inter-related identities, the focus of their constitution and the direction of their constructional dependencies is determined by the event context. Nineteen transcripts of forensic interviews involving children ages 3 to 12 were collected during a three-month period at a children's center in a western state. Legal witness as an identity of performance, is constituted in <b>performance.</b> <b>Interview</b> processes socialize children to these performances. Ritualized sequences within interviews also provide evidence that children have the qualities required of a legal witness. Children are constructed as legal victims in interview processes that establish they have been acted upon according to specific actions defined in the law. This mutually constitutes the legal perpetrator. Children, however, resist both interpellation as a legal victim and elements of the process of the interview affecting how they are perceived as legal witnesses. Analysis also reveals {{that the purpose of the}} interview within the extended legal process inherently shapes the accounts and narratives that are co-produced. The addition of a third interview participant is also considered. Second interviewers provided a complex co-construction process that can support the constitution of the legal witness identity. Relatives of the child also provide a complex process. If they are perceived as co-authoring the narratives or accounts, however, they may negatively affect the legal witness identity. The addition of an interpreter can facilitate the child's co-construction as a legal witness. As pre-trial events, forensic interviews are not subject to trial requirements for trained interpreters. In the case considered here, the untrained interpreter produced language that was less precise, more personal, and had the potential to affect the legal implication of questions. Finally, I discuss the therapeutic, theoretical, and the social, cultural, and political implications of the study...|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} in three parts. Part One looks at background. It briefly covers {{historical}} concepts of education; {{it goes on}} to look at the people who enter teaching and why they have chosen it as a career. Lastly part one looks at the hurdles they have to negotiate before being offered a place a college of education. Part Two looks at some of the variables which affect student teaching performance – personality, flexibility and how these have been shown to relate to measured teaching performance. It also looks at those variables external to the student which research has shown are likely to affect the marks a student will get for teaching practice. Finally section two looks at the relationship between teaching practice performance and future performance as a qualified teacher. Part Three is the empirical research. Five year groups of students already in colleges of education and one further group interviewed for a place at Bede College, Durham, constitute the research sample. Measures of academic <b>performance,</b> <b>interview</b> grades, I. Q. and flexibility scores were used as predictors of student teaching marks. Consistently the I. Q. score and flexibility score in multiple battery produced the best first order multiple prediction of teaching practice marks. Also consistently, G. C. E. and Interview grades produced the worst multiple prediction of teaching practice marks. The test of flexibility was shown by multiple regression analysis to consistently provide the significant predictive contribution to those multiple batteries in which it was present. The women students obtained very significantly higher scores on the test of flexibility than did the men students. One unexpected finding was that students who would have preferred to go to university were regarded as significantly poorer ' classroom performers than the rest. The appendices deal with the various predictors used in the empirical study, in particular with the development of the test of flexibility. The hypothesis that a test of verbal flexibility would predict the marks awarded to students for their teaching practice performance was accepted...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Research question: ‘How ‘Family- Centred’ do {{staff and}} parents {{perceive}} {{their work with}} disabled children and young people?’ Objectives: 1. To determine staff self-evaluation of family-centred care by completing the questionnaire MPOC-SP. 2. To explore staff views on their own family-centred care through discussion in a focus group, using the themes from the MPOC-SP. 3. To explore parental views of family-centred provision for their disabled child by interview individually or in a focus group. 4. To identify any areas where further staff training to improve their family-centred service provision. Relevance: Physiotherapists working with children do not work in isolation and are a valuable part of the interdisciplinary team. Achieving high standards of health care provision with children with a disability requires a focus on Family Centred Care. Family Centred Care {{has been defined as}} a philosophy of care where families are supported in their decision-making roles in an equal partnership with professionals. Participants: Purposive non-random sampling was used to recruit study participants. Staff were approached by letter and invited {{to take part in a}} focus group in their area. These staff then gave out information letters to parents whose child was receiving a service. Twenty nine staff and 10 parents volunteered. Methods: This study utilized a mixed methodology. The Measure of the Processes of Care for Service Providers (MPOC-SP) is a sensitive, valid and reliable questionnaire. Quantitative data was gathered from administration of this questionnaire with staff. A series of interviews and focus groups based around the themes from the questionnaire were also conducted with staff and parents of disabled children. These were recorded with a Dictaphone and transcribed verbatim. Analysis: The questionnaire data were analyzed with SPSS 16. The questionnaire is scored from 1 - 7 with 1 being the lowest 7 the highest score staff could award themselves based on their own perception of their <b>performance.</b> <b>Interview</b> and focus group data were analyzed using an editing approach. Results: The mean of ‘interpersonal sensitivity’ was 5. 35 and ‘respect’ 5. 74 compared to ‘providing general information’ 4. 34 and ‘communicating’ 4. 96, being slightly lower in staff self perception. Staff commented on the value of the questionnaire as a self- reflective tool. Staff described how they adapted their service to meet parental needs and empowered and enabled parents despite. Parent’s spoke highly of staff input and described the attributes they most valued. Some parental feedback suggested that there needed to be a clearer complaints procedure. Conclusions: This was a pilot study and the results should be treated with caution. The MPOC-SP has value for practitioners as a self reflective tool. The majority of parents considered they were treated as equal partners in the decision making processes and this should continue. To increase our understanding of Family Centred Care this topic could be explored by a closer ethnographic study in this context. Implications: Physiotherapists working with families with children with a disability need to evaluate their practice in terms of family centred care. Investigation of the influence of focused Family Centred Care training on parental experiences is warranted...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEpilepsy is {{a common}} cause of psychosocial {{disability}} and has been perceived to have {{a profound impact on}} the social functioning of individuals with epilepsy. In Zimbabwe a combination of developing world economic priorities (with provision of social and health services for disabled people not a major goal) and culturally mediated perceptions of epilepsy as a non-medical and feared stigma may further disadvantage people with epilepsy (PWE) in this respect. In order to assess both the level of psychosocial functioning of individuals with epilepsy and their own perception of it, three groups of people were sampled: attenders at a specialized epilepsy clinic and members of two community-based support groups. All completed a brief quality-of-life questionnaire with activities of daily living added. Those carers present completed the same questionnaire at the time of sampling. The results indicated that 36 of 38 people with epilepsy sampled, and their carers, did not perceive themselves to have sufficient cognitive impairment to interfere with social functioning, work performance or relationships with other as assessed by a subsection of the WHO SIDAM (objective evaluation of cognitive <b>performance)</b> <b>interview.</b> However, an adapted activities of daily Living Questionnaire (ADLQ) showed that three-quarters of carers (and two-thirds of PWE) felt that functioning was mildly to moderately reduced, particularly in the areas of solving daily problems and speed of thinking. One-quarter of PWE experienced problems with relationships to others, just less than one-fifth of PWE reported more than four areas of reduced functioning. Of special interest was the fact that 25 (66 %) reported sexual functioning as not applicable, although only four of these were of an age group which is not sexually active (less than 15 years old). In addition one-third of the central Hospital Group reported difficulties with using public transport, but none of the Community Support Group members, implying that the use of Public transport becomes an issue when it is necessary to travel long distances and that PWE curtail their travel but do not necessarily view this as a restriction. The samples chosen were from groups which, compared with PWE as a whole, are likely to include more disabled individuals, because attenders at a specialized epilepsy clinic and members of support groups self-select for more symptomatic epilepsy and a visibility. Therefore the proportion of PWE perceived to have difficulties with ADL in this project is not representative for PWE as a whole. The implications of our study are firstly that there is a significant need for selected groups of PWE in Zimbabwe to receive attention to psychosocial abilities and secondly that there are certain specific areas such as sexual functioning and the use of transport which deserve special attention. A much more detailed inventory of neuro-psychological tests will be of value to plan treatment strategies for those selected by the crude screening instruments used in this project. An important future comparison will be a survey of ADL and psychosocial functioning amongst PWE in rural communities, because it is uncertain whether PWE in rural communities are generally more or less disabled than those in the city...|$|E
