5|$|The {{inauguration of}} Ronald Reagan as {{president}} in 1981, ushered in an eight-year period of conservative {{leadership in the}} U.S. government. Under his leadership, the government pushed a conservative social agenda, including outlawing abortion, inserting prayer in schools, banning <b>pornography,</b> <b>and</b> resisting gay rights.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1970s, {{there were no}} federal laws {{specifically}} addressing the production, distribution or possession of child <b>pornography,</b> <b>and</b> it was readily available to those who sought it. While most was imported from European countries where it was legally produced in large quantities {{there was also a}} domestic industry.|$|E
5|$|Foreign comics, {{especially}} Japanese, {{became quite}} successful in Canada, and stood out for gaining {{large numbers of}} female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books. They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as child <b>pornography</b> <b>and</b> result in jail terms.|$|E
50|$|Erotic art, such as animal <b>pornography</b> in {{cartoons}} <b>and</b> the like, {{which does}} not require the recording of an actual sexual act, are not usually considered sex with animals by the law, and so their status depends upon more general laws such as legal limits upon obscenity or <b>pornography</b> alone, <b>and</b> the thin line between erotic art <b>and</b> <b>pornography.</b>|$|R

5|$|It {{was later}} {{discovered}} that Howard Cotterman boarded {{a flight to}} Mexico on April 9, 2007, with a final destination of Sydney, Australia. On April 11, 2007, Agent Owen was able to break the computer security and discovered 378 more images of child pornography. Cotterman was indicted on June 27, 2007 for several charges related to child <b>pornography</b> <b>and</b> unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He was arrested by Australian law officials and delivered to the U.S. Marshals Service on March 31, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Jim Dawson devoted {{an entire}} chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged {{flatulence}} in Mind Meld, which he compares {{to the sound}} of someone stepping on a tribble. G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching <b>pornography,</b> <b>and</b> compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 2007 at {{approximately}} 10 AM, Howard and Maureen Cotterman drove from Mexico to the Lukeville Port of Entry (POE). Upon arrival, the inspector checked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection electronic database {{and found a}} computer-generated alert, based upon Howard Cotterman's prior conviction for child sex crimes in 1992. The alert advised the inspector {{to be on the}} lookout for child <b>pornography</b> <b>and</b> due to the warning, the Cottermans were sent to a secondary inspection area.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year of the Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of <b>pornography</b> <b>and</b> other low-brow reality television programming. The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E
5|$|At a party, Bruce Wayne meets Debra Kane, a {{caseworker}} with Child Protective Services. He asks to {{join her}} while she visits clients. She agrees and shows him the varying degrees of child abuse she encounters {{in the course of}} her job. Wanting to understand the factors behind child abuse, Bruce, as Batman, breaks into Hellgate Prison and talks with an informant who points him to a child <b>pornography</b> <b>and</b> prostitution ring. Bruce's butler Alfred Pennyworth reveals that Bruce's mother, Martha Wayne, had been secretly investigating a similar child prostitution ring, and that the sex traffickers ordered the murders of Bruce's parents in order to silence her.|$|E
5|$|He {{would carry}} the day after federal {{prosecutors}} appealed for an en banc rehearing by the entire court, reiterating that point for an eight-judge majority and saying that unless Jacobson could demonstrate that a specifically protected right had been violated by the investigation, the conviction should stand. The majority also rejected the entrapment defense, arguing that the postal investigators had merely provided Jacobson with opportunities to purchase child <b>pornography</b> <b>and</b> not sought to affect his predisposition (an important element in entrapment under U.S. law) {{to do so in}} any way.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Striptease made news {{again when}} it was shown in a fourth-grade class in Chicago, Illinois. The teacher claimed the {{students}} chose the film, but he drew criticism since the film was risqué. (The violent 1996 film Scream was shown in the same school on the same day, causing further controversy.) In 2000 in Ireland, some viewers criticized the Radio Telefís Éireann for running Striptease. These viewers questioned the film's appropriateness and some considered it demeaning to women. However, the station felt it was not <b>pornography</b> <b>and</b> it was aired at night.|$|E
5|$|Nedim Gürsel {{wrote his}} 2001 novel Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul about a minor passage in Candide during which its protagonist meets Ahmed III, the deposed Turkish sultan. This chance meeting {{on a ship}} from Venice to Istanbul is the setting of Gürsel's book. Terry Southern, in writing his popular novel Candy with Mason Hoffenberg adapted Candide for a modern {{audience}} and changed the protagonist from male to female. Candy deals with the rejection of a sort of optimism which the author sees in women's magazines of the modern era; Candy also parodies <b>pornography</b> <b>and</b> popular psychology. This adaptation of Candide was itself adapted for the cinema by director Christian Marquand in 1968.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of Boys in the Sand, Casey Donovan became an {{underground}} celebrity. While he never achieved the mainstream film career {{for which he had}} hoped, he continued his career in <b>pornography</b> <b>and</b> translated his fame into some appearances on the legitimate stage, including a successful national tour in the gay-themed play Tubstrip and an unsuccessful attempt to produce a revival of The Ritz. His fame also allowed him success as a high-priced escort. He remained a bankable commodity in the adult industry, making films for the next fifteen years until his death from AIDS-related illness in 1987.|$|E

5|$|As {{the family}} gathers around the {{television}} {{to watch the}} local news, Lois states her fondness of the new co-anchor, Joyce Kinney. Later that day, the family attends church, and while there, Lois learns of a local bake sale, and decides to bring her own baked goods. Going to the store to buy ingredients, Lois notices Joyce shopping there as well, and approaches her. The two quickly become close friends, and they decide {{to spend the day}} together at the news studio. That night, Lois and Joyce decide to get a drink together, and share stories. Reluctant at first to tell Joyce her darkest secret, she soon reveals that she was in a porn film when she was in college in the early 1980s, before she met Peter. Expecting Joyce will keep it a secret, as she promised, she is shocked when the local news reveals her participation in the making of the <b>pornography,</b> <b>and</b> Lois is made a social outcast.|$|E
5|$|Many {{residents}} {{moved away}} from Bow Street after the theatre {{was established in the}} early 18th century. Life in the street declined and became known for <b>pornography</b> <b>and</b> prostitution. The publisher Edmund Curll lived at No.2 during this time, and by 1740 the street held 8 pubs, concealing a number of brothels. In 1833, the Commissioners of Woods, Forest and Land Revenues were looking to buy land on and around Bow Street, and discovered that James Robinson, lessee to the Duke of Bedford, was running a brothel there. In the following legal dispute, Robinson's legal team accused the Commissioner's surveyor of being prejudiced against prostitution. The building was demolished, but made little difference to the area's reputation. In 1844, a resident suggested the street should be renamed as a continuation of Wellington Street to distance itself from the reputation Bow Street had acquired.|$|E
