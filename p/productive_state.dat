40|$|Better {{understanding}} {{of how and why}} networks of open innovation and global participatory science communities form and evolve, and how they can be governed or influenced toward sustainable innovation and <b>productive</b> <b>states</b> are critical questions. To this end, a simulation-based exploratory study is conducted to better understand the conditions that confer increased rates of innovation in such socio-technical systems. Three types of open science communities are identified and simulated using agent simulation as a method of inquiry. Simulation results show that centrality, as a measure of degree of connectedness, exhibits positive influence for innovation output in exploratory and service communities up to a point. Also, utility-oriented communities have social network structures with low density and high centrality, suggesting high potential for innovation. ...|$|R

50|$|Following on {{the renewed}} {{interest}} in the African-American experience of slavery (as opposed to the white view of it) engendered by The Journal of Negro History after 1916, there were several efforts to record the remembrances of living former slaves. The earliest of these were two projects begun in 1929, one led by Charles S. Johnson at Fisk University and the other by John B. Cade at Southern University. One of Johnson's students, Lawrence D. Reddick, proposed a federally funded continuation of these efforts in 1934 through the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. This program, however, did not achieve its ambitious goals, and several years passed before narratives began to be collected again. Although {{some members of the}} Federal Writers' Project were aware of Reddick's project, the FWP slave narrative collection was more directly inspired by the folklore collections of John Lomax, and was pursued by Carolyn Dillard, director of the Georgia branch of the Writers' Project. A parallel project was then started in Florida with Lomax's participation, and the effort subsequently grew to cover all of the southern (except Louisiana) and several northern states. The most <b>productive</b> <b>state</b> project, in the end, was in Arkansas.|$|E
5000|$|Farmer-managed natural {{regeneration}} (FMNR) is a low-cost, sustainable land restoration technique used to combat poverty and hunger amongst poor subsistence farmers {{in developing countries}} by increasing food and timber production, and resilience to climate extremes. It involves the systematic regeneration and management of trees and shrubs from tree stumps, roots and seeds. [...] FMNR is especially applicable, but not restricted to, the dryland tropics. As well as returning degraded croplands and grazing lands to productivity, {{it can be used}} to restore degraded forests, thereby reversing biodiversity loss and reducing vulnerability to climate change. FMNR can also play an important role in maintaining not-yet-degraded landscapes in a <b>productive</b> <b>state,</b> especially when combined with other sustainable land management practices such as conservation agriculture on cropland and holistic management on rangelands. FMNR adapts centuries-old methods of woodland management, called coppicing and pollarding, to produce continuous tree-growth for fuel, building materials, food and fodder without the need for frequent and costly replanting. On farmland, selected trees are trimmed and pruned to maximise growth while promoting optimal growing conditions for annual crops (such as access to water and sunlight). When FMNR trees are integrated into crops and grazing pastures there is an increase in crop yields, soil fertility and organic matter, soil moisture and leaf fodder. There is also a decrease in wind and heat damage, and soil erosion.|$|E
50|$|Adam Smith notes this in The Wealth of Nations and it figures {{into the}} {{question}} of general equilibrium and the general glut controversy. In the general equilibrium model savings must equal investment for the economy to clear. The economy grows as division of labor increases productivity of laborers. This increased productivity in laborers creates a surplus that will be split between capitalists’ expenditure on goods for themselves and investment in other capital. The accumulation of saving and parsimony of capitalists leads to greater increases in capital {{which leads to a}} more <b>productive</b> <b>state.</b> Smith advocates this parsimony of profit as a virtue. Smith provides the example of the colonial United States for the positive relationship between the wage fund and investment in capital. He says that England is a much more wealthy economy than anywhere in America, however, he believes that the true wealth lies within the market for wage funds and the growth rate of the population. The colonies have a much higher wage rate than England due to a lower cost of provisions and necessities to survive, which result in a higher competition for human capital among the “masters” of the economy, which in turn raises the wage rate and increases the wage fund. The core of this phenomenon, is why Adam Smith believes in the savings investment identity. The reason why wages go up and there is competition between employers {{is the result of a}} constant influx of capital that is equal or greater to the rate in which the amount of labor increases.|$|E

To better understand the current dilemma, this paper considers the physical and material environments associated with 19 th century US tuberculosis mortality.

Occupations were also related with the physical environment and tuberculosis mortality, and workers in outdoor occupations, such as farmers and unskilled workers, were less likely than workers in other occupations to die from tuberculosis.

40|$|The {{association}} and dissociation of particles via specific anisotropic interactions {{is a fundamental}} process, both in biology (proteins) and in soft matter (colloidal patchy particles). The presence of alternative binding sites can lead to multiple <b>productive</b> <b>states</b> and also to non-productive “decoy” or intermediate states. Besides anisotropic interactions, particles can experience non-specific isotropic interactions. We employ single replica transition interface sampling to investigate how adding a non-productive binding site or a nonspecific isotropic interaction alters the dimerization kinetics of a generic patchy particle model. The addition of a decoy binding site reduces the association rate constant, independent of the site’s position, while adding an isotropic interaction increases it due to an increased rebinding probability. Surprisingly, the association kinetics becomes non-monotonic for a tetramer complex formed by multivalent patchy particles. While seemingly identical to twoparticle binding with a decoy state, the cooperativity of binding multiple particles leads to a kinetic optimum. Our results are relevant for the understanding and modeling of biochemical networks and self-assembly processes. Published by AIP Publishing. [URL]...|$|R
