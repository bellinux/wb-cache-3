40|$|We {{consider}} a polymer brush composed of end-grafted polymer chains. Classical theory advocates that a worsening of the solvent quality {{results in a}} smooth decrease of the brush height from a swollen to a dense brush. We report that a homogeneous brush under poor solvent conditions can have a negative surface pressure, indicating an instability in favour of lateral segregation. Also by using a two-gradient version of the self-consistent field (SCF) theory we show that, in contradiction to the classical result, but {{in line with the}} negative pressure, the collapse transition for laterally mobile chains has a first-order character, exemplified by the presence of a compact brush that coexists with a dilute gas of end-grafted chains. The dense brush assumes a pancake shape wherein the chains balance the stretching entropy against surface energies. The height of the pancake scales sub-linearly with the chain length because the local grafting density decreases with increasing chain length. In analogy with wetting studies we discuss how the spreading parameter has an influence on the <b>pancake</b> <b>structure.</b> Accordingly, the height increases with worsening of the solvent quality and decreases with increased affinity for the substrate.

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} for {{understanding}} nonlinear mechanisms at {{early stages of}} turbulence, when the flow is not yet affected by viscosity.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well-known}} that strongly stratified flows are organized into a layered <b>pancake</b> <b>structure</b> in which motions are mostly horizontal but highly {{variable in the}} vertical direction. However, what determines the vertical scale of the motion remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a scaling law for this vertical scale Lu when no vertical lengthscales are imposed by initial or boundary conditions and when the fluid is strongly stratified, i. e., when the horizontal Froude number is small: Fh=U/NLh " 1, where U is {{the magnitude of the}} horizontal velocity, N the Brunt-Vïsälä frequency and Lh the horizontal lengthscale. Specifically, we show that the vertical scale of the motion is Lv=U/N by demonstrating that the inviscid governing equations in the limit Fh?O, without any a priori assumption on the magnitude of Lu, are self-similar with respect to the variable zN/U, where z is the vertical coordinate. This self-similarity fully accounts for the layer characteristics observed in recent studies reporting spontaneous layering from an initially vertically uniform flow. For such a fine vertical scale, vertical gradients are large, O(1 /FhLh). Therefore, even if the magnitude of the vertical velocity is small and scales like FhU, the leading order governing equations of these strongly stratified flows are not two-dimensional in contradiction with a previous conjecture. The self-similarity further suggests that the vertical spectrum of horizontal kinetic energy of pancake turbulence should be of the form E(kz) ?N 2 kz- 3, giving an alternative explanation for the observed vertical spectra in the atmosphere and oceans. © 2001 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|Temperature data {{derived from}} the {{cryogenic}} limb array etalon spectrometer (CLAES) on board the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) are used to investigate planetary-scale temperature disturbances near the equatorial stratopause for January 1992 to May 1993. The disturbances are characterized by vertically stacked temperature extrema of alternating sign with a vertical scale of about 10 km and have a localized and stationary nature in the longitudinal direction with persistence of about 1 week. These are nearly identical to so-called “pancake structures” first identified by Hitchman et al. [1987] {{using data from the}} limb infrared monitor of the stratosphere (LIMS). Their analysis suggested that pancake structures are consistent with those predicted by inertial instability theory and that their appearance is synchronized with strong planetary waves in the winter midlatitude, though the LIMS observations were made only during the northern winter. Using the CLAES data for about 14 months, this study shows that pancake structures occur not only during the northern winter but also during the southern winter. In addition, it is found that an equatorial <b>pancake</b> <b>structure</b> has its counterpart with reversed phase in the winter midlatitude, suggesting clear evidence for inertial instability. Further analyses on the basis of Ertel's potential vorticity show that inertially unstable regions intrude locally far into the winter hemisphere around pancake structures that appear when planetary wave breaking is going on. This implies a mechanism of localized inertial instability and resulting pancake structures caused by midlatitude planetary waves in the winter hemisphere, as some numerical studies have inferred...|$|E
40|$|We {{perform the}} {{systematic}} numerical study of high vorticity structures that {{develop in the}} 3 D incompressible Euler equations from generic large-scale initial conditions. We observe that a multitude of high vorticity structures appear {{in the form of}} thin vorticity sheets (pancakes). Our analysis reveals the self-similarity of the pancakes evolution, which is governed by two different exponents e^-t/T_ℓ and e^t/T_ω describing compression in the transverse direction and the vorticity growth respectively, with the universal ratio T_ℓ/T_ω≈ 2 / 3. We relate development of these structures to the gradual formation of the Kolmogorov energy spectrum E_k∝ k^- 5 / 3, which we observe in a fully inviscid system. With the spectral analysis we demonstrate that the energy transfer to small scales is performed through the <b>pancake</b> <b>structures,</b> which accumulate in the Kolmogorov interval of scales and evolve according to the scaling law ω_∝ℓ^- 2 / 3 for the local vorticity maximums ω_ and the transverse pancake scales ℓ.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review a {{recently}} developed approximate method for investigation of dynamics of compressible ellipsoidal figures. Collapse and subsequent behaviour are {{described by a}} system of ordinary differential equations for time evolution of semi-axes of a uniformly rotating, three-axis, uniform-density ellipsoid. First, we apply this approach to investigate dynamic stability of non-spherical bodies. We solve the equations that describe, in a simplified way, the Newtonian dynamics of a self-gravitating non-rotating spheroidal body. We find that, after loss of stability, a contraction to a singularity occurs only in a pure spherical collapse, and deviations from spherical symmetry prevent the contraction to the singularity through a stabilizing action of nonlinear non-spherical oscillations. The development of instability leads {{to the formation of}} a regularly or chaotically oscillating body, in which dynamical motion prevents the formation of the singularity. We find regions of chaotic and regular pulsations by constructing a Poincare diagram. A real collapse occurs after damping of the oscillations because of energy losses, shock wave formation or viscosity. We use our approach to investigate approximately the first stages of collapse during the large scale structure formation. The theory of this process started from ideas of Ya. B. Zeldovich, concerning the formation of strongly non-spherical structures during nonlinear stages of the development of gravitational instability, known as 'Zeldovich's pancakes'. In this paper the collapse of non-collisional dark matter and the formation of <b>pancake</b> <b>structures</b> are investigated approximately. We estimate an emission of very long gravitational waves during the collapse, and discuss the possibility of gravitational lensing and polarization of the cosmic microwave background by these waves.

40|$|We perform {{two-dimensional}} and three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations {{to study}} cold clouds accelerated by radiation pressure on {{dust in the}} environment of rapidly star-forming galaxies dominated by infrared flux. We utilize the reduced speed of light approximation to solve the frequency-averaged, time-dependent radiative transfer equation. We find that radiation pressure is capable of accelerating the clouds to hundreds of kilometers per second while remaining dense and cold, consistent with observations. We compare these results to simulations where acceleration is provided by entrainment in a hot wind, where the momentum injection of the hot flow {{is comparable to the}} momentum in the radiation field. We find that the survival time of the cloud accelerated by the radiation field is significantly longer than that of a cloud entrained in a hot outflow. We show that the dynamics of the irradiated cloud depends on the initial optical depth, temperature of the cloud, and the intensity of the flux. Additionally, gas pressure from the background may limit cloud acceleration if the density ratio between the cloud and background is ≲ 10 ^ 2. In general, a 10 pc-scale optically thin cloud forms a <b>pancake</b> <b>structure</b> elongated perpendicular to the direction of motion, while optically thick clouds form a filamentary structure elongated parallel to the direction of motion. The details of accelerated cloud morphology and geometry can also be affected by other factors, such as the cloud lengthscale, the reduced speed of light approximation, spatial resolution, initial cloud structure, and the dimensionality of the run, but these have relatively little affect on the cloud velocity or survival time.

40|$|Filaments, {{forming in}} the context of cosmological {{structure}} formation, are not only supposed to host the majority of the baryons at low redshifts {{in the form of the}} WHIM, but also to supply forming galaxies at higher redshifts with a substantial amount of cold gas via cold steams. In order to get insight into the hydro- and thermodynamical characteristics of these structures, we performed a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Instead of analyzing extensive simulations of cosmological structure formation, we simulate certain well-defined structures and study the impact of different physical processes as well as of the scale dependencies. In this paper, we continue our work from Klar & Mücket (2010), and extend our simulations into three dimensions. Instead of a <b>pancake</b> <b>structure,</b> we now obtain a configuration consisting of well-defined sheets, filaments, and a gaseous halo. We use a set of simulations, parametrized by the length of the initial perturbation L, to obtain detailed information on the state of the gas and its evolution inside the filament. For L > 4 Mpc, we obtain filaments which are fully confined by an accretion shock. Additionally, they exhibit an isothermal core, which temperature is balanced by radiative cooling and heating due to the UV background. This indicates on a multiphase structure for the medium temperature WHIM. We obtain scaling relations for the main quantities of this core. In the vicinity of the halo, the filament's core can be attributed to the cold streams found in cosmological hydro-simulations. Thermal conduction can lead to a complete evaporation of the cold stream for L > 6 Mpc/h. This corresponds to halos more massive than M_halo = 10 ^ 13 M_Sun, and implies that star-formation in more massive galaxies can not be supplied by cold streams. For perturbations on scales L > 6 Mpc/h the filament does not longer exhibit a cold core. Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E
40|$|Rocketsonde {{observations}} at Kwajalein (8. 7 °N, 167. 7 °E) {{were used}} for investigation of horizontal wind disturbances induced by inertial instability. Two characteristic cases {{were found in the}} 1978 – 1979 northern winter during which the limb infrared monitor of the stratosphere (LIMS) made observations. In both the cases the eastward component and the northward component of horizontal winds are negatively correlated in the vertical direction near the stratopause level, which is thought to be due to inertial instability. The wind disturbances have a wavelength of about 10 km, and their maximum amplitudes are estimated as over 10 ms− 1. Examinations of the LIMS temperatures support a possibility that the wind disturbances are induced by inertial instability. It was revealed that temperature disturbances characteristic of inertial instability, called “pancake structures, ” appear in the same height and time as the wind disturbances do. The relationship between the rocketsonde wind disturbances and the LIMS <b>pancake</b> <b>structures</b> is 90 ° out of phase, as expected by the theory of inertial instability. In addition, it was confirmed that the two inertial instability events follow enhancements of the midlatitude planetary wave. This is consistent with a mechanism of the inertially unstable disturbances in the equatorial region inferred in some observational and numerical studies. Analyses of rocketsonde data were extended to the entire observation period at Kwajalein, which suggests that the occurrence of inertially unstable disturbances is biased toward the winter season. However, at some other stations in the tropics, wind disturbances which may be induced by inertial instability do not appear so frequently as they do at Kwajalein. This seasonality and regionality of inertially unstable disturbances would be due to the seasonality and regionality of planetary wave breakings at midlatitude...|$|R

The Zel'dovich approximation shows that under gravitational instability the velocity eld of the initial perturbations in the universe induces a random network structure, traced by the `ridges' of dark matter (DM) Zel'dovich <b>pancakes</b> or sheet-like <b>structures.</b> The approximate analytic solution of Paper 1 shows that the mean free path or mean separation of DM pancakes is 5 h 1 Mpc. Hence, this is a characteristic scale of large-scale structure (LSS) as opposed to the 50 { 100 h 1 Mpc scale of superlarge-scale structure (SLSS). The `modulation' of the network structure by the gravitational potential produces on SLSS scales DM underdense regions, which are predicted to correspond to the `voids' seen in the observed galaxy distribution. Our aims in this paper are to explore the usefulness of our `core sampling' analysis for a quantitative `empirical' description of the evolution of structure in N-body simulations and to test the theory of Paper I by comparing its prediction with the `core sampling measurement' of the mean free path between DM LSS elements in an N-body simulation. Six simulations in all were used and `measurements' made at several dierent epochs for each simulation. For such DM particle catalogues, we need to also introduce a heuristic model for the mass function of large-scale structure elements in a core sample, involving a new parameter, fsm, the fraction of mass in `supermassive' clumps, which then measures the degree of structure evolution in a simulation.
