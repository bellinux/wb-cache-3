5|$|The {{following}} day the violence continued to spread, and Chinese <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hospital were taken outside and killed. Attempts to extinguish fires in areas devastated the preceding day failed, and the flames increased in vigour, and continued until 12October. Meanwhile, {{a group of}} 800 Dutch soldiers and 2,000 natives assaulted Kampung Gading Melati, {{where a group of}} Chinese survivors were holding up under the leadership of Khe Pandjang. Although the Chinese evacuated to nearby Paninggaran, they were later driven out of the area by Dutch forces. There were approximately 450 Dutch and 800 Chinese casualties in the two attacks.|$|E
5|$|When an {{outbreak}} of noma (a gangrenous bacterial disease of the mouth and face) struck the Romani camp in 1943, Mengele initiated a study to {{determine the cause of}} the disease and develop a treatment. He enlisted the aid of prisoner Dr. Berthold Epstein, a Jewish pediatrician and professor at Prague University. Mengele isolated the <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate barrack and had several afflicted children killed so that their preserved heads and organs could be sent to the SS Medical Academy in Graz and other facilities for study. The research was still ongoing when the Romani camp was liquidated and its remaining occupants killed in 1944.|$|E

5|$|In the Soviet times, mental {{hospitals}} were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, {{a human rights}} activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who {{have been living in}} a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the total}} {{radioactivity}} of {{a dose of}} I-131 is usually high, and because the local beta radiation of nearby stomach tissue from an undissolved capsule is high, I-131 is usually administered to human <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small drink containing a few ounces of fluid(or alternatively in Capsule form). Liquid form administration is often slowly and carefully sucked out of a shielded container to prevent spillage.

25|$|The most {{important}} duty of a psychiatric nurse {{is to maintain}} a positive therapeutic relationship with <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clinical setting. The fundamental elements of mental health care revolve around the interpersonal relations and interactions established between professionals and clients. Caring for people with mental illnesses demands an intensified presence and {{a strong desire to}} be supportive. Dziopa and Ahern assert that there are nine critical mental health aspects of the psychiatric nursing practicum: understanding and empathy, individuality, providing support, being there/being available, being 'genuine', promoting equality, demonstrating respect, demonstrating clear boundaries, and demonstrating self-awareness for the patient.|$|E
25|$|In adults, {{particularly}} {{those living in}} areas with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (which normally inhabits the stomach wall and {{has been associated with}} peptic ulcers), identification and treatment of this infection has been shown to improve platelet counts in a third of <b>patients.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> fifth, the platelet count normalized completely; this response rate is similar to that found in treatment with rituximab, which is more expensive and less safe. In children, this approach is not supported by evidence, except in high prevalence areas. Urea breath testing and stool antigen testing perform better than serology-based tests; moreover, serology may be false-positive after treatment with IVIG.|$|E
