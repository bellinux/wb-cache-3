500|$|Artificial {{respiration}} and the blowing {{of smoke}} into the lungs or the rectum {{were thought to}} be interchangeably useful, but the smoke enema was considered the most potent method, due to its supposed warming and stimulating properties. [...] The Dutch experimented with methods of inflating the lungs, as a treatment for those who had fallen into their canals and apparently drowned. [...] Patients were also given rectal infusions of tobacco smoke, as a respiratory stimulant. [...] Richard Mead was among the first Western scholars to recommend tobacco smoke enemas to resuscitate victims of drowning, when in 1745 he recommended tobacco glysters to treat iatrogenic drowning caused by immersion therapy. [...] His name was cited in one of the earliest documented cases of resuscitation by rectally applied tobacco smoke, from 1746, when a seemingly drowned woman was treated. [...] On the advice of a passing sailor, the woman's husband inserted the stem of the sailor's pipe into her rectum, covered the bowl with a piece of <b>perforated</b> <b>paper,</b> and [...] "blew hard". [...] The woman was apparently revived.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, the term {{hurdy-gurdy}} was also {{applied to a}} small, portable [...] "barrel organ" [...] (a cranked box instrument {{with a number of}} organ pipes, a bellows and a barrel with pins that rotated and programmed the tunes) that was frequently played by poor buskers (street musicians). Barrel organs require only the turning of the crank to play; the music is coded by pinned barrels, <b>perforated</b> <b>paper</b> rolls, and more recently by electronic modules. The French call the barrel organ the Orgue de Barbarie ("Barbary organ"), and the Germans Drehorgel ("turned organ"), instead of Drehleier ("turning lyre").|$|E
50|$|Artists {{working in}} the stamp art medium often employ {{fixed-line}} perforators {{as part of the}} creation process. Most functional and sought-after of these machines are cast-iron, pedal-operated devices manufactured beginning in the 1880s by bindery equipment makers like F.P Rosback Co. and Latham Machinery Co. Rosback also produced table-top perforators, but surviving models are exceedingly rare. Other methods for <b>perforating</b> <b>paper</b> to resemble stamp sheets have generally proven unsatisfactory. Such alternative methods used include using sewing machines, sewing pounces, leather punches, modified veterinary needles, and speciality scissors. Some owners of pedal-operated or motorized perforators sell pre-perforated <b>paper</b> and offer <b>perforating</b> services for a fee.|$|R

2500|$|The {{instrument}} used rolls of <b>perforated</b> <b>paper.</b> Most of the rolls had five tunes on them, the popular tunes of the day. Individual tunes {{could not be}} selected. [...] Over time, the Mills Novelty Company produced approximately 3,121 different rolls. Each arrangement of a song was identified by a unique number. Some songs appear {{on more than one}} rolls. Attempts have been made to produce a complete [...] "rollography" [...] for the Violano-Virtuoso. A list has been produced that covers {{more than half of the}} different rolls that were ever produced. Rolls 1 to about 1000 [...] and 1800 to 2500 are well documented. Information between rolls 1000 and 1800 is very sparse and it may be that these roll numbers were never used.|$|E

40|$|Apparatus {{suitable}} for measuring gas diffusion capacity of cigarette paper was assembled and evaluated. The apparatus provides semi-automated means {{for measuring the}} concentration of carbon dioxide diffusing through a small area of the paper, and computation of a paper thickness-dependent diffusion capacity of the sample. Measurements are rapid and {{can be made in}} about 30 s. Diffusion capacity measurements were repeatable and reproducible to within about 1 %. Variability of the diffusion capacity values was much lower than that observed for permeability measurements. For these reasons, the apparatus is useful for quality assessment and research applications. Diffusion capacity was measured for cigarette papers of inherent permeability ranging from 6 to 62 cm/min. As expected from prevailing theory, the diffusion capacity values generally increased with permeability. The diffusion capacity measured for electrostatically <b>perforated</b> <b>papers</b> was only slightly higher (about 6 - 11 %) than the unperforated base paper despite large increases in permeability. This result indicates that diffusion capacity is governed by small pores in the paper. The apparatus is capable of measuring banded areas of papers designed for reduced ignition propensity. Diffusion capacity values for banded areas were lower than those of non-banded paper of similar permeability, suggesting that the band material preferentially occludes small pores in the paper...|$|R

5000|$|Techniques for the {{creation}} of artistamps may include <b>perforating</b> the <b>paper</b> to resemble a traditional perforated stamp, as well as applying gum to the reverse side of the paper. Self-adhesive paper is also used. The image represented on the stamp may be hand-drawn or painted, lithographed or offset-printed, photographed, photocopied, etched, engraved, silk-screened, rubber stamped, or produced on a digital inkjet or laser printer. While the method of production is entirely the choice of the artist, creators who exclusively or primarily use rubber stamps are occasionally held in contempt by members of the artistamp community, some of whom refer to such producers as [...] "bunny-stampers." ...|$|R

50|$|This material, {{known as}} Perforated card-board at the time, first became {{available}} in the 1820s as plain sheets used {{for the creation of}} bookmarks and small mottoes and sayings, often taken from the Bible. By the 1870s the Victorian craze for this inexpensive and versatile craft material was at its peak. The invention of new printing processes made the pre-printing of mottoes and bookmarks on the <b>perforated</b> <b>paper</b> possible. These items were extremely popular and original examples, in good condition, can still be found today. The Victorian fad of embroidering mottoes on <b>perforated</b> <b>paper</b> died out around 1910 and was virtually lost as a needleart until recently being rediscovered. <b>Perforated</b> <b>paper</b> {{as we know it today}} was invented by Justin Ruble of Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|The first {{important}} {{improvement of}} the draw loom took place in 1725, when Basile Bouchon introduced the principle of applying a <b>perforated</b> band of <b>paper.</b> A continuous roll of paper was punched by hand, in sections, each of which represented one lash or tread, {{and the length of}} the roll was determined by the number of shots in each repeat of pattern. The Jacquard machine subsequently evolved from this.|$|R
5000|$|A {{paper towel}} {{is a piece}} of paper that can be used once as a towel and then be {{disposed}} of. A <b>perforated</b> roll of <b>paper</b> towels is normally mounted on a rod a little longer than the width of the roll, or in an alternative type of hanger that has protrusions on ears, the protrusions fitting into the ends of the paper towel roll. Paper towels can also be found packaged like facial tissues, as individual folded sheets.|$|R

Three days were spent producing a saxophone sound from an electric guitar; each note of a guitar solo was recorded separately and faded in on the track, which was then sent through a speaker and out of a rubber hose with <b>perforated</b> cigarette <b>paper</b> at the end. Enough pressure was displaced by forcing the sound through the holes of the cigarette paper to give the rasp of a saxophone.|$|R

5000|$|In both {{instruments}} {{the signals}} are sent {{by means of}} a <b>perforated</b> ribbon of <b>paper</b> but the cable sender was the more complicated, because the cable signals are formed by both positive and negative currents, and not merely by a single current, whether positive or negative.

The aftercurrent had the effect of [...] "curbing" [...] its precursor.|$|R
5000|$|Dillbohner's thematic, {{site-specific}} installations generally meld painting, {{various forms}} of assemblage, and works on and made of paper to create what one curator has termed [...] "landscapes of the psyche". An installation inspired by Nepalese honey hunters, The Honey Gatherers (1993), featured large suspended conical forms, sheets of beeswax-impregnated rice paper covering the windows, and assemblages of burlap, felt, coal, rusted metal, and other materials. A series of installations entitled Sippwells in the early 2000s, inspired by Australian Aboriginal culture, featured encaustic paintings and large hanging sheets of <b>perforated</b> waxed <b>paper,</b> while the titular sip wells (depressions scraped in damp sand) were represented by shallow clay bowls set out {{in a row in}} a layer of crushed charcoal.

40|$|Homogenization {{theory is}} the study of the {{asymptotic}} behaviour of solutionsto partial differential equations where high frequency oscillations occur. In the case of a perforated domain the oscillations are due to variations in thedomain of the equation. The four articles that constitute this thesis are devotedto obstacle problems in <b>perforated</b> domains. <b>Paper</b> A treats an optimalcontrol problem where the objective is to control the solution to the obstacleproblem by the choice of obstacle. The optimal obstacle in the perforated domain,as well as its homogenized limit, are characterized in terms of certainauxiliary problems they solve. In papers B,C and D the authors solve homogenizationproblems in a perforated domain where the perforation is definedas the intersection between a periodic perforation and a hyper plane. Thetheory of uniform distribution is an indespensible tool in the analysis of theseproblems. Paper B treats the obstacle problem for the Laplace operator andthe authors use correctors to derive a homogenized equation. Paper D is ageneralization of paper B to the p-Laplacian. The authors employ capacitytechniques which are well adapted to the problem. In Paper C the obstaclevaries on the same scale as the perforations.

40|$|Scale {{deposition}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important and serious problems which water injection systems are generally engaged in. Scale sometimes limits or blocks oil and gas production by plugging the oil-producing formation matrix or fractures and the <b>perforated</b> intervals. This <b>paper</b> presents a summary of the laboratory measurements of the solubility of common oil field scales in synthetic brines (formation water and sea water) of high-barium and high-salinity formation waters at 40 to 90 °C and atmospheric pressure. The experimental results confirm the general trend in solubility dependencies for common oil field scales at these conditions. At higher temperatures the deposition of CaCO 3, CaSO 4 and SrSO 4 scale increases and the deposition of BaSO 4 scale decreases since the solubilities of CaCO 3, CaSO 4 and SrSO 4 scales decreases and the solubility of BaSO 4 increases with increasing temperature...|$|R
40|$|In {{the view}} {{to develop an}} {{innovative}} system {{for the prevention of}} insect damages to food packs, repellency and perforation ability tests were performed to evaluate the effects of two essential oils (basil and vetiver) and of an azadiractin based formulation on the stored product pests Rhizopertha dominica, Sitophilus oryzae, Tribolium castaneum and Stegobium paniceum. Repellency was tested by means of Petri dishes lined with filter paper where a half was treated with the test substance and the other half left untreated. The position of 10 insects was recorded after 1, 2, 4 hrs and repellency indexes were compared. Perforation ability trials were carried out using an especially designed apparatus where 5 insects had to <b>perforate</b> a <b>paper</b> layer treated with the test substance in order to reach the food. Latency to perforation and mortality were recorded. All substances were tested at 3 concentrations (1, 5, 10 ml/m 2). From repellency trials emerged that vetiver oil was repellent for all species even at the lowest concentration; basil oil was attractive for almost all species except R. dominica; the azadiractin based product was slightly repellent for T. castaneum, slightly attractive for R. dominica and toxic to S. paniceum. Perforation ability trials were performed only on R. dominica, whose penetrating capacity was reduced by all substances, especially at the highest concentrations, and on S. oryzae, where only vetiver oil showed an evident inhibitory effect to perforation...|$|R
