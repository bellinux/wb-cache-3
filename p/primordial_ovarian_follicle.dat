40|$|Infections of {{the uterus}} or mammary gland with Gram-negative {{bacteria}} cause infertility in cattle, not only during disease but also for some time afterward. Even though these infections are in organs distant from the ovary, metritis and mastitis perturb antral follicle development and function in vivo. Although granulosa cells from antral follicles express toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), and detect and mount an inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, {{it is not known}} whether LPS impacts preantral follicle development. The present study tested the hypothesis that LPS perturbs the development of primordial ovarian follicles. Exposure of bovine ovarian cortex ex vivo to LPS reduced the primordial follicle pool associated with increased primordial follicle activation. Ovarian cortex culture supernatants accu-mulated the inflammatory mediators IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, and IL- 8 in an LPS concentration-dependent manner. In addition, LPS exposure modulated key intracellular regulators of follicle activation with loss of the primordial follicle PTEN and cytoplasmic translocation of FOXO 3. Acute exposure of mice in vivo to LPS also reduced the primordial follicle pool associated with increased follicle atresia. The increased follicle atresia was TLR 4 -dependent as Tlr 4 -deficient mice were insensitive to LPS-mediated follicle atresia. However, LPS did not affect the diameter of individually cultured bovine second-ary follicles or their enclosed oocytes. In conclusion, LPS reduced the <b>primordial</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> pool in the bovine ovarian cortex ex vivo and in the murine ovary in vivo. These observations provide an insight into how bacterial infections distant from the ovary have long term effects on fertility. immunity, infection, inflammation, lipopolysaccharide, ovarian cortex, ovarian follicle, ovary, toll-like recepto...|$|E

Under the same condition, control serum-treated testicular cells primarily yielded cylindrical tubular structures that can be very long. Over a critical range, concentrations of H-Y antibody apparently influenced the frequency of testicular folliculoid formation.

40|$|Background: <b>Primordial</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles,</b> {{which are}} often present in the ovaries of {{premature}} ovarian failure (POF) patients or are cryopreserved from the ovaries of young cancer patients who are undergoing gonadotoxic anticancer therapies, cannot be used to generate mature oocytes for in vitro fertilization (IVF). There has been very little success in triggering growth of primordial follicles to obtain fertilizable oocytes due to the poor understanding of the biology of primordial follicle activation. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have recently reported that PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) prevents primordial follicle activation in mice, and deletion of Pten from the oocytes of primordial follicles leads to follicular activation. Consequently, the PTEN inhibitor has been successfully used in vitro to activate primordial follicles in both mouse and human ovaries.

The current {{study examined the}} ability of dioxin (2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo[p]dioxin, TCDD) to promote epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and DNA methylation epimutations in sperm. Gestating F 0 generation females were exposed to dioxin during fetal day 8 to 14 and adult-onset disease was evaluated in F 1 and F 3 generation rats.

40|$|AIM: GATA {{proteins}} are {{a family}} of zinc finger transcription factors regulating gene expression, differentiation and proliferation in various tissues. The expression of GATA- 4 and FOG- 2, one of its modulators, was studied in pediatric Sex Cord-Stromal tumors of the ovary, in order to evaluate their potential role as diagnostic markers and prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and histological data of 15 patients, enrolled into the TREP Project since 2000 were evaluated. When available, immunostaines for FOG- 2, GATA- 4, α-Inhibin, Vimentin and Pancytokeratin were also analyzed. RESULTS: In our series there were 6 Juvenile Granulosa Cell Tumors (JGCT), 6 Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumors (SLCT), 1 Cellular Fibroma, 1 Theca Cell Tumor and 1 Stromal Sclerosing Tumor (SST). Thirteen patients obtained a complete remission (CR), 1 reached a second CR after the removal of a metachronous tumor and 1 died of disease. Inhibin was detectable in 11 / 15, Vimentin in 13 / 15, Pancytokeratin in 6 / 15, GATA- 4 in 5 / 13 and FOG- 2 in 11 / 15. FOG- 2 was highly expressed in 5 / 6 JGCT, while GATA- 4 was weakly detectable only in 1 of the cases. SLCT expressed diffusely FOG- 2 (4 / 6) and GATA- 4 (3 / 5). GATA- 4 and FOG- 2 were detected in fibroma and thecoma {{but not in the}} SST. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric granulosa tumors appear to express a FOG- 2 /GATA- 4 phenotype in keeping with <b>primordial</b> <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles.</b> High expression of GATA- 4 does not correlate with aggressive behaviour as seen in adults, but it is probably involved in cell proliferation its absence can be associated with the better outcome of JGCT. SLCTs replicate the phenotype of Sertoli cells during embryogenesis in normal testis. In this group, the lack of expression of FOG- 2 in tumors in advanced stages might reveal a hypothetical role in inhibiting GATA- 4 cell proliferation pathway. In fibroma/thecoma group GATA- 4 and FOG- 2 point out the abnormal activation of GATA pathway and might be involved in the onset of these tumors...|$|R

40|$|Female mammals {{are born}} with a nite number of <b>ovarian</b> <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> that cannot be regenerated; thus, {{chemicals}} that destroy oocytes contained in these follicles can produce premature ovarian failure (early menopuase in women). Exposure of women to known ovotoxicants, such as contaminants in cigarette smoke, is associated with early menopause. Thus, the potential risks posed by ovotoxic chemicals is of concern. Our {{studies have focused on}} the environmental chemical 4 -vinylcyclohexene (VCH), which is produced during the manufacture of rubber tires, ame retardants, insecticides, plasticizers, and antioxidants. Dosing of female rats and mice with the ovotoxic diepoxide metabolite of VCH, 4 -vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD), for 30 days destroyed the majority of <b>ovarian</b> <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles.</b> Using VCD in rats as a generalized model for ovotoxicity, we determined that 1) repeated daily dosing is required, 2) cell death is via apoptosis, and 3) altered expression of speci c genes is involved. An integrated approach at the morphologic, biochemical, and molecular level was used to support these conclusions. Studies in isolated rat small preantral follicles (targeted for VCD-induced ovotoxicity) focused on the role of cell death genes, mitochondrion-associated events, and VCD metabolism.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{ultrastructure}} of human <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> after cryopreservation and short-term xenografting. DESIGN: Prospective experimental study. SETTING: Academic gynecology and anatomy research units. PATIENT(S) : Ovarian cortical biopsy specimens {{were obtained from}} 13 patients. INTERVENTION(S) : Each ovarian biopsy specimen was dissected into pieces of 1 mm(3) and divided into three groups: [1] fresh tissue, [2] frozen-thawed tissue, and [3] frozen-thawed tissue xenografted onto the peritoneum of nude mice for 3 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Follicular ultrastructure was assessed by light and transmission electron microscopy in [1] fresh, [2] frozen, and [3] frozen-grafted tissue. RESULT(S) : Thirty-five <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> were analyzed by light and transmission electron microscopy. Twenty-five <b>primordial</b> and primary <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> were found. Most of them exhibited ultrastructurally well preserved features (fresh [N = 8 / 10], frozen [N = 7 / 10], and frozen-grafted [N = 4 / 5] tissue). Ten secondary follicles were present in xenografts. By transmission electron microscopy, all the healthy-looking secondary follicles (70 %) were shown to contain intact oocytes, with features typical of earlier developmental stages, surrounded by several layers of follicular cells.

40|$|Abstract. Gonadectomy is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used method for permanent contra-ception in small animals. The irreversibility of the method is however a main drawback for its use in valuable breeding animals. Moreover, several negative side effects can be observed after surgical castration. Therefore several non-surgical methods were developed. This paper describes the current non-surgical methods of contraception used in female dogs and cats. They include hormonal procedures, such as application of progestins, androgens and GnRH analogues in order to prevent the ovarian cycle. Another method is the use of 4 –vinylcyclohexene diepoxide, an industrial chemical destroying <b>primordial</b> and primary <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles.</b> Further prospective possibilities consist in immunocontraception and in the elaboration of a safe and effective vaccine with reversible effect.

40|$|The <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> develop {{initially}} from primordial follicles. The {{majority of}} <b>ovarian</b> <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> are maintained quiescently as a reserve for the reproductive life span. Only {{a few of}} them are activated and develop to an advanced follicular stage. The maintenance of dormancy and activation of primordial follicles are controlled by coordinated actions of a suppressor/activator with close communications with somatic cells and intra-oocyte signaling pathways. Many growth factors and signaling pathways have been identified and the transforming growth factorbeta superfamily plays important roles in early folliculogenesis. However, the mechanism of maintaining the dormancy and survival of primordial follicles has remained unknown for decades. Recently, since the first finding that all primordial follicles are activated prematurely in mice deficient forkhead box O 3 a, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) signaling pathway was reported to be important in the regulation of dormancy and initial follicular activation.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{identify}} correlates and {{longitudinal changes}} in circulating antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels {{as a marker}} of <b>ovarian</b> <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> recruitment in normal peripubertal girls. DesignObservational study using mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses. SettingNot applicable. Patient(s) Unselected girls assessed at ages 7 – 11 years. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) AMH, inhibin B, and FSH levels were analyzed in blood samples collected at ages 7, 9, and 11 years for longitudinal analyses and at age 8 years for cross-sectional analyses. Result(s) In the cross-sectional analysis, AMH levels at age 8 years were lower in pubertal girls (median 25. 0 pmol/L, interquartile range [IQR] 16. 0 – 33. 9; n = 39) than in prepubertal girls (33. 5 pmol/L, IQR 22. 3 – 49. 1; n = 342). In prepubertal girls, higher AMH levels were associated with higher inhibin B levels, lower FSH levels, and larger body mass index at age 8 years and subsequently with later age at menarche. AMH levels were unrelated to birth weight or birth length. In the longitudinal analysis, AMH levels increased between ages 7 (median 27. 0 pmol/L, IQR 19. 2 – 34) and 9 years (32. 0 pmol/L, IQR 26. 5 – 42. 7), then declined between 9 and 11 years (26. 5 pmol/L, IQR 19 – 42. 25) with high intraindividual correlation in AMH levels between ages 7 and 9 years and 7 and 11 years.

An increase in pulsatile secretion of LH and greater circulating concentrations of 17 β-estradiol were observed when estrous synchronization treatments were compared to midluteal phase of the estrous cycle. Greater doses of MGA than those typically used in estrous synchrony protocols did not suppress LH and 17 β-estradiol to the same extent as progesterone from CL. Greater pulsatile secretion of LH resulting from use of estrous synchrony treatments induces development of persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> which may compromise fertility in cattle. Persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> have greater concentrations of 17 β-estradiol and less activity of IGFBPs in follicular fluid than normally growing <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles.</b> Therefore, greater LH pulse frequency and possibly less activity of IGFBPs in follicular fluid may facilitate the growth of persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> and reduce fertility in cattle.

The greater release of LH pulses results in enhanced secretion of 17 β-estradiol from persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles.</b> The greater frequency of LH release or the greater secretion of 17 β-estradiol associated with development of persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> probably contributes to the reduced fertility that occurs when progestins are used to synchronize stage of the estrous cycle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of an electromagnetic field (EMF), generated close to the ovaries, on primordial follicles. A total of 16 rats were used in this study. The study group consisted of rats exposed to an EMF in the abdominal region for 15  min/d for 15 days. Both the study and control group were composed of eight rats. After the treatment period of 15 days, the ovaries of the rats were extracted, and sections of ovarian tissue were taken for histological evaluation. The independent samples t test was used to compare the two groups. In the study group, the means of the right and left <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> numbers were 34. 00  ±  10. 20 and 36. 00  ±  10. 53, respectively. The average total <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> number was 70. 00  ±  19. 03. In the control group, the means of the right and left <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> numbers were 78. 50  ±  25. 98 and 71. 75  ±  29. 66, respectively, and the average total <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> number was 150. 25  ±  49. 53. The comparisons of the means of the right and left <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> numbers and the means of the total <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> numbers between the study and control groups indicated that the study group had significantly fewer follicles (p <  0. 001, p =  0. 011, and p =  0. 002, respectively). This study found a significant decrease in the number of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> in rats exposed to an EMF. Further clinical studies are needed to reveal the effects of EMFs on ovarian reserve and infertility...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ovarian</b> <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> are {{critical}} for female reproduction and comprise a finite pool of gametes arrested in development. A systems biology approach was used to identify regulatory gene networks essential for primordial follicle development. Transcriptional responses to eight different growth factors known to influence primordial follicles were used to construct a bionetwork of regulatory genes involved in rat primordial follicle development. Over 1, 500 genes {{were found to be}} regulated by the various growth factors and a network analysis identified critical gene modules involved in a number of signaling pathways and cellular processes. A set of 55 genes was identified as potential critical regulators of these gene modules, and a sub-network associated with development was determined. Within the network two previously identified regulatory genes were confirmed (i. e., Pdgfa and Fgfr 2) and a new factor was identified, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). CTGF was tested in ovarian organ cultures and found to stimulate primordial follicle development. Therefore, the relevant gene network associated with primordial follicle development was validated and the critical genes and pathways involved in this process were identified. This {{is one of the first}} applications of network analysis to a normal developmental process. These observations provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for preventing ovarian disease and promoting female reproduction...|$|R
40|$|To {{maintain}} the female reproductive lifespan, {{the majority of}} <b>ovarian</b> <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> are preserved in a quiescent state {{in order to provide}} ova for later reproductive life. However, the molecular mechanism that maintains the long quiescence of primordial follicles is poorly understood. Here we provide genetic evidence to show that the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc 1), which negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1), functions in oocytes to {{maintain the}} quiescence of primordial follicles. In mutant mice lacking the Tsc 1 gene in oocytes, the entire pool of primordial follicles is activated prematurely due to elevated mTORC 1 activity in the oocyte, ending up with follicular depletion in early adulthood and causing premature ovarian failure (POF). We further show that maintenance of the quiescence of primordial follicles requires synergistic, collaborative functioning of both Tsc and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) and that these two molecules suppress follicular activation through distinct ways. Our results suggest that Tsc/mTORC 1 signaling and PTEN/PI 3 K (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase) signaling synergistically regulate the dormancy and activation of primordial follicles, and together ensure the proper length of female reproductive life. Deregulation of these signaling pathways in oocytes results in pathological conditions of the ovary, including POF and infertility...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of <b>ovarian</b> <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> must be preserved in a quiescent state {{to allow for}} the regular production of gametes over the female reproductive lifespan. However, the molecular mechanism that maintains the long quiescence of primordial follicles is poorly understood. Under certain pathological conditions, the entire pool of primordial follicles matures simultaneously leading to an accelerated loss of primordial follicles and to premature ovarian failure (POF). We have previously shown that loss of Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) in mouse oocytes leads to premature activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, subsequent follicular depletion in early adulthood, and the onset of POF. Lack of PTEN leads to increased phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1) signaling in the oocytes. To study the functional and pathological roles of elevated mTORC 1 signaling in the oocytes, we treated the Pten-mutant mice with the specific mTORC 1 inhibitor rapamycin. When administered to Pten-deficient mice prior to the activation of the primordial follicles, rapamycin effectively prevented global follicular activation and preserved the ovarian reserve. These results provide a rationale for exploring the possible use of rapamycin as a drug for the preservation of the primordial follicle pool, and the possible prevention of POF...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> {{growth is}} under the {{influence}} of many growth factors and hormones of which FSH {{remains one of the most}} prominent regulators. Therefore, factors affecting the sensitivity of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> to FSH are also important for follicle growth. The aim of the present study was to inves-tigate whether anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) has an inhib-itory effect on follicle growth by decreasing the sensitivity of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> to FSH. Furthermore, the combined action of AMH and FSH on <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> development was examined. Three different experiments were performed. Using an in vitro follicle culture system it was shown that FSH-stimulated preantral follicle growth is attenuated in the presence of AMH.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyze the effects of green tea {{infusion}} on the toxicity of ovaries of female rats treated with the contraceptive depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). Material and Methods: A total of twenty-four female rats were randomly divided into four groups, incuding the control group (no treatment), the DMPA-treated group and the group treated with DMPA and infusion of green tea at various doses (165 and 330 mg/gram of body weight per day). The number of granulosa cells, the number of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> and the size of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> were subjected to histopathological analysis. Results: The number of granulosa cells did not differ significantly among the study groups. The number of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> was significantly higher in the DMPA-treated group than that of the control group. Of doses of 165 and 330 mg/g of body weight of green tea administration, only the low dose decreased the number of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> significantly relative to the DMPA-treated group, although it has not yet reached the levels comparable to those of the control group. The size of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> did not differ significantly among the study groups. Conclusion: DMPA led to an increased number of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles,</b> which was restored by infusion of low doses of green tea. Thus, green tea constitutes an herb that can be combined with administration of DMPA and useful in inhibiting the adverse effects of contraceptives.
