50|$|In {{the other}} case, Mr Mark Futter, the first claimant, settled two {{discretionary}} trusts, with himself and another as trustees, {{where he had}} a life interest and Mrs Futter, the defendant, had a reversionary life interest. The remainder would eventually go to their three children (the second to fourth defendants). The trustees exercised the power of enlargement so the first claimant became absolutely entitled to the fund, and then the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>advancement</b> was used to give £12,000 to each child. This was to avoid capital gains tax on the settlement. But the legal advisers got the law wrong, and large capital gains tax liability arose. The claimants argued the enlargement and advancements were void, because they failed {{to take account of}} the capital gains tax consequences. The Judge granted the declaration and the Revenue appealed.|$|E

40|$|A {{previous}} study, using regression analysis, {{established the}} relationship between the LOS distribution <b>of</b> <b>advancements</b> and the volume <b>of</b> <b>advancements</b> for three ratings of the Navy Enlisted Force. This relationship was the basis of a model to predict the number <b>of</b> <b>advancements</b> by LOS in future years. The present study used that (regression) model as a starting point to accomplish the same goal with a gamma distribution model appropriately parametrized to make it dependent on volume <b>of</b> <b>advancements.</b> The latter model appears nearly as accurate in its predictions as the regression model, while reducing the number of parameters from ninety-three to fifteen for each pay grade of each rating.
