25|$|Morey {{demonstrated}} his {{engine in}} New York and Philadelphia {{and there are}} eyewitness reports for both. In Philadelphia, he demonstrated it powering a boat and a wagon. Unfortunately, {{when he decided to}} demonstrate the car on the street, he fell off after starting the engine and the vehicle powered across Market Street into a ditch. This was the second car ride in the world, and the first in the United States. Despite these mostly successful demonstrations, Morey could not find a buyer, and became frustrated. A letter from Reverend Dana of Orford written in October 1829 tells of Morey’s trip to Baltimore, “I am told, the Capt. Is determined to make one more vigorous effort, to sell his <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> for some of his modern inventions , and if he does not now succeed, he will give the matter up, and return to Orford, to spend his days in quiet.” Morey did not find a buyer, and as he was then in his late 60s, it made sense to stop traveling {{up and down the east}} coast and call it quits.|$|E
40|$|In The Malleability of <b>Patent</b> <b>Rights</b> 1, I {{developed}} {{the concept that}} <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> are malleable rather than static and fixed, distinguishing malleability from the idea that <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> are merely uncertain. Malleability refers {{to the idea that}} the strength and scope of <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> can be altered by the actors who interact with a patent well after it has issued. Patent law is full of mechanisms that allow for these post-issuance changes, yet {{there seems to be no}} good theoretical argument that supports malleability. At best, I concluded, the costs of malleability must be weighed against the doctrinal cures, and perhaps those cures themselves would come with greater costs of their own. This Essay builds upon The Malleability of <b>Patent</b> <b>Rights</b> to explain how viewing <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> as malleable can dramatically alter conventional narratives of the patent system—both narratives told by supporters of strong <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> and narratives told by those who argue that the patent system must be changed to favor competitors. In doing so, this Essay provides examples of how the malleable nature of <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> can present real problems for the patent system. 1.

40|$|The {{objective}} of <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> is to foster innovation and economic growth. However, to date, {{there is little}} robust evidence that patents achieve this objective. Here, we study the impact of changes in effective <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> within panels of up to 54 manufacturing industries in up to 72 countries between 1981 - 2000. Stronger <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> were associated with faster growth in more patent-intensive industries, and the effect was larger in higher-income countries. Between 1991 - 1995, {{an increase in the}} level of effective <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> from Turkey to Singapore was associated with the average growth of the other chemicals and leather industries being respectively 1 / 6 and 1 / 17 higher. <b>Patent</b> <b>rights</b> were associated with faster growth through both factor accumulation and raising productivity.

2500|$|In 1981 Swanson, Dobkin and Widlar co-founded Linear Technology. Swanson {{steered the}} company into {{producing}} second-source parts for other companies. Three {{years later the}} relationships fell apart in a <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> dispute. Widlar claimed rights over Linear's LT1 to LT20 chips, and in May 1984 walked away, leaving the case to his lawyers. In October 1984 Swanson fired Widlar after stealing his designs and invoked the mandatory share repurchase provision that was in Widlar's contract. According to Bo Lojek, Widlar's notebooks contain sufficient evidence to prove {{that many of the}} disputed patents were created by Widlar before Linear was formed. Widlar returned to National Semiconductor for the remainder of his life. He and Dobkin never talked to each other after the breakup.

A two-way random-effects panel indicates that <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> regimes per se do not matter; they matter with importing countries' imitative abilities. For a country with an "average" imitative ability, US R&D-intensive exports increase by 4 - 9 % for a unit increase in the <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> index; a unit increase in the <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> index leads to a drop in US non-R&D-intensive exports by about 8 - 11 %.

He had arrived in Florence that day, and had to be brought unasked. He put on the effect of an old friend with her; but Clementina's curiosity was chiefly taken with a tall American, whom she thought very handsome. His light yellow hair was brushed smooth across his forehead like a well-behaving boy's; he was dressed like the other men, but he seemed not quite happy in his evening coat, and his gloves which he smote together uneasily from time to time. He appeared to think that somehow the radiant Clementina would know how he felt; he did not dance, and he professed to have found himself at the party by a species of accident. He told her that he was out in Europe looking after a <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> that he had just taken hold of, and was having only a middling good time. He pretended surprise to hear her say that she was having a first-rate time, and he tried to reason her out of it. He confessed that from the moment he came into the room he had made up his mind to take her to supper, and had never been so disgusted in his life as when he saw that little lord toddling off with her, and trying to look as large as life. He asked her what a lord was like, anyway, and he made her laugh all the time.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} foreign <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> on U. S. bilateral exports. The empirical analysis covers three highly disaggregated drug industries over three decades. We estimate bilateral trade equations for each industry using cross-country data {{on the strength of}} national <b>patent</b> <b>rights.</b> The findings show that strong foreign <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> enhance the market power of U. S. drug exporters across countries with weak imitative abilities. Alternatively, strong foreign <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> stimulate the market expansion of U.

30|$|Over {{the last}} few years, there has been {{innovation}} in various industries, particularly in the technology sector. An important indicator of technological innovation is intellectual property (IP), an umbrella term for patents, copyrights, and other creative expressions. Studies have explored the association between stronger <b>patent</b> <b>rights,</b> innovation, and economic growth. The relationship of patents to economic growth arises out of the rationale that stronger <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> positively influences innovation through cost-saving technologies and new product development, which in turn promote economic growth (Kanwar and Evenson 2003; Hudson and Minea 2013). Research in this arena {{has not always been}} consistent, however. Park and Ginarte (1997) used an index of <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> compiled for 60 countries by Ginarte and Park (1997), to study the relationship between <b>patent</b> <b>rights,</b> economic growth, and R&D expenditure. While they found a positive association between strong <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> and R&D expenditure for upper income OECD countries, they found no association for low- income countries. In addition, they found no relationship between <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> and economic growth. On the other hand, Hudson and Minea (2013) found <b>patent</b> <b>rights,</b> along with GDP per capita, to positively influence economic growth. Park (2003) analyzed data for 18 manufacturing industries between the years 1980 and 1995 for 21 OECD countries and found a positive relationship of patents with labor productivity and R&D expenditure. However, for a larger sample of countries, they found that while R&D expenditure increased with patents, labor productivity did not. In an analysis of 32 countries between the years 1981 and 1990, Kanwar and Evenson (2003) found a positive relationship between <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> and R&D intensity (ratio of R&D expenditure to GDP). Kim et al. (2008) found that <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> for developed countries were associated with higher R&D intensity. Research is therefore varied and brimming with inconsistent results, which points to the need for more analysis and discoveries.|$|R

50|$|Since a <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> {{is also a}} kind of {{property}} right, an act of infringement of a <b>patent</b> <b>right</b> constitutes a tort, and a patentee who sustains damages {{as a result of}} an act of infringement may demand damages from the infringer in tort (Article 709 of the Civil Code). Unlike an ordinary tortious act however, in the case of the infringement of a <b>patent</b> <b>right,</b> it is often difficult to prove the amount of the loss, as well as intent or negligence on the part of the infringer. For that reason, the Patent Act contains a special provision for calculating the amount of loss (Article 102), a provision on the presumption of negligence (Article 103), and a provision permitting the determination of a reasonable amount of loss (Article 105-3).|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> is to foster innovation and economic growth. However, to date, {{there is little}} robust evidence that patents “work”. Here, we applied a difference-in-differences strategy to study the impact of changes in <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> within panels of up to 54 manufacturing industries in up to 72 countries between 1981 - 2000. We found that stronger <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> were associated with faster growth among more patent-intensive industries. During 1991 - 95, for an industry with average patent intensity, a one standard deviation increase in <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> (equivalent to an increase from Hong Kong to Australia) was associated {{with an increase in}} growth of 0. 69 % points, or almost a fifth of the average industry growth rate of 3. 7 %. The effect of <b>patent</b> <b>rights</b> on growth became stronger in the 1990 s than in the 1980 s. Patents “worked ” through both encouraging factor accumulation and technical progress.
