The tests were carried out on bean pods grown for dry seeds of cultivars: Narew, Nida and Warta. There was the comparison of four methods of measurement of the volume (pycnometric and three simple pod models). The four applied methods of volume measurement signifi cantly infl uenced the results, both in the total volume of the pod and the air volume in the pod. The above mentioned qualities had higher results for the method II and lower for the method III. The volume measured with the <b>method</b> I (<b>pycnometer)</b> and the <b>method</b> IV differed statistically insignifi cantly.

40|$|Introduction. Micro-CT {{analysis}} {{is a powerful}} technique for a non-invasive evaluation of the morphometric parameters of trabecular bone samples. This elaboration requires a previous binarization of the images. A problem which arises from the binarization process is the partial volume artifact. Voxels at the external surface of the sample can contain both bone and air so thresholding operates an incorrect estimation of volume occupied by the two materials. Aim. The {{aim of this study}} is the extraction of bone volumetric information directly from the image histograms, by fitting them with a suitable set of functions. Methods. Nineteen trabecular bone samples were extracted from femoral heads of eight patients subject to a hip arthroplasty surgery. Trabecular bone samples were acquired using micro-CT Scanner. Hystograms of the acquired images were computed and fitted by Gaussian-like functions accounting for: a) gray levels produced by the bone x-ray absorption, b) the portions of the image occupied by air and c) voxels that contain a mixture of bone and air. This latter contribution can be considered such as an estimation of the partial volume effect. Results. The comparison of the proposed technique to the bone volumes measured by a reference instrument such as by a helium <b>pycnometer</b> show the <b>method</b> as a good way for an accurate bone volume calculation of trabecular bone samples...|$|R

40|$|Oxidative {{aging is}} {{a major issue in}} asphalt {{pavements}} that leads to hardening of the asphalt, which further contributes significantly to asphalt pavement embrittlement and eventually results in excessive pavement cracking. In addition, the performance of asphalt binder is also highly related to its service conditions which involve climatic conditions and traffic conditions, such as temperature, moisture and traffic loads. Generally, the mechanical properties of asphalt before and after oxidative aging can be tested in the laboratory; however, the fundamental material science of asphalt before and after oxidative aging is difficult to be investigated in the laboratory regarding chemical composition and property change due to the difficulties of studying the molecular structures and their dynamic behavior in asphalt. Therefore, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation method is used in this study to understand how the chemical composition and property changes of asphalt after oxidative aging affect the physical, thermodynamic, rheological and mechanical performance of the asphalt, and how the oxidized asphalt acts under different conditions, such as loading, temperature, and moisture, compared to the unoxidized asphalt. MD simulation is a computational method used to simulate the physical movements of atoms and molecules depending on time and force field chosen under different conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and loading. Asphalt models before and after oxidative aging are developed for MD simulations in this study under different temperatures, loading and moisture contents. Simulation results show that the oxidized functional groups in asphalt molecules increase the strength of intermolecular bonds of asphalt, which further contributes to the hardening of the oxidized asphalt. Specifically, the internal energy changes, especially for higher magnitude of intermolecular and lower kinetic energies, are responsible for the hardening of oxidized asphalt, and the higher potential energies and for oxidized asphalt further proves that oxidation increases the polarity of molecules in asphalt and forms strongly interacting components. The internal property change is consistent with the external physical and rheological property change after oxidation, which is revealed by the increase of density, bulk modulus and viscosity. Considering the mechanical property of asphalt using MD simulations, both the unoxidized and oxidized asphalts deform more and fail faster with an increase in both compressive and tensile stress rates, especially under tensile stresses. However, the oxidized asphalt is stiffer than the unoxidized asphalt, which shows slower and less deformation, further validating the hardening of asphalt after oxidation. Asphalt is significantly susceptible to temperature. Simulation results show that density, and zero shear viscosity of asphalt decrease with an increase in temperature. Isothermal compressibility and bulk modulus also change under different temperatures. Moreover, the density, bulk modulus (inverse of isothermal compressibility) and zero shear viscosity of oxidized asphalt is higher than the unoxidized asphalt proving the hardening of asphalt during oxidation. The different change trends of isothermal compressibility and bulk modulus between unoxidized and oxidized asphalts under different temperatures indicate glass transition behavior changed after asphalt oxidation. According to MD simulations, the moisture impacts on asphalt before and after oxidative aging are significant regarding bulk modulus and zero shear viscosity. Both bulk modulus and zero shear viscosity of asphalt decrease with an increase in moisture content in the asphalt. Moreover, moisture adversely impacts more on oxidized asphalt. The moisture impact on the density of asphalt before and after oxidation is not significant. Density of oxidized asphalt is constantly higher than the unoxidized asphalt under different moisture contents and the density fluctuations of oxidized asphalt is larger. This indicates that asphalt is more sensitive to moisture inclusion after oxidative aging. Laboratory tests are used to validate MD simulation results. <b>Pycnometer</b> <b>method,</b> Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and nanoindentation are used to test density, zero shear viscosity, and nanomechanical properties including modulus, hardness and viscosity of asphalt binders with different degree of oxidative aging, respectively.

40|$|Rock {{density is}} {{critical}} for determining the tonnage of an orebody and therefore impacts on the total resource of a deposit. Density {{is defined as the}} concentration of matter, and is expressed as mass per unit volume (g/cc; g/cm 3 or t/m 3). The density that is calculated will depend {{on the nature of the}} rock, and whether the volume calculated includes the open and/or closed pore volume of the rock. The pore volume will depend on the rock’s internal and external characteristics. This study looks at two methods commonly used to determine the rock density of samples taken from boreholes drilled for platinum mines on the North Eastern limb of the Bushveld Complex, South Africa. The first method is a gas pycnometer, which is almost exclusively used by laboratories. A Grabner Minidens air gas pycnometer was used. The second method is a hydrostatic immersion method, using water as the Archimedean fluid. An adapted Snowrex NH – 3 scale that can weigh a rock sample in air and in water was used. The first part of the study investigates the possible differences between conducting rock density measurements on finely milled core in the Grabner Minidens air gas pycnometer or on solid halved core samples using a hydrostatic immersion method, and the implications thereof. The second part of the study, not only investigates the differences between conducting density measurements on solid core samples or on milled core samples, but also looks at how the type of method used and how location affects the density measurement obtained. The location is important because changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure have been shown to produce small, but measurable changes in density. The density of pure water at 4 °C is approximately 1 g/cm 3, increases or decreases in temperature will marginally decrease the density of water. The density of pure water at room temperature (21 °C) is 0. 998 g/cm 3. Changes in atmospheric pressure have been shown to have a negligible effect on the density of most solids. The diamond drill core samples were taken from boreholes targeting the platinum group element (PGE) rich Merensky reef (MR) and Upper Group 2 (UG 2) chromitite layer of the Upper Critical Zone. Samples were taken from the hangingwall (HW), reef and footwall (FW) of the MR and UG 2. These rocks are made up of closely interlocking minerals, typical of cumulates. There are generally no visible pore spaces apart from highly fractured and altered samples. In part one of the study, 18, 430 samples were used. The halved core samples were first measured using the hydrostatic immersion method at the exploration offices close to where the boreholes were drilled, referred to as the “Driekop” method. The samples were then sent to a laboratory in Johannesburg. Each sample was first milled to a fine powder (40 μm), and then a small portion of the milled sample (4 cm 3) measured using the Grabner Minidens air gas pycnometer, referred to as the “Grabner Milled” method. For quality control, 811 of the remaining halved core samples were re-measured using the hydrostatic immersion method. The Grabner Milled results were found to be consistently higher than the Driekop results, with a mean average relative difference (AVRD) of approximately 5 % for all stratigraphic units. The difference observed can be accounted for, from the way in which the sample is prepared and the type of density that is measured. The Driekop method calculates the bulk density of the solid halved core sample, which includes all the open and closed pores of the rock. The Grabner Milled method calculates the true density of the finely milled sample, which through comminution, has excluded all open and closed pores that were in the rock. The quality control repeat measurements on the remaining halved core samples showed a good correlation with the original measurements, with a mean AVRD of only 0. 33 %. In part two of the study, 82 randomly selected samples were used. The density of each solid sample was first determined using the hydrostatic immersion method. The same hydrostatic immersion method used in part one was applied at the same location; therefore it is also referred to as the “Driekop” method. The same hydrostatic method was then conducted on the samples at the laboratory in Johannesburg, referred to as “Lab water solid”. The gas <b>pycnometer</b> <b>method</b> was only conducted at the laboratory. The samples were first measured as a solid, referred to as “Grabner solid”. The samples were then milled to 40 μm and remeasured in the Grabner Minidens, referred to as “Grabner Milled”. The three solid methods results showed good correlation, with an average AVRD of only 0. 01 % for the two hydrostatic immersion methods. On the other hand, there was a marked difference in results between the solid methods and the Grabner Milled method, the most significant difference being between the Grabner Milled and Grabner solid method (AVRD = 3. 42 %). The resource model parameters for a project within the study area were used to illustrate the effect of density on resource planning. The average density used in the resource calculation will depend on what density method is used. The AVRD between the two methods for the mining cut density was approximately 5 %. The resource calculation showed that the difference in tonnage and 4 E ounces between the two methods was also approximately 5 %. Changes in density result in equal changes in tonnage and metal content (4 E ounces). Increases in dilution or overbreak from 10 to 30 cm above the optimal mining cut showed increases in tonnage and decreases in metal content. Due to similarities in rock composition between the HW, reef and FW of the MR, further dilution caused only a marginal decrease in density. The UG 2 was found to be much more sensitive to dilution because of the distinct differences in rock composition between the reef, which is a chromitite layer and the HW and FW, which are both made up of plagioclase pyroxenite. Emphasis is commonly placed on the effect of dilution on grade; however this shows that the effect of density can be as important. The hydrostatic method of density determination is a very practical way of determining rock density at a remote exploration site. The whole sample can be measured and it is not restricted by the size or shape of the sample. Modern gas pycnometers have a higher degree of accuracy and precision, but need to be operated in a laboratory controlled environment, and are only capable of measuring a small amount of sample. With the correct application of quality control, both are suitable methods of density determination. The selection will depend on what type of density is required, the nature of the rock and whether the method must include or exclude pore spaces in the rock.
