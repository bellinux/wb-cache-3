40|$|Louis Parker (January 1 1906 - June 21 1993) {{invented the}} {{television}} receiver, Patent Number(s) 2, 448, 908. Parker 2 ̆ 7 s invention is the modern basis for coordinating sound and picture. Among Parker 2 ̆ 7 s other inventions {{was the first}} color television system using vertical color lines. This {{made it possible to}} change from the original three-color dot system to the simpler vertical color-line system. Most of the color television receivers in the world now use this system. Born in Budapest, Hungary, Parker received his primary and secondary education in Hungary. Following graduation, he immigrated to the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1932. After learning English, he studied at the City College of New York. Parker first gained publicity in 1929 with a hotel radio system that used low-frequency signals to broadcast over the electric wires within the building. This made it possible to receive noiseless reception with one-tube receivers. Later he worked on radio direction finders for airplanes and cathode ray oscilloscopes, which led to work on television and closed circuit television systems. During World War II, Parker designed and manufactured <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitters</b> for military use. Later he invented electrical instruments operating on somewhat different principles which were greatly superior in performance and which were the bases for the Parker Instrument Corporation. The company was chosen by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to furnish select instruments for use in the manned Apollo flights to the moon. Parker received more than 200 United States and foreign patents. [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|Pocket FM is a small, <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitter</b> {{developed}} by MiCT {{in collaboration with}} Germany-based design firm IXDS. Due to its small size and design, {{it looks more like}} a receiver than a transmitter, making it more difficult to detect, sabotage, or hijack, and much cheaper to run. [...] Syrnet operates through twelve Pocket FM transmitters, each of which is capable of reaching up to six kilometers, and five larger relays. The Pocket FM units, which can run on solar power or an automobile's 12-volt battery, are equipped with built-in satellite receivers to pick up the Syrnet feed and broadcast it over-the-air.|$|E

On 17 June 1940, following Marshal Philippe Pétain's declaration of his intention to seek an armistice, Air-Vice Marshal Arthur Barratt, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief British Air Forces in France, sent Grinnell-Milne {{on a mission to}} deliver letters to the leaders of the French Air Force, stating Britain's determination to continue the fight, and encouraging them to do the same in North Africa. Grinnell-Milne was also appointed the British liaison officer to the Commander-in-Chief of the French Air Force Joseph Vuillemin, and equipped with <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitter,</b> call-signs and codes. Grinnell-Milne drove to Bordeaux, then to GHQ French Air Forces at Agen. There Vuillemin regretfully informed him that he had begun the process of transferring men and aircraft to North Africa, but had now received orders to halt all movements. Grinnell-Milne found most of the senior staff officers were either resigned to their fate, obstructive, or openly hostile, though he noted that many of the younger officers and men were eager to leave for England. He left France late on 18 June aboard [...] Once back in London he was appointed liaison officer to Free French General Charles de Gaulle, remaining with him for the next four months, and taking part in the battles of Dakar and Gabon. He was promoted to flying officer on the 3 August 1941. [...] Grinnell-Milne was invalided out of the RAF (technically he resigned his commission), retaining his rank of flying officer on 20 July 1944. [...] Thereafter he rejoined the BBC, remaining there until 1946.|$|E

5000|$|The {{characters}} {{and some of}} the events described are fiction, but the story may have some basis in fact. A cargo of gold bullion worth $9,000,000 arrived by the freighter Bomma in Baltimore on 28 June 1940, with the ships captain reporting that the gold was smuggled past the Germans by Norwegian children on their sleds. The book is often described as being [...] "based on a true story." [...] McSwigan stated in an authors note [...] "that she had tried to be as accurate as possible in describing how the children carried the gold on sleds" [...] while admitting that some details were changed. A journalist by trade, she wrote in 1960: [...] "Some of my childrens books are based on actual happenings. Over and over, an Associated Press dispatch or one from United-International has set me to wondering: What kind of patriots were those Norwegians who saved their gold by having their children sled it down a mountain past the occupation forces, as I subsequently made my characters do in Snow Treasure? Or what was he like, the real sixteen-year-old who, on a homemade <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitter,</b> broadcast resistance against the Japanese as did my Juan of Manila? Or, what about those Czechs who stole a railway train and drove it into West Germany, as mine would do in All Aboard for Freedom? These stories came out of the newspapers." [...] In the books foreword McSwigan also asserted: [...] "This story is based on an actual happening. On June 28, 1940, the Norwegian freighter Bomma reached Baltimore with a cargo of gold bullion worth $9,000,000... Two changes were made in the scant account given in the news dispatches that accompanied the disclosure of the cargo of gold. The Bomma, a coasting motorship, became the Cleng Peerson, a fishing smack. Also, the distance the gold was sledded was not twelve miles but actually thirty-five miles. Otherwise, how the Norse children set about eluding the German forces of occupation is here reconstructed as well as possible from what brief facts were permitted." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{personal}} radio {{service is}} any {{system that allows}} individual to operate <b>radio</b> <b>transmitters</b> and receivers for personal purposes with minimal or no special license or individual authorization.

Many regions (for example, the European Union) have standardized personal radio service rules to allow travelers from one country to use their equipment in another country. Examples of standardized services include PMR446 and FM Citizens Band Radio (CB) in the EU and several other countries/regions. 26-27 MHz CB radio is the oldest personal radio service and is used in nearly every country worldwide, with many countries and regions copying the United States 40-channel frequency plan. In many countries, CB radio is less popular due to the availability of other personal radio services that offer shorter antennas, better protection from noise and interference.|$|R
