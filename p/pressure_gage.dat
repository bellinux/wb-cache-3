Therefore, uniformity of compression pressure and valve timing became one of most important engine design and production standard. Conventional method to evaluate compression pressure uniformity is to measure each cylinder pressure by mechanical <b>pressure</b> <b>gage</b> during cranking. This conventional method causes inaccuracy of cylinder pressure measurement because of different cranking speed results from battery status and also causes high manhour and cost.
