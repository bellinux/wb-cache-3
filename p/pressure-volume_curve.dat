40|$|OBJECTIVE: Respiratory <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> {{fitted to}} {{exponential}} equations {{have been used}} to assess disease severity and prognosis in spontaneously breathing patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Sigmoidal equations {{have been used to}} fit <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> for mechanically ventilated patients but not for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. We compared a sigmoidal model and an exponential model to fit <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> from mechanically ventilated patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: Six idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and five controls underwent inflation <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> using the constant-flow technique during general anesthesia prior to open lung biopsy or thymectomy. We identified the lower and upper inflection points and fit the curves with an exponential equation, V = A-B. e-k. P, and a sigmoid equation, V = a+b/(1 +e-(P-c) /d). RESULTS: The mean lower inflection point for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients was significantly higher (10. 5 ± 5. 7 cm H 2 O) than that of controls (3. 6 ± 2. 4 cm H 2 O). The sigmoidal equation fit the <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> of the fibrotic and control patients well, but the exponential equation fit the data well only when points below 50 % of the inspiratory capacity were excluded. CONCLUSION: The elevated lower inflection point and the sigmoidal shape of the <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> suggest that respiratory system compliance is decreased close to end-expiratory lung volume in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients under general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. The sigmoidal fit was superior to the exponential fit for inflation <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> of anesthetized patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and could be useful for guiding mechanical ventilation during general anesthesia in this condition...|$|R

50|$|In {{a patient}} with acute lung injury (ALI), the right level of PEEP is that which optimizes {{arterial}} oxygenation without causing O2 toxicity or ventilatior-induced lung injury. Balancing the benefit of keeping the lung open (during tidal ventilation) against the risk of lung overinflation may require monitoring of the <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curve,</b> lung morphology, and gas exchange. When loss of aeration has a focal distribution (atelectatic lower lobes coexisting with aerated upper lobes), {{a high level of}} PEEP can cause overinflation of already aerated areas and only partial recruitment of atelectatic areas. Different strategies exist to find the level of PEEP in these patients: ARDSnet, guided by esophageal pressure, Stress Index, static airway <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curve.</b> In such patients, some experts recommend limiting PEEP to low levels (~10cmH2O). In patients who have diffused loss of aeration PEEP can be used provided it does not cause the plateau pressure to rise above the upper inflection point.|$|E
5000|$|Thermodynamic {{processes}} can {{be carried}} out in one of two ways: reversibly or irreversibly. Reversibility refers to performing a reaction continuously at equilibrium. In an ideal thermodynamically reversible process, the energy from work performed by or on the system would be maximized, and that from heat would be minimized; heat cannot fully be converted to work and will always be lost to some degree (to the surroundings). The phenomenon of maximized work and minimized heat can be visualized on a <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curve,</b> as the area beneath the equilibrium curve, representing work done. In order to maximize work, one must follow the equilibrium curve closely.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{mechanical}} ventilators is {{to deliver a}} constant volume, constant pressure, {{or a combination of}} both with each breath. Any given volume will correspond to a specific pressure on the <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curve</b> and vice versa in any case. Settings on each mechanical ventilator may include respiratory rate, tidal volume, trigger sensitivity, flow rate, waveform, and inspiratory/expiratory ratio. The volume-cycled ventilation includes the volume-control function and delivers a set tidal volume. The pressure is not a fixed number but it varies with resistance and capacitance of the respiratory system. The volume-cycled ventilation is the simplest and most efficient of providing ventilation to a patient’s airway compared to other methods of mechanical ventilation. Each inspiratory effort that is beyond the set sensitivity threshold will be accounted for and fixed to the delivery of the corresponding tidal volume. If the patient does not breathe enough, then the volume-cycled ventilation will initiate a breath for the patient to bring up the breathing rate to the minimum respiratory rate. The synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) is a similar method of mechanical ventilation that also delivers breaths at a fixed rate and volume that corresponds to the patient’s breathing. Unlike the Volume-Cycled Ventilation, patient efforts above the fixed rate are unassisted in the synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV).|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that lung {{recruitment}} maneuvers are important means of treating ARDS. Although computed tomography (CT) scans and <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> are the most common ways to evaluate lung recruitment, there are still many disadvantages. Not only do the scans have to take place in a CT room, but the patient is exposed to large doses of radiation through the multiple scans necessary to define the optimal PEEP. <b>Pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> require deep sedation and muscle relaxation. Thus, bedside lung ultrasound may be considered to be a safer and easier alternative to CT scans or <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves.</b> In our case, we evaluated the effectiveness of lung recruitment with a bedside ultrasound on a patient who was suffering from life-threatening hypoxemia. Bedside ultrasound is a faster and more convenient imaging method because it reduces the need for patient transport compared with CT scan and requires no muscle relaxation. This case supports that ultrasound may become an alternative imaging tool to guide and evaluate alveolar recruitment in patients with ARDS.

40|$|The <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curve</b> of the {{respiratory}} {{system is a}} physiological method used for diagnotic purposes to describe the static mechanical properties of {{the respiratory}} system. A renewal {{of interest in the}} <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curve</b> has recently appeared because of experimental evidence regarding the information conveyed by the curve, {{a better understanding of the}} pathophysiologic factors influencing its interpretation and the beneficial results of clinical trials based on the use of the <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curve</b> for ventilatory management of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Thus, adapting ventilatory settings to individual characteristics of the patients in terms of respiratory mechanics may be an extremely important aspect for a better management of the most difficult to ventilate patients with acute lung injury. There is considerable experimental evidence that both the opening-collapse phenomena and the excessive lung stretch may cause damage to the lungs. Therefore tools allowing an individual titration of ventilatory settings taking into account the constraints of the respiratory system seem highly desirable.

It is hopeful to think that in the future the measurement of the P-V curve and the quantification of alveolar recruitment may be easily provided at the bedside and may help for the titration of the ventilatory settings in clinical practice.

Compliance was assessed from postmortem <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> and from pressure-length measurements (mercury-in-silastic segment length gauges) made both in vivo and postmortem. Postmortem <b>pressure-volume</b> <b>curves</b> showed reduced compliance compared to sham-operated animals. Postmortem pressure-length curves of infarcted and adjacent normal myocardium indicated that the diminished total compliance {{could be attributed to}} an increase in stiffness of the infarcted area.

In addition, anesthetized dogs with infarcts, when compared with sham-operated animals, had similar left ventricular end-diastolic volumes (indicator dilution method), but higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressures. Taken with previous observations, which show that systolic aneurysmal bulging is uniformly present at the onset of ischemia, these results indicate that stiffening of the ischemic myocardium occurs during the first 5 days after infarction, and show that elevation of left ventricular filling pressure does not necessarily signify ventricular dilatation.
