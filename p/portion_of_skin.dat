[p.159]wandering {{in and out}} {{of every}} Wakalah in the village, during which peregrination the boy Mohammed proved himself so useful that I {{determined}} at all risks to make him my companion, we accidentally heard that a Hindi had taken lodgings at a hostelry bearing the name of Jirjis al-Zahr.[FN#32] On arriving there our satisfaction was diminished by the intelligence that the same Hindi, after locking the door, had gone out with his friends to a ship in the harbour; in fact, that he had made all preparations for running away. I dismounted, and tried to persuade the porter to break open the wooden bolt, but he absolutely refused, and threatened the police. Meanwhile Mohammed had found a party of friends, men of Al-Madinah, returning to the pilgrimage after a begging tour through Egypt and Turkey. The meeting was characterised by vociferous inquiries, loud guffaws and warm embraces. I was invited to share their supper and their dormitory,-an uncovered platform projecting from the gallery over the square court below,-but I had neither appetite nor spirits enough to be sociable. The porter, after much persuasion, showed me an empty room, in which I spread my carpet. That was a sad night. My eighty-four mile ride had made every bone ache; I had lost epidermis, and the sun had seared every <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> exposed to it.

40|$|Atherosclerotic plaques in man have {{monoclonal}} characteristics. One {{possible explanation}} for this observation is that clonal selection occurs as cells proliferate at sites of intimal injury. To test whether such clonal selection could occur during {{the formation of an}} intimal "scar", the clonal characteristics of human cutaneous scars were studied with the use of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 -PD) as a cellular marker. Scars from 7 black women heterozygous for the A and B isoenzymes of G- 6 -PD were divided into 870 <b>portions</b> consisting <b>of</b> contiguous normal <b>skin,</b> scar margin, outer scar, and inner scar. Portions were further divided into surface and deeper <b>portions</b> <b>of</b> scar. In 4 of the 7 cases, significant differences were observed between the mean percentage of total activity in the B isoenzyme band in <b>portions</b> <b>of</b> scar and <b>portions</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin.</b> Significant differences between surface and deeper <b>portions</b> <b>of</b> both <b>skin</b> and scar were also observed in 5 cases.

However, the magnitude of the difference (no greater than a 5. 7 % B isoenzyme difference) is far too small to even partially explain the marked differences in isoenzyme patterns observed between atherosclerotic plaques and uninvolved aortic wall. The results do not support the idea that the monoclonality of human atherosclerotic plaques is due to clonal selection following the healing of an intimal injury...|$|R

40|$|The major <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> {{secretory}} peptidome of the European Tree frog Hyla arborea {{consists of}} short peptides from tryptophyllin family. It {{is known that}} b-ions of these peptides undergo head-to-tail cyclization, forming a ring that can open, resulting in several linear forms. As a result, the spectrum contains multiple ion series, thus complicating de novo sequencing. This was observed in the Q-TOF spectrum {{of one of the}} tryptophyllins isolated from Hyla arborea; the sequence FLPFFP-NH 2 was established by Edman degradation and counter-synthesis. Though no rearrangements were observed in FTICR-MS and MALDI-TOF/TOF spectra, both of them were not suitable for mass-spectrometry sequencing due to the low sequence coverage. To obtain full amino acid sequence by mass spectrometry, three chemical modifications to N-terminal amino moiety were applied. They include acetylation and sulfobenzoylation of N-amino group and its transformation to 2, 4, 6 -trimethylpyridinium by interaction with 2, 4, 6 -trimethylpyrillium tetrafluoroborate. All three reagents block scrambling and provide spectra better than the intact peptide. Unfortunately, all of them also readily react with lysine side chain. Hence, all investigated procedures can be used to improve sequencing of short peptides, while acetylation is the recommended one. It shows excellent results, and it is plain and simple to perform.

30|$|The depot {{hypothesis}} is the earliest proposed mechanism for adjuvant action, hypothesized by Glenny, Buttle and Stevens in 1931 after working on DT-precipitated in alum (Glenny et al. 1931). They excised a <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> containing {{the site of}} injection from guinea pigs 3  days after administration of alum-precipitated DT or soluble DT. They then homogenized the skin and injected the emulsion into naïve guinea-pigs. The alum-precipitated DT-recipients were successfully immunized whereas, the DT-recipients (controls) groups were not, as measured by anti-toxin titers. This experiment led them to generate a hypothesis that the slow elimination of alum-precipitated Ags {{over a long period}} of time from single injection site may enhance both primary and secondary stimulation resulting in the associated enhanced Ab titers (Glenny et al. 1931). Similarly, Harrison proved this hypothesis by transferring the alum nodules from one guinea pig into another guinea pig (Harrison 1935). White and colleagues suggested that depot causes persisting inflammation that stimulates immune cells within the regional LNs, and induction of local granuloma that recruit Ab-producing plasma cells (White et al. 1955). Consequent studies suggested that Ag was detected for 2 – 3  weeks in alumina gel-triggered granulomas (Osebold 1982). It was realized that strong adsorption to an adjuvant may ensure a high localized concentration of Ag for a period of time (Harrison 1935; White et al. 1955), that may be sufficient to allow Ag uptake and activation of APCs like DCs (HogenEsch 2002).|$|E

More than one single cause is considered as responsible for the aetiology of the disease, including vascular anomalies. If the defects are large or deep, especially on the vertex, surgical intervention is necessary. We report on a 5 year-old ACC case that healed spontaneously after birth and, was admitted to our hospital for a 12 x 13 cm cicatricial alopecic area and skull defect on the vertex. For treatment, expanded scalp flaps were planned and applied after a non-problematic expansion for a long period. The expanded scalp flap was transposed to the defect and {{although there was no}} tension, venous insufficiency developed and the flap was lost during the post-operative period. Immediately after this, another transposition flap was used to close the skin defect. Again, partial flap failure with venous insufficiency developed. A split skin graft was applied after granulation tissue developed on the site of debrided necrotic areas. The final result was partially satisfactory with alopecic areas due to skin graft instead of scar that could have resulted from the spontaneously healed skin defect and preserved bone grafts. We suggest that the flaps used for reconstruction of ACC defect in the scalp should be either advancement or bipedicled flaps, because of better reliability...|$|E
40|$|Serious burn {{patients}} (2 nd and 3 rd degree) {{are in need}} of skin replacements {{to increase}} their chance of survival. Currently, the gold standard for these types of wounds is a surgical debridement with closure using autologous split thickness skin grafts (STG: epidermis and a thin layer of dermis) (1). However, in extended burns, healthy body areas available for graft removal are often insufficient. Moreover, aesthetically disappointing scars remain {{because of a lack of}} dermis. To obtain better results in terms of skin healing and aesthetics, deeper grafts comprising the epidermis and the complete dermis can be taken. But such an approach is limited due to small-sized graft removal areas like the groin or the lower abdomen and the associated higher morbidity. Therefore, surgeons need alternative strategies to obtain large <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> for grafts without taking it from the patient. Presently, techniques are investigated like: cadaver skin, collagen or hyaluronic acid acellular wound dressings and autologous cultured keratinocytes (with or without fibroblasts) (1). The biocompatibility of these potential skin replacements and their ability to get properly vascularized once grafted are two key factors for a successful long-term survival of the graft. To obtain access to the recipient's vascular network, the graft can either recruit existing blood vessels or generate new ones. Therefore, being able to measure a skin substitute's biocompatibility and angiogenesis ability in pre- clinical stages is crucial to evaluate its potential application in a clinical setting...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gene {{therapy has}} been {{recently}} introduced as {{a novel approach}} to treat ischemic tissues by using the angiogenic potential of certain growth factors. We investigated the effect of adenovirus-mediated gene therapy with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) delivered into the subdermal space to treat ischemically challenged epigastric skin flaps in a rat model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A pilot {{study was conducted in}} a group of 5 animals pretreated with Ad-GFP and expression of green fluorescent protein in the skin flap sections was demonstrated under fluorescence microscopy at 2, 4, and 7 days after the treatment, indicating a successful transfection of the skin flaps following subdermal gene therapy. Next, 30 male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups of 10 rats each. An epigastric skin flap model, based solely on the right inferior epigastric vessels, was used as the model in this study. Rats received subdermal injections of adenovirus encoding TGF-beta (Ad-TGF-beta) or green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) as treatment control. The third group (n = 10) received saline and served as a control group. A flap measuring 8 x 8 cm was outlined on the abdominal skin extending from the xiphoid process proximally and the pubic region distally, to the anterior axillary lines bilaterally. Just prior to flap elevation, the injections were given subdermally in the left upper corner of the flap. The flap was then sutured back to its bed. Flap viability was evaluated seven days after the initial operation. Digital images of the epigastric flaps were taken and areas of necrotic zones relative to total flap surface area were measured and expressed as percentages by using a software program. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in mean percent surviving area between the Ad-TGF-beta group and the two other control groups (P < 0. 05). (Ad-TGF-beta: 90. 3 +/- 4. 0 % versus Ad-GFP: 82. 2 +/- 8. 7 % and saline group: 82. 6 +/- 4. 3 %.) CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the authors were able to demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated gene therapy using TGF-beta ameliorated ischemic necrosis in an epigastric skin flap model, as confirmed by significant reduction in the necrotic zones of the flap. The results of this study raise the possibility of using adenovirus-mediated TGF-beta gene therapy to promote perfusion in random <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> flaps, especially in high-risk patients...|$|E
