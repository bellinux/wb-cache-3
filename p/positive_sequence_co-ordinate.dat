40|$|IEEE Xplore link: [URL] fully rated {{converter}} of type 4 {{wind turbines}} {{is capable of}} providing dynamic voltage control during grid faults by injecting controlled reactive currents. This paper describes three different dynamic voltage control options during unbalanced grid faults: 1) the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage control with only a <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> reactive current injection and suppression of the negative sequence current; 2) the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage control with limitation of the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> reactive current injection and suppression of the negative sequence current; and 3) the <b>positive</b> and negative <b>sequence</b> voltage control with both a positive and a negative sequence reactive current injection. These different control options are compared in simulations of a wind power plant connected to a meshed power system, including synchronous generators. It is shown that both the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage control with limitation and the <b>positive</b> and negative <b>sequence</b> voltage control can overcome the voltage rise and voltage distortion that can occur with pure <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage control without limitation. Both of these options have a distinct fault response, where the <b>positive</b> and negative <b>sequence</b> voltage control results in a fault response that resembles the fault response of a synchronous generator with higher fault current contributions in the faulted phases. status: publishe...|$|R

These advanced control strategies sense <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage and current components at the PCCs of IBDERs and DFIMs, and then provide special VSC switching processes [91]. The control of zero sequence currents {{is the same as}} for AC machines [12], [18, 19, 20, 21, 22].

40|$|Abstract — StatCom {{is a type}} of {{device that}} can be used for {{controlling}} as well as reducing <b>positive</b> and negative <b>sequence</b> voltages produced in a system. It is a static synchronous generator which controls capacitive or inductive output current irrespective of the ac system voltage. The main source of arising of <b>positive</b> and negative <b>sequence</b> voltages are generation of unsymmetrical faults in a wind farm. <b>Positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage causes voltage instability and negative sequence voltage causes heavy generator torque oscillations which leads to mechanical vibration. Unbalanced voltage causes unbalanced heating in the machine winding. Therefore at first, current capability of StatCom can be controlled for removing <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltages for improving voltage stability and then remaining current is controlled for eliminating negative sequence voltages.

30|$|In this paper, a <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> current based {{directional}} relaying {{method is}} proposed for CCVT secondary transient during SPT condition. The method computes the fundamental components of fault and prefault current using least square technique.

The <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> current based methods have although limitation for high resistance far end fault, and load change situation but during such situation CCVT transient is not possible. So, once the CCVT transient {{at the secondary}} side is detected, the proposed method can be applied as a stand-alone protection scheme to avoid any nuisance directional relay operation. The presence of AFSC and PFSC, higher system SIR value, fault type, fault location, fault resistance, and fault inception angle have negligible impact {{on the performance of}} proposed method. The proposed method is 100 % efficient for CCVT subsidence transient condition as based only current information. Results demonstrate the promise of the proposed method.|$|R

Therefore, the DG injected current contains both <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> and negative sequence components where the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> component can help to improve the power factor or voltage support as discussed earlier, while the negative sequence component could reduce negative sequence of voltage at PCC [46].|$|R
