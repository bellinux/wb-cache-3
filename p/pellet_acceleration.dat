40|$|A new {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} centrifuge injector for steady state plasma refuelling by solid hydrogen isotope pellets is presented and discussed. The apparatus has three new components: a screw extruder for continuous pellet production, a new rotating curved barrel for <b>pellet</b> <b>acceleration,</b> whose entrance section {{is placed on the}} axis of the centrifuge rotor, and a new pellet chopping unit. In preliminary tests, the screw extruder with the pellet chopping unit delivered a series of about 10, 000 deuterium pellets of 2 mm in size (at the rate up to 15 Hz and velocities 100 - 150 m/s) into the curved barrel with a 99 Vo reliabllitv.

40|$|ENEA and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) are collaborating on the {{development}} of a four barrel, two-stage pneumatic injector for the Ignitor experiment, featuring two innovative concepts: (i) the proper shaping of the propellant pressure pulse to improve <b>pellet</b> <b>acceleration,</b> and (ii) the use of fast closing (< 10 ms) valves to drastically reduce the expansion volumes of the propellant gas removal system. Two independent sub-systems have been built and tested separately by ENEA and ORNL. The ENEA equipment has then been shipped to Oak Ridge, where testing of the two coupled systems have started during the last year. The results of the first two short experimental campaigns, jointly carried out by ENEA and ORNL teams (May 12 - 16 and December 15 - 19 2008), as well as the latest advancement of this project will be reported...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There is {{a growing}} concern that the {{velocity}} of the DT-ice pellets being proposed to fuel ITER will not have the velocity to effectively penetrate through the pedestal of the plasma edge, because with velocities of only 300 m/s, high field side launched pellets will only penetrate to r /a = 0. 90, which may not be adequate for fueling. The likelihood of increasing the pellet velocity is problematic, since the forces on the ice pellet as it goes around bends causes the pellets to disintegrate at velocities above 300 m/s. To achieve deeper penetration, either the pellet needs to have its velocity increased after it has passed the last bend, or the pellet has to be made stronger to survive the increased forces higher velocities create. One method toward higher velocity is to accelerate the DT-ice pellets using microwave power in the last meter of the guide tube after the last bend. A second method to reach higher velocities is to increase the strength of the ice pellets using the technologies developed in the production of the fuel pellets used in Inertial Confinement Fusion. That is to either encapsulate the pellet inside a solid shell of either metal or plastic, or to stiffen the ice by integrating it into a plastic foam sphere. Analysis indicates a plastic shell will increase the strength of a DT Ice pellet by a factor of 100. Bench tests of the microwave <b>pellet</b> <b>acceleration</b> have been performed and are reported below...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to study the}} behavior and phase formation of a Si+C compacted <b>pellet</b> under centrifugal <b>acceleration</b> in a hybrid reaction. Si+C as elemental mixture {{in the form of}} a pellet is embedded in a centrifugal tube. The pellet assembly and tube are exposed to the sudden thermal energy of a thermite reaction resulted in a hybrid reaction. The hybrid reaction of thermite and Si+C produced unique phases. X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) as well as microstructural and elemental analyses are then investigated. XRD pattern showed formation of materials with possible electronic and magnetic properties. The cooling rate and the molten particle viscosity mathematical model of the process are meant to assist in understanding the physical and chemical phenomena took place during and after reaction. The results analysis revealed that up to 85 % of materials converted into secondary products as ceramics-matrix composite...|$|R
40|$|We {{obtain a}} theory {{describing}} laminar shock-like structures in a collisionless plasma {{and examine the}} parameter limits, {{in terms of the}} ion sound Mach number and the electron/ion temperature ratio, within which these structures exist. The essential feature is the inclusion of finite ion temperature with the result that some ions are reflected from a potential ramp. This destroys the symmetry between upstream and downstream regions that would otherwise give the well-known ion solitary wave solution. We have shown earlier (Cairns et al 2014 Phys. Plasmas 21 022112) that such structures may be relevant to problems such as the existence of strong, localized electric fields observed in laser compressed <b>pellets</b> and laser <b>acceleration</b> of ions. Here we present results on the way in which these structures may produce species separation in fusion targets and suggest that {{it may be possible to}} use shock ion acceleration for fast ignition.

40|$|New {{technologies}} of <b>pellet</b> production and <b>acceleration</b> for fueling and diagnostics purposes in large thermonuclear reactors are proposed. The technologies {{are intended to}} apply to the multiple-pellet injection system ""HIPEL"" for Large Helical Device of NIFS in Japan. The pellet production technology has already been tested in a pipe-gun type pellet injector. It will realize the repeating pellet injection by means of decreasing of the pellet formation time into the pipe-gun barrel. The acceleration technology is based upon a new pump tube operation in two-stage gas gun and also upon a new pump tube operation in two- stage gas gun and also upon a new conception of the allowable pressure acting on a pellet into a barrel. Some preliminary estimations have been made, and principles of a pump tube construction providing for reliable long term operation in the repeating mode without any troubles from a piston are proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} design, {{construction}} and the testbed results for a novel compact gas gun injector for solid diagnostic pellets {{of different sizes}} and materials. The injector was optimized for the diagnostic requirements of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak, yielding {{the possibility of a}} widely varying deposition profile of ablated material inside the plasma. This allows variation of the pellet velocity and the total number of injected atoms. The use of different propellant gases (He, N_ 2, H_ 2) results in an accessible velocity range from about 150 m/s to more than 600 m/s in the case of spherical carbon pellets with masses ranging from 2 x 10 " 1 " 8 to 10 " 2 " 0 atoms. Both the scattering angle (#propor to# 1) and the maximum propellant gas throughput to the tokamak (less than 10 " 1 " 6 gas particles) were found to be sufficiently low. The injector provided both high efficiency (#>=# 85 %) and high reliability during the whole testbed operation period and also during the first injection experiments performed on ASDEX Upgrade. The pellet velocities achieved for different propellant gas pressures, pellet diameters, and pellet materials were analyzed. We found that, although the pellet diameters range from 0. 45 to 0. 85 times the barrel diameter, the <b>pellet</b> <b>acceleration</b> is mostly caused by gas drag. Pellet velocities in excss of those calculated {{on the basis of the}} gas drag model were observed. Additional acceleration that increases with the pellet diameter contrary to the gas drag model may be explained by the influence of the pellet on the gas dynamics in the barrel. (orig.)

40|$|In {{experiments}} on ASDEX-Upgrade and DIII-D tokamaks, the injection of D 2 pellets from the magnetic high-field {{side of the}} plasma resulted in deeper pellet penetration and improved fueling efficiency. Based on those successful experiments, fusion researchers at the Joint European Torus and the Large Helical Device decided to implement inside launch pellet injection. These injection schemes {{require the use of}} curved guide tubes to route the <b>pellets</b> from the <b>acceleration</b> devices to the inside launch locations, and the pellets are subjected to stresses from centrifugal and impact forces in traversing the tubes. Before the installations on the large experimental fusion devices, mock-ups of the guide tubes were constructed and tested at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to determine the pellet speed limit for reliable operation without pellet fracturing. In laboratory testing of the mock-ups, {{it was found that the}} pellet speed had to be limited to a few hundreds of meters per second for intact pellets. In this paper, the test equipment and experimental results are described...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the new pellet {{injection}} system for refuelling the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak with cubic H_ 2 or D_ 2 pellets having alternative side lengths of 1. 5, 1. 75 and 2. 0 mm and optional Ne doping. The system delivers series of about one hundred pellets at a maximum repetition {{rate of more than}} 40 Hz. The pellets are accelerated by means of a centrifuge with an optimized straight acceleration arm. This configuration minimizes the compulsive force acting on the <b>pellet</b> during the <b>acceleration</b> process. Since this also minimizes stresses inside the pellet, high velocities - a maximum of 1211 m/s being achieved - are possible without destroying the hydrogen cubes. A special pellet feed-in technique based on a static stop cylinder interrupting the acceleration path successfully reduced the horizontal scattering angle to values of less than #+-# 4 degrees. Thus, a high efficiency - with more than 90 % of the pellets arriving within the acceptance angle - was achieved without using a guide tube. The whole system was found to work very reliably and reproducibly during the whole test operation period, covering about 10 " 5 pellet shots. The new centrifuge, now integrated into the ASDEX Upgrade setup, {{has proved to be a}} reliable unit even for long operation periods thus affording the possibility of quasicontinuous particle refuelling throughout a plasma discharge in ASDEX Upgrade.
