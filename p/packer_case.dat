The bullets hit her skirts and lessen the blows inflicted on her publishers behind her. McMurphy and Pry {{meet in a}} tavern to discuss the Packer story over whiskey. She begins with the five prospectors who will become victims meeting {{up for the first}} time at a boardinghouse, where the landlady tells them that Alfred Packer is the best guide in the area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The packing robot in China is less {{developed}} than western countries at present. For the demand of packaging {{in food and}} beverage industry, the integrated <b>case</b> <b>packer</b> based on robot is developed and used in production line. The scheme and layout of the system with seven subsystems is proposed. With {{the identification of the}} critical path, the process is analyzed to improve the efficiency of the integrated <b>case</b> <b>packer.</b> Finally, path planning and motion parameters of packing operation are optimized and its experimental research is carried out, which verifies the feasibility of system design. The equipment is applied in Hangzhou WaHaha Group Co., Ltd. with a desired result...|$|R
40|$|Three {{patients}} are described who had developed asthma after working as tea <b>packers.</b> In two <b>cases</b> {{the diagnosis was}} confirmed by serial monitoring of peak expiratory flow rates, bronchial responsiveness to histamine, and specific inhalation challenges in the laboratory. The third patient experienced isolated changes in bronchial responsiveness to histamine after periods of exposure at work and after specific inhalation challenges in the laboratory without showing spirometric changes. Two of the three subjects were non-atopic; none had an immediate reaction to skin prick testing with a tea solution...|$|R

In the first case, [...] "1000", the prime minister is suspected in allegedly obtaining inappropriately large-scale benefits from businessmen, among them Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and James <b>Packer.</b> The second <b>case</b> involves alleged attempts to strike a deal with publisher of the Yediot Ahronot newspaper group, Arnon Mozes, to promote legislation to weaken Yediot's main competitor, Israel Hayom, in exchange for more favorable coverage of him by Yediot.|$|R

50|$|The at-large {{selection}} of teams from mid-major conferences (which included George Mason) to the tournament was criticized by media personalities, most notably Billy <b>Packer.</b> In the <b>case</b> of George Mason, this was possibly {{because of the}} absence of Tony Skinn, who was suspended for one game by the Patriots for punching Hofstra guard Loren Stokes in the groin during the CAA tournament semifinal loss. Moreover, many believed that Hofstra, who didn't get invited to the tournament despite {{of the fact that they}} beat the Patriots twice in a span of ten days, deserved to get in instead of them. Nevertheless, the Patriots entered the tournament as an 11th seed and defeated the 6th seeded Michigan State Spartans, who had played in the previous year's Final Four.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} the simultaneous determination of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in human whole blood. The drugs were extracted with phosphate buffer at pH 6, followed by solid-phase extraction and quantification by GC/MS with electron impact ionization using helium as carrier gas. Quantification was performed using cocaine-d 3 as internal standard in selected ion monitoring mode. The method is very simple, rapid and sensitive. The specificity, linearity, intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy, and extraction recovery were fully evaluated. The limits of detection were 3. 6 ng/mL for cocaine and 6. 8 ng/mL for benzoylecgonine. The method was applied to blood samples removed at autopsy from body <b>packers</b> and stuffers <b>cases</b> in the I - IV and XV regions of Chile during 2008 - 2010...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} organic food is often {{reported}} as exceeding supply. When faced with {{just such a}} shortfall in supply, Australian egg supplier G. O. Drew Pty Ltd substituted non-organic eggs to fill the supply gap. That deception has cost the company 295, 000, the egg business has been sold, and the owners are no longer egg suppliers or <b>packers.</b> The 2007 <b>case</b> of ACCC v G. O. Drew Pty Ltd is a milestone for the Australian organic sector - {{it is the first}} Australian case where the Australian Consumer & Competition Commission (ACCC) has publicly challenged organic food labelling claims. This compares to at least 16 cases where the ACCC has successfully challenged false and/or misleading Country of Origin labelling (CoOL). Details of the case and problematic issues with the judgement are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{performance}} analysis and optimization for Carbonated Soft Drink Glass Bottle (CSDGB) filling system of a beverage plant using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach. The CSDGB system consists of seven main subsystems arranged in series namely Uncaser, Bottle Washer, Electronic Inspection Station, Filling Machine, Crowner, Coding Machine and <b>Case</b> <b>Packer.</b> Considering exponential distribution for probable failures and repairs, mathematical modeling is performed using Markov Approach (MA). The differential equations have been derived {{on the basis of}} probabilistic approach using transition diagram. These equations are solved using normalizing condition and recursive method to drive out the steady state availability expression of the system i. e. system’s performance criterion. The performance optimization of system has been carried out by varying the number of particles and number of generations. It has been observed that the maximum availability of 90. 27 % is achieved at flock size of 55 and 90. 84 % at 300 th generation. Thus, findings of the paper will be useful to the plant management for execution of proper maintenance decisions...|$|R
5000|$|The Gillies Report sketch (available on YouTube) also parodied Packer's own recent self-serving {{appearance}} {{to defend himself}} on his own network's current affairs show, which was in itself a highly unusual move for the notoriously media-wary millionaire. It opened with Patrick Cook, in barrister's garb, putting questions to 'Packer' (Gillies), about the allegations. He at first responds amiably, but gradually becomes enraged by the interrogation, and the hostile reaction of the audience, and finally smashes up his desk, revealing {{that he has a}} long lizard-like tail. As the cast perform a satirical quasi-operatic song about the <b>case,</b> <b>Packer</b> - now transformed into [...] "The Goanna" [...] - is pursued through the TV station by the mob, but (parodying King Kong) he escapes by scaling the transmitter tower of Packer's Sydney TV station TCN-9 where, now grown to gigantic size, he catches and crushes a news helicopter from a rival network. The desk-smashing also lampooned Packer's famously volcanic temper, and referenced a well-known rumour of the time, which claimed that Packer once smashed up his own office in a fit of rage during one of his many attempts to quit smoking.|$|R
