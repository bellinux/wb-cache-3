50|$|The report {{authors found}} that while burning some {{biofuels}} can reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, not all biofuel use leads to cuts in greenhouse gases.

For example, {{the researchers found that}} <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> <b>biodiesel</b> could reduce emissions when compared to fossil fuels by 80 per cent. However, if the plant from which the palm oil was extracted was grown on cropland from cleared tropical forests, greenhouse gas emissions could be as much as 800 per cent higher. And if the land used to grow the palms was cleared from ancient peatlands, the emissions increase over using fossil fuels could rise to 2000 per cent.

Finally, for investors, the benefits of diversification in spreading risks to different commodity markets may be less effective given the dependence of the agricultural commodities, analysed in this paper, to crude oil.

Recently, a free, soluble Thermomyces lanuginosus (TL) 1, 3 specific lipase has shown promise as biocatalyst, reportedly yielding up to 96 % ASTM D 6751 compliant biodiesel after 24 h transesterification of soybean, canola oils and other feedstocks. Biodiesel conversion rate and quality of enzymatically catalyzed transesterification of Jatropha oil was evaluated. Two lipases: free, soluble TL and immobilized Candida antarctica (CA) catalyzed methanolic transesterification of crude Jatropha and refined <b>palm</b> <b>oil.</b> Results: Jatropha yields were similar to palm biodiesel with NaOH as catalyst. After 24 h transesterification, Jatropha (81 %) and <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> (86 %) <b>biodiesel</b> yields with TL as catalyst {{were significantly higher than}} CA ( 90 %). Enzymatic catalysts (TL and CA) produced Jatropha biodiesel with optimum flow properties but did not complied with ASTM D 6751 stability parameters (free fatty acid content and oil stability index). Conclusions: Biodiesel production with filtered, degummed, low FFA Jatropha oil using a free liquid lipase (TL) as catalyst showed higher yielding potential than immobilized CA lipase as substitute of RBD <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> with alkaline catalyst. However, Jatropha enzymatic biodiesel yield and stability were inferior to alkaline catalyzed biodiesel and not in compliance with international quality standards. Lower quality due to incomplete alcoholysis and esterification, potential added costs due to need of more than 24 h to achieve comparable biodiesel yields and extra post-transesterification refining reactions are among the remaining drawbacks for the environmentally friendlier enzymatic catalysis of crude Jatropha oil to become an economically viable alternative to chemical catalysis...|$|R

Innovative technologies and processes for the treatment of by-products can contribute significantly for meeting the emission targets. Build upon the research, resulted to the recommendation to use biochar and capturing methane from POME. The research result was also concerned that emission savings are annulled in the case of land use change (LUC) and <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> production on peatland. Based on this research resulted to recommended that the utilization of waste from <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> cultivation on peatland which was disuse and the capturing of methane from POM...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound is {{predicted}} {{to be able to}} accelerate the chemical reaction, to increase the conversion of plant <b>oil</b> into <b>biodiesel,</b> and to decrease the need of catalyst and energy input. The application of ultrasound for processing of biodiesel and the mathematical model were conducted in this research. The result of the experiments showed that the ultrasound increased reaction rate and the conversion of <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> into <b>biodiesel</b> up to 100 %. It was better than the process with mechanical stirrer that the conversion was just 96 %. The duration to complete the process using ultrasound was 1 minute. It was 30 to 120 times faster than that withmechanical stirrer. Ultrasound transforms mechanical energy into inner energy of the fluids and causes an increasing of temperature. Simultaneously, natural mixing process undergo because of acoustic circulation. Simulation with experiment data showed that the acceleration of transesterification with ultrasound was affected not only by natural mixing and increasing temperature. The cavitation, surface tension of micro bubble, and hot spot accelerate chemical reaction. In fact, transesterification of <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> with ultrasound still needs catalyst. It needs only about 20 % of catalyst compared to the process with mechanical stirrer...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> as a biofuel {{has been}} heavily debated for its land-use {{conflict}} with nature and its competition with food production, being {{the number one}} cooking oil worldwide. In that context, we present a life cycle assessment of a <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> production process yielding both <b>biodiesel</b> and cooking <b>oil,</b> incorporating the land-use impact and evaluating the effect of treating the <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> mill effluent (POME) prior to disposal. The {{results show that the}} nonrenewable energy requirement, global warming potential (GWP; exclusive land-use change), and acidification potential are lower than those of the fossil alternative. However, the system triggers an increase in eutrophication potential (EP) compared to the fossil fuel reference. This system shows less energy requirement, global warming and acidification reduction, and less eutrophication increase compared to the reference than the same system converting all <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> into <b>biodiesel</b> (no cooking <b>oil</b> production). The land occupation of <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> triggers ecosystem quality (EQ) loss of 30 - 45 % compared to the potential natural vegetation. Furthermore, such land-use change triggers a carbon debt neutralizing the GWP reduction for 45 - 53 years. The POME treatment scenarios reveal a trade-off between GWP and EP.
