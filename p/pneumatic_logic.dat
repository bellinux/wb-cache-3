50|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>logic</b> is a {{reliable}} and functional control method for industrial processes. In recent years, these systems have largely been replaced by electronic control systems in new installations because of the smaller size, lower cost, greater precision, and more powerful features of digital controls. Pneumatic devices are still used where upgrade cost, or safety factors dominate.|$|E
50|$|Logic gates are {{primarily}} implemented using diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches, {{but can also}} be constructed using vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relays (relay logic), fluidic logic, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>logic,</b> optics, molecules, or even mechanical elements. With amplification, logic gates can be cascaded {{in the same way}} that Boolean functions can be composed, allowing the construction of a physical model of all of Boolean logic, and therefore, all of the algorithms and mathematics that can be described with Boolean logic.|$|E
40|$|Fluid {{handling}} procedures like {{serial dilution}} {{are common to}} a number of laboratory protocols. Such procedures are time consuming and require laboratory training to be performed. Thus using microfluidics technology for such procedures is very promising. Whereas {{there are a number of}} innovative lab-on-a-chip systems that use microfluidics to miniaturize lab procedures, these devices require heavy off-chip equipments to operate. For example a typical setup consists of a pump, a computer, tons of tubing and more. Such dependency on off-chip machinery limits microfluidic liquid handling devices only to highly-equipped settings. Therefore to exploit the microfluidic technology such that the devices are also useful for limited resource settings and other applications (e. g. point-of-care diagnostics), it is important to minimize or eliminate the dependence of these devices on off-chip control equipments. Automation of fluid-handling microfluidic devices can be achieved by incorporating the control logic in the chip design. <b>Pneumatic</b> digital <b>logic</b> structures can be built on the chip and can be used to provide timing reference and also control signals for operations such as mixing/diluting, selection, storage and routing of liquid on the chip. This project explores the usefulness of <b>pneumatic</b> digital <b>logic</b> for the purpose of automation of fluid handling microdevices. Serial dilution, which is a very common laboratory procedure, is automated on-chip such that the chip requires only one constant vacuum source for power and one clock signal to operate. Logic circuits such as the microfluidic oscillator, the finite state machine and, decoding circuits are employed to automate a fluid-handling circuit on the chip. This report discusses how these <b>pneumatic</b> digital <b>logic</b> structures can be integrated and optimized in order to control and operate a fluid-handling structure that carries out on-chip serial dilution...|$|R

40|$|Presented on April 22, 2009, from 4 - 5 pm in room G 011 of the Molecular Science and Engineering Building on the Georgia Tech Campus. Runtime: 52 : 32 minutesThe {{field of}} {{microfluidics}} is uniquely poised to significantly impact the biomedical sciences through the miniaturization and massive parallelization of biochemical assays. For example, future advances in microfluidics could revolutionize disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and pathogen detection. In our work, {{we focus on}} components and integrated systems {{that can be used}} in health-related biochemical analysis. Construction of such systems is currently relatively easy; there are a large number of published “lab on a chip” systems constructed from a variety of substrates using different actuation, sensing, and control components. However, there are still relatively few microfluidic diagnostic systems commercially available. Although there are many reasons, one possible explanation for this scarcity is the complex interconnect requirements of many pneumatically actuated analysis chips. In an attempt to overcome this disadvantage, we have developed microfluidic components and systems that strive to reduce the required number of pneumatic interconnects. For instance, a single pressure input can be sent to multiple temperature-regulated venturis, each of which is capable of generating a unique pressure signal. In addition to electronically controlled components, pneumatically controlled components can be used such as <b>pneumatic</b> <b>logic</b> gates and decoders. These and other components will be discussed in terms of integrated biochemical analysis systems...|$|E

Typical courses include math, communications, circuits, digital devices and electrical controls. Other courses include robotics, automation, electrical motor controls, programmable logic controllers, and computer-aided design. [...] Good math and analytic skills {{are essential to}} understand automated systems and isolate problems. In addition to programming, Automation Technicians are expected to become proficient with various instruments and hand tools for troubleshooting, such as electrical multimeters, signal analyzers, and frequency counters.Employers generally prefer applicants who have completed an automation technician certificate or associate degree. These programs can be completed at Colleges and Universities in either an in-class or online format. Some Colleges, such as George Brown College, offer an online Automation Technician program that uses simulation software, LogixSim, to complete automation lab projects and assignments.|$|R
40|$|Microfluidics is an {{adaptation}} of semiconductor technology {{to the creation of}} circuits of gas and liquid. They have enabled the establishment of mechanical and liquid circuits with complexity similar to integrated electrical circuits. However, while the microfluidic chips have been miniaturized, their external governing systems have remained unchanged. This lack of embedded control transforms the small chip into a large and often cumbersome system. Next generation of microfluidic systems will allow reduction or removal of these controllers. Various successful microfluidics for reduction of these external requirements has been demonstrated. However, an autonomous, self-contained, programmable microfluidic finite state machines (FSM) that only requires power to operate has remained absent. In this work, we present sequential logic circuits implemented in microfluidics rather than electronics for the autonomous control of liquid networks. We demonstrate microcontrollers, simple pneumatic computers, built entirely out of microfluidic parts. We also demonstrate a programmable FSM, first programmable microfluidic computer, built out of <b>pneumatic</b> Boolean <b>logic</b> gates and channels. We show a 6 -bit asynchronous pneumatic counters, useful as an embedded timing reference. Added to the controllers we create liquid systems such as a 7 stage 1 : 1 serial diluter system, i. e. serial dilution ladder. Finally, we integrate liquid networks with these controllers to create self-contained microfluidic systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} {{detailed}} understanding of fundamental and advanced components towards {{the widespread use}} of microfluidic systems are addressed in this dissertation. First, to understand mixing in microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems, discrete droplet mixing in microchannels was examined using mathematical modeling, simulations, and experiments. The microfluidic mixing occurs in three distinct regimes (diffusion-dominated, dispersion-dominated, and convection-dominated) depending on the Péclet number and the droplet dimensions. Using mathematically developed asymptotic curves, it was possible to predict the mixing time and required channel distance for any Péclet numbers. The mixing of typical drops (~ 3000 um long) in microchannels (100 ~ 500 um) resulted in mixing times of 0. 001 ~ 10000 seconds depending on the drop velocity. Simulations and experiments of the mixing of two discrete drops agreed well with the theoretical limits. Second, novel microfluidic components for discrete drop mixing and routing in lab-on-a-chip systems have been developed. The membranous air bypass valve (MBV) in PDMS allows air to pass through but stops liquid. Using two-dimensional and three-dimensional MBVs, the trapped air between discrete drops was rapidly removed at the aspiration rate of ~ 65 nL/s. MBVs with semicircular membranes could also act as fluidic diodes that allow only unidirectional flow at operating pressures of 12 ~ 24 kPa. Complex drop routing was possible with multiple fluidic diodes embedded. Third, a user-friendly device construction methodology using prefabrication of microfluidic assembly blocks in PDMS was introduced to allow users to build custom microfluidic systems without any fabrication expertise. Complete sealing was done by applying adhesive materials such as the PDMS curing agent and UV-curable glues between blocks. Using the square blocks of the size of 16 mm 2, we demonstrated common microfluidic applications including laminar flow development, valve control, and cell culturing. Finally, digital pneumatic microprocessors have been developed as universal on-chip control platforms to multiplex a single <b>pneumatic</b> input. <b>Logic</b> components such as AND, NOR, flip-flops, and shift-registers were constructed and linked to compute, store, and parallelize serially-encoded input signals. The resulting parallel outputs were used to control multiple valves, pumps, channels, and chambers, independently. By significantly reducing the need for external controllers, digital pneumatic microprocessors could facilitate {{the widespread use of}} microfluidic systems...|$|R
40|$|Pneumatic {{actuator}} {{is widely}} used in the automation industry and {{in the field of}} automatic control due to its advantages such as high power to weight ratio, costeffective and uses air as a clean medium to drive it. However, pneumatic actuator also has some drawback in control due to the nonlinear factors such as air compressibility and friction. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to design a controller that will control the position of the cylinder <b>pneumatic</b> stroke. Fuzzy <b>Logic</b> Control is proposed because of its simplicity in terms of less mathematical equation and also its performance in controlling the nonlinearities. Three different types of Fuzzy Logic controller were designed and compared to observe the performance of the controller in controlling the pneumatic actuator. An optimization method of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used in tuning the fuzzy control parameter. PSO is used to find the best value of the parameter involved in the controller design. Both controllers and optimization method are designed using MATLAB/Simulink platform from position transfer function obtained by System Identification (SI) technique. Then, the simulation results are analyzed and validated with real-time experiment using the Data Acquisition (DAQ) card. The experiment has been done to the pneumatic actuator with different loads and positions target. A Pneumatic Ball and Beam System (PABBS) is proposed as the application of the position controller. The mathematical model of the system is developed and tested with simulation and experiments for its fast response and stability in controlling the ball movement. Results show that Proportional-Derivative Fuzzy Logic Controller (PD-Fuzzy) offers better control compared to other controllers in terms of stability and robustness for the pneumatic actuator and cascaded PD-Fuzzy controller gives better control compared with position and rate feedback controller for the PABBS application...|$|R
