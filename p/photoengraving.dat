5|$|Washington's son, George Washington, Jr., {{served for}} a time as {{treasurer}} of his father's company, and, like his father, dabbled in invention, patenting a widely used <b>photoengraving</b> process for newspapers that was introduced by Fairchild Camera and Instrument in 1948.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photoengraving</b> uses a {{photomask}} and developer to selectively {{remove a}} UV-sensitive photoresist coating and thus create a photoresist mask. Direct imaging techniques are sometimes used for high-resolution requirements. Experiments {{were made with}} thermal resist.|$|E
25|$|Traditional engraving, by burin or {{with the}} use of machines, {{continues}} to be practised by goldsmiths, glass engravers, gunsmiths and others, while modern industrial techniques such as <b>photoengraving</b> and laser engraving have many important applications. Engraved gems were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers relief as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.|$|E

25|$|Chandler ran the {{newspaper}} {{for the next}} 43 years, first as The Bend Bulletin and after 1963 as The Bulletin. During his tenure, Chandler brought new technology into his newspaper operation. Soon after he bought the paper in 1953, he expanded the <b>photoengraving</b> facilities. In 1956, he replaced the paper's flatbed press with a new rotary press that printed 13,000 32-page sections per hour. The new press also allowed the paper to print photographs in color.|$|E
500|$|Ukiyo-e artists had {{traditionally}} illustrated {{urban life}} and society – especially the theater, for which their prints often served as advertising.

500|$|Ichirō {{raised his}} son under the {{influence}} of the liberal educational principles of Nakae Chōmin. Ichirō was responsible for the welfare of five of his wife's siblings, and so at age 11, after four years of primary school, the family finances did not permit Kanae's schooling to continue. He became an apprentice wood engraver and mastered Western techniques of tonal gradation in the workshop of Sakurai Torakichi in Shiba. His training focused on book and newspaper illustration, and included letterpress printing and <b>photoengraving.</b> His skill developed quickly and soon won praise from those he worked with. During this time printing technology underwent rapid change, brought to the forefront by the First Sino-Japanese War, which was reported in a variety of media, from paintings and woodblock prints to photographs. Kanae completed his apprenticeship at 18, followed by an obligatory year of service with Sakurai. By 1896, Ichirō had earned his medical license and set up a practice in [...] (now part of Ueda), a village in Nagano Prefecture.|$|E

[...] "Rusty", as Powell was known, graduated from Providence Country Day School in 1962. He was a standout football player in high school.|$|E
2500|$|West Shore {{magazine}} produced many finely executed {{illustrations of}} scenery, architecture, and commerce in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Montana, British Columbia, and Alaska. [...] However, its original illustrations {{were limited to}} small black and white wood engravings. [...] It added lithography in 1878. [...] Color lithography illustrations were introduced in 1886. [...] Finally, the magazine switched to halftone <b>photoengraving</b> just prior to closing in 1891.|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1980s, {{most large}} {{newspapers}} were printed with turn-of-the-century [...] "letterpress" [...] technology using easily smudged oil-based ink, off-white, low-quality [...] "newsprint" [...] paper, and coarse engraving screens. While letterpresses produced legible text, the <b>photoengraving</b> dots that formed pictures often bled or smeared and became fuzzy and indistinct. In this way, even when newspapers used photographs well— a good crop, a respectable size— murky reproduction often left readers re-reading the caption {{to see what}} the photo was all about. The Wall Street Journal adopted stippled hedcuts in 1979 to publish portraits and avoid the limitations of letterpress printing. Not until the 1980s did a majority of newspapers switch to [...] "offset" [...] presses that reproduce photos with fidelity on better, whiter paper.|$|E

2500|$|In London, the India House settled Acharya's {{short-term}} worries of {{food and}} shelter. With financial support from the organisation, Acharya was able to enroll to learn <b>photoengraving</b> at the trade school of the London County Council. However, India House, by this time, was considered [...] "The most dangerous organisation outside India" [...] and had attracted enough attention for its nationalist opinions to {{be discussed in the}} British Parliament. Prominent London newspapers including The Times demanded that Shyamji Krishna Varma, the founder of India House, be prosecuted for preaching [...] "disloyal sentiments" [...] to Indian students. By September 1907, The Indian Sociologist, published by the India House, was deemed [...] "seditious literature" [...] and was banned in India. It was at India House that Acharya was introduced to V.D. Savarkar.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{advocate}} of the <b>photoengraving</b> process over wood engraving for magazine reproduction of illustrative art, Remington became an accepted expert in reproduction methods, which helped gain him strong working relationships with editors and printers. Furthermore, Remington's skill as a businessman was equal to his artistry, unlike many other artists who relied on their spouses or business agents or no one at all to run their financial affairs. He was an effective publicist and promoter of his art. He insisted that his originals be handled carefully and returned to him in pristine condition (without editor's marks) so he could sell them. He carefully regulated his output to maximize his income and kept detailed notes about his works and his sales. In 1991 the PBS series American Masters filmed a documentary of Remington's life called [...] produced and directed by Tom Neff.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1875, when Carpeaux {{was made}} Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor, Știrbei {{was the first}} to bring him the news, at the church in Courbevoie. The artist died a few weeks later at Bécon, [...] "consoled by the {{touching}} care of his princely host." [...] Controversially, Știrbei had purchased Carpeaux's drawings (including his study after the cadaver of Victor Liet) and his seal of authenticity, which technically allowed him to pass plaster cast as the originals; for several years, he battled in court with the Carpeaux estate over ownership of these items, ultimately relinquishing the seal. Before donating the drawings, Știrbei released them as an album, published using <b>photoengraving.</b> Carpeaux's tomb was another issue of contention: the Prince had ordered the body to be buried in Courbevoie, giving it a lavish funeral. The widow, who was kept absent from the ceremony, sued and won, taking the remains to Valenciennes.|$|E
50|$|When Reuter {{was growing}} up, Berlin {{was a major}} {{cultural}} center. He {{did not want to}} be a photographer, but rather an actor and dancer. He did some performing as a young man, such as in a chorus directed by Georg Gotsch in 1923. To earn money, he worked as a <b>photoengraver,</b> an activity he taught himself, first at Sahm& Co. printing house in 1920 than at Artes Gráficas Büxenstein in 1925.|$|R

25|$|In 1899, photoengravers in New York City went {{on strike}} to demand a 48-hour work week. ITU President S.B. Donnelly refused to support the local, fearing {{employers}} might retaliate. The New York City photoengravers won their strike, {{but the lack of}} ITU support led most of the union's <b>photoengraver</b> locals to seek disaffiliation. A national convention in Philadelphia in November 1900 saw the photoengravers leaving the ITU and establishing the International Photo-Engravers' Union of North America. ITU President James M. Lynch, pressured the AFL into refusing to recognize the photoengravers' union until May 1904.|$|R

50|$|Nicéphore Niépce (born Joseph Niépce; 7 March 1765 - 5 July 1833) was a French inventor, now usually {{credited}} as {{the inventor}} of photography and a pioneer in that field. Niépce developed heliography, a technique he used to create the world's oldest surviving product of a photographic process: a print made from a <b>photoengraved</b> printing plate in 1825. In 1826 or 1827, he used a primitive camera to produce the oldest surviving photograph of a real-world scene. Among Niépce's other inventions was the Pyréolophore, the world's first internal combustion engine, which he conceived, created, and developed with his older brother Claude.|$|R
5000|$|Fleischer {{began his}} career at The Brooklyn Daily Eagle first as an Errand Boy, and was {{advanced}} to Photographer, <b>Photoengraver,</b> and later, became a staff Cartoonist. At first he drew single panel editorial cartoons, then graduated to the full strips, [...] "Little Algie," [...] and [...] "S.K. Sposher, the Camera Fiend." [...] These satirical strips reflected his life in Brownsville and his fascination with technology and photography respectively-both displaying his sense of irony and fatalism. It was during this period he met newspaper cartoonist and early animator, John Randolph Bray, who would later give him his start in the animation field.|$|R
50|$|After {{studying}} at the University of Nantes, he initially {{worked as a}} <b>photoengraver</b> before becoming a camera operator. At the Film d'Art company in 1915 he was noticed by Abel Gance and began a collaboration with him which extended over 16 films, including J'accuse, La Roue, and Napoléon. In the period of silent films he also worked on several productions with Jacques Feyder. During the 1930s he worked regularly with Jean Dréville and Henri Decoin. With Le Journal d'un curé de campagne, for which he won the best cinematography award at the Venice Film Festival in 1951, Burel began another important collaboration with the director Robert Bresson which continued through three further films. Burel also directed three films himself between 1922 and 1932.|$|R
