50|$|Humans {{perceive}} the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> a transverse <b>flute</b> at the amplified 2nd harmonic or more commonly, one octave above the produced fundamental.|$|R
50|$|The foot end <b>of</b> the <b>flute</b> {{can have}} {{direction}} holes.These holes affect the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>flute</b> {{when all the}} finger holes are covered.The direction holes also relate to (and derive their name from) the Four Directions ofEast, South, West, and North found in many Native American stories.The direction holes can also be called the tuning holes or wind holes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> {{a vessel}} <b>flute</b> is {{affected}} by how hard the player blows. Breath force can change the pitch by three semitones. This is why vessel flutes generally have no tuning mechanism, and why {{it is hard to}} learn to play a vessel flute in tune.|$|R
50|$|In practice, the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> {{a vessel}} <b>flute</b> is also {{affected}} by how hard the player blows. If more holes are open, {{it is necessary}} to blow harder, which raises the pitch. The high notes tend to go sharp; the low notes, flat. To compensate, fingering charts soon diverge from the plain binary progression.|$|R
25|$|The lülü {{formed the}} ritual scale to which many {{instruments}} were tuned. The {{name of the}} lowest sound, huangzhong also implyed 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> zithers, <b>flutes</b> and singers <b>of</b> imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations. The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve fundamental notes {{for the construction of}} the musical scales themselves. The lülü also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.|$|R
50|$|The oldest phase at Jiahu only {{contains}} two flutes, which are tetratonic and pentatonic; the middle phase at Jiahu contains several flutes, including an interesting pair <b>of</b> hexatonic <b>flutes.</b> One <b>of</b> the <b>flutes</b> was broken, {{and the other}} flute {{seems to be a}} replica <b>of</b> the first <b>flute,</b> as it shows evidence of adjustments made to match the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the first. Innovations in the last phase include the use <b>of</b> heptatonic <b>flutes.</b> The flutes were cut, smoothed at the ends, polished and finally drilled with a row of holes on one side. One <b>of</b> the broken <b>flutes</b> was repaired by drilling fourteen tiny holes along the breakage lines and then tying the sections together with hemp string.|$|R

40|$|The choice <b>of</b> {{corrugated}} medium, <b>flute</b> size, combining adhesive, and linerboards can be varied {{to design}} a corrugated board with specific properties. In this paper, the nonlinear finite element analysis of the fluted corrugated sheet in the corrugated cardboard based on software SolidWorks 2008 was investigated. The model of corrugated board with three or more flutes is reliable for stress and displacement measurement to eliminate {{the influence of the}} number <b>of</b> <b>flutes</b> in models. According to the static pressure test, with the increase <b>of</b> <b>flute</b> height H or arc radius <b>of</b> <b>flute,</b> the maximum stress in the models decreased and the maximum displacement increased. However the maximum stress and maximum displacement in the models increase nonlinearly in the static pressure test with the increase <b>of</b> the <b>flute</b> angle θ. According to the drop test, with the increase <b>of</b> <b>flute</b> height H, the maximum stress of goods on the upper board in the drop test decreased. The maximum stress of the model in the drop test decreases firstly and then increases with the increase <b>of</b> <b>flute</b> angle, and the optimal flute angle θ could be 60 ° for corrugated board. All the conclusions are consistent with experimental data or product standards...|$|R
