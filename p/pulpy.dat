One of these, called tī para or tī tāwhiti, was grown because it suckers readily and forms multiple ﬂeshy rhizomes. A dwarf non-flowering selection of C.australis, {{it has a}} rubbery, <b>pulpy</b> stem, and thick green leaves. Although it was recorded by the early naturalists, botanists only rediscovered it in the 1990s, being grown by gardeners as the cultivar Cordyline 'Thomas Kirk'. Recent and unpublished DNA work suggests it derives from C.australis of the central North Island.|$|E

[...] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, rated the film 66 out of 100 based on 43 reviews from critics indicating [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews.

Although a completely xylem-free carrot is not possible, some cultivars have small and deeply pigmented cores; the taproot can appear to lack a core when the colour of the cortex and core are similar in intensity.

500|$|Flying Aces was {{a monthly}} American {{periodical}} {{of short stories}} about aviation, {{one of a number}} of so-called [...] "flying pulp" [...] magazines popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Like other pulp magazines, it was a collection of adventure stories, originally printed on coarse, <b>pulpy</b> paper but later moved to a slick format. The magazine was launched in October 1928 by Periodical House, Inc. It featured stories written and illustrated by known authors of the day, often set against the background of World War I. Later issues added non-fiction aviation articles, as well as articles and plans for model airplanes. The latter became more prominent, and eventually the magazine was renamed Flying Models, and catered exclusively to aeromodeling hobbyists.|$|E
500|$|Two of Johansson's {{films in}} 2006 {{explored}} {{the world of}} stage magicians, both opposite Hugh Jackman. Allen cast her opposite Jackman and himself in the film Scoop (2006), in which she played a journalism student. The film was a modest worldwide box office success, but polarized critics. Ebert was critical of the film, but found Johansson [...] "lovely as always", and Mick LaSalle opined that she [...] "brings deftness and freshness" [...] to her part. She also appeared in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia, a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria. Johansson later {{said she was a}} fan of DePalma and had wanted to work with him on the film. Nonetheless, she thought that she was [...] "physically wrong" [...] for the part, and Anne Billson of The Daily Telegraph likewise found her miscast. CNN noted that she [...] "takes to the <b>pulpy</b> period atmosphere as if it were oxygen".|$|E
500|$|Inside Man has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes sampled 197 reviews, and currently has an 86% rating, making it [...] "Certified Fresh". The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Spike Lee's energetic and clever bank-heist thriller {{is a smart}} genre film {{that is not only}} rewarding on its own terms, but manages to subvert its <b>pulpy</b> trappings with wit and skill -- and Denzel Washington is terrific as a brilliant hostage negotiator." [...] Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned Inside Man a weighted average score of 76 (out of 100) based on 39 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be [...] "generally favorable reviews". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] on an A+ to F scale, with exit polls showing that 54% of the audience was male, while 68% was at least 30 years old or older. The American Film Institute named Inside Man {{as one of the top}} ten films of 2006.|$|E
500|$|Like other ornithischians, Ankylosaurus was herbivorous. Its wide muzzle {{was adapted}} for non-selective low-browse cropping, {{although}} comparisons of beak shape with [...] Euoplocephalus suggest {{it was more}} selective than the latter. Ankylosaurus likely feed on [...] abundant ferns and low bushes. Though ankylosaurs may not have fed on fibrous and woody plants, {{they may have had}} a more varied diet, including tough leaves and <b>pulpy</b> fruits. The retraced position of the nostrils, which have been compared to those of fossorial worm lizards and blind snakes, may have allowed Ankylosaurus to dig in the ground for roots and tubers. It could also have occasionally eaten small invertebrates. With its low center of gravity, it would to have been unable to knock down trees as in modern elephants, and is unlikely to have been capable of stripping off and chewing bark. Assuming it was endothermic, Ankylosaurus would have eaten [...] of food per day.|$|E
500|$|White {{was willing}} to print a variety of fiction, with {{traditional}} stories side-by-side with more experimental material that {{was influenced by the}} British New Wave or by 1960s psychedelia. In 1971 he serialized Ursula K. Le Guin's The Lathe of Heaven, about a man whose dreams can modify reality. One writer who was influenced by this was James Tiptree, Jr., who later wrote that [...] "after first plowing into the first <b>pulpy</b> pages of the 1971 Amazing in which Lathe came out, my toe-nails began to curl under and my spine hair stood up." [...] White's willingness to experiment led to Amazing running more stories with sexual content than other magazines. One such story, White's own [...] "Growing Up Fast in the City", was criticized as pornographic by some of Amazings readers. Other stories, such as Rich Brown's [...] "Two of a Kind", about the violent rape of a black woman and the subsequent death of her rapists, also led to controversy. White also printed more conventional fiction, however, much of it of high quality. The magazine was nominated for the Hugo award (a readers' award, named for Hugo Gernsback) for best editor three times during his tenure (1970, 1971 and 1972), finishing third each time.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of Imperial Bedrooms began after Ellis had re-read Less Than Zero during {{the writing of}} his 2005 pseudo-memoir, Lunar Park. The novel {{takes its name from}} Elvis Costello's 1982 album Imperial Bedroom, just as Less Than Zero had been named for a Costello single. Upon reading Zero, Ellis began to reflect on how his characters would have developed in the interim. Soon, he found himself [...] "overwhelm" [...] by the idea of what would become Imperial Bedrooms as it continually returned to him. After gestating the idea, and making [...] "voluminous notes", Ellis realised that his detailed outline had become longer than the finished book. He felt that this process of note-taking limited him to the novels that he genuinely wanted [...] "to stay with for a couple of years". To this, he attributed having [...] "written so few novels". Ellis's biggest influence in the course of writing Imperial Bedrooms was American novelist Raymond Chandler, citing his particular brand of <b>pulpy</b> noir fiction. He found particular inspiration in the opacity of Chandler's fiction, citing the lack of closure in some of the books, which he called [...] "existentialist masterpieces." [...] He also admired the cynical worldview that Chandler created, and his particular sense of style and mood. In terms of his own plotting, however, he opined that [...] "plots really don't matter", nor solutions to mysteries, because it's [...] "the mood that's so enthralling... kind of universal, this idea of a man searching for something or moving through this moral landscape and trying to protect himself from it, and yet he's still forced to investigate it." [...] Part of the [...] "impetus" [...] behind Imperial Bedrooms, which Ellis [...] "wrestled with", was to try and dispel the [...] "sentimental" [...] view of Less Than Zero that made it, to some, [...] "an artifact of the 80s" [...] alongside [...] "John Hughes movies and Ray-Bans and Fast Times at Ridgemont High"; he felt he began assessing audience's reactions to his work when working on Lunar Park.|$|E
500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film an A- {{describing}} {{the film as}} [...] "a friskier, sweeter-natured variation" [...] when compared to Raimi's work. She explained that the most [...] "amazing" [...] element was not the [...] "blockbuster wow!" [...] but instead the [...] "intimate awww." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today explained that [...] "as {{a new chapter in}} the superpowered arachnid saga, it stands on its own quite nicely, focusing more on human emotions than on a panoply of special effects." [...] She said [...] "where Tobey Maguire in the original Spider-Man trilogy was earnest, Garfield's Spider-Man is whip-smart and likably cheeky, with an undercurrent of teenage angst." [...] She also called the film [...] "as much a coming-of-age story as a crime-fighting action saga." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described Garfield's Spider-Man as an arrogant and misunderstood outsider, giving the film a [...] "restless, reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger." [...] She also concluded that Webb was a different sort of director, saying that while Webb's big set pieces lacked Raimi's imagination, they conveyed [...] "emotional truth" [...] and [...] "a pervasive sense of humanity". However, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe felt that the film lacked the original's pop grace and the <b>pulpy</b> joy, saying the film was [...] "dumbed down, tarted up" [...] and [...] "almost shockingly uninspired". Burr evaluated it as [...] "the worst superhero film since Green Lantern". Colin Covert of the Star Tribune also felt that The Amazing Spider-Man is weaker than its predecessor and described it as [...] "The Notebook in spandex". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the reboot provided better reasons for why Peter Parker adopts his superhero role, even if the origin story didn't need to be told once again. He also remarked that it was [...] "probably the second best" [...] of the four Spider-Man films after Spider-Man 2, explaining that Lizard was lackluster compared to that film's villain, Doctor Octopus, and had the dramatic range of Godzilla.|$|E

2500|$|Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger {{finds the}} series [...] "shiny, attractive, and—on the whole—entertaining". But {{he adds that}} [...] "given the premise (and skill of the writers) it really should have shot for <b>pulpy</b> thrills instead of stately {{political}} intrigue." [...] Theron Martin says [...] "for the series as a whole to be worth watching, though, the storytelling and character development need to improve". Melissa Harper adds it is a [...] "slick, well animated show" [...] but [...] "disjointed story {{makes it difficult to}} know or care what is going on". Hypers Daniel Wilks comments that the anime is [...] "for most part rather formulaic but the series does really pick up {{when it comes to the}} action scenes which are fast, frenetic, highly creative and beautifully animated".|$|E
2500|$|Ian Nathan of Empire {{described}} Carrie-Anne Moss as [...] "a major find", {{praised the}} [...] "surreal visual highs" [...] enabled by the bullet time (or [...] "flo-mo") effect, {{and described the}} film as [...] "technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool". Nathan remarked that although the film's [...] "looney plot" [...] would not stand up to scrutiny, {{that was not a}} big flaw because [...] "The Matrix is about pure experience". Maitland McDonagh said in her review for TV Guide, [...] "The Wachowski Brothers' through-the-looking-glass plot... manages to work surprisingly well on a number of levels: as a dystopian sci-fi thriller, as a brilliant excuse for the film's lavish and hyperkinetic fight scenes, and as a pretty compelling call to the dead-above-the-eyeballs masses to unite and cast off their chains... This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, <b>pulpy</b> sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critic Stephanie Zacharek of Salon {{states that}} [...] "this {{adaptation}} of Cormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't <b>pulpy</b> and visceral, {{the kind of}} thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points– that's nothing new– but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your hands dirty. No Country for Old Men feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it's an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones, as if he were a schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town." ...|$|E
2500|$|That same year, RKO put {{out another}} {{historically}} notable film made at low cost {{and with an}} only faintly starry cast: the 85-minute-long Split Second comes to a head in a desert ghost town {{about to become a}} nuclear blast site, making it perhaps the first example of an [...] "atomic noir." [...] The most famous such movie, Kiss Me Deadly (1955), independently produced by Victor Saville and his Parklane Pictures company, typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and B picture. Film historian Richard Maltby identifies it as a [...] "programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatre's double-bill [...] budgeted at approximately $400,000. [...] distributor, United Artists, released around twenty-five programmers with production budgets between $100,000 and $400,000 in 1955. For UA, these movies served to spread the overhead costs of their distribution operation rather than to make profits in themselves." [...] The film's length, 106minutes, is A level, but its star, Ralph Meeker, had previously appeared in only one major film. It is based on an unequivocally <b>pulpy</b> source, one of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels, but is directed in a self-consciously aestheticized fashion by Robert Aldrich. The result is a brutal genre picture that chillingly evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb.|$|E

60|$|A full account will {{be given}} in the next chapter {{of the effects of}} heat on the leaves, and I need here only state that leaves {{immersed}} for a short time in water at a temperature of 120oFahr. (48o.8 Cent.), which, as we have seen, does not immediately induce aggregation, were then placed in a few drops of a strong solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 109 of water, and became finely aggregated. On the other hand, leaves, after an immersion in water at 150o (65o.5 Cent.), on being placed in the same strong solution, did not undergo aggregation, the cells becoming filled with brownish, <b>pulpy,</b> or muddy matter. With leaves subjected to temperatures between these two extremes of 120o and 150o Fahr. (48o.8 and 65o.5 Cent.), there were gradations in the completeness of the process; the former temperature not preventing aggregation from the subsequent action of carbonate of ammonia, the latter quite stopping it. Thus, leaves immersed in water, heated to 130o (54o.4 Cent.), and then in the solution, formed perfectly defined spheres, but these were decidedly smaller than in ordinary cases. With other leaves heated to 140o (60o Cent.), the spheres were extremely small, yet well defined, but many of the cells contained, in addition, some brownish <b>pulpy</b> matter. In two cases of leaves heated to 145o (62o.7 Cent.), a few tentacles could be found with some of their cells containing a few minute spheres; whilst the other cells and other whole tentacles included only the brownish, disintegrated or <b>pulpy</b> matter.|$|E
