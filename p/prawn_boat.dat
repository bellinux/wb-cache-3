50|$|Jimmy, skipper of the <b>prawn</b> <b>boat</b> Amity, is 100 miles {{offshore}} fishing {{in one of}} the most hazardous areas of the North Sea - the Devil's Hole. The engines which bring in his nets are on the brink of failing - if they stop he'll have to cut loose his nets and return to port with no prawns and no pay. 80 miles away, 17 year old new boy Ryan is desperate to impress skipper of the Ryanwood Kevin West, but time is running out for him to show he's tough enough.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, the Adelaide Festival of the Arts {{started to}} outgrow the city's {{existing}} venues, {{and there was}} a push to build a 'Festival Hall'. The originally proposed site was the Carclew Building in North Adelaide which had been purchased from the Boynton family by the Adelaide City Council for the purposes of building a Festival Hall. Liberal Premier Steele Hall lobbied the Federal Government for Tax Concessions for a public appeal for the Festival Hall, which was unsuccessful, until Prime Minister John Gorton called Hall from a <b>prawn</b> <b>boat</b> on the Gulf of Carpentaria and offered him either Tax Concessions or $100,000. Hall accepted the $100,000. [...] While on a trade trip to London, Steele Hall visited the Royal Festival Hall {{on the banks of the}} River Thames and decided that the banks of the River Torrens was the ideal choice for the home of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts and the cultural heart of the city. During this time, the State Government changed but the drive for a new Centre continued with fervour. When Don Dunstan became Premier he expanded the idea of a 'Festival Hall' into a 'Festival Centre' incorporating multiple smaller venues.|$|E

50|$|Portland Roads {{community}} is a reasonably standard housing area with some open-plan style houses and no power, water or sewerage facilities. It was predominantly a fishing community until the recent changes to Fisheries Regulations. Many <b>prawn</b> trawlers, cray <b>boats</b> and yachts use this sheltered anchorage. Approximately 10 persons live here.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 February 2002 the Tullaghmurray Lass left Kilkeel Harbour to {{fish for}} <b>prawns.</b> When the <b>boat</b> failed to return when {{expected}} a huge search mission was organised involving local fishing boats, the RNLI, HM Coastguard, the Royal Navy and the Irish Navy. (including two helicopters, a Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod and the minesweeper HMS Bridport) ...|$|R
50|$|Tuggerah Lake is {{well known}} for its {{recreational}} fishing with species such as luderick, bream, flathead and whiting caught from the shoreline and <b>boats.</b> <b>Prawns</b> can be plentiful over the summer months during the dark of the new moon. Fishing in Tuggerah Lake is generally poor during late winter and early spring, particularly when westerly winds are prevalent.|$|R
50|$|The {{region is}} Myanmar's largest rice producer, so its {{infrastructure}} of road transportation {{has been greatly}} developed during the 1990s and 2000s. Two-thirds of the total arable land is under rice cultivation with a yield of about 2,000-2,500 kg per hectare. Fishing is carried out from fixed fishing frames {{as well as from}} small <b>boats.</b> <b>Prawn</b> fishery and harvesting sea turtle eggs are also major commercial activities both of which are now threatened by the loss of mangrove forests as clearing of land proceeds for agriculture. Since communication throughout the delta is easiest by water, almost every household possesses a boat and major towns such as Bogale, Mawlamyinegyun and Myaungmya are served by steamer.|$|R
40|$|A quake-triggered tsunami lashed the Nagapattinam {{coast of}} {{southern}} India on December 26, 2004 at around 9. 00 am (IST). The tsunami caused heavy damage to houses, tourist resorts, fishing <b>boats,</b> <b>prawn</b> culture ponds, soil and crops, and consequently affected the livelihood {{of large numbers}} of the coastal communities. The study was carried out in the Tsunami affected villages in the coastal Nagapattinam with the help of remote sensing and geographical information science tools. Through the use of the IRS 1 D PAN and LISS 3 merged data and quick bird images, it was found that 1, 320 ha of agricultural and non-agricultural lands were affected by the tsunami. The lands were affected by soil erosion, salt deposition, water logging and other deposited sediments and debris. The maximum run-up height of 6. 1 m and the maximum seawater inundation distance of 2. 2 km were observed at Vadakkupoyyur village in coastal Nagapattinam. Pre and Post Tsunami survey on soil quality showed an increase in pH and EC values, irrespective of distance from the sea. The water reaction was found to be in alkaline range (> 8. 00) in most of the wells. Salinity levels are greater than 4 dS m- 1 in all the wells except the ring well. The effect of summer rainfall on soil and water quality showed the dilution of soluble salts. Pumping of water has reduced the salinity levels in the well water samples and {{as well as in the}} open ponds. Following the 2004 event, it has become apparent to know the relative tsunami hazard for this coastal Nagapattinam. So, the Tsunami hazard maps are generated using a geographical information systems (GIS) approach and the results showed 20. 6 per cent, 63. 7 per cent and 15. 2 per cent of the study area fall under hig...|$|R
