5|$|As with {{previous}} games, the visuals of End of Ages were widely praised. The switch to real-time rendering was generally {{seen as a}} <b>positive</b> <b>step.</b> The game's music was lauded; GameSpot's review noted the use of music in End of Ages was sparse, but the little audio present set the proper tone for different Ages. A few reviewers, such as Charles Herold of the New York Times, felt that the graphics fell short of what was possible, especially compared to the prerendered visuals of Myst IV: Revelation. While Greg Kasavin of GameSpot felt that though the visuals were on par {{with previous}} games, End of Ages was missing several elements which made Myst IV more immersive; only important, story-driving items could be interacted with, for example, and the player makes no sounds or footsteps in the game.|$|E

This addition provided for the creation of Medicaid waivers. It also outlined the contractual obligations of states choosing to establish waiver programs with Medicaid. Waiver programs were considered a <b>positive</b> <b>step</b> as they provided a way for people to lead less-restricted lives in the community. Studies that supported waivers cited cost-effectiveness as the main reason why they should be enacted. It was argued that providing the same institutional care in the community cost less.|$|E

Rio Tinto also, as of 2010, employs 700 indigenous workers in its Pilbara operations, comprising 6 percent of its overall work force. FMG, under the leadership of Andrew Forrest, is driving a national program which aims to find 50,000 jobs for indigenous workers in Australia. Companies like BHP Billiton, FMG and Rio Tinto have programs aimed at increasing the number of Aboriginal employees in their operations. Indigenous Australians in Western Australia in 2001 accounted for 3.1% of the population.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, Madonna {{released}} her controversial Sex book and her fifth studio album Erotica, both containing explicit sexual imagery {{and pictures of}} voyeuristic fantasies. She also starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence. During the same period, Madonna's appearance on David Letterman's talk show was noted for her controversial behavior. It included the singer using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it. This made the episode the most censored in American network television talk-show history, {{while at the same}} time garnering the show some of the highest ratings it ever received. All releases were panned by critics and fans alike, calling Madonna a sexual renegade and claiming that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over. A song titled [...] "I'll Remember" [...] was included in the soundtrack of the film With Honors in early 1994.

If anything, it's a small reflection of the changing attitudes in society".
