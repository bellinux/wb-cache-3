5|$|Certain {{medications}} {{may cause}} weight gain or changes in body composition; these include insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, steroids, certain anticonvulsants (<b>phenytoin</b> and valproate), pizotifen, and {{some forms of}} hormonal contraception.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1800s, {{the first}} {{effective}} anti-seizure medication, bromide, was introduced. The first modern treatment, phenobarbital, {{was developed in}} 1912, with <b>phenytoin</b> coming into use in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, <b>phenytoin</b> enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, <b>phenytoin</b> and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{medications}} available including <b>phenytoin,</b> carbamazepine and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that <b>phenytoin,</b> carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor isoniazid {{increases the risk of}} hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, <b>phenytoin,</b> and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E
5|$|Kritschgau and Skinner put Mulder under {{additional}} tests to verify his abnormal brain activity. They again inject Mulder with <b>phenytoin,</b> {{but this time}} they are caught by Fowley and Mulder goes into a seizure. Meanwhile Dr. Barnes, in a bizarre type of experiment, kills his driver, but the driver soon reanimates and kills him instead. Scully flies back to the U.S. and visits Mulder at the hospital. On the African coast, Ngebe arrives with the police, finding Dr. Barnes dead and the spaceship gone.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{when the}} only {{anticonvulsant}} drugs were the sedative bromides (discovered 1857) and phenobarbital (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when H. Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam discovered <b>phenytoin</b> (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across {{a broad range of}} epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, declined further.|$|E
5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, <b>phenytoin,</b> carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, <b>phenytoin,</b> probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as <b>phenytoin</b> are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
5|$|Many drugs, {{including}} oral contraceptives, some antibiotics, antidepressants, and antifungal agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They {{reduce the}} rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as St John's wort, the antibiotic rifampicin, and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and <b>phenytoin,</b> accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action. Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, opioids and other central nervous system depressants potentiates their action. This often results in increased sedation, impaired motor coordination, suppressed breathing, and other adverse effects that have potential to be lethal. Antacids can slow down absorption of some benzodiazepines; however, this effect is marginal and inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or <b>phenytoin.</b> Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, <b>phenytoin</b> and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenytoin,</b> reduces <b>phenytoin</b> excretion, hence {{increasing}} {{the potential for}} toxicity.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Drs Rimmer and Richens at the University of Wales {{reported}} that administering vigabatrin with <b>phenytoin</b> lowered the serum <b>phenytoin</b> concentration {{in patients with}} treatment-resistant epilepsy. Five years later, the same two scientists reported a fall in concentration of <b>phenytoin</b> of 23% within five weeks in a paper describing their failed attempt at elucidating the mechanism behind this interaction.|$|E
25|$|The {{first case}} report {{in which the}} {{shortening}} of the QT interval by primidone was documented, published in the July 1980 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, involved three patients, a 31-year-old woman, her 15-year-old nephew, and his 16-year-old sister. The woman still had ventricular fibrillation, syncope, and seizures even after the removal of her left stellate ganglion and a thoracic chain dissection. The woman had previously been tried {{on a combination of}} phenobarbital and <b>phenytoin</b> when she was thought to have only seizures, followed by phenobarbital combined <b>phenytoin</b> and procainamide. The procainamide was replaced with propanolol, which in turn replaced the propanolol when the latter brought the tachycardia back almost instantaneously upon the first dose. The phenobarbital and <b>phenytoin</b> were then combined with atropine and acetyl strophanthidin. When this failed, the atropine and acetyl strophanthidin were replaced with lidocaine prior to the surgery. After the surgery, the QT-prolongation returned, so the <b>phenytoin</b> was doubled to 200mg four times daily. A month later, she was admitted to the hospital for <b>phenytoin</b> toxicity, where it was found that she had slow spike and abortive wave activity in her left temporal lobe. It was after this that primidone was substituted for <b>phenytoin.</b> The primidone suppressed the fibrillations and lengthened the QT interval for two years and eight months in the patient. Her 16-year-old niece was started on primidone after an unsuccessful trial of <b>phenytoin.</b> Following this, her 15-year-old nephew, the niece's brother, was started because of family history.|$|E
25|$|It may elevate serum <b>phenytoin</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the drugs}} used for myoclonus, such as barbiturates, <b>phenytoin</b> and {{primidone}}, are also used to treat epilepsy. Barbiturates slow down {{the central nervous system}} and cause tranquilizing or antiseizure effects. <b>Phenytoin</b> and primidone are effective antiepileptics drugs, although <b>phenytoin</b> can cause liver failure or have other harmful long-term effects in patients with PME. Sodium valproate is an alternative therapy for myoclonus and can be used either alone or in combination with clonazepam. Some people have adverse reactions to clonazepam and/or sodium valproate.|$|E
25|$|Some {{anticonvulsants}} including: carbamazepine, ethosuximide, <b>phenytoin,</b> topiramate, valproate.|$|E
25|$|Carbamazepine and <b>phenytoin</b> are {{reported}} to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam {{decreases}} {{the levels of}} carbamazepine, and, likewise, clonazepam's level is reduced by carbamazepine. Azole antifungals, such as ketoconazole, may inhibit the metabolism of clonazepam. Clonazepam may affect levels of <b>phenytoin</b> (diphenylhydantoin). In turn, <b>Phenytoin</b> may lower clonazepam plasma levels by increasing the speed of clonazepam clearance by approximately 50% and decreasing its half-life by 31%.|$|E
25|$|Barbiturates, <b>phenytoin</b> {{and some}} other enzyme-inducing antiepileptics– these {{probably}} accelerate the metabolism of vitamin D.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs that}} have been used with success include <b>phenytoin,</b> dantrolene, and dimetyl glycine.|$|E
25|$|Inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes such as barbiturates, <b>phenytoin,</b> and {{rifampicin}} {{can reduce}} the half-life of dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|Of {{all cases}} of DIGO, about 50% are {{attributed}} to <b>phenytoin,</b> 30% to cyclosporins and the remaining 10-20% to calcium channel blockers.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{adulteration}} of some {{herbal medicine}} preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, <b>phenytoin,</b> and glibenclamide, has been reported.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of {{potential}} clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, <b>phenytoin,</b> carbamazepine, pethidine and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, amiodarone, flecainide, quinidine, fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Rifampin, <b>phenytoin,</b> carbamazepine, and {{phenobarbital}} {{increase the}} metabolism of diazepam, thus decreasing drug levels and effects. Dexamethasone and St John's wort {{also increase the}} metabolism of diazepam.|$|E
25|$|Combined use of {{clonazepam}} {{with certain}} antidepressants, antiepileptics, such as phenobarbital, <b>phenytoin</b> and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opiates, antipsychotics, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics like zolpidem and alcohol {{may result in}} enhanced sedative effects.|$|E
25|$|Primidone {{is one of}} the {{anticonvulsants}} {{associated with}} anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome, others being carbamazepine, <b>phenytoin,</b> and phenobarbital. This syndrome consists of fever, rash, peripheral leukocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and occasionally hepatic necrosis.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{acting like}} dephenylhydantoin (DPH): {{mechanism}} of action unknown, but others had attributed its cardiac action to an indirect action on the brain; this drug is better known as antiepileptic drug <b>phenytoin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Open-label {{case series}} have {{suggested}} that primidone is effective {{in the treatment of}} epilepsy. Primidone has been compared to <b>phenytoin,</b> phenobarbital, mephobarbital, ethotoin, metharbital, and mephenytoin. In adult comparison trials, primidone {{has been found to be}} just as effective.|$|E
25|$|TB {{treatment}} involves numerous {{drug interactions}} with anti-epileptic drugs and serum drug levels should be closely monitored. There are serious interactions between rifampicin and carbamazepine, rifampicin and <b>phenytoin,</b> and rifampicin and sodium valproate. The {{advice of a}} pharmacist should always be sought.|$|E
25|$|Hyperammonemic {{encephalopathy}} {{was reported}} by Katano Hiroyuki of the Nagoya City Higashi General Hospital in early 2002 in a patient who had been stable on primidone monotherapy for five years before undergoing surgery for astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor. Additionally, her phenobarbital levels were inexplicably elevated post-surgery. This is much more common with the valproates than {{with any of the}} barbiturates. A randomized controlled trial whose results were published in the July 1985 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine found that primidone was more likely to cause impotence than <b>phenytoin,</b> carbamazepine, or phenobarbital. Like <b>phenytoin,</b> primidone is rarely associated with lymphadenopathy. Primidone can also cause vomiting; this happens in 1.0–0.1% of users.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine {{has fewer}} drug {{interactions}} than many anticonvulsant drugs, although pharmacokinetic interactions with carbamazepine, <b>phenytoin</b> and other hepatic enzyme inducing medications may shorten half-life. Dose adjustments {{should be made}} on clinical response, but monitoring may be of benefit in assessing compliance.|$|E
25|$|Less than 1% of {{primidone}} {{users will}} experience a rash. Compared to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and <b>phenytoin,</b> {{this is very}} low. The rate is {{comparable to that of}} felbamate, vigabatrin, and topiramate. Primidone also causes exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.|$|E
