40|$|In its {{industrial}} heyday, Thorne Moors {{was the most}} extensive commercial peat operation in Britain. It became closely tied to nearby Hatfield Moors, and at both the methods of exploitation were essentially the same. Although much of Thorne Moors is situated in Yorkshire, the eastern extent lies in Lincolnshire. Recognizable differences in scale and methodology existed between the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire parts. After regional drainage in the 1620 - 30 s, there was increased trade in the peat of Thorne Moors along the River Don. A succession of uses included unrefined and refined fuel, products from carbonization and distillation, and moss litter for working horses. From the mid- 19 th century, companies were formed to exploit the new uses, especially moss litter, and export became increasingly focused on railways. In 1896, the British Moss Litter Co. Ltd was set up (restructured 1899) to assume the Thorne/Hatfield interests of several smaller companies, including the Anglo-Dutch Griendtsveen Moss Litter Co. Ltd. The British Moss Litter Co. was acquired by Fisons Ltd in 1963. Following a contextual history, descriptions are given of both muscle-powered <b>peat</b> <b>winning</b> and transportation methodologies. These comprise exploitation in the 17 th and 18 th centuries, {{an examination of the}} 19 th century writings of William Casson, and written allusions spanning 1863 - 1963. Information is imparted on the Griendtsveen Moss Litter Co. In addition to creating a 'Dutch' peat canal system, this company introduced an immigrant Dutch workforce, proficient in their native methods and intended inter alia to retrain local workers looking for employment with Griendtsveen. Dutch methodology persisted alongside the local methods for c. 60 years. Accounts are also presented of the evolutionary limit of indigenous <b>peat</b> <b>winning,</b> and the use of narrow gauge railways. Finally the transition to mechanisation of peat cutting and narrow gauge haulage is outlined...|$|E
50|$|As {{last man}} down the hill, <b>Peat</b> <b>won</b> the La Bresse {{downhill}} world cup round 2 on 10 May 2009 {{with a time}} of 02:07.14 knocking Sam Hill out of the hot seat for his 16th world cup round win, tying {{at the top of the}} all-time leader-board with Nicolas Vouilloz. Just one week later on 17 May 2009, at the third round of the UCI World Cup in Vallnord, <b>Peat</b> <b>won</b> again (besting compatriot Gee Atherton by just 0.02 seconds) making him the most successful male downhill mountain bike racer ever by number of wins at the time. This record has since been beaten Peat's South African teammate, Greg Minnaar.|$|R

50|$|Peats {{joined the}} Canterbury Bulldogs in 1989. He {{made his first}} grade debut in round 11 of the 1989 season for the Bulldogs at hooker in their 16-2 win against the Parramatta Eels at Belmore Sports Ground. Peats also captained the Under 21 side {{in his first season}} at the Bulldogs. In 1990, Peats became a regular member of the reserve grade team, and in 1991, he became a regular member of the first grade team. In round 1 of the 1991 season, <b>Peats</b> <b>won</b> the man of the match award in the Bulldogs' 26-16 win over the Balmain Tigers at Leichhardt Oval. Peats scored his first try in first grade in the Bulldogs' 18-16 loss to the Canberra Raiders at Bruce Stadium in round 9 of the 1991 season. After {{spending}} most of the next three seasons back in reserve grade, his stint at the Bulldogs ended {{at the conclusion of the}} 1994 season.|$|R
5000|$|The biggest polder is the [...] "Hoevense Beemde" [...] {{which was}} founded at 12 June 1409 when the abbot of [...] "Sint Bernardus" [...] offered {{a large piece of}} land to the public.

40|$|Die Vegetationsentwicklung in zwei unterschiedlich abgetorften Mooren wird mit Hilfe der Transektmethode in Abhängigkeit von Abbauweise, Zusammensetzung und Mächtigkeit des Resttorfkörpers bzw. der Bunkerde dargestellt. Zusätzlich wurden in den verschiedenen Vegetationsstadien einige weitere Standortsparameter erhoben: Mittlerer Moorwasserstand und pH, Kalium- und Calciumgehalt des Moorwassers. Die Richtung der Vegetationsentwicklung auf Frästorfflächen ist eng korreliert mit der Zusammensetzung des Resttorfkörpers, mittlerem Moorwasserstand und Qualität (pH, Calciumgehalt) des Moorwassers, auf Handtorfstichflächen mit der Zusammensetzung der Bunkerde, mittlerem Moorwasserstand und Qualität des Moorwassers. Eine Moorregeneration i. S. v. beginnendem Torfmooswachstum konnte nur auf Teilflächen in Handtorfstichen beobachtet werden, für den gesamten Moorkomplex gilt diese Aussage nicht. Voraussetzung für ein Entstehen dieser Stadien auf Teilflächen war das Einbringen von Bunkerde und ein relativ hoher Wasserstand nach dem Abbau. Vegetation {{development}} in two differently mined peat areas is presented. Peat scratching in the wendlinger Filz {{was used to}} <b>win</b> <b>peat</b> dust as a litter for cattle or for horticultural purposes. After drainage of the mire lots, the upper rooted layer ("Bunkerde") was removed. If frozen during the next winter, {{it could be used}} for litter. After removing the "Bunkerde", peat was extracted by hand or by machines. Vegetation development after peat mining began on bare soil with the invasion of generative and vegetative propagules from outside. Peat cutting in the Wieninger Filz was used to <b>win</b> <b>peat</b> for fuel. After drainage of the mire lots, the "Bunkerde" was removed and filled in formerly mined areas. Then peat was cut by hand or by machines. Vegetation development started mainly from the potential of whole plants or generative and vegetative propagules in the "Bunkerde". Vegetation stages on formerly scratched areas are mostly dominated by "one species" stages. These species are successful either in generative (Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna vulgaris, Drosera ssp.) or vegetative dispersal (Rhynchospora alba, Carex rostrata, Eriophorum angustifolium, Phragmites communis) or in both (Juncus effusus). The direction of vegetation development depended on the composition of the remaining peat, mean water level and minerotrophy of the water. Regeneration in the sense of beginning peat moss growth could be observed only on these lots, where water level was above ground throughout the year (here Sphagnum cuspidatum), because former drainage got out of function. Vegetation stages on formerly cut areas show a higher diversity than on scratched areas. The direction of vegetation development depended mainly on the composition of the "Bunkerde", but on mean water level and minerotrophy of the water too. Regeneration could be observed on all lots with a relatively high water level, where peat was cut "under water" or drainage ditches were dammed up or got out of function. Requirement was that the "Bunkerde" contained whole plants or generative or vegetative propagules of the corresponding species, above all peat mosses...|$|R
