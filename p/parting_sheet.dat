40|$|To {{meet the}} helium (He) {{requirements}} of the superconducting supercollider (SSC), the cryogenic plants {{must be able to}} respond to time-varying loads. Thus the design and simulation of the cryogenic plants requires dynamic models of their principal components, and in particular, the core heat exchangers. In this paper, we detail the derivation and computer implementation of a model for core heat exchangers consisting of three partial differential equations (PDES) for each fluid stream (the continuity, energy and momentum balances for the He), and one PDE for each <b>parting</b> <b>sheet</b> (the energy balance for the <b>parting</b> <b>sheet</b> metal); the PDEs have time and axial position along the exchanger as independent variables. The computer code can accommodate any number of fluid streams and parting sheets in an adiabatic group. Features of the code include: rigorous or approximate thermodynamic properties for He, upwind and downwind approximation of the PDE spatial derivatives, and sparse matrix time integration. The outputs from the code include the time-dependent axial profiles of the fluid He mass flux, density, pressure, temperature, internal energy and enthalpy. The code is written in transportable Fortran 77, and can therefore be executed on essentially any computer...|$|E

40|$|A hybrid {{light-weight}} {{heat exchanger}} concept {{has been developed}} that uses high-conductivity carbon-carbon (C-C) composites as the heat-transfer fins and uses conventional high-temperature metals, such as Inconel, nickel, and titanium as the <b>parting</b> <b>sheets</b> to meet leakage and structural requirements. In order to maximize thermal conductivity, the majority of carbon fiber is aligned in the fin direction resulting in 300 W/m. K or higher conductivity in the fin directions.

40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} used in cryogenic applications need to {{have very}} high effectiveness to preserve the refrigerating effect produced. Normally the heat exchangers used in cryogenic refrigerators and liquefiers have effectiveness {{of the order of}} 0. 95 or higher. If the effectiveness of the heat exchangers falls below the design value, there may not be any liquid yield. Plate fin heat exchangers, because of their compactness, low weight and high effectiveness, are widely used in aerospace and cryogenic applications. Such heat exchangers have closely spaced fins and offer narrow and intricate passages for the fluid flow which often leads to significant pressure drop. The stringent requirement of high effectiveness in cryogenic refrigerators and liquefiers and high pressure drop occurring in plate fin heat exchangers make it necessary to test the heat exchanger before putting into operation in a liquefier. Plate fin heat exchanger (PFHE) is a type of compact exchanger that consists of a stack of alternate flat plates called <b>parting</b> <b>sheets</b> and corrugated fins, both being brazed together as a block. Streams exchange heat by flowing along the passages made by the fins between the <b>parting</b> <b>sheets.</b> Separating plates act as the primary heat transfer surfaces and the appendages known as fins act as the secondary heat transfer surfaces intimately bonded to the primary surface. Aluminum is the most commonly used material and stainless steel is employed in high pressure and high temperature applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In a very {{competitive}} domain of design and manufacturing of multi-stream brazed aluminium plate-fin heat exchangers, the continuous challenge for a manufacturer such as Nordon Cryogenie (France) is to ensure an optimal brazing between the aluminium <b>parting</b> <b>sheets</b> and the fins in sandwich between those sheets. Fins are obtained from flat sheets by successive bending. It is therefore important to design the tools {{in such a way}} that the fins present a sufficient surface in contact with the top and bottom sheets. The present paper deals with some aspects of a research and development program where a new tooling equipment was designed to improve the forming of the fins. More specifically, the simulation aspects using the ABAQUS software are described and the numerical results are compared with some available experimental results. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{cryogenics}} field, high effectiveness {{heat exchangers}} {{of the order}} of 0. 96 or higher are widely used for preserving the refrigeration effect produced. So, there will be no liquid yield if the effectiveness falls below that of the design value. Due to high effectiveness, low weight & compactness, the compact heat exchangers have their extensive applications in the air-conditioning system, oil industries, food industries & in the process industries. The plate fin heat exchangers (PFHE) is a type of compact heat exchanger which is manufactured by brazing a stack of alternate plates (<b>parting</b> <b>sheets)</b> & corrugated fins together. The exchange of heat occurs by the streams through the fins. Generally, aluminium is used for manufacturing PFHE due to their high thermal conductivity & low cost. In the plate fin heat exchanger, the pressure drop is also measured along with the effectiveness. The increase in pressure gradient can be outweighed by decreasing the passage length so that an acceptable pressure drop can be achieved. There is enormous research is going on to make out the heat transfer phenomena & also to determine the dimensionless heat transfer coefficients those are the Colburn factor (j) and the friction factor (f). This thesis on the offset strip plate fin heat exchanger compares the effectiveness, overall thermal conductance & the pressure drop obtained from the experimental data with some correlations on plate fin heat exchanger i. e., Joshi-Webb correlation, Maiti-Sarangi correlation, Manglik-Bergles correlation and also with the numerically achieved data obtained by using CFD...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{little was}} known about the {{specific}} types of water-bearing features or “zones” tapped by deep production wells in the crystalline igneous and metamorphic bedrock of the Piedmont physiographic province of Georgia (Fig. 1). Detailed study of the depth, nature, and yield of water-bearing features in Rockdale County, Georgia, indicates that foliation-parallel <b>parting</b> planes, <b>sheet</b> fractures, joints, and weathered veins {{are among the most}} common. An optical televiewer and other borehole-geophysical logging tools were used to delineate water-bearing features in 20 “open-hole” bedrock wells located {{in various parts of the}} study area (Fig. 1).

40|$|Plate fin heat exchangers, {{because of}} their compactness, low weight and high {{effectiveness}} are widely used in aerospace and cryogenic applications. This device is made of a stack of corrugated fins alternating with nearly equal number of flat separators known as <b>parting</b> <b>sheets,</b> bonded {{together to form a}} monolithic block. Appropriate headers are welded to provide the necessary interface with the inlet and the exit streams. While aluminum is the most commonly used material, stainless steel construction is employed in high pressure and high temperature applications. The performance of a plate fin heat exchanger is determined, among other things, by the geometry of the fins. The most common fin configurations are - (1) plain (straight and uninterrupted) rectangular or trapezoidal fins (2) uninterrupted wavy fins and (3) interrupted fins such as offset strip, louver and perforated fins. The interrupted surfaces provide greater heat transfer at the cost of higher flow impedance. Here I have designed rectangular offset plate fin heat exchanger. I have assumed some data and based on them I have designed heat exchanger. The flowing fluid in heat exchanger is liquid nitrogen and material of heat exchanger is Al. After designing the heat exchanger, rating is also necessary. The heat transfer and flow friction characteristics of plate fin surfaces are presented in terms of the Colburn factor j and the Fanning friction factor f vs. Reynolds number Re, the relationships being different for different surfaces. The laminar flow model under predicts j and f values at high Reynolds number, while the 2 -Layer k-e turbulence model over predicts the data throughout the range of interest. Because most industrial heat exchangers operate with Re less than 3000, and because the j and f data predicted by the laminar and the 2 -layer k-e turbulence model differ little from each other at low Reynolds numbers, we have used the laminar flow model up to Reynolds number of 10, 000, which is considered to be the limit for plate fin heat exchangers operating with gases. Velocity, pressure and temperature fields have been computed and j and f factors determined over appropriate range of Reynolds number and geometric dimensions. ...|$|R
5000|$|When Powell's {{first wife}} Helena—who {{was born in}} Smolensk, Russia, in 1908—died in the bitterly cold winter of 1941, he joined the Army Air Corps and worked in a defense plant. Thereafter {{he was in the}} plastic figurine {{business}} in Yakima, Washington. He married a second time around 1946 to Audrey Scott, the union producing a son, Eddie. The marriage, however, would be short-lived as the couple was prone to fighting and she eventually left him. Powell's heavy drinking may have been a factor in their <b>parting</b> of the <b>sheets.</b> In 1952 he married fellow artist Nancy McLaughlin and the couple made their home in the town of Hungry Horse, a few miles east of Bad Rock Canyon, and operated a combination studio and gallery. A son, Dave Powell—who would go on to be a fine artist in his own right—was born to the couple. It was during this period that Powell gained much of his reputation and began to garner a following of collectors who would patronize him {{for the rest of his}} career. [...] Their gallery/studio would burn to the ground in 1964, and shortly thereafter he and Nancy were divorced. His fourth marriage, in 1965, was to Thelma Conner and they made their home in Kalispell.|$|R

The most common fin configurations are - (1) plain (straight and uninterrupted) rectangular or trapezoidal fins (2) uninterrupted wavy fins and (3) interrupted fins such as offset strip, louver and perforated fins. The interrupted surfaces provide greater heat transfer at the cost of higher flow impedance. The heat transfer and flow friction characteristics of plate fin surfaces are presented in terms of the Colburn factor j and the Fanning friction factor f vs. Reynolds number Re, the relationships being different for different surfaces. One of the earliest and the most authoritative sources for j and f data on plate fin surfaces is the monograph Compact Heat Exchangers by Kays and London [1984]. Although nearly two decades have passed after the latest edition, there has not been any significant addition to this database in open literature. Unlike simpler geometries, the thermal performance of plate fin surfaces is not uniquely determined by the hydraulic diameter; other geometric variables such as fin spacing (s), fin height (h), fin thickness (t), offset strip length (l), wave length (Λ), and wave amplitude (a) have significant effect. It will be prohibitively expensive and time consuming to fabricate heat exchanger cores and carry out experiments over reasonable ranges of so many geometric variables. In contrast, it is reasonably easy and cost effective to conduct a parametric study in numerical simulation and derive correlations for use by the heat exchanger designer. But, because numerical solution is based on certain simplifying assumptions, the computed results are, in general, different from experimentally observed values. To alleviate this problem, we have evolved a procedure where some of the constants in the correlations are estimated from numerical simulation, the rest being determined by fitting experimental data We have used the finite volume based CFD software, FLUENT 6. 1 as the numerical tool. Three-dimensional, steady, Navier-Stokes equations and the Energy equation have been solved with appropriate boundary conditions for plain, offset strip and wavy fin surfaces. We have observed that the laminar flow model under predicts j and f values at high Reynolds number, while the 2 -Layer k-e turbulence model over predicts the data throughout the range of interest. Because most industrial heat exchangers operate with Re less than 3000, and because the j and f data predicted by the laminar and the 2 -layer k-e turbulence model differ little from each other at low Reynolds numbers, we have used the laminar flow model up to Reynolds number of 10, 000, which is considered to be the limit for plate fin heat exchangers operating with gases. Velocity, pressure and temperature fields have been computed and j and f factors determined over appropriate range of Reynolds number and geometric dimensions. The j and f data have been expressed in the form: j or f = F (Re, geometry) = A RebF(dimensionless geometric) parameters The function F is also a power law expression in the geometric parameters such as h/s, t/s, λ/s etc. We have determined the indices of F by multiple regression from numerically computed results, and the constants A and b by fitting experimental data of Kays and London. Because the j or f vs. Re curves show significant non-linearity, we have expressed the correlations in terms of two separate equations over the low and the high Re regimes. The transition Reynolds number has also been correlated with dimensionless geometric parameters. We have thus carried out an exhaustive numerical study on the heat transfer and flow friction phenomena in plate fin heat exchanger surfaces with plain, wavy and offset strip fins. While the data for plain and offset-strip fins have been correlated successfully by pure power law expressions, those for wavy fins have demanded more complex relations. The indices of the dimensionless geometrical factors in wavy fin geometry have been expressed as simple polynomials of Reynolds number. A practical approach has evolved for determining the dependence of j and f factors on Re and dimensionless geometrical features. A set of correlations has been generated for use in heat exchanger design. These correlations are expected to extend the range and accuracy of available correlations, particularly for offset strip fin and wavy fin surfaces...|$|R
