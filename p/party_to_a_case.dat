500|$|Damages {{is money}} claimed in {{compensation}} for some failure {{by the other}} <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case.</b> It is commonly believed that the Court of Chancery could not grant damages until the Chancery Amendment Act 1858, which gave it that right, but in some special cases it {{had been able to}} provide damages for over 600years. The idea of damages was first conceived in English law during the 13th century, when the Statutes of Merton and Gloucester provided for damages in certain circumstances. Despite what is normally assumed by academics, it was not just the common law courts that could grant damages under these statutes; the Exchequer of Pleas and Court of Chancery both had the right to do so. In Cardinal Beaufort's case in 1453, for example, it is stated that [...] "I shall have a subpoena against my feoffee and recover damages for the value of the land". A statute passed during the reign of Richard II specifically gave the Chancery the right to award damages, stating: ...|$|E

50|$|In {{some types}} of cases (for example, if the {{original}} trial court was not a court of record) or in some legal systems, if the losing <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> appeals, then the appellate court itself will hold a new trial, known as a trial de novo.|$|E
50|$|The Sheriff Appeal Court can remit (transfer) {{a case to}} the Court of Session under Section 112 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014, {{which allows}} for the Inner House to deal with complex or novel {{questions}} of law.

5000|$|A {{court order}} is an {{official}} proclamation {{by a judge}} (or panel of judges) that defines the legal relationships between the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hearing, a trial, an appeal or other court proceedings. Such ruling requires or authorizes the carrying out of certain steps {{by one or more}} <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case.</b> <b>A</b> court order must be signed by a judge; some jurisdictions may require it to be notarized.|$|R
25|$|A court {{attorney}} {{is a lawyer}} who works with and assists the judge by researching legal questions and helping to write decisions.

5000|$|Undisclosed <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> are {{represented}} by initials (e.g., R v RDS). Criminal cases are prosecuted by the Crown, which is always represented by [...] "R" [...] for Regina (queen) or Rex (king). Constitutional references are always entitled [...] "Reference re" [...] followed by the subject title.|$|R
50|$|An amicus curiae (literally, {{friend of}} the court; plural, amici curiae) is {{someone who is not}} a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> and is not {{solicited}} by a party, but who assists a court by offering information that bears on the case. The decision on whether to admit the information lies at the discretion of the court. The phrase amicus curiae is legal Latin.|$|E
50|$|Any {{party to}} a claim may {{apply for a}} Group Litigation Order to be made before or after issue of the claim. A single court will be {{assigned}} to manage the GLO. A Group Register will then be set up listing all claims which {{have become part of}} the GLO. Any <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> may apply to be added or removed from the group register.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that in states where Indian {{reservations}} are located, the state generally has no legal jurisdiction over Indian Territory as recognized tribes enjoy legal status as a sovereign nation. Thus a process server certified under the authority of the state (i.e. Arizona) cannot serve a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> while that person is on the reservation unless the tribal council consents to permit service.|$|E
5000|$|Before oral arguments, the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> file legal briefs {{outlining}} their arguments. An amicus curiae {{may also}} submit a brief {{in support of}} a particular outcome in the case if the Court grants it permission. Formal rules govern every aspect of these briefs; Chief Justice William Rehnquist described the rules thus: ...|$|R
5000|$|If the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> {{anticipate}} {{that it will}} not take up a significant amount of time, they may apply for the court to designate it as <b>a</b> short cause. <b>Cases</b> on the [...] "short cause" [...] calendar will get priority since they will not tie up a courtroom for a long time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{database}} design {{centers on}} the case record and each case record has multiple related records. For example, the [...] "party" [...] table lists <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the caseâ€”Plaintiff, Defendant, Debtor, etc. In <b>a</b> bankruptcy <b>case</b> the Trustee, US Trustee, and certain creditors can become <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case.</b> Each <b>party</b> is either pro se or has one or more counsel (attorney) listed. A party can also {{have a list of}} aliases, e.g., [...] "Winona Judd DBA 'The Judds'". This feature allows name searches to find the case.|$|R
50|$|Involuntary {{dismissal}} {{can also}} be made by order of the judge when no defendant has made a motion to dismiss. Involuntary dismissal is a punishment that courts may use when a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> is not acting properly. Other punishments are found in FRCP Rule 11, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 38, sections 1927 and 1912 of Title 28 United States Code, and inherent powers of the court.|$|E
5000|$|... 28 U.S.C. Section 144, captioned [...] "Bias or {{prejudice}} of judge," [...] {{provides that}} under circumstances, when a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> in a United States District Court files a [...] "timely and sufficient Motion {{that the judge}} before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or {{in favor of an}} adverse party," [...] the case shall be transferred to another judge.|$|E
50|$|Often {{the court}} or other legal body determines whether a {{particular}} fact or facts amount to a good cause. For example, if a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> has failed to take legal action before a particular statute of limitations has expired, the court might decide that the said party preserves its rights nonetheless, since that party's serious illness is a good cause, or justification for having additional {{time to take the}} legal action.|$|E
50|$|The amicus curiae process, {{allowing}} third <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> depose <b>a</b> written text {{before the}} Court {{in order to}} defend general interest, was then formalized. The process was used in 2001, when Spanish justice sent an international arrest warrant for responsibles of human rights violations in Argentina. An NGO then deposed a text, as third party, before the Argentine court, setting forth the judicial arguments needed to either extradite or judge suspects of human rights violations (an alternative known as subsidiary universal jurisdiction).|$|R
40|$|When {{they learn}} {{procedural}} law, {{students need to}} understand and memorize the forms of legal court action which {{can be carried out}} by <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case.</b> <b>A</b> large proportion of this body of law is descriptive and factual, but complex too; and the constraints of academic curricula do not allow students to learn procedural law in the real environment of the court. As a result, even with the inclusion of case law, and with examples to contextualize the procedural principles, the subject can be perceived as an exercise in knowledge acquisition alone (Vaughn, 1995) ...|$|R
50|$|Currently, victims cannot enforce {{effectively}} any of {{the rights}} established in section 43 because section 43 provides that assertion of a victim's rights cannot invalidate a court ruling or suspend <b>a</b> <b>case</b> and because district attorneys are the only <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> that have authority to assert the victim's section 43 rights. Thus, victims cannot appear in court to assert their section 43 rights and cannot appeal from or otherwise challenge a ruling of a court denying {{any of the}}ir section 43 rights. The constitution prevents the legislature from providing victims such procedural rights by statute.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the commissioners}} of the Inter-American Commission, judges are not {{required}} to recuse themselves from hearing cases involving their home countries; however no member state may have more than one representative judge serving on the Court at any time.In the event a member state is <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> as a defendant does not have a representative judge sitting on the Court, the member state is entitled to appoint a judge to the court ad hoc for the case.|$|E
50|$|Document review (also {{known as}} doc review), {{in the context}} of legal proceedings, is the process whereby each <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> sorts through and {{analyzes}} the documents and data they possess (and later the documents and data supplied by their opponents through discovery) to determine which are sensitive or otherwise relevant to the case. Document Review is a valuable main staple of the type of work performed by attorneys for their clients, though it is increasingly common for the work to be performed by specialized document review attorneys.|$|E
5000|$|Rule 24(b) {{provides}} for permissive intervention, which {{is subject to}} the discretion of the judge hearing the case. An applicant may be permitted by the court to intervene (1) when a federal statute confers upon the applicant a conditional right to intervene or (2) when the applicant's claim or defense shares a common question of law or fact with the main action. Agents of the federal or state government may be permitted by the court to intervene when a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> relies on a federal or state statute or executive order, or any regulation promulgated thereunder, for its claim or defense.|$|E
5000|$|A brief (Old French from Latin [...] "brevis", short) is {{a written}} legal {{document}} used in various legal adversarial systems that is presented <b>to</b> <b>a</b> court arguing why one <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>case</b> should prevail.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to {{the passing}} of the Courts and Legal Services Act, only barristers, solicitors and the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> had {{automatic}} rights of audience in the County Courts (as established by the County Courts Act 1984). Other parties, if they were in [...] "relevant legal employment", could also request rights of audience for <b>a</b> particular <b>case.</b> The Civil Justice Review found significant variations between courts as to who would be granted rights of audience, however, and Part I of the Courts and Legal Services Act attempted to address this. Section 11 allows the Lord Chancellor <b>to</b> make <b>an</b> order giving rights of audience to anyone in County Court <b>cases</b> of <b>a</b> certain type.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{distinct}} {{character of}} the Civil Service Tribunal {{as well as its}} case-law has led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of procedural particularities and innovations. The Civil Service Tribunal encourages the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> favour <b>an</b> amicable settlement of the dispute. In the staff cases the amicable settlement procedure is of very significant value as it allows achieving a balanced and for both <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> acceptable solution. The particular attention needs to be paid to the allocation of costs according to the rules governing the procedure before the Civil Service Tribunal. It is to be noted that a special rule previously had applied to the staff cases, according to which the applicant did not pay the institution's costs even if he lost the case. The special rule was abolished as from the 1 st November 2007 and today a general rule stating that the unsuccessful party shall be ordered to pay the costs has to be applied. However, as it is apparent from the case-law of the Civil Service Tribunal, the general rule is not applied automatically. Attention must be also drawn to the provisions granting the Tribunal the possibility of ordering any claimant bringing a manifestly abusive action to reimburse the costs occasioned by that action. The Tribunal is faced with an increasing number of actions from claimants who misuse that judicature, the cases brought by those applicants often take up a disproportionate amount of the Tribunal's time and impedes its functioning. Thus, this article analyses the abovementioned specific aspects of the procedure before the Civil Service Tribunal. These procedural aspects are compared to the aspects of procedure before the Court of Justice and the General Court...|$|R
50|$|National laws usually define {{age limits}} for {{children}} {{to have the right}} to contact social services on their own initiative, to be heard in judicial and administrative procedures, to act as a litigant or <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case,</b> to appeal against decisions, and to complain and seek redress. The age limits defined under national law differ among countries and, in some cases, also between the various laws applying to different groups of children and contexts. The right of younger children to be heard is often not addressed in the same way as the right of adolescents. Special measures nationally can ensure younger children are not excluded from exercising their right to be heard.|$|E

50|$|The Supreme Court of Bhutan, which {{comprises}} the Chief Justice and four Drangpons, {{is the highest}} appellate authority to entertain appeals against the judgments, orders, or decisions of the High Court in all matters. The Supreme Court is a court of record. The Chief Justice of Bhutan, Drangpons (Associate Justices) of the Supreme Court are appointed by the King. The term of office of the Chief Justice of Bhutan is five years (or until attaining age 65). That of the Drangpons of the Supreme Court is ten years (or until attaining age 65). Where a question of law or fact is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain {{the opinion of the}} Supreme Court, the King may refer the question to the Supreme Court for its consideration, which hears the reference and submit its opinion to him. The Supreme Court may, on its own motion or on an application made by the Attorney General or by a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>case,</b> withdraw any case pending before the High Court involving a substantial question of law of general importance relating to the interpretation of this Constitution and dispose off the case itself.|$|E
