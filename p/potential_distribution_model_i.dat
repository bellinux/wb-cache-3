(lantana), a highly {{invasive}} shrub species, {{was developed to}} estimate its <b>potential</b> <b>distribution</b> using CLIMEX. <b>Model</b> development was carried out using its native and invasive distribution and validation was carried out with the extensive Australian distribution. A good fit was observed, with 86. 7 % of herbarium specimens collected in Australia occurring within the suitable and highly suitable categories. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the model parameters that had the most influence on lantana distribution. The changes in suitability were assessed by mapping the regions where the distribution changed with each parameter alteration. This allowed an assessment of where, within Australia, the modification of each parameter was having the most impact, particularly {{in terms of the}} suitable and highly suitable locations. The sensitivity of various parameters was also evaluated by calculating the changes in area within the suitable and highly suitable categories. The limiting low temperature (DV 0), limiting high temperature (DV 3) and limiting low soil moisture (SM 0) showed highest sensitivity to change. The other model parameters were relatively insensitive to change. Highly sensitive parameters require extensive research and data collection to be fitted accurately in species <b>distribution</b> <b>models.</b> The results from this study can inform more cost effective development of species <b>distribution</b> <b>models</b> for lantana.

Based on the potential model, a new compact model for the subthreshold swing is formulated. It is shown that for the devices having very high short-channel effects (SCE), the effective subthreshold slope factor is mainly dictated by the potential close to the channel center rather than the surface.

40|$|International audienceAim <b>Models</b> of the <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> of invading {{species have}} to deal with a number of issues. The key one is the high {{likelihood}} that the absence of an invading species in an area is a false absence because it may not have invaded that area yet, or that {{it may not have been}} detected. This paper develops an approach for screening pseudo-absences in a way that is logical and defensible. Innovation The step-wise approach involves: (1) screening environmental variables to identify those most likely to indicate conditions where the species cannot invade; (2) identifying and selecting the most likely limiting variables; (3) using these to define the limits of its invasion potential; and (4) selecting points outside these limits as true absence records for input into species <b>distribution</b> <b>models.</b> This approach was adopted and used for the study of three prominent Hakea species in South Africa. Models with and without the false absence records were compared. Two rainfall variables and the mean minimum temperature of the coldest month were the strongest predictors of <b>potential</b> <b>distributions.</b> <b>Models</b> which excluded false absences predicted that more of the <b>potential</b> <b>distribution</b> would have a high invasion potential than those which included them. Main conclusions The approach of applying a priori knowledge can be useful in refining the <b>potential</b> <b>distribution</b> of a species by excluding pseudo-absence records which are likely to be due to the species not having invaded an area yet or being undetected. The differences between the <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> predicted by the different models convey more information than making a single prediction, albeit a consensus model. The robustness of this approach depends strongly on an adequate knowledge of the ecology, invasion history and current distribution of that species...|$|R

The contin-ued range expansion of H. armigera in Central America is likely to change the invasion threat it poses to North America qualitatively, making natural dispersal from either the Carib-bean islands or Mexico feasible. To characterise the threat posed by H. armigera, we collat-ed the value of the major host crops in the United States growing within its modelled potential range, including that area where it could expand its range during favourable sea-sons.

METHODS <b>Potential</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>models</b> of Triatoma infestans and Chagas disease were performed using Maxent, a machine-learning method. FINDINGS Climate change appears to play a major role in the reemergence of Chagas' disease and T. infestans in Chile.

A finite element mesh of the LV was constructed to fit the geometry of the wall. The mesh was deformed by optimizing the nodal parameters to the motion of a sparse number of fidu-cial markers that were manually tracked in the images through the cardiac cycle. A parameter <b>distribution</b> <b>model</b> (PDM) of LV de-formations was obtained from a database of MR tagging studies. This was used to filter the calculated deformation and incorporate a priori information on likely motions. The estimated deformation obtained from 13 normal untagged studies was compared with the deformation obtained from MR tagging. The end systolic (ES) cir-cumferential and longitudinal strain values matched well with a mean difference of 0. 1 3. 2 % and 0. 3 3. 0 %, respectively. The calculated apex-base twist angle at ES had a mean difference of 1 0 2 3.

A variety of maximum coastal tsunami height distributions shown as gray lines in Fig.  6 a, which indicate overestimation and underestimation by <b>Model</b> <b>I,</b> could express the uncertainties of a tsunami forecast. We evaluated {{the extent to which}} the selected tsunami scenarios were able to approximate the pseudo-observation scenario by using the three indices defined by Eqs. (1), (3), and (4) to compare the maximum coastal tsunami height distributions of the pseudo-observation scenario with those of the selected tsunami scenarios. In this study, we refer to the coastal indices as coastal R, coastal VRO, and coastal VRC, which are defined by the pseudo-observation distributions and the calculated distributions of maximum coastal tsunami heights that do not depend on time t. Figure  6 b plots 16 selected tsunami scenarios on the coastal VRO–VRC diagram for comparing the maximum coastal tsunami height distributions for the corresponding tsunami scenarios. In this figure, the colored squares indicate the selected tsunami scenarios whose colors are the same as those of Fig.  4 c, and the gray crosses indicate the unselected tsunami scenarios.|$|R
40|$|The Patagonian opossum (Lestodelphys halli), {{the southernmost}} living marsupial, inhabits dry and open environments, {{mainly in the}} Patagonian steppe (between ~ 32 °S and ~ 49 °S). Its rich fossil record shows its {{occurrence}} further north in Central Argentina during the Quaternary. The paleoenvironmental meaning of the past distribution of L. halli has been mostly addressed in a subjective framework without an explicit connection with the climatic "space" currently occupied by this animal. Here, we assessed the <b>potential</b> <b>distribution</b> of this species and the changes occurred in its geographic range during late Pleistocene-Holocene times and linked the results obtained with conservation issues. To this end, we generated three <b>potential</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>models</b> with fossil records and three with current ones, using MaxEnt software. These models showed {{a decrease in the}} suitable habitat conditions for the species, highlighting a range shift from Central-Eastern to South-Western Argentina. Our results support that the presence of L. halli in the Pampean region during the Pleistocene-Holocene can be related to precipitation and temperature variables and that its current presence in Patagonia is more related to temperature and dominant soils. The models obtained suggest that the species has been experiencing a reduction in its geographic range since the middle Holocene, a process that is in accordance with a general increase in moisture and temperature in Central Argentina. Considering the findings of our work and the future scenario of global warming projected for Patagonia, we might expect a harsh impact on the distribution range of this opossum in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{ecological}} niche models (ENM) to generate <b>potential</b> geographic <b>distributions</b> of species has rapidly increased in ecology, conservation and evolutionary biology. Many methods {{are available and}} the most used are Maximum Entropy Method (MAXENT) and the Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production (GARP). Recent {{studies have shown that}} MAXENT perform better than GARP. Here we used the statistics methods of ROC - AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve) and bootstrap to evaluate the performance of GARP and MAXENT in generate <b>potential</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>models</b> for 39 species of New World coral snakes. We found that values of AUC for GARP ranged from 0. 923 to 0. 999, whereas those for MAXENT ranged from 0. 877 to 0. 999. On the whole, the differences in AUC were very small, but for 10 species GARP outperformed MAXENT. Means and standard deviations for 100 bootstrapped samples with sample sizes ranging from 3 to 30 species did not show any trends towards deviations from a zero difference in AUC values of GARP minus AUC values of MAXENT. Ours results suggest that further studies are still necessary to establish under which circumstances the statistical performance of the methods vary. However, {{it is also important to}} consider the possibility that this empirical inductive reasoning may fail in the end, because we almost certainly could not establish all potential scenarios generating variation in the relative performance of models...|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{planners}} often wish {{to predict}} how species distributions will change in response to environmental changes. Species <b>distribution</b> <b>models</b> (SDMs) are the primary tool for making such predictions. Many methods are widely used; however, they all make simplifying assumptions, and predictions can therefore be subject to high uncertainty. With global change well underway, field records of observed range shifts are increasingly being used for testing SDM transferability. We used an unprecedented distribution dataset documenting recent range changes of British vascular plants, birds, and butterflies to test whether correlative SDMs based on climate change provide useful approximations of <b>potential</b> <b>distribution</b> shifts.

40|$|The <b>Potential</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>model</b> can {{describe}} {{at once the}} probability distribution and temporal distribution of rainfall. It also allows the incorporation of the dependence of the probability {{with the number of}} independent stations. This paper analyzes the probability distribution and temporal distribution of extreme rainfall in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country using daily data from 43 stations, with an average of 31 active stations between 1961 and 2000. It was found that this model provided a good adjustment (NMAE = 1. 4 %) for rainfall over 115 mm in 24 h, and is consistent with other analyses of extremes. Finally, the article proposes a mathematical relationship to estimate the maximum expected rainfall for a return period equal to or more than 10 years, with a duration longer than 1 minute, and for a given set of independent stations. This relationship depends on two exponents, one for the return period (m = 0. 23 ± 0. 02) and another for the duration (n = 0. 63 ± 0. 06). In addition, it also depends on a scale factor, which takes values between Po = 42 ± 2 mm to the south of the region and Po = 71 ± 5 mm to the north, with an average value for the Basque Country equal to 58 ± 2 mm...|$|R
40|$|Phytoplankton {{species are}} an {{important}} basis of the food web for various systems such as pelagic, coastal and lake. Due to their photosynthetic capacity, this community is sensitive to changes in light availability, temperature, nutrient concentrations, herbivores consumption, parasitism and competition. Therefore, they show a high spatial and temporal variability related to environmental changes both natural and anthropogenic. However, as any taxonomic group, phytoplankton species have environmental thresholds, ecological niches that define their distribution. This study was located in Aguamilpa Dam, an artificial aquatic reservoir which started operations in 1994 for electric energy production. In this system the <b>potential</b> <b>distribution</b> of the phytoplankton was evaluated, where the highest species richness and restricted distribution areas were identified. <b>Potential</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>models</b> based on ecological niche definition were generated using ArcMap 9. 2 ® with Maxent (Maximun Entropy Method). The development of distribution maps was carried out using Digital Elevation Models in cells of 100 m x 100 m (1 ha), based on nine physico-chemical and biological water parameters monitored in the reservoir. The highest species richness areas {{were found in the}} Huaynamota river tributary and at the station called La Confluencia, while the less abundance areas were found in the Santiago river tributary during warm and cold dry seasons with a great abundance of cyanophyta. During the rainfall season, the Huaynamota river tributary diversity areas were extended and the presence of some dominant species of cyanophyta were indentified. These species can be associated with trophic processes related to anthropogenic pollutants in the reservoir. This study illustrates the potential application of niche modeling approach in aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
