40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and toxicities of low-dose oral cyclophosphamide and oral etoposide {{in patients with}} persistent and recurrent cervical cancer with gross <b>pelvic</b> <b>disease</b> following full course of chemoradiation therapy. Materials and Methods: 30 patients with recurrent and persistent cervical cancer with gross <b>pelvic</b> <b>disease</b> were enrolled in this trial. The patients were randomly {{divided into two groups}} of 15 patients each with one group receiving low dose oral cyclophosphamide (100 mg/day) and the other group receiving low-dose oral etoposide (50 mg/day). Results were statistically analysed by IBM SPSS Statistics 19. Results: Oral etoposide was not well tolerated with grade 2 neutropenia occurring in 33. 3 % and grade 3 neutropenia in 6. 6 % and thrombocytopenia occurring in 13. 3 %. Oral cyclophosphamide group on the other hand was better tolerated with none of the patients having thrombocytopenia and 6. 6 % patients having grade 2 neutropenia. There were two complete response (15. 38 %) and one partial response at the end of study (7. 6 %) in the cyclophosphamide group whereas there was no complete response and two partial response (16. 6 %) in the oral etoposide group. Conclusion: Long-term, low-dose oral etoposide was found to be less tolerated without any significant effect with patients with persistent and recurrent cervical cancer with gross <b>pelvic</b> <b>disease</b> following full course of chemoradiation therapy in contrast to oral cyclophosphamide which was found to be effective and well-tolerated by the patients...|$|E

40|$|MIDWIFE´S ROLE IN EDUCATION OF WOMEN WITH <b>PELVIC</b> INFLAMMATORY <b>DISEASE</b> Nowadays, {{the number}} of women who have underestimated the {{symptoms}} of <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> and who have been coping with its consequences such as chronic pain or infertility is increasing. Therefore the following topic was selected for the bachelor thesis: "Midwife´s Role in Education of Women with Pelvic Inflammatory Disease". The theoretical part of the bachelor thesis deals with the educational activity provided by a midwife, basic aetiology of <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease,</b> its treatment and nursing process for women with <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease.</b> A quantitative research method using anonymous questionnaires was selected for the practical part of the bachelor thesis. The research was conducted in the period of 1 January - 31 March 2011 and 93 responders participated in it. Three goals were stated in the thesis and they were met. The first goal of the research was to find out whether women are informed about the symptoms, treatment and subsequent prevention of <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease.</b> The second goal was to find out how satisfied women are with the level of education provided by a midwife in the field of <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease.</b> The third goal was to create educational material on <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease.</b> Further, for the purpose of the research, 3 hypotheses were stated. Hypothesis No. 1 : "Women are aware of the symptoms of <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> and they pay respective attention to them," was confirmed. Hypothesis No. 2 : "Women lack information on causative agents of <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> causing post-inflammatory changes such as infertility," was confirmed. Hypothesis No. 3 : !Women have enough information on causes of occurrence of gynaecological inflammation, its symptoms, treatment and subsequent prevention," was not confirmed.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to compare the expression of plasma stromal cell-derived factor 1 and the gene poly-morphism in patients with <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> and healthy controls. The enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism were, respectively, {{used to measure the}} plasma stromal cell-derived factor 1 a level and stromal cell-derived factor 1 polymorphism in 50 healthy controls and in 44 patients with <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> before and after they received routine treatment protocols. The level of plasma stromal cell-derived factor 1 a was ele-vated in patients with <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> compared to normal controls and decreased significantly after treatment. There were significant correlations between plasma stromal cell-derived factor 1 a level and neutrophil count as well as between stromal cell-derived factor 1 a level and white blood cell count in patients with <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease.</b> There was no significantly different distribution of stromal cell-derived factor 1 genotypes between patients with <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> and normal controls. Patients with <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> having stromal cell-derived factor 1 - 30 A allele were associated with significantly elevated plasma stromal cell-derived factor 1 a concentration compared to patients with <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> having G/G homozygous alleles (P <. 02). In normal controls, {{there was no significant difference}} in the plasma stromal cell-derived factor 1 level between individuals with and with-out stromal cell-derived factor 1 - 30 A allele. When the cutoff level of plasma stromal cell-derived factor 1 a level was determined to be 2192 pg/mL based on receiver-operating characteristic curve, the sensitivity, spe-cificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value as well as accuracy were 77. 3 %, 88. 0 %, 85. 0 %, 81. 5 %, and 83. 0 %.

40|$|Background: <b>Pelvic</b> {{inflammatory}} <b>disease</b> is a community-acquired infection {{accounting for}} approximately 1. 2 million hospital visits and $ 1. 88 billion in cost {{annually in the}} United States. Few interventions are available {{for the prevention of}} <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease.</b> Intrauterine devices are a well established method of contraception, in addition, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices may provide a protective advantage against <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease.</b> This review aims to evaluate the available evidence to determine if levonorgestrel intrauterine devices, in addition to contraception, provide a protective benefit against <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> when compared to other intrauterine devices. Method: An extensive literature search was performed using the databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Duplicate results and non-English articles were excluded. Articles meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed using the GRADE system. Results: The literature search identified three articles that met inclusion criteria. All studies were randomized comparison trials involving a levonorgestrel intrauterine device compared to one or more forms of copper intrauterine device. Studies showed conflicting evidence supporting the benefit of levonorgestrel intrauterine devices for the prevention of <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease.</b> All studies were of very low quality. Conclusion: Limited very low quality evidence is available to support the potential benefit of levonorgestrel intrauterine devices for the prevention of <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease.</b> Research results are conflicting and there is a small amount of very low quality evidence to support this theory. Based on the current research levonorgestrel intrauterine devices for the prevention of <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory <b>disease</b> are not recommended.

Another tracer that follows the amino acid transport mechanism is 18 F-FACBC which is a radiolabeled analog of leucine [23].
