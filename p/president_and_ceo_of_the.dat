5|$|The IFC {{is governed}} by its Board of Governors which meets {{annually}} and consists of one governor per member country (most often the country's finance minister or treasury secretary).

The IFC's Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors who meet regularly and work at the IFC's headquarters, and is chaired by the President of the World Bank Group. The executive directors collectively represent all 184 member countries. When the IFC's Board of Directors votes on matters brought before it, each executive director's vote is weighted according to the total share capital of the member countries represented by that director. The IFC's Executive Vice President and CEO oversees its overall direction and daily operations.
