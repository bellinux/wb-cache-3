50|$|Most {{centrifugal}} pumps are not self-priming. In other words, the pump casing must {{be filled with}} liquid before the pump is started, or the pump {{will not be able}} to function. If the pump casing becomes filled with vapors or gases, the pump impeller becomes gas-bound and incapable of pumping. To ensure that a centrifugal pump remains primed and does not become gas-bound, most {{centrifugal pumps}} are located below the level of the source from which the pump is to take its suction.

These pumps need special {{attention}} on cavitation performance because the cavitation erosion rate is related to impeller speed.

To solve the problems, two different impellers were analyzed with respect to ?as-built? deviations in inlet angles and leading edge shape compared to design. Experimental and numerical methods were applied to study the ?as-built? and ?design? versions. It is shown that ?as-built? local inlet angles and shapes controlled the cavitation performance.

40|$|Twin {{screw pumps}} (TSPs) are {{commonly}} used for multiphase boosting systems to enhance oil and gas production. TSPs are a positive displacement pump that can efficiently handle fluids {{with a wide range}} of gas volume fractions (GVFs). The present study has developed a model to predict the performance of TSPs for varying GVFs, <b>pump</b> speeds, <b>suction</b> <b>pressures,</b> and differential pressures. A two-phase compressible flow model is used to determine the rate of leakage backflow through clearances within the pump. The model incorporates the possibility of choking due to sonic flow. Hydraulic imbalances cause rotor deflection, and the model accounts for increased leakage flowrates due to the induced eccentric rotation. The model was validated with experimental data from a Colfax MR- 200 TSP, and there is good agreement in most test cases. However, cases with low speeds and high differential pressures were not as reliable. This may be due to uncertainty of the rates of gas infiltration into the clearances at low pump speeds. The study reveals that pump performance is generally better when operating at high pump speeds, high GVF, low <b>suction</b> <b>pressures,</b> or low differential pressures. Linear pressure distributions throughout the pump?s chambers generally indicate lower volumetric efficiency compared to steep, concave pressure distributions. The effects of rotor deflection are generally small, but in a few cases they should not be ignored. Choking occurred at the circumferential, flank, and root clearances in 18 %, 13 %, and 99 % of the test cases, respectively. The presence of choked leakage flow marginally improved the pump performance...|$|R

50|$|Pumps {{typically}} have an inlet where the fluid enters the pump {{and an outlet}} where the fluid comes out. The inlet location {{is said to be}} at the suction side of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the discharge side of the pump. Operation of the <b>pump</b> creates <b>suction</b> (a lower <b>pressure)</b> at the <b>suction</b> side so that fluid can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the <b>pump's</b> <b>suction</b> and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the <b>suction</b> <b>pressure</b> of a centrifugal pump is too low, a device may trigger the pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.|$|R
40|$|The {{progressing}} {{cavity pump}} {{is a type}} of positive displacement pump that is capable of moving nearly any fluid. This type of pump transports fluids in a series of discrete cavities formed by the helical geometries of its rigid rotor and elastomeric stator. With appropriate materials for the rotor and stator, this pump can move combinations of liquids, suspended solids, and gasses equally well. Because of its versatility, the progressing cavity pump is widely used in the oil industry to transport mixtures of oil, water, and sediment; this investigation was prompted by a desire to extend the use of progressing cavity pumps to wet gas pumping applications. One of the progressing cavity pump's limitations is that the friction between the rotor and stator can generate enough heat to damage the rotor if the pump is not lubricated and cooled by the process fluid. Conventional wisdom dictates that this type of pump will overheat if it pumps only gas, with no liquid in the process fluid. If a progressing cavity pump is used to boost the output from a wet gas well, it could potentially be damaged if the well's output is too dry {{for an extended period of}} time. This project seeks to determine how a progressing cavity pump behaves when operating at gas volume fractions between 0. 90 and 0. 98. A progressing cavity pump manufactured by seepex, model no. BN 130 - 12, is tested at half and full speed using air-water mixtures with gas volume fractions of 0. 90, 0. 92, 0. 94, 0. 96, and 0. 98. The pump's inlet and outlet conditions are controlled to produce <b>suction</b> <b>pressures</b> of 15, 30, and 45 psi and outlet pressures 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 psi higher than the inlet pressure. A series of thermocouples, pressure transducers, and turbine flow meters measures the pump's inlet and outlet conditions, the flow rates of water and air entering the pump, and pressures and temperatures at four positions within the pump's stator. Over all test conditions, the maximum recorded temperature of the pump stator did not exceed the maximum safe rubber temperature specified by the manufacturer. The pump?s flow rate is independent of both the fluid's gas volume fraction and the pressure difference across the pump, but it increases slightly with the <b>pump's</b> <b>suction</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>pump's</b> mechanical load, however, is dependent only on the pressure difference across the pump and increases linearly with that parameter. Pressure measurements within the stator demonstrated that the leakage between the pump's cavities increases with the fluids gas volume fraction, indicating that liquid inside the pump improves its sealing capability. However, those same measurements failed to detect any appreciable leakage between the two pressure taps nearest the pump's inlet. This last observation suggests that the pump could be shortened by as much as 25 percent without losing any performance in the range of tested conditions; shortening the pump should increase its efficiency by decreasing its frictional mechanical load...|$|R
