40|$|<b>Predaceous</b> <b>insect</b> {{encounter}} {{rate was}} measured in 21 southeast Nebraska alfalfa fields through weekly sweep net sampling during 2002 - 03. The most frequently encountered <b>predaceous</b> <b>insect</b> families were Coccinellidae (Coleoptera), Nabidae (Hemiptera), and Chrysopidae (Neuroptera). The study used multiple regression analysis to {{examine the effect of}} aphid abundance and the surrounding vegetative patch composition on <b>predaceous</b> <b>insect</b> abundance. In 2002, Hippodamia parenthesis Say was encountered more frequently in fields with lower aphid abundances, and Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, Coccinella septempunctata L., and Nabis americoferus Carayon were encountered more frequently in fields with higher aphid abundances. In 2003, Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer was encountered more frequently in fields with higher aphid abundance. The remaining two species of coccinellids and Chryoperla spp. did not exhibit significant correlations with aphid abundance in either year. It was determined that in 2002, H. parenthesis was encountered more frequently in alfalfa surrounded by a higher percentage of unfarmed land, and C. maculata, C. septempunctata, N. americoferus,, and Chrysoperla spp. were encountered more frequently in alfalfa surrounded by a higher percentage of farmed land. In 2003, N. americoferus was again encountered more frequently in alfalfa fields surrounded by a higher percentage of farmed land. The remaining three coccinellid species collected did not exhibit significant relationships between vegetative patch composition and encounter rate in either year...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the abundance of}} spiders and predaceous insects in five central California vineyards. Spiders constituted 98. 1 % of all predators collected. More than 90 % of all spiders collected were from eight species of spiders, representing six families. Two theridiids (Theridion dilutum and T. melanurum) were the most abundant, followed by a miturgid (Cheiracanthium inclusum) and an agelinid (Hololena nedra). Predaceous insects comprised 1. 6 % of all predators collected, and were represented by six genera in five families. Nabis americoferis (Heteroptera, Nabidae) {{was the most common}} <b>predaceous</b> <b>insect,</b> with its densities highest late in the growing season. Chrysoperla carnea, Chrysoperla comanche and Chrysopa oculata (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae) and Hippodamia convergens (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) were most abundant early in the season. The dominance of spiders may be due to their more stable position in the vineyard predator community compared to predaceous insects. We also suggest that the low percentage of predaceous insects (e. g., lacewings) may reflect the lack of preferred prey (e. g., aphids) on grapevines...|$|E
40|$|The green lacewing, Chrysopa pallens Rambur, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} natural predators because of its extensive spectrum of prey and wide distribution. However, what we know about the nutritional and reproductive physiology of this species is very scarce. By cDNA amplification and Illumina short-read sequencing, we analyzed transcriptomes of C. pallens female adult under starved and fed conditions. In total, 71236 unigenes were obtained with an average length of 833 bp. Four vitellogenins, three insulin-like peptides and two insulin receptors were annotated. Comparison of gene expression profiles suggested that totally 1501 genes were differentially expressed between the two nutritional statuses. KEGG orthology classification showed that these differentially expression genes (DEGs) were mapped to 241 pathways. In turn, the top 4 are ribosome, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, biosynthesis of amino acids and carbon metabolism, indicating a distinct difference in nutritional and reproductive signaling between the two feeding conditions. Our study yielded large-scale molecular information relevant to C. pallens nutritional and reproductive signaling, which will contribute to mass rearing and commercial use of this <b>predaceous</b> <b>insect</b> species...|$|E
50|$|Chitin {{synthesis}} inhibitors work {{by preventing}} {{the formation of}} chitin, a carbohydrate needed to form the insect's exoskeleton. With these inhibitors, an insect grows normally until it molts. The inhibitors prevent the new exoskeleton from forming properly, causing the insect to die. Death may be quick, or take up to several days depending on the insect. Chitin synthesis inhibitors can also kill eggs by disrupting normal embryonic development. Chitin synthesis inhibitors affect insects {{for longer periods of}} time than hormonal IGRs. These are also quicker acting but can affect <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects,</b> arthropods and even fish. Compounds include benzoylurea pesticides.|$|R
30|$|A {{group of}} predators was found {{associated}} with the scale insects on citrus. Among the <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects,</b> the two coccinellids, Chilochorus bipustulatus L. and Scymnus syriacus March, were reported by Tawfik et al. (1970) (for C. ficus) and Mahmoud (1981) for A. aurantii and L. beckii. The former predator was considered by both authors as the most efficient. Metwally et al. (1999) at Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate (northern Egypt) studied seasonal abundance of the coccinellid predator, Clitostethus arcuatus (Rossi). This predator accounted 41.9 % {{of the total number}} of predators found {{associated with the}} citrus whitefly Dialeurodes citri (Ashm.) on citrus trees, where a mean number of the predator reached 15 individuals/ 80 double net-strokes, as described.|$|R
40|$|Commercial filbert {{orchards}} {{throughout the}} Willamette Valley were surveyed for natural {{enemies of the}} filbert aphid, Myzocallis coryli (Goetze). A large number of <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects</b> were found to prey upon M. coryli, particularly members of the families Coccinellidae, Miridae, Chrysopidae, Hemerobiidae, and Syrphidae. Also, a parasitic Hymenopteran (Mesidiopsis sp.) and a fungal pathogen (Triplosporium fresenii) were found to attack this aphid species. Populations of major predators were monitored closely during 1981 to determine phenology and synchrony with aphid populations and to determine their relative importance. Adalia bipunctata, Deraeocoris brevis, Chrysopa sp. and Hemerobius sp. {{were found to be}} extremely well synchronized with aphid population development cycles. Laboratory feeding trials demonstrated that all 4 <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects</b> tested (Deraeocoris brevis, Heterotoma meriopterum, Compsidolon salicellum and Adalia bipunctata) had a severe impact upon filbert aphid population growth. A. bipunctata was more voracious than the other 3 species, but could not live as long in the absence of aphid prey. Several insecticides were tested both in the laboratory and field to determine their relative toxicity to filbert aphids and the major natural enemies. Field tests showed Metasystox-R to be the most effective against filbert aphids, while Diazinon, Systox, Zolone, and Thiodan were moderately effective. Sevin was relatively ineffective. All insecticides tested in the field severely disrupted the predator complex. Laboratory tests showed all insecticides to be very toxic to Adalia bipunctata and Deraeocoris brevis, although Zolone caused a significantly lower mortality. Samples from a block of trees sprayed twice with Sevin showed higher aphid numbers late in the season than a comparable unsprayed block. This is interpreted as an indication that many aphid problems in commercial orchards are induced by insecticide disruption of natural biological control. Possible solutions to this problem are discussed...|$|R
40|$|During unusually wet {{years the}} {{salinity}} of the Great Salt Lake (Utah) decreased from above 100 g/L to 50 g/L. This allowed the <b>predaceous</b> <b>insect</b> Trichocorixa verticalis {{to invade the}} pelagic region {{of the lake and}} reach a mean summer density of 52 /m 3. Concurrent changes in the pelagic ecosystem were: a decrease in the dry biomass of the previously dominant filter-feeding brine shrimp Artemia franciscana from 720 to 2 mg/m 3, the invasion of three other zooplankton taxa, a 10 × decrease in community filtration rate, a 20 × increase in chlorophyll a concentration, a 4 × decrease in water clarity and perhaps a decrease in soluble nutrients. Trichocorixa abundance was also inversely correlated with the abundance of Artemia along a salinity gradient in the lake 2 ̆ 7 s estuary. In a 9 -d microcosm experiment Trichocorixa preyed on nauplii and decreased the total density of Artemia from 103 to 6 /L. The reduction in Artemia allowed protozoans to increase 10 – 100 ×. Changes in chlorophyll and clarity were consistent with those observed in the lake. These results suggest that invertebrate predation may be an important factor structuring simple food webs such as those found in moderately saline lakes...|$|E
40|$|A twelve-month {{survey for}} {{mosquito}} predators {{was conducted in}} Townsville, Queensland, Australia, which {{is located in the}} arid tropics. The survey revealed the presence of five <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects</b> but only Anisops sp. (backswimmers) and Diplonychus sp. were common. Predatorial capacity and factors influencing this capacity were then assessed for adult Anisops sp. and adult and nymph stages of Diplonychus sp. against Culex annulirostris mosquito immatures under laboratory conditions. Predatorial capacity bioassays showed that adult Diplonychus sp. preyed upon both larval and pupal stages of Cx. annulirostris quite successfully. Nymphs of Diplonychus sp. proved to be more successful with smaller prey immatures, and Anisops sp adults did not prey successfully on any prey pupae. Increasing the foraging area and introducing aquatic vegetation significantly reduced the predatorial capacity of Diplonychus sp. nymphs, while only vegetation and not foraging area had a significant effect on adult Diplonychus sp. predation capacity. Overall, adult Diplonychus sp. proved to be a more efficient predator than Anisops sp., and field trials are now recommended to further assess the potential of Diplonychus sp. as a biocontrol agent...|$|R
40|$|Aggression plays a {{key role}} all across the animal kingdom, as it allows the {{acquisition}} and/or defence of limited resources (food, mates and territories) in a huge number of species. A large part of our knowledge on aggressive behaviour has been developed on insects of economic importance. How can this knowledge be exploited to enhance integrated pest management? Here, I highlight how knowledge on intraspecific aggression can help IPM both in terms of insect pests (with a focus on the enhancement of the sterile insect technique) and in terms of biological control agents (with a focus on mass-rearing optimisation). Then, I examine what implications for IPM can be outlined from knowledge about interspecific aggressive behaviour. Besides predator-pest aggressive interactions predicted by classic biological control, I focus on what IPM can learn from (i) interspecific aggression among pest species (with special reference to competitive displacement), (ii) defensive behaviour exhibited by prey against <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects</b> and (iii) conflicts among predaceous arthropods sharing the same trophic niche (with special reference to learning/sensitisation practices and artificial manipulation of chemically mediated interactions) ...|$|R
40|$|In 2006 and 2007, a {{wide range}} of fruit crops were {{surveyed}} to determine the species composition of thrips and predators of thrips in the Çukurova region located in the Eastern Mediterranean area of Turkey. Weed hosts of thrips species and fruit damage due to attacks of thrips were also investigated. Twenty thrips species were identified, belonging to the Aeolothripidae (six species), Phlaeothripidae (three species) and Thripidae (eleven species). Frankliniella occidentalis and Thrips major were the most prevalent species, sharing high ratios (46 % and 37 %, respectively). Most of the thrips specimens sampled, by number, were taken from nectarines, followed by peach, apple and plum. Large numbers of F. occidentalis were often recorded on blossoms of nectarines, peach and plum while T. major was the predominant thrips on apple, loquat and pear. The generalist predators, Orius laevigatus and O. niger (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), were the prevailing <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects</b> and mostly detected on loquat infested by thrips during autumn and winter. High numbers of adult and larval thrips inhabited the yellow and multiflowered weed species grown around or inside the fruit orchards. Injury from thrips was high on nectarines with a proportion of 29 %, followed by plum (17 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The coccinellid predator, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) {{was used}} to control the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri (Risso.) (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) on the croton {{ornamental}} shrubs, Codiaeum variegatum L. at Giza governorate, Egypt. Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant, 50 adults/Croton shrub, were released once on October 27, 2008 in the open field. Obtained results indicated that percentages of reduction among the egg masses, nymphs and adults of P. citri, one month after releasing the predator reached to 41. 5, 42. 3 and 57. 5 %, respectively. Two months later, the corresponding rates were 80. 6, 86. 5 and 91. 5 %. Finally, {{after three months of}} releasing the predator, reduction rates reached to 100 % for all stages of the pest. The associated natural enemies in the field were consisted of three <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects</b> and one parasitic species. The insect predators secured were the hemerobiid predator, Sympherobius amicus Navas; the coccinellid predator, Scymnus syriacus (Mars.) and the chrysopid predator, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens). The parasitic species was the encyrtid, Coccidoxenoides peregrinus (Timberlake). The aforementioned natural enemies were found feeding on the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri infesting croton shrubs. In the second season, 2009 there is no mealybug, P. citri individuals were found on the croton shrubs...|$|R
40|$|Riparian {{wetlands}} are hotspots {{for both}} biodiversity and development, creating a management challenge that requires detailed biological research (Burger 2000; Decamps et al. 2004). Extensive housing development on Midwestern lakes simplifies vegetation structure, often by removal of understory plants and floating macrophytes (Racey & Euler 1982; Radomski & Goeman 2001). This change may diminish the riparian and littoral biodiversity that most homeowners value (Bryan & Scarnecchia 1992; Lindsay 2002; Woodford & Meyer 2003), although policy-makers require more {{data to support}} shoreline buffer regulations. For oviparous animals that do not provide care for offspring, reproductive success depends on females selecting optimal oviposition sites. Because all dragonflies and damselflies (order Odonata) are excellent dispersers and generalist predators, habitat selection could {{play a key role}} in odonate community composition (e. g., De Marco & Resende 2004). Many odonate species respond more rapidly to altered vegetation structure than other animals do, making them useful bioindicators of riparian habitat integrity (e. g., Samways & Taylor 2004; Foote & Hornung 2005). However, lack of information on why <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects</b> require plants makes this correlation difficult to apply as a wetlands monitoring tool. Understanding when and why Odonates are sensitive to riparian plants can strengthen their utility as indicator species. I propose to study how riparian plants influence adult odonates selecting ovipositio...|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} natural enemies, which play an {{important}} role against rice pests, especially C. agamemnon (Tantawy; personal communication). There are two species of true spiders; one belongs to the genus Lycosa (Fam. Lycosidae) and the other is Areneus inustus (Fam. Araneidae), both predating on moths of the rice stem borer, the cotton leaf worm, and the rice butterfly. Some <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects</b> are also found in the rice fields feeding vigorously on eggs and young larvae of these insects. Among these predators are Reduvius pallipes (Reduviidae), the staphylinid Paederus alfierii Koch., and some anthocorids. It appears, also, that the egg parasitoid T. evanescens West. plays a promising role against the stem borer, especially late in the season (time of the fourth generation of this pest). Consequently, a natural range of parasitism (95.5 – 96.2 %) was recorded (Sherif et al. 2005). Accordingly, it was recommended, in the first symposium of the Egyptian Society of Biological Control of Pests (ESBCP) that was held in Cairo in February 1992, not to undertake any insecticidal application in rice fields, except when degree of infestation with the rice stem borer exceeds the economic threshold <)[*] 7 %(. In the frame of the IPM program in rice fields, utilization of T. evanescens through inundative releases has been highly recommended in case of high infestation with the pest.|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{the study of}} insect {{pathogens}} was not {{regarded as one of}} the duties of the entomologist. When insects became numerous and caused economic damage, they were combatted either with insecticides or by the introduction of parasitic or <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects.</b> The use of insecticides in the forest is not economical. Forest entomologists therefore resorted largely to the introduction and propagation of parasitic insects. Unfortunately, experience has shown, in many cases, that introduced parasites multiply too slowly to check current insect infestations. Insect pathogens multiply rapidly and at times contribute more to the control of insect pests than all other combined control factors. The control of the European spruce sawfly by disease created new interest in the possible use of insect pathogens in biological control. Relatively few insect diseases have been discovered. Those which are now known are the obvious cases. A study of any insect population probably would reveal one or more pathogens affecting it. This is being demonstrated as the result of the newly created interest and research in insect pathology. The discovery of an organism pathogenic to insects does not necessarily imply that it can be propagated and immediately disseminated in nature and effect control. This has been attempted too often in the past with disappointing results. Any program of artificial dissemination must be based on a thorough knowledge of the nature of the organism [ [...] . ...|$|R

30|$|The early instar larvae of S. litura {{had shown}} normal {{digestion}} compared to control while proceeding the larvae {{failed to show}} a good sign of digestion process in terms of reduced AD. The higher AD values in the early instars of infected larvae {{may be due to}} the little consumption of the treated part. Likewise, the lower AD values in the late instars were because these caterpillars consumed food indiscriminately to meet the demand for energy and nitrogen (Hussain et al. 2009). In support of the present investigation, Hussain et al. (2009) observed higher AD values in Ocinara varians larvae infected with entomopathogenic fungi compared to the healthy control. The present investigation recorded reduced conversion potential (digested as well ingested food) of the treated larvae. Slansky and Scriber (1982) found that the utilization efficiencies (ECI) of 11 <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects</b> were between 4 and 75  %, while in the present investigation, the isolate I. fumosorosea fraction treated larvae had shown comparatively higher reduction in ECD and ECI which ranged from 75 to 46  % with respect to III to V instar larvae. In support of the present study, Sintim et al. (2009) observed 45.8  % ECI value in S. litura when fed with artificial diet.

40|$|The arroyo chub, Gila orcutti, is {{native to}} the {{watersheds}} of southern California and has been proposed {{as a replacement for}} the non-native western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, as a biological control agent for mosquitoes in sensitive watersheds throughout the region. Because mosquito-eating fish are not strictly larvivorous, they also have the potential to impact non-target organisms in systems where they are introduced. The impact of arroyo chub stocking density on the invertebrate community, and the suitability of a riverine constructed wetland as conservation habitat for the arroyo chub population, in the Santa Ana River were evaluated at the Prado Wetlands in Riverside County, California. Invertebrate abundance and community structure did not differ significantly among three stocking densities (0, 1. 5 and 6 kg/ha) during a five-week study in cage mesocosms. Approximately 16 months after stocking G. orcutti into a 0. 9 -ha wetland, nearly 3, 700 fish were collected; however, no arroyo chubs were recovered. All of the fish collected were invasive species in the Santa Ana River system and piscivory by non-native species most likely caused the extirpation of the arroyo chubs in the wetland. The ovipositional responses of female Culex tarsalis to semiochemicals produced by aquatic organisms in three aquatic guilds (<b>predaceous</b> <b>insects,</b> algivorous fish and predatory/larvivorous fish) were examined in laboratory choice assays. Previous binary choice trials have shown that female mosquitoes avoid laying eggs on water that contains fish exudates and will instead choose to oviposit on water without kairomones released by fish. Culex tarsalis was not deterred from ovipositing in cups containing semiochemicals from invertebrate predators and algivorous fish, but was deterred from ovipositing in cups containing arroyo chub semiochemicals...|$|R
40|$|Field {{studies of}} {{population}} of Geocoris and Nabis {{indicated that the}} density of adult Nabis was higher than Geocoris before April, but the reverse was true after April. In general, the abundance of adults and nymphs of each species was caused by alfalfa harvesting, dispersal of adults, discrepancies of sweep-net sampling, differences in mortality of eggs and {{the differences in the}} diapause termination of adults. The field cuttings of alfalfa reduced populations of both species, but adults were reduced more than the nymphs. In laboratory studies adults and nymphs of each species fed on each other on alfalfa in small cages, but in larger cages when only adults were caged, interspecific predation of adults did not occur. This suggests that, in the field, interspecific predation of nymphs can be more prevalent than adults of each species since nymphs which are more sedentary than adults are less affected by alfalfa cuttings. A number of predatory insects other than Nabis that were common in the alfalfa, such as Chrysopa carnea Stephens, Orius tristicolor (White), Hippodamia convergens Guerin, and Sinea confusa Caudell, were also found to prey upon Geocoris in the laboratory. Hyalomya aldrichii Townsend was the only parasite reared from Geocoris adults and nymphs from the field. The parasite did not numerically respond to the density of Geocoris and had minor impact on the population of the predator. The host preference of this parasite among the Geocoris spp. and between Geocoris and Nabis was not determined since rearing the parasite in the laboratory failed. Telenomus sp. parasitized groups of Geocoris eggs exposed in alfalfa fields. In the laboratory, it parasitized both G. pallens and G. punctipes eggs. Rearing the parasite at 30 (DEGREES) C resulted in poorer emergence of adults than at 20 (DEGREES) C and 25 (DEGREES) C. <b>Predaceous</b> <b>insects</b> that synchronize with populations of Geocoris, larger in size then Geocoris, especially Nabis and Sinea spp. may be more important than parasites in regulating population of Geocoris in the field...|$|R
40|$|The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is an {{economically}} important pest of citrus because {{it serves as}} a vector of the causal pathogens of huanglongbing (HLB) also known as citrus greening disease. The increased use of insecticides for control of D. citri negatively impacts several natural enemies including some effective ladybeetle species which are not available commercially. The two-spotted ladybeetle, Adalia bipunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is found in some crop and forest ecosystems of Asia, Europe and North America and available commercially. It is known to attack aphids and mealybugs but there are no published records of feeding on psyllids. We evaluated suitability and preference of A. bipunctata for nymphs of D. citri compared to corn leaf aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis (Hemiptera: Aphididae) a global pest of cereal crops and prey for many <b>predaceous</b> <b>insects.</b> We also compared development and reproduction of A. bipunctata on these two species with frozen eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) at 25 °C. Initially, more D. citri than R. maidis nymphs were consumed in the no-choice tests although final consumption by larva and adult of A. bipunctata did not differ in the choice and no-choice tests. Larval development was prolonged by one day on D. citri compared to R. maidis nymphs but did not differ between either of these diets and E. kuehniella. Larval survival to adult averaged 93 - 100 % and was not impacted by diet. Adult life span did not differ between diets although those on D. citri and R. maidis nymphs weighed less and produced fewer but more fertile eggs than on E. kuehniella eggs.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{suggested}} that Mycobacterium ulcerans, the etiological agent of Buruli ulcer, may be transmitted to humans by insect bites. M. ulcerans has been isolated from a <b>predaceous</b> aquatic <b>insect,</b> and PCR detection of M. ulcerans DNA in aquatic environments suggests that the organism is widely distributed within many invertebrate taxa and functional feeding groups. Thus, M. ulcerans may be concentrated through different trophic links. However, the specific environmental niche of M. ulcerans and route of transmission to humans remain a mystery. In this study, a biologically relevant infection model in which M. ulcerans-infected mosquito larvae were fed to a species of predaceous hemiptera (African Belostomatidae) was used to demonstrate the persistent colonization of M. ulcerans and subsequent transmission of bacteria to naïve prey. The association of M. ulcerans with specific anatomical compartments showed that M. ulcerans accumulates preferentially on the exoskeleton. In contrast, few organisms were found in dissected guts or salivary glands. No difference was found between the ability of wild-type M. ulcerans and an M. ulcerans isogenic mycolactone-negative mutant to colonize belostomatids. These data show that African belostomatids can successfully be colonized by M. ulcerans and support the trophic transfer of M. ulcerans within the environment...|$|R

"December 2012 "Naucorids are <b>predaceous</b> aquatic <b>insects</b> and the principal arthropod predators of biting fly larvae. Naucorids exert natural control of mosquito larvae and are important with respect to malaria in Tanzania. However, naucorids have been documented to harbor the mycobacterium responsible for Buruli ulcer in Africa, although transmission is not known. Therefore, to provide a sound foundation for future biological, ecological, and epidemiological investigations, a study to document the taxonomic composition and distribution of the species of Naucoridae of Tanzania was conducted from 2010 to 2012; a total of 127 localities sampled. Habitats sampled included streams, rivers, waterfalls, ponds, lakes, reservoirs, swamps, and cold and hot springs. Previously, only four genera and seven species were known from Tanzania. All taxa previously recorded from Tanzania were re-collected except two species (Neomacrocoris karimii Poisson and N. usambaricus Montandon). These collections added an additional two genera and eight species, including two undescribed species of Neomacrocoris and one undescribed species of Macrocoris. As a result, the known fauna of Naucoridae of Tanzania now comprises 6 genera and 14 species. This study provides the first authoritative identification resource to determine the entire fauna of Naucoridae of an African country using modern techniques.

Five to eight taxa on each plant species showed significant differences in abundance among years. Aphids and scale <b>insects,</b> <b>predaceous</b> mirids, and some detritivores showed peak abundances in 1999, a particularly dry year, whereas most other taxa showed lowest abundances during 1999 or declining abundances during this period, suggesting association with wetter conditions. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS), supported by multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP), showed that arthropod assemblages differed significantly among the seven plant species, especially between overstory conifers and understory angiosperms, and among the 3 years. These data indicate that the diversity and structure of arthropod communities depend on vegetation structure and/or condition, perhaps as modified by annual variation in weather conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} is {{the result}} of research by the above listed students. It is intended to provide dichotomous keys to species of Reduviidae listed as occurring in Florida. Records are based on literature only. Figures are mostly from Blatchley's Heteroptera of Eastern North America. ] This is a large group (more than 160 North American species) of predaceous bugs, and many species are fairly common. They are often blackish of brownish in color, but many are brightly colored. The head is usually elongate with the part behind the eyes neck like. The beak is short and three-segmented, and its tip fits into a stridulatory groove in the prosternum. The abdomen in many species is widened in the middle, exposing the lateral margins of the segments beyond the wings. Most species are <b>predaceous</b> on other <b>insects,</b> but a few are bloodsucking and frequently bite people. Many species will inflict a painful bite if carelessly handled. One {{of the largest and most}} easily recognized assassin bugs is the wheel bug, Arilus cristatus (L.), a grayish bug 28 - 36 mm in length, with a semicircular crest on the pronotum that terminates in teeth and resembles a cogwheel. This species is fairly common in the East. The Masked hunter, Reduvius personatus (L.) is a brownish black bug 17 - 22 mm in length that is often found in houses. It feeds on bed bugs, but will also bite people. The nymphs are soft-bodied an...|$|R
40|$|Family VII. Asilidae. This family {{comprises}} the well-known and universally distributed "Robber Flies," so called {{on account of}} their predaceous habits. The species are of medium or large size, the head attached to the thorax by a slender neck; front excavated between the eyes, which are separated in both sexes; thorax with well-developed bristles; wings with the normal venation of the Brachyctra, posterior cells five in number, the three basal cells always long. The Asilidae are strongly-built <b>predaceous</b> flies, attacking <b>insects</b> of widely differing orders. I have seen a specimen of Asiliis alcetus having as its prey a dragonfly very much larger than itself. In Tasmania the species are only of moderate size, but on the mainland of Australia some very large species occur, one of these - Phellus glaucus —being {{one of the largest}} known diptera. Family VIII. BOMBYLIDAE Moderate-sized or rather large sun-loving flies; thoracic bristles usually present, but these are often concealed under dense furry pubescence; proboscis frequently much elongated; legs thin and slender and almost without bristles; wings with only three or four posterior cells. Family IX. EMPIDAE The Empidae form a very large family of small flies of inconspicuous appearance, which sometimes occur in great abundance. They are predaceous in their habits, preying on other diptera. Their habits are somewhat diverse. Species of Hilara occur flying in numbers over the surface of pools and streams, or, more rarely, over the bare ground; species of Empis may be found frequenting flowers or dancing in the air; those of Leptopeza frequenting low vegetation. The greater number of Tasmanian species occur in the spring time, whilst two species are found in midwinter; during the height of summer but few species are to be met with. Family X. DOLICHOPODIDAE. Most of the flies belonging to this family are partly or altogether metallic green in colour, but this may be varied with metallic blue, grey, or violet; even the most soberly coloured species usually exhibit at least a metallic tinge. Frequently a great difference exists between the two sexes, and owing to this fact, and also because the chief generic and specific distinctions are shown by the male, I have, {{with the exception of the}} unmistakeable genus Sciapus, only described those species in which the male is known to me. This gives a total of twelve Tasmanian species, but this number is likely in the future to be greatly increased. Family XI. PHORIDAE. This family seems to be very poorly represented in Australia, only five species having so far been described. One of these is a curious, wingless form, discovered by Lea in an ants' nest in Victoria, and described by him under the name of Euterimorphin abdominalis. In Tasmania only one species is at present known to occur. Included at the end are an Addenda et Corrigenda for Part I and a systematic list of the species described in this paper...|$|R
