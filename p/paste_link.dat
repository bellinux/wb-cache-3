40|$|To {{combine the}} {{affordance}} {{of paper and}} computers, prior research has proposed numerous interactive paper systems that link specific paper document content to digital operations such as multimedia playback and proofreading. Yet, it remains unclear to what degree these systems bridge the inherent gap between paper and computers when compared to existing paper-only and computer-only interfaces. In particular, given the special properties of paper, such as limited dynamic feedback, how well does an average novice user learn to master an interactive paper system? What factors affect the user performance? And how does the paper interface work in a typical use scenario? To answer these questions, we conducted two empirical experiments on a generic pen-gesture-based command system, called PapierCraft [Liao, et al., 2008], for paper-based interfaces. With PapierCraft, people can select sections of printed documents and issue commands such as copy and <b>paste,</b> <b>linking</b> and in-text search. The first experiment focused on the user performance of drawing pen gestures on paper. It proves that users can learn the command system in about 30 minutes and achieve a performance comparable to a Table PC-based interface supporting the same gestures. The second experiment examined {{the application of the}} command system in active reading tasks. The results show promise for seamless integration of paper and computers in active reading for their combined affordance. In addition, our study reveals some key design issues, such as the pen form factor and feedback of gestures. This paper contributes to better understanding on pros and cons of paper and computers, and sheds light on the design of future interfaces for document interaction...|$|R

Out of this database, we identified 1, 300 e-mail addresses of key informants—managers at executive levels such as CEOs or managing directors. In addition, the questionnaire was announced by trade associations such as the Association of German Freight Forwarders and Logistics Operators (DSLV), German Logistics Association (BVL) and the trade journal DVZ. The web-based questionnaire was conducted in February and March of 2011. We used the Unipark survey tool—a program used by more than 300 universities worldwide—for the question design and the collection of responses. The e-mail invitations were then sent to the sample members. Each respondent received an Internet link to the questionnaire, which allowed him to skip a question or pause and continue answering at any time. In contrast, the <b>link</b> <b>pasted</b> in the announcements of the trade associations did not allow for this feature. A total of 85 companies replied during the first 4  weeks. After the second mailing, an additional 63 usable surveys were received. The public announcements delivered another 15 usable responses.

Controlling structure and properties of the C-S-H phase is a challenge, due {{to the complexity of}} this hydration product and of the mechanisms that drive its precipitation from the ionic solution upon dissolution of cement grains in water. Departing from traditional models mostly focused on length scales above the micrometer, recent research addressed the molecular structure of C-S-H.

Here we unveil the C-S-H mesoscale texture, a crucial step to connect the fundamental scales to the macroscale of engineering properties. We use simulations that combine information of the nanoscale building units of C-S-H and their effective interactions, obtained from atomistic simulations and experiments, into a statistical physics framework for aggregating nanoparticles. We compute small-angle scattering intensities, pore size distributions, specific surface area, local densities, indentation modulus, and hardness of the material, providing quantitative understanding of different experimental investigations.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of cement pastes depend strongly on their porosities. In a wet <b>paste,</b> the porosity <b>links</b> {{to the free}} water volume after hydration. Structural water which presents in the solid phase, constrained water absorbed {{on the surface of}} the pores and free water in the center of the pores have different dynamical behavior. Hence, it should be possible to extract information on pore system by exploiting the water dynamics. We investigated the dynamics of hydration water confined in calcium- and magnesium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H and M-S-H) gels using high-resolution quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS). C-S-H and M-S-H are the chemical binders present in calcium rich and magnesium rich cement. To analyze the cement QENS data, we developed a new global model which is numerically more stable than previous models for cement QENS analysis. With this model, we can correctly quantify the structural water index (SWI) and the confining radius. We also established the relation between the constrained to liquid water ratio and the temperature dependence of translational relaxation time. We analyzed two different sets of synthetic cement using this method: (1) C-S-H with different water to cement ratio (w/c) and (2) M-S-H with various additives. For the first set, SWI and confining radius are both controlled by w/c with a linear relation. For the second set, we show that by adding ASN-COOH additive, M-S-H becomes similar to C-S-H in all parameters. We also analyzed the small angle x-ray scattering data of M-S-H gel with a polydisperse cylinder model which fits better than previously published polydisperse sphere model and will be studied further in future work. The result indicates that C-SH and M-S-H have similar globule shape and fractal structure. The evidence from QENS and SAXS experiments suggest that the weak compressive strength of M-S-H compares to C-S-H is due to the high porosity rather than the globule shape. by Peisi Le. Thesis: Ph.
