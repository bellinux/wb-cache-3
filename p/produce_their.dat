5|$|Males {{begin to}} {{increase}} in size {{at a faster rate}} with each successive moult after the seventh instar. Females, on the other hand, <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> first brood at the seventh instar. They may moult several times as adults, becoming sexually receptive each time until death. The average lifespan of C.mutica in laboratory conditions is 68.8 days for males and 82 days for females.|$|E
5|$|Vocabulary {{development}} is a process by which people acquire words. Babbling shifts towards meaningful speech as infants grow and <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> first words around the age of one year. In early word learning, infants build their vocabulary slowly. By the age of 18 months, infants can typically produce about 50 words and begin to make word combinations.|$|E

5|$|All {{of their}} {{material}} {{had been released}} solely on the band's MySpace pagetheir recording contract came after performances at the CMJ Music Festival and Pitchfork Media Music Festival, on July 15, 2007. Eventually, The Cool Kids signed to Chocolate Industries, another independent label. The group has revealed on its MySpace page that The Cool Kids' debut album, When Fish Ride Bicycles, will be released in 2008, though it did not come out until 2011. Ingersoll has been the producer for tracks released thus far, but both work in rapping and production. The duo uses music software program Reason from Propellerhead Software to <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> music.|$|E
5|$|Bread is a {{significant}} part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 different types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen). German cheeses account for about a third of all cheese produced in Europe. In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts, Weisswursts, and Currywursts. In 2012, organic foods accounted for 3.9% of total food sales.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} {{detected}} in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources {{have been detected}} even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E

5|$|Progressive pop {{is a form}} of {{pop music}} which {{attempts}} to break with the genre's standard formula. Originally termed for early progressive rock music, some stylistic features of progressive pop include changes in key and rhythm, experiments with larger forms, and unexpected, disruptive, or ironic treatments of past conventions. Performers commonly <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> own material while opposing the influence of managers, agents, or record companies.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore trees <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> {{flowers in}} hanging {{branched}} clusters known as panicles that contain {{a variety of}} different flower types. Most are morphologically bisexual, with both male and female organs, but function as if they were unisexual. Some are both morphologically and functionally male, others morphologically bisexual but function as males, and still others are morphologically bisexual but function as females. All of the flower types can produce pollen, but the pollen from functionally female flowers does not germinate. All flowers produce nectar, the functionally female flowers producing it in greater volume and with a higher sugar content.|$|E
5|$|The broader {{definition}} differs {{mainly in}} including plants {{that do not}} <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> own digestive enzymes but rely on internal food webs or microbes to digest prey, such as Darlingtonia and some species of Heliamphora. The original definition of botanical carnivory, set out in Givnish et. al. (1984), required a plant to exhibit an adaptation of some trait specifically for the attraction, capture, or digestion of prey while gaining a fitness advantage through the absorption of nutrients derived from said prey. Upon further analysis of genera currently considered carnivorous, botanists widened the original definition to include species that use mutualistic interactions for digestion.|$|E

5|$|After being {{signed by}} Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{released}} their self-titled debut album in 1973 to poor sales. Although it was praised by critics, {{the band was}} not satisfied with producer Todd Rundgren's sound for the album and had disagreements with him before choosing not to retain him. Songwriting and production partners Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were originally enlisted to <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> next album, while the band's guitarist Johnny Thunders wanted to produce it himself. However, Leiber and Stoller withdrew shortly before recording was to begin. The group held a single session with Mercury A executive Paul Nelson at Media Sound Recording Studios, where they recorded 14 songs, {{most of which were}} covers.|$|E
5|$|Dan and Gretta {{meet with}} Saul, Dan's {{business}} partner {{and co-founder of}} their record label, {{but he does not}} see the same potential in Gretta and turns her away. Undeterred, Dan proposes that he and Gretta <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> own album together, to be recorded live during the summer at various public locations around New York City. Recruiting a team of talented musicians, including Gretta's best friend Steve, Dan sets out to make an album worthy of being published by his label. During this time, Dan and Gretta bond both personally and professionally, and Gretta takes Dan's teenage daughter Violet, a fledgling guitarist, under her wing and encourages her to play on the album. When the album is finished, Dan and Gretta meet again with Saul, who is very impressed with their collaboration. Gretta demands that Saul give Dan his job back and give her a bigger share in the deal. They leave without reaching an agreement, but Dan feels confident that Saul will eventually sign Gretta to the label.|$|E
5|$|Mark Hoppus' {{involvement}} {{stems from}} when an Atticus Clothing employee played him I Am the Movie. He was so taken with {{it that he}} raved about the band in Rolling Stone, inviting them to open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. He told them that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told the band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E

5|$|Mineral ores can be mined {{just like}} normal stone and the raw ore can be smelted to <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> {{corresponding}} metal bars. Different ores or metal bars can be alloyed together for higher quality materials. For steel production, flux stones {{are used to}} make pig iron bars and smelt it with regular iron and coal (or charcoal). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy bronze or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of tin and copper. The metal adamantine, found deep below, is extremely light but very strong, making it excellent for sharp weapons and armor. Raw adamantine can be extracted into strands and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into wafers.|$|E
5|$|Now {{settled into}} Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers {{began looking for}} a {{suitable}} producer. One person in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded in contrast to individuals they had worked with in the past even though Rubin previously turned down the band's offer to <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak who would die of a heroin overdose a year later. Eventually, the band decided Rubin {{would be the best}} choice as a producer, and therefore hired him to produce what would become Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone that they felt confident to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> own food (production {{is greater than}} respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E

5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships were contested for in TNA {{until the}} morning of May 13, 2007. On that day, NWA's Executive Director Robert Trobich {{announced}} that the NWA were ending their five-year agreement with TNA, which had allowed them full control over both titles. Trobich went on to state that effective that morning, then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Christian Cage and then-NWA World Tag Team Champions Team 3D were stripped of their respective championships. The alleged motivation behind these actions was because Cage refused to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against wrestlers from NWA territories. That same day, TNA were scheduled to <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> Sacrifice event, in which both Cage and Team 3D were to defend their respective championships. On the card, Cage was scheduled to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Kurt Angle and Sting in a match involving three competitors, {{also known as a}} three-way match.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{generally}} whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but {{are able to}} move {{within the confines of}} the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to <b>produce</b> <b>their</b> cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E
