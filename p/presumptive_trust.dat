40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} sense-making in maintaining trust within dominant-subordinate relationships, following trust violation, addressing the question “Why do people carry on trusting despite evidence to the contrary?” Whilst recognizing the role of hierarchy, accounts of sense-making have tended to emphasise agency and shared sense-sense-making or consensual adequacy. They have consequently tended to neglect how following <b>presumptive</b> <b>trust</b> individuals may be socialized into trusting behaviour that complies with norms dictated by more powerful actors, even where a trust violation offers evidence that becoming vulnerable will result in harm. Using their trust relationship with hospital employees, patients’ sense making of trust violations {{in relation to their}} safety is examined. The contribution we make is therefore two-fold. Firstly we explore the implications for trust of how service users make sense of events where there may be opportunity for discrepant sense-making. Secondly by focusing on service users’ narratives we examine processes by which, in the face of contradictory information, trust is maintained...|$|E
40|$|Early {{research}} on inter-organizational trust drew on theories about social ties among individuals, for example, duration of ties {{and amount of}} interaction, yet these proved inadequate to explain the diverse arrangements arising in inter-national business. Dyer and Chu’s award-winning JIBS paper demonstrated that trust was best predicted by organizational processes that developed positive expectations of predictability, reliability, and competence, not only within national boundaries but also in cross-national relationships. This review of recent trust research building on Dyer and Chu draws attention to six themes: (1) new conceptualizations that explore identity, roles, and rules as foundations of <b>presumptive</b> <b>trust</b> at the organizational level; (2) dynamics of trust and distrust over time, how violations of trust are interpreted, and what affects ease of repair; (3) pendulum swings in inter-organizational relationships, arising from plural governance and alternation between modes, but also resulting in the continuous coexistence {{of positive and negative}} states; (4) the impact of intra-organizational conflict and inter-organizational coalitions on the establishment and maintenance of trust; (5) the relative impact of nation-level vs organization-level differences in culture as influences on trust; and (6) whether intermediate modes of exchange in between transactional and relational modes are unstable, transitional hybrids or embody complementarities that yield both value and stability...|$|E

As a result, they {{play a key role}} in the enforcement of security policies and the protection of sensitive information. A user typing a password or passphrase must be assured that it is disclosed exclusively to the intended program. The interprocess communication functionality that underlies “cut and paste ” must be guarded such that (a) messages transmitted are known to reflect user intentions and (b) global policies concerning information flow are honored. Most window systems today, including X 11 and Microsoft Windows, have carried forward the <b>presumptive</b> <b>trust</b> assumptions of the Xerox Alto from which they were conceptually derived. These assumptions are inappropriate for modern computing environments. In this paper, we present the design of a new trusted window system for the EROS capabilitybased operating system. The EROS Window System (EWS) provides robust traceability of user volition and is capable (with extension) of enforcing mandatory access controls. To our knowledge it does not introduce new covert channels into the overall system architecture, and it is not subject to significant denial of service attacks. The entire implementation of EWS is less than 4, 500 lines, which is a factor of ten smaller than previous trusted window systems such as Trusted X, and well within the range of what can feasibly be evaluated for high assurance. ...|$|E
50|$|Betrayal is the {{breaking}} or {{violation of a}} <b>presumptive</b> contract, <b>trust,</b> or confidence by that produces moral and psychological conflict within a relationship amongst individuals, between organizations or between individuals and organizations. Often betrayal is the act of supporting a rival group, or it is a complete break from previously decided upon or presumed norms by one party from the others. Someone who betrays others is commonly called a traitor or betrayer. Betrayal is also a commonly used literary element, also used in other fiction like films and TV series, and {{is often associated with}} or used as a plot twist.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} “bundle of rights” theory as it meets {{at the intersection}} of trust and family property law. Drawing on conceptions of property, the principles and purposes of the Property (Relationships) Act and contrasted with trust law, a theory is adopted to explain why family property law has <b>presumptive</b> power over <b>trust</b> principles. Orthodox trust principles are discussed to explain why trust assets are protected from third party claims, the importance of the laws of powers and fiduciary obligations, the problems created by settlor or appointor control and the reason a “controller” is a beneficial owner of trust assets. The dispositions of relationship property to trusts and the limits on compensatory payments are discussed alongside the significance of the abolition of gift duty, other statutory remedies and judicial responses. Case authorities are explored, similarities with Australian alter ego trusts are drawn upon, and the application of the “bundle of rights” theory is discussed with reference to the valuation of debts and occupation orders. The dissertation concludes that the “bundle of rights” theory draws on an expansive meaning of property, it is a principled approach but confined to the Act...|$|R
