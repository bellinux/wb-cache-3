25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the Princess was {{designed}} to be operated by a pair of pilots, two flight engineers, a navigator, and a radio operator. Early on, it had been intended for the aircraft to be outfitted with some form of powered flight controls, including an early fly-by-wire implementation, in order that pilots would be able to effectively actuate its large control surfaces, which would have to overcome equally larger forces. However, it was decided to opt for a traditional mechanical linkage approach that was augmented by a series of electrically-driven <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> <b>units</b> to effectively support actuation instead.|$|R

40|$|Recently, <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suits which support human {{physical}} activities have been researched. We {{are developing a}} <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit for workers in a nuclear power plant. If a 	disaster happens, the workers have to wear heavy radiation protective equipment. The <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit is supposed to support the wearer so that it reduces the load of the radiation protection equipment during an operation. This paper proposes a <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> control method based on motion prediction using 9 -axis motion sensors. The <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit enables rapid <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> because the motion sensor can detect the start of walking motion in real time. A motion database consists of angles and angular velocities of wearer’s chest, lower limbs, and joint angles of the <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit. The <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit recognizes {{the motion of the}} wearer based on the database. 	Then, it assists the wearer based on the estimation of the motion of the wearer.

40|$|A <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> {{wheelchair}} combines human power, {{which is}} {{delivered by the}} arms through the pushrims, with electrical motors, which are powered by a battery. Today’s electric <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> wheelchairs use force sensors to measure the torque exerted on the pushrims by the user. The force sensors in the pushrims are rather expensive and this approach also makes the wheels a little bit clumsy. The objective with this project {{is to find a}} new, better and cheaper solution that does not use expensive force sensors in the pushrims. The new <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> wheelchair will instead only rely on its velocity, which is measured with rotational encoders, as feedback signal and thereby the project name “Torque Sensor Free <b>Power</b> <b>Assisted</b> Wheelchair”. The project consisted of two main parts; an extensive construction part, where an ordinary joystick controlled motorized wheelchair has been rebuild to the new <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> wheelchair without torque sensors and a development part, where different torque sensor free controllers has been designed, simulated, programmed and tested. The project resulted in a torque sensor free <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> wheelchair, where the final implemented design is a proportional derivative controller, which gives a very good assisting system that is robust and insensitive to measurement noise. The proportional derivative control design gives two adjustable parameters, which can be tuned to fit a certain user; one parameter is used to adjust the amplification of the user’s force and the other one is used to change the lasting time of the propulsion influence. Since the new assisting control system only relies on the velocity, the torque sensor free <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> wheelchair will besides giving the user <b>assisting</b> <b>power</b> also give an assistant, which pushes the wheelchair, additional power. This is a big advantage compared to the pushrim activated one, where this benefit for the assistant is not possible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This Paper {{describes}} the generalised structure of Force-Sensor-less <b>Power</b> <b>assist</b> control (FSPAC) {{which is an}} essential technology to design a feedback control system in a human friendly way. Paper clarifies regarding generalised structure of Force-Sensor-less <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> control using two force observer. The Force, {{which is used to}} assist the control system is estimated by using encoders instead of using force-sensors. This Paper also compares other FSPAC’s with the FSPAC using two observer methodology. Since, this Feedback control system uses positive feedback, the Force-sensor-less <b>Power</b> <b>Assist</b> control deals with weak robustness problem. To increase Robustness of the system, Control design based on disturbance observer with variable gain is also discussed in this paper.

40|$|Abstract. We {{developed}} a 1 -DOF <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> robot system to lift objects {{of different sizes}} by human subjects. We adopted a hypothesis that weight perception due to inertia might be different from that due to gravity when lifting an object with a <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> robot because the human feels {{a difference between the}} actual weight and the perceived weight of the object. We included this hypothesis in the robot dynamics. We then discussed the suitability of force control for the robot for lifting objects and developed several weight-perception-based force control strategies. These force control strategies may be compared to previously developed position control strategies, and the comparison results may help determine appropriate control for the robot to achieve desired maneuverability. The results, as a whole, may help develop human-friendly <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> devices to handle heavy objects in various industries...|$|R
