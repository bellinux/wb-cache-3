5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles {{for the well-being of}} all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate <b>policies</b> <b>for</b> basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will {{improve the quality of life}} rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E

Web Services {{can be implemented}} in any available technology but they are accessible through a standard protocol. With web services being accepted and deployed in both research and industrial areas, the security related issues become important.

5|$|Funding for the battleships was {{authorized}} by a 24 June 1910 act, {{which called for}} the ships to cost no more than $6,000,000. The act also specified new labor <b>policies</b> <b>for</b> their construction which put strict limits on labor hours and working conditions for shipyard employees. Bids were solicited only for Battleship No. 35, Texas, on 27 September 1910, while Battleship No. 34, New York, was to be built by New York Navy Yard. Bids opened for No. 35 on 1 December. Ultimately Newport News Shipbuilding Company won the contract with a bid of $5,830,000. Battleship No. 35 began construction first, on 17 April 1911, launched 18 May 1912, and completed on 12 March 1914. Battleship No. 34 was laid down on 11 September 1911, launched on 30 October 1912, and completed on 15 April 1914.|$|E

He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of Gough Whitlam, which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between municipal <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply and the planning of new housing in Sweden. Through {{a case study of}} Göteborg municipality and a comparative content analysis of Göteborgs <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply and a number of plans featuring housing the analysis {{seeks to investigate}} the effect of <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply as a tool for securing the demand for housing in the Swedish municipalities. The thesis also seeks to discuss its findings using theory concerning the implementation of policy and the general planning situation for Swedish municipalities today. The result of the analysis shows that most plans fail to regulate most of the content suggested in the <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply, particularly regarding aspects such as pricing, type of housing and type of ownership. The result also points towards a relationship regarding the prevalence of municipal land contracts and compatibility to <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply as well as a connection between how extensive the plans are in their proposed land use and their compatibility with <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply. Using theories of policy implementation and the municipal planning situation, possible explanations for the findings of the analysis could be a split in responsibility between the formulating and implementation of the <b>policy</b> <b>for</b> housing supply and its contents, a lack of resources of means for implementing or the prevalence of special interests when attempting to convert policy to plans...|$|R

Simultaneously, Stosch began a campaign to force Werner out of the navy. This was in part to ensure that Batsch, his protégé, would be next in line after Stosch retired. Despite his popularity, particularly with Kaiser Wilhelm I and his son, Werner was unable to resist Stosch's efforts to force his ouster. On 15 October 1878, he requested retirement.|$|E

Newell saw Sony's publication model as more open, allowing Steam-like features to be used on the console. Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks, including automatic updates, downloadable content, and community support.
