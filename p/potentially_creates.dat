25|$|FCC proponents {{argue that}} {{menstruation}} became a key problem because it <b>potentially</b> <b>creates</b> {{conflicts between the}} females and conflicts between males. Menstruation has little social impact among chimpanzees or bonobos, since visible oestrus swellings {{are the focus of}} male attention. But once external signs of ovulation had been phased out in the human lineage, according to FCC, menstruation became salient as the one remaining external promise of fertility. Potentially, dominant males might exploit such information, repeatedly targeting newly cycling females at the expense of pregnant or nursing mothers (figure e). Those who might lose male investment needed to take control. According to FCC, older and more experienced females did this by initiating newly cycling females into their kin-based coalitions (figures f, g). Red ochre pigments allowed women to take conscious control over their signals, resisting any dominant male strategy of picking and choosing between them on biological grounds. It is argued that because precise, sustained menstrual synchrony is difficult to achieve, painting up with blood-red pigments was the next best thing, enabling the benefits of artificial, ritually constructed synchrony.|$|E

5000|$|The {{inconsistency}} of children's memory <b>potentially</b> <b>creates</b> {{a problem}} with the reliability of children's reports. A study done by Klemfuss and Ceci (2012) indicates that [...] "general memory skill is inconsistently associated with children's accuracy". Children younger than the age of 6 also tend to remember a higher proportion of details inaccurately in their reports when compared to children of ages 8 and 10. Along with the problem of poor memory development at a young age, there is {{a problem with}} remembering information accurately after a certain period of time. According to Beuscher and Roberts (2005), individuals tend to remember a higher ratio of accurate to inaccurate information over time.|$|E
50|$|Mental health {{professionals}} document {{the results of}} Initial and Review PTSD C&P exams on a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). The VA developed Disability Benefit Questionnaires (DBQs) to streamline the VBA ratings process and thereby complete the claims process faster. In addition, veterans may ask their treating clinicians to complete a DBQ and possibly bypass {{the need for a}} C&P exam. However, {{it is important to note}} that the VA discourages their mental health clinicians from completing DBQs for their patients, and similar recommendations have been offered to private psychologists and psychiatrists whose patients ask them to complete DBQs, because it <b>potentially</b> <b>creates</b> a conflict of interest due to a dual role relationship (serving simultaneously as a treating clinician and a forensic evaluator).|$|E

50|$|Because chronic {{illnesses}} predominate {{as a cause}} of death in the US and pathways for  treating {{chronic illnesses}} are complex and multifaceted, prevention is a best practice approach to chronic disease when possible.  In many cases, prevention requires mapping complex pathways to determine the ideal point for intervention.  In addition to efficacy, prevention is considered a cost-saving measure.  Cost-effectiveness analysis of prevention is achievable, but impacted by the length of time it takes to see effects/outcomes of intervention. This makes prevention efforts difficult to fund—particularly in strained financial contexts.  Prevention <b>potentially</b> <b>creates</b> other costs as well, due to extending the lifespan and thereby increasing opportunities for illness.  In order to establish reliable economics of prevention for illnesses that are complicated in origin, knowing how best to assess prevention efforts, i.e. developing useful measures and appropriate scope, is required.|$|E

5000|$|The risk of {{allowing}} individual shareholders to bring derivative suits is usually {{thought to be}} that it could encourage costly, distracting litigation, or [...] "strike suits" [...] - or simply that litigation (even if the director is guilty of a breach of duty) {{could be seen as}} counterproductive by a majority of shareholders or stakeholders who have no conflicts of interest. Accordingly, it is generally thought that oversight by the court is justified to ensure derivative suits match the corporation's interests as a whole because courts may be more independent. However, especially from the 1970s some states, and especially Delaware, began also to require that the board have a role. Most common law jurisdictions have abandoned role for the board in derivative claims, and in most US states before the 1980s, the board's role {{was no more than a}} formality. But then, a formal role for the board was reintroduced. In the procedure to bring a derivative suit, the first step is often that the shareholder had to make a [...] "demand" [...] on the board to bring a claim. Although it might appear strange to ask a group of directors who will be sued, or whose colleagues are being sued, for permission, Delaware courts took the view that the decision to litigate ought by default to lie within the legitimate scope of directors' business judgment. For example, in Aronson v Lewis a shareholder of the Meyers Parking System Inc claimed that the board had improperly wasted corporate assets by giving its 75-year-old director, Mr Fink, a large salary and bonus for consultancy work even though the contract did not require performance of any work. Mr Fink had also personally selected all of the directors. Nevertheless, Moore J. held for the Delaware Supreme Court that there was still a requirement to make a demand on the board before a derivative suit could be brought. There was [...] "a presumption that in making a business decision, the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis in good faith and in the honest belief that the action was taken in the best interests of the company", even if they owed their jobs to the person being sued. A requirement to make a demand on the board will, however, be excused if it is shown that it would be entirely [...] "futile", primarily because a majority of the board is alleged to have breached its duty. Otherwise it must be shown that all board members are in some very strong sense conflicted, but merely working with the accused directors, and the personal ties this <b>potentially</b> <b>creates,</b> is insufficient for some courts. This indicated a significant and controversial change in Delaware's judicial policy, that prevented claims against boards.|$|E
