5|$|The English {{people are}} a British people. Some genetic {{evidence}} suggests that 75–95% descend in the <b>paternal</b> <b>line</b> from prehistoric settlers who originally came from the Iberian Peninsula, {{as well as a}} 5% contribution from Angles and Saxons, and a significant Scandinavian (Viking) element. However, other geneticists place the Germanic estimate up to half. Over time, various cultures have been influential: Prehistoric, Brythonic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking (North Germanic), Gaelic cultures, as well as a large influence from Normans. There is an English diaspora in former parts of the British Empire; especially the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Since the late 1990s, many English people have migrated to Spain.|$|E

5|$|Curtis Piʻehu Iʻaukea {{was born}} December 13, 1855, in Waimea, {{on the island}} of Hawaii. Descended from the Hawaiian aliʻi (noble) class, his parents were John W. Iaukea and Lahapa. His father served as the {{district}} magistrate of Hamakua and their family were well-known {{on the island of}} Hawaii. From his <b>paternal</b> <b>line,</b> he descended from Namiki, a priest of the Pa‘ao order, and Kahiwa Kānekapōlei, a daughter of Kānekapōlei, the wife of Kalaniʻōpuʻu and Kamehameha I. While on his mother's side, he descended from Kalanipo or Nalanipo, a descendant of the ʻI clan of Hilo and the Mahi clan of Kohala. His mother's family were also related to Kekuʻiapoiwa II, the mother of King Kamehameha I. His family were considered to be of the Hawaiian kaukau aliʻi rank, or lower ranking chiefs in service to the royal family.|$|E

5|$|During William's absence {{a crisis}} had {{developed}} in Jerusalem. King Baldwin {{had reached the}} age of majority in 1176 and Raymond III had been removed from the regency, but as a leper Baldwin could have no children and could not be expected to rule much longer. After the death of William of Montferrat in 1177, King Baldwin's widowed sister Sibylla required a new husband. At Easter in 1180, the two factions were divided even further when Raymond and his cousin Bohemond III of Antioch attempted to force Sibylla to marry Baldwin of Ibelin. Raymond and Bohemond were King Baldwin's nearest male relatives in the <b>paternal</b> <b>line,</b> and could have claimed the throne if the king died without an heir or a suitable replacement. Before Raymond and Bohemond arrived, however, Agnes and King Baldwin arranged for Sibylla to be married to a Poitevin newcomer, Guy of Lusignan, whose older brother Aimery of Lusignan was already an established figure at court.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{was born}} on 5 May 1818 to Heinrich Marx (1777–1838) and Henrietta Pressburg (1788–1863). He was born at Brückengasse 664 in Trier, a town then part of the Kingdom of Prussia's Province of the Lower Rhine. Marx was ancestrally Jewish as his {{maternal}} grandfather was a Dutch rabbi, while his <b>paternal</b> <b>line</b> had supplied Trier's rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx. His father, as a child known as Herschel, {{was the first in}} the line to receive a secular education and he became a lawyer and lived a relatively wealthy and middle-class existence, with his family owning a number of Moselle vineyards. Prior to his son's birth, and to escape the constraints of anti-semitic legislation, Herschel converted from Judaism to Lutheranism, the main Protestant denomination in Germany and Prussia at the time, taking on the German forename of Heinrich over the Yiddish Herschel. Marx was a third cousin once removed of German Romantic poet Heinrich Heine, also born to a German Jewish family in the Rhineland, with whom he became a frequent correspondent in later life.|$|E

25|$|In December 2016, Cheryl {{appeared}} on the BBC One genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, during which she researched her maternal family. Research shows that her <b>paternal</b> <b>line</b> is from Tyneside {{and that there were}} a number of coal miners amongst Cheryl's forebears. When tracing further back, in one of the branches of her <b>paternal</b> <b>line,</b> researchers find that her ancestry includes several mariners. The investigation into Cheryl's maternal line shows that her grandmother, Olga Ridley, was one of twin girls born to Edith Annie Burton, the housekeeper for a widower named Joseph Ridley who already had a number of children from his marriage. Joseph Ridley had fought in World War I in the Durham Light Infantry as a Pioneer in France and, from an examination of the census, before the war he had been a Grocery Warehouseman.|$|E

40|$|Sixty-three major inbred {{varieties}} and parental lines of major F 1 hybrids {{used in the}} commercial rice production in China were assayed with rice microsatellites screened in a previous study and additional microsatellites on four chromosomes. A set of 24 markers was selected and proposed for its application in the variety identification of rice, which are distributed on all the 12 rice chromosomes with 2 markers on each chromosome. The 63 major {{varieties and}} parental lines, as well as 41 major F 1 hybrids, were genotyped with the markers. Alleles detected in each line at each marker locus were verified. By matching marker genotypes of corresponding F 1, maternal and <b>paternal</b> <b>lines</b> of hybrid rice, high reliability of the maternal lines was verified, data on the <b>paternal</b> <b>lines</b> were modified, and a false hybrid was removed. A database containing genotype data of 103 major rice varieties and parental lines at the 24 marker loci was constructed and analyzed...|$|R
25|$|All human men descend in the <b>paternal</b> <b>line</b> from {{a single}} man dubbed Y-chromosomal Adam, who lived {{probably}} between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago. A 'family tree' can be drawn showing how men today descend from him. Different branches of this tree are different haplogroups. Most haplogroups can be further subdivided multiple times into sub-clades. Some known sub-clades were founded in the last 1000 years, meaning their timeframe approaches the genealogical era (c.1500 onwards).|$|E

25|$|According to {{research}} done by Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. for the PBS series Faces of America, a relative had hidden the Ma family genealogy {{in his home}} in China to save it from destruction during the Cultural Revolution. His paternal ancestry {{can be traced back}} eighteen generations to the year 1217. This genealogy had been compiled in the 18th century by an ancestor, tracing everyone with the surname Ma, through the <b>paternal</b> <b>line,</b> back to one common ancestor in the 3rd century BC. Ma's generation name, Yo, had been decided by his fourth great grand-uncle, Ma Ji Cang, in 1755.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of Khazarian ancestry in Ashkenazi {{has also been}} a subject of discussion in the field of population genetics, wherein claims have been made concerning evidence both for and against it. Eran Elhaik argued in 2012 for a significant Khazar component in the <b>paternal</b> <b>line</b> based on the study of Y-DNA of Ashkenazi Jews using Caucasian populations, Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijani Jews, as proxies. The evidence from historians he used has been criticised by Shaul Stampfer and the technical response to such a position is dismissive, arguing that, if traces of descent from Khazars exist in the Ashkenazi gene pool, the contribution would be quite minor, or insignificant.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{denominations}} of Rabbinical Judaism, Karaite Judaism {{maintains that}} {{it is the responsibility of}} each Jew to study the Tanakh for themselves. The Talmud and Oral Law are not considered canonical, and rabbinical opinions are not considered authoritative either, but every interpretation is held up to the same scrutiny, regardless of its source. Karaite Judaism relies on the Tanakh to indicate that Jewishness is passed down through the <b>paternal</b> <b>line,</b> not the maternal line as is maintained by Orthodox Judaism (though a minority hold that both parents need to be Jewish). Karaite Jews are eligible for Aliyah under the Law of Return. The eligibility of converts to Judaism through the Karaite movement to make Aliyah under the Law of Return has not yet been addressed in Israeli courts.|$|E

25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the republic, the citizenry consisted of all those who had been holding the citizenship of the former territory of Transkei. Individuals were given no choice in this matter as the Transkeian constitution was a legally binding act; for the future, it provided citizenship regulations based on both jus sanguinis and jus soli. Citizenship by descent was given along the <b>paternal</b> <b>line,</b> regardless of a person's place of birth; in addition, any individual born within the republic's territory was eligible for citizenship, excluding those whose father held diplomatic immunity or was deemed an illegal immigrant and whose mother was a non-citizen. Dual citizenship at birth was not permitted, and renunciation of one's citizenship was legally possible, but rendered the individual stateless in most cases. In effect, the regulations thus created an almost homogeneous population of Xhosa ethnicity, though exceptions existed.|$|E

25|$|Immanuel Kant {{was born}} on April 22, 1724 in Königsberg, Prussia (since 1946 the city of Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). His mother, Anna Regina Reuter (1697–1737), was also born in Königsberg to a father from Nuremberg. (Her name is {{sometimes}} erroneously given as Anna Regina Porter.) His father, Johann Georg Kant (1682–1746), was a German harness maker from Memel, at the time Prussia's most northeastern city (now Klaipėda, Lithuania). Immanuel Kant believed that his paternal grandfather Hans Kant was of Scottish origin. While scholars of Kant's life long accepted the claim, {{there is no evidence}} that Kant's <b>paternal</b> <b>line</b> was Scottish; it is more likely that the Kants got their name from the village of Kantwaggen (today part of Priekulė) and were of Curonian origin.
