5|$|The {{fruit body}} {{formation}} of L.torminosus is pileostipitocarpic. In {{this type of}} development, the hymenium forms early {{on the underside of}} the cap and upper stem of the mushroom <b>primordium.</b> As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.|$|E
5|$|The ontogeny, or development, of Mycena stylobates fruit bodies {{has been}} {{investigated}} in detail using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. According to Volker Walther and colleagues, the development {{can be divided into}} two phases: in the first, the <b>primordium</b> is established that contains all the structures of the mature fruit body; in the second stage, the primordial stipe elongates rapidly, and the newly exposed hymenium immediately begins spore production. The first detected stage of fruit body formation was an irregularly arranged hyphal structure within the colonized substrate. After rupturing the surface of the substrate and establishing itself there, the structure develops a layer of wrapping hyphae that covers the entire <b>primordium.</b> The structures of the stipe and the cap develop simultaneously. The developing stipe, cap, and basal disc together form a secondary ring-like cavity, in which the gills develop. Gill development initiates with a number of small alveolae on the lower side of the cap, which are covered with a hymenophoral palisade (a group of tightly packed, roughly parallel cells). The margins of these alveolae form the primary gills. The hymenophoral palisade spreads from the developing alveolae to the gill edge; the edge of the primary gills is forked {{in the early stages of}} its development. The secondary gills (lamellulae) are formed by the ridges folding down from the lower side of the cap. In contrast to the primary gills, they are covered with hymenophoral palisade from the beginning. Spore production begins immediately after the stipe elongates.|$|E
25|$|Using A. thaliana, the {{genetics}} behind leaf shape development {{have become more}} clear and have been broken down into three stages: The initiation of the leaf <b>primordium,</b> the establishment of dorsiventrality, {{and the development of}} a marginal meristem. Leaf primordia are initiated by the suppression of the genes and proteins of the class I KNOX family (such as SHOOT APICAL MERISTEMLESS). These class I KNOX proteins directly suppress gibberellin biosynthesis in the leaf <b>primordium.</b> Many genetic factors were found to be involved in the suppression of these class I KNOX genes in leaf primordia (such as ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1, BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1, SAWTOOTH1, etc.). Thus, with this suppression, the levels of gibberellin increase and leaf <b>primordium</b> initiates growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{members of}} the MADS-box family of {{transcription}} factors play a very important and evolutionarily conserved role in flower development. According to the ABC model of flower development, three zones - A,B and C - are generated within the developing flower <b>primordium,</b> {{by the action of}} some transcription factors, that are {{members of the}} MADS-box family. Among these, the functions of the B and C domain genes have been evolutionarily more conserved than the A domain gene. Many of these genes have arisen through gene duplications of ancestral members of this family. Quite a few of them show redundant functions.|$|E
25|$|An {{external}} stimulus {{is required}} in order to trigger the differentiation of the meristem into a flower meristem. This stimulus will activate mitotic cell division in the meristem, particularly on its sides where new primordia are formed. This same stimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a developmental pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems. The main difference between these two types of meristem, apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled) phyllotaxis, that is, the absence of stem elongation among the successive whorls or verticils of the <b>primordium.</b> These verticils follow an acropetal development, giving rise to sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Another difference from vegetative axillary meristems is that the floral meristem is «determined», which means that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer divide.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the leaf}} {{primordial}} cells are established from the SAM cells, the new axes for leaf growth are defined, one important (and more studied) among them being the abaxial-adaxial (lower-upper surface) axes. The genes involved in defining this, {{and the other}} axes {{seem to be more}} or less conserved among higher plants. Proteins of the HD-ZIPIII family have been implicated in defining the adaxial identity. These proteins deviate some cells in the leaf <b>primordium</b> from the default abaxial state, and make them adaxial. It is believed that in early plants with leaves, the leaves just had one type of surface - the abaxial one. This is the underside of today's leaves. The definition of the adaxial identity occurred some 200 million years after the abaxial identity was established. One can thus imagine the early leaves as an intermediate stage in evolution of today's leaves, having just arisen from spiny stem-like outgrowths of their leafless ancestors, covered with stomata all over, and not optimized as much for light harvesting.|$|E
500|$|Since the {{mushroom}} is small, and fruits {{in only a}} limited season in a small area, researchers have investigated the conditions needed to artificially cultivate the species in laboratory conditions, {{in order to have}} more material to study the mechanism of bioluminescence, and to help preserve the species. The optimum temperature for the growth of mycelia is , while the optimum for the growth of primordia is [...] These temperatures are consistent with the subtropical climate in which the species is typically found. Maximum luminescence occurs at 27°C, and about 25–39hours after the primordia begin to form, when the cap has fully expanded. At 21°C, luminescence persists for about 3days, and becomes undetectable to the naked eyes about 72hours after <b>primordium</b> initiation.|$|E
500|$|Mycena stylobates, {{commonly}} known as the bulbous bonnet, is a species of inedible mushroom in the family Mycenaceae. Found in North America and Europe, it produces small whitish to gray fruit bodies with bell-shaped caps that are up to [...] in diameter. The distinguishing characteristic of the mushroom is the fragile stipe, which is seated on a flat disk marked with distinct grooves, and fringed with a row of bristles. The mushrooms grow in small troops on leaves and other debris of deciduous and coniferous trees. The mushroom's spores are white in deposit, smooth, and ellipsoid-shaped with dimensions of 6–10 by 3.5–4.5μm. In the development of the fruit body, the preliminary stipe and cap structures appear at the same time within the <b>primordium,</b> and hyphae originating from the stipe form a cover over the developing structures. The mycelia of the mushroom is believed to have bioluminescent properties.|$|E
2500|$|A {{mushroom}} develops from a nodule, or pinhead, {{less than}} two millimeters in diameter, called a <b>primordium,</b> which is typically found {{on or near the}} surface of the substrate. It is formed within the mycelium, the mass of threadlike hyphae that make up the fungus. The <b>primordium</b> enlarges into a roundish structure of interwoven hyphae roughly resembling an egg, called a [...] "button". The button has a cottony roll of mycelium, the universal veil, that surrounds the developing fruit body. As the egg expands, the universal veil ruptures and may remain as a cup, or volva, {{at the base of the}} stalk, or as warts or volval patches on the cap. Many mushrooms lack a universal veil, therefore they do not have either a volva or volval patches. Often, a second layer of tissue, the partial veil, covers the bladelike gills that bear spores. As the cap expands, the veil breaks, and remnants of the partial veil may remain as a ring, or annulus, around the middle of the stalk or as fragments hanging from the margin of the cap. The ring may be skirt-like as in some species of Amanita, collar-like as in many species of Lepiota, or merely the faint remnants of a cortina (a partial veil composed of filaments resembling a spiderweb), which is typical of the genus Cortinarius. Mushrooms lacking partial veils do not form an annulus.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the genetic}} level, {{developmental}} {{studies have shown}} that repression of the KNOX genes is required for initiation of the leaf <b>primordium.</b> This is brought about by ARP genes, which encode transcription factors. Genes of this type have been found in many plants studied till now, and the mechanism i.e. repression of KNOX genes in leaf primordia, seems to be quite conserved. Expression of KNOX genes in leaves produces complex leaves. It is speculated that the ARP function arose quite early in vascular plant evolution, because members of the primitive group lycophytes also have a functionally similar gene [...] Other players that have a conserved role in defining leaf primordia are the phytohormone auxin, gibberelin and cytokinin.|$|E
2500|$|In invertebrates, the proneural genes, {{particularly}} {{the members of}} the achaete-scute complex(AS-C) promote neurogenesis, while the neurogenic genes prevent neurogenesis and facilitate epidermal development. The formation of neuroblasts depends on the Achaete-scute complex genes – achaete (ac), scute (sc), lethal of scute (lsc) and ventral nervous system defective (‘’vnd’’). However, only ‘’vnd’’ can control this formation process because this gene activates the expression of the others. ac, sc, lsc factors are initially expressed within the <b>primordium</b> of the embryonic central nervous system (neuroectoderm) in proneural clusters, from which single neuroblasts later arise. Every cell of the proneural cluster shares a common neuroblasts-forming potential. The local inhibition of the remaining cells by the enlarging neuroblasts ensures that only one neuroblast arises from the proneural cluster. All cells of the cluster retain their NB forming potential, at least while the NB is enlarging, but lose this potential by the time the cell is about to divide. The patterns of expression of the proneural genes lead to different modes of neuroblasts formation in the head and trunk. [...] Co-expression of proneural genes in brain neuroblasts is transient and varies with the developmental stage.|$|E
