40|$|Introduction: Entrapped trauma victims require extrication, which, on rare occasions, {{may involve}} {{amputation}} of a limb. Standard extrication techniques sometimes fail {{or may be}} impossible, leading {{to the death of}} the entrapped victim. We propose that the use of fire service hydraulic <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment</b> can be used effectively to urgently amputate a limb, where conventional techniques are unusable. Method: The study aims to determine: (i) the potential use of this equipment to achieve expeditious life-saving amputations and (ii) the effect the fire service hydraulic <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment</b> has on the bony and surrounding soft tissues. Initially a porcine limb was used followed by fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs. We recorded the time, number of cuts, proximal fracture propagation and quality of bone cut when performing amputations at five levels. Results: The experiment confirms that faster guillotine amputations in human cadaveric lower limb specimens can be achieved by using fire service hydraulic <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment.</b> Overall, the average time to complete an amputation in these ideal experimental circumstances at all five levels was quicker using the hydraulic <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment.</b> Either one or two cutting actions were required to achieve the amputation using fire service hydraulic <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment.</b> The degree and proximal extent of the comminution were greater using the fire service hydraulic <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment.</b> Conclusion: If circumstances and time constrains allow, a conventional amputation technique carried out by a trained medical practitioner would be preferable {{to the use of the}} fire service hydraulic <b>cutting</b> <b>equipment.</b> However, we feel that this technique could be used to perform emergent amputation under trained medical supervision, if it is felt that a standard amputation technique would take too long or the environment is too restrictive to perform a standard amputation safely. </p...|$|R
