25|$|The linear {{motors and}} {{steerable}} axles used in Innovia Metro trains are relatively rare, although similar Japanese designed linear motor <b>propulsion</b> <b>technologies</b> {{are also used}} {{on a number of}} subway lines in East Asia, such as the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line, Toei Ōedo Line and Guangzhou Metro Line 5. However, the Innovia Metro system has a number of competitors in the field of automated light metros, including the VAL technology developed by Matra for the Lille Metro in France (and now owned by Siemens) and the Meteor technology used by Paris Métro Line 14 (which is built to high-capacity, full metro standards). Furthermore, the CITYFLO and SelTrac signaling technologies are not specific to the Innovia Metro, but can also equip most conventional railway lines regardless of propulsion technology or carrying capacity.|$|E
500|$|The {{ancestor}} of the Metroliner multiple unit railcar was the Budd Pioneer III {{which had been}} developed for the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1958 as a new concept in long distance passenger service in the east. The cars used new <b>propulsion</b> <b>technologies</b> and lightweight construction {{in an effort to}} improve performance compared with older electric multiple unit technology. After a fleet of 55 improved Pioneer III cars referred to as Silverliners were ordered for commuter trains in the Philadelphia area, the United States Department of Transportation placed a follow up order for 4 Silverliners, specially modified for high speed operation on the PRR's Northeast Corridor. Equipped with several modifications, including a semi-streamlined slab end {{on the front of the}} lead car, the experimental train ran a series of test runs, reaching a speed of [...] on April 2, 1967. This success allowed Metroliner testing to begin.|$|E
2500|$|Space {{science and}} {{technology}} have been a government priority for decades. [...] In the late 1980s and 1990s, Brazil invested almost US$1 billion in developing space infrastructure around the National Institute of Space Research (INPE), leading to {{the launch of the}} first scientific satellite built entirely in Brazil in 1993 (SCD-1). Between 1999 and 2014, Brazil and China built a series of five remote sensing satellites for environmental monitoring within the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellites (CBERS) programme. Brazil has now achieved the critical mass of skills and infrastructure required to dominate several space technologies. It is determined to master the complete chain of space technologies, from material sciences, engineering design, remote sensing, aperture-synthetic radars, telecommunications and image processing to <b>propulsion</b> <b>technologies.</b> The joint Argentinian–Brazilian SABIA-MAR mission will be studying ocean ecosystems, carbon cycling, marine habitats mapping, coasts and coastal hazards, inland waters and fisheries.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the promising propulsion systems for advanced supersonic transport application, and to identify the critical <b>propulsion</b> <b>technology</b> requirements. It is shown that noise constraints have a major effect on the selection of the various engine types and cycle parameters. Several promising advanced propulsion systems were identified which show the potential of achieving lower levels of sideline jet noise than the first generation supersonic transport systems. The non-afterburning turbojet engine, utilizing a very high level of jet suppression, shows the potential to achieve FAR 36 noise level. The duct-heating turbofan with a low level of jet suppression is the most attractive engine for noise levels from FAR 36 to FAR 36 minus 5 EPNdb, and some series/parallel variable cycle engines show the potential of achieving noise levels down to FAR 36 minus 10 EPNdb with moderate additional penalty. The study also shows that an advanced supersonic commercial transport would benefit appreciably from advanced <b>propulsion</b> <b>technology.</b> The critical <b>propulsion</b> <b>technology</b> needed for a viable supersonic propulsion system, and the required specific <b>propulsion</b> <b>technology</b> programs are outlined...|$|R
