From a sample of Norwegian contracts, we extracted a set {{of the most frequently}} used <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which we compared to previous research conducted on the US venture capital market and to relevant financial theory. For analytical purposes we divided the mechanisms into two main categories; cash flow rights and control rights. The findings in this paper are that <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> applied in Norwegian venture capital transactions contribute to minimize the agent-principal costs, even though there are some possible areas of improvement...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} detail and {{dynamics}} of how contractual and relational governance mechanisms are deployed in managing complex, long-term public–private supply arrangements. Using empirical data from two UK Private Finance Initiative (PFI) cases, the paper analyses {{the interplay of}} governance mechanisms along a timeline of project phases. Conceptual and practical findings confirm that relational and <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are indeed complementary forms of exchange governance but also that the relational intentions of all parties frame whether the contract is interpreted as a written sign of distrust or commitment. Equally, relational and contractual governance follow different development paths: both follow cumulative trajectories but (a) inter-personal relational mechanisms are more incremental and fragile, whereas (b) <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> move with fewer degrees of freedom and ‘anchor’ the exchange throughout the life cycle. Finally, the different development characteristics of relational and <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> mean that their dynamic interplay does not follow consistent patterns. The paper concludes with suggestions for more longitudinal studies...|$|R

40|$|What is the {{importance}} of specific control and <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for IT outsourcing relationship quality and outsourcing success? Employing a survey among financial institutions and applying Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) known from marketing research, we analyse the relative importance of Service Level Agreements, control and <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for relationship quality and outsourcing success. Results show that, consistent with prior research, IT outsourcing relationship quality is positively related to outsourcing success. Extending prior research we show that outsourcing contract quality in general is most important for relationship quality, followed by control mechanisms and the characteristics of Service Level Agreements. We contribute to theory by revealing the differential importance of specific control and contractual factors for relationship quality and outsourcing success. Furthermore, we contribute to outsourcing practice by demonstrating {{the importance}} of specific measures in an IT outsourcing context and thu...|$|R
40|$|Governments {{around the}} world raise {{significant}} amounts of capital by issuing sovereign bonds in international financial markets. These bonds are typically purchased and traded by foreign investors who seek a profitable return on their investment. The issuing country incurs sovereign debt, which it must repay over a predetermined period of time. Occasionally, sovereigns—typically emerging market governments—become {{unable or unwilling to}} repay their sovereign debt. A country’s ability to repay its debt is difficult to assess given the multitude of nonfinancial factors that affect the assessment. As a result, investors are vulnerable to opportunistic defaults which can deprive them of their investment. Additionally, investors cannot collect on their investment through bankruptcy proceedings because a country cannot declare bankruptcy. The financial markets have responded to this challenge with a variety of <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> aimed at facilitating a debt restructuring, which will simultaneously lower the sovereign’s debt burden while ensuring that investors receive payment on their investment. Unfortunately, the <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> currently utilized in sovereign bond contracts have proven to be inadequate. This Note begins by explaining sovereign debt and the major problems with the current international sovereign bond market. Next, this Note explores the global community’s various efforts to address these problems thus far and explains why these solutions have proven inadequate. Ultimately, this Note proposes a new <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanism</b> that provides for the creation and use of a new type of trustee to monitor, enforce, and renegotiate sovereign bonds...|$|R

40|$|Material-Adverse-Change (MACs) clauses in merger {{agreements}} {{allow for}} the allocation of risk between the target and acquirer over the time period from the announcement to {{the completion of the}} acquisition. I find that MACs are more prevalent as a condition for completing the acquisition than any other <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanism.</b> My analysis documents that the number and variation of Material-Adverse-Event (MAE) exclusions, which limit the acquirer’s abandonment option defined through MACs, have increased substantially in the last decade. I show that the economic consequences of MACs are significant in at least four ways. First, the number of MAE exclusions is negatively related to the premium offered to the target. Second, consistent with the view that having a weaker abandonment option decreases the probability of termination, arbitrage-spreads decrease with the number of MAE exclusions. Third, limiting the abandonment option through MAE exclusions significantly reduces the probability and hazard rate of acquisition renegotiation or termination. Finally, acquirers that renegotiate an acquisition after the target experienced a firm-specific MAE obtain, on average, a 14 % reduction in the premium paid. Collectively, these findings indicate that MACs are important <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for allocating risk between target and acquirer firms. ...|$|R
40|$|Global {{accountability}} is commonly {{understood as a}} <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanism</b> between principals and agents where standards of behavior are objective and respond to functional needs, agents are autonomous, motivations are self-interested and practices are procedural. This paper theorizes an alternative to this rationalist framing of global accountability anchored in theories of sociological institutionalism that rest on a constructivist ontology. In this latter perspective, standards of accountable global behaviour derive from socially constructed global cultural norms governed by the logic of appropriateness that both produces and contours embedded global actions. The argument is made that epistemologically distinguishing and empirically uniting contractual and cultural understandings offers new vistas for understanding the challenge of global accountability. This is illustrated with a comparative investigation of <b>contractual</b> accountability <b>mechanisms</b> and cultural accountability norms inside two World Bank country offices in Bolivia and Vietnam...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the brain}} drain argument, {{there are good reasons}} for states to limit the exit of their skilled workers (more specifically, {{healthcare}} workers), because of the negative impacts this type of migration has for other members of the community from which they migrate. Some theorists criticise this argument as illiberal, while others support it and ground a duty to stay of the skilled workers on rather vague concepts like patriotic virtue, or the legitimate expectations of their state and co-citizens. In this article, on the contrary, we suggest that the liberal conception of states’ legitimate political authority demands, and not just permits, that developing states from which migration of skilled workers occurs set up <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> These mechanisms will ensure that state-funded training in the health sector is provided against a commitment on the part of future professionals to reciprocate with their services for the benefits obtained. If one of the conditions for the state to maintain legitimate political authority is to provide basic services such as healthcare to its subjects (while respecting at the same time their autonomy and freedom), then this is what developing states affected by the brain drain ought to do. What we call the authority-based approach {{to the brain}} drain also helps to clarify the obligations that other states have not to interfere with these <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> when they exist, and not to profit from their absence. Inspired by FIFA’s legal instruments of training compensation and solidarity mechanism for the transfer of players, we conclude by suggesting a plausible global policy to complement this authority-based approach...|$|R

The impetus for the protection of "non-standard" or atypical employees is underscored by policy considerations that have been incorporated by the recent legislative amendments. These developments may very well place a heavier burden than before on employers who opt to rely on "automatic termination" clauses to sustain an argument in favour or their validity and/ or enforcement...|$|R

We consider two broad classes of products, durable goods and perishable goods. In both cases, when facing strategic con-sumers, firms are typically better off if they can commit to future actions. When operating in a decentralized supply chain, <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can help firms achieve commit-ment power and increase profits.

The answer lies in the durability of arbitration aiming at making the meta-organization sustainable over time and to establish it as a firm. Or, to put it differently, the latent opportunism of under-investment in the meta-organization’s specific assets becomes counter-weighed by the latent monitoring of the arbitrator. Thus, the creation of unique resources in a meta-organization is backed-up by a <b>contractual</b> <b>mechanism</b> that is internal rather than external (Conner 1991, Foss 1996 a,b).|$|R
