5|$|The calcium {{sensitivity}} of the sarcomere, that is, the calcium concentration at which muscle contraction occurs, is directly determined by the calcium binding affinity of cNTnC. To date, there are no known post-translational modifications of cTnC that impact its calcium binding affinity. However, calcium binding by cNTnC is a dynamic <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be impacted by the closed-to-open conformational equilibrium of cNTnC, the domain positioning of cNTnC, or the relative availability of cTnI148-159, the physiologic binding partner of cNTnC. The closed-to-open equilibrium of cNTnC can be shifted towards the open state by small compounds (see section below on troponin-binding drugs). Domain positioning of cNTnC can be impacted by phosphorylation of cTnI, of which the most important site in humans is Ser22/Ser23. The availability of cTnI148-159 depends on the blocked-closed-open equilibrium of tropomyosin on actin, which can be impacted by any interactions involving the thin filament, including actin-myosin cross-bridging and length dependent activation (also known as stretch activation or the Frank Starling law of the heart). All of these processes can be impacted by mutations (see section below on disease-causing mutations).|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the equatorial region of Vesta is sculpted {{by a series of}} concentric troughs. The largest is named Divalia Fossa (10–20km wide, 465km long). Despite the fact that Vesta is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia Fossa dwarfs the Grand Canyon. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. The largest of the northern troughs is named Saturnalia Fossa (≈ 40km wide, > 370km long). These troughs are thought to be large-scale graben resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the longest chasms in the Solar System, nearly as long as Ithaca Chasma on Tethys. The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> happen only in a body that, like Vesta, is differentiated. Vesta's differentiation {{is one of the reasons}} why scientists consider it a protoplanet.|$|E

25|$|Ion etching is a {{sputtering}} <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> remove {{very fine}} quantities of material. This {{is used to}} perform a finishing polish of specimens polished by other means. Ion etching uses an inert gas passed through an electric field to generate a plasma stream that is directed to the sample surface. Acceleration energies for gases such as argon are typically a few kilovolts. The sample may be rotated to promote even polishing of the sample surface. The sputtering rate of such methods is {{on the order of}} tens of micrometers per hour, limiting the method to only extremely fine polishing.|$|E
25|$|Passing a {{nasogastric}} tube (NGT) is useful both diagnostically and therapeutically. A long tube is passed {{through one of}} the nostrils, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. Water is then pumped into the stomach, creating a siphon, and excess fluid and material (reflux) is pulled off the stomach. Healthy horses will often have less than 1 liter removed from the stomach; any more than 2 litres of fluid is considered to be significant. Horses are unable to vomit or regurgitate, therefore nasogastric intubation is therapeutically important for gastric decompression. A backup of fluid in the gastrointestinal tract will cause it to build up in the stomach, a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> eventually lead to stomach rupture, which is inevitably fatal.|$|E
25|$|Working through {{abandonment}} {{depression is}} a complicated, lengthy and conflicted <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be an enormously painful experience {{in terms of}} what is remembered and what must be felt.

There is also a mourning for the loss of an identity, the false self, which the person constructed and with which he or she has negotiated much of his or her life. The dismantling of the false self requires relinquishing the only way that the patient has ever known of how to interact with others. This interaction was better than not to have a stable, organized experience of the self, no matter how false, defensive, or destructive that identity may be.|$|E

25|$|Despite the prosecution's {{recommendation}} of leniency, at her sentencing hearing on 22 January 2013 {{a panel of}} judges ruled there were no mitigating circumstances in Sandiford's favour, and imposed a death sentence. Amser Simanjuntak, who headed the panel said Sandiford's actions had damaged Bali's reputation as a tourist destination and undermined Indonesia's fight against drugs, while his colleague, Komang Wijaya Adi said their decision had been influenced by several factors, including what was viewed as her lack of remorse. The sentence was greeted with gasps from around the courtroom. In Indonesia an execution is generally carried out by firing squad, often at night in an isolated location. Following the judgment Sandiford was led from the court in a distressed state, where she declined to speak to journalists before being escorted away by guards {{to be held at}} Bali's notorious Kerobokan Prison. Her lawyers announced she would appeal, a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> take several years under Indonesian law.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of Hoveyda's premiership {{is marked by a}} sense of optimism. As already mentioned, in 1966, Hoveyda {{attempted}} to allure many elements of the intellectual community, as well as the opposition, into an informal agreement with the regime. Although talks between the two sides eventually broke down, Hoveyda never lost sight of what a partnership between the two could have accomplished. His pragmatic approach to politics allowed him to envision an incremental reform <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be carried out through action. This is contrary to the path assumed by many Iranian intellectuals at the time, which involved quixotic solutions to problems such as electoral corruption and media censorship. Hoveyda resumed many of the reform initiatives set out by the Mansour administration. In particular, reform plans that were laid out by the Shah in the White Revolution. Although a secularist, he would even allocate government revenue to the clerical establishment. The clerical establishment was seen as a bulwark against Communism by the Shah, and was constantly reinforced (a policy that the Shah would later regret).|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} crafts made in the state, which are often distinguished by the use of certain materials and of certain designs. The best known of these is the carving of figures from ironwood (palo fierro in Spanish), which is a very dense, almost black wood that sinks in water. This wood was often used in braziers in the past because it would burn for a very long time. This carving is the specialty of the Yaquis and the Seris. Before it can be carved, this wood must be dried thoroughly, a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> take up to five years. If this is not done, the wood takes on an ochre color, rather than its characteristic shiny near black. Objects made from this wood are almost always decorative in nature {{in a wide variety of}} shapes such as sahuaro and other cacti, eagles, turtles, dolphins and other flora and fauna of the state, along with crosses. The last is popular among indigenous groups as it is believed that such guard against the envy of others and other ills. Objects made of this wood are very much in demand on the international market, but indigenous craftsmen cannot compete with factory made pieces.|$|E

25|$|Creativity {{is viewed}} {{differently}} in different countries. For example, cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity {{more in terms}} of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity {{more in terms of}} the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being Arabic). The principle of linguistic relativity, i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music, art, and storytelling. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges, while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be applied to help solve problems.|$|E

500|$|The {{passage of}} a {{tropical}} cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially, which can influence subsequent cyclone development. This cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters. This effect results in a negative feedback <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> inhibit further development or lead to weakening. [...] Additional cooling may {{come in the form}} of cold water from falling raindrops (this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes). Cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean, by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage. All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days.|$|E
