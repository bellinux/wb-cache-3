Cases are considered, when application of ordinary methods of distribution of loading (equalities of relative increases, increasing prices etc.) is impossible from non-linearity or discreteness of power descriptions of equipment, necessity of simultaneous distribution of electric and thermal loading, to the necessity at distribution of loading to {{determine the amount of}} simultaneously working aggregates and type of fuel for them. The algorithms are showed: for construction linear model of heat central station for distributing thermal and electric loadings by means of linear programming, algorithm distributing of loadings by the method of the dynamic programming and algorithm of choice the composition of workings aggregates and distributing of loadings between them by the method of the integer programming (method of "branches-and-bound"). ? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????????? ???????????????? ??? ??????? ????? ????????????? ???????? ????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????????

40|$|Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) {{have become}} very {{important}} in determining {{the way in which}} spatial data are used throughout an organization, a nation, different regions, and the world. SDI is now accepted as a central component in supporting decision making for economic and social development. Regional Spatial Data Infrastructures (RSDI), Constitutes a set of relationships and partnerships that enable data sharing, production, update and integration. Clearing more about relation and situation of RSDI and Information Technology (IT), cause leading all activities in both of them especially in National and Regional Level and in information extent and also realizing information society scopes. SDI is an initiative intended to create an environment in which all stakeholders can cooperate with each other and interact with technology, to better achieve their objectives at different political / administrative levels. RSDI is the response to spatial data requirement for disaster management. With SDI, not only up-to-date spatial data is always available, but also many other advantages will be gained in Regional and Global level such as: − Removes <b>parallel</b> <b>workings</b> in production data and redundant data collectio...|$|E
40|$|Funded by the AHRB, co-directed by Emilyn Claid (choreographer) and Valerie Briginshaw (writer), ‘Embodying Ambiguities’ (1999 - 2004) {{researched}} the dynamics between Claid’s choreographic processes/practices and Briginshaw’s written texts. Outcomes include: website; performances (‘Shiver Rococo’, 1999; ‘No Bodies Baby’, 2002; ‘Remember to Forget’, 2003) that toured internationally; showings of work-in-progress; after-show discussions; conference papers internationally, including PARIP and FIRT (‘Federation Internationale de Recherche Théâtrale’). Thirteen collaborators {{worked with the}} two directors, researching new tools/models for devised choreographic performance. The research revealed a model of dramaturgy for choreographic processes through the <b>parallel</b> <b>workings</b> of theoretical writing and embodied practice. The website, created in collaboration with web designer Nicholas Watton, builds on the outcomes of this research to: · Detail the processes and performances that provided ongoing stimulus for research, including video excerpts from performances, images, programme notes, written papers, workshop scores, studio tasks etc.; · Detail the specific questions of each choreographic practice evoked by aesthetics, cultural difference, space, time, narrative, abstraction; · Interrogate relationships between professional performance and practice-based research: e. g. the differing roles of language, time, memory, repetition in writing and choreography; their interweaving in creative processes; · Demonstrate strategies to layer memories and processes, drawing forward images and devising tools from one performance to the next; · Reveal how Claid’s choreography explores the space/time conventions of making, performing and watching, {{through the use of}} multi-directional space in performance...|$|E
5000|$|Director Colin Trevorrow {{stated that}} the Indominus rex, the {{synthetic}} hybrid dinosaur {{at the center of}} the film's story, is symbolic of consumer and corporate excess. The dinosaur was [...] "meant to embody humanity's worst tendencies. We're surrounded by wonder and yet we want more, and we want it bigger, faster, louder, better. And in the world of the movie, the animal is designed based on a series of corporate focus groups." [...] He also stated, [...] "There's something in the film about our greed and our desire for profit. The Indominus rex, to me, is very much that desire, that need to be satisfied." [...] Film journalists have noted the <b>parallels</b> between the <b>workings</b> of the park in Jurassic World and the film and entertainment industry. Actor James DuMont stated that [...] "the person and the environment are one" [...] is one of the obvious themes. Another theme is that [...] "those who do not stop evil are supporting and encouraging it".|$|R
