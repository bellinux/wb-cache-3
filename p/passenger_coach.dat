5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 29 November 1877, heavy rain caused the dam of the Rhodgeidio mill near Llanerchymedd to breach, and the surge of water washed away the wooden Caemawr bridge over the Afon Alaw. The first train {{of the day was}} driven by William Taylor, with fireman John Saunders and railway {{inspector}} John Davies also on the footplate. The train also included two coal trucks, a <b>passenger</b> <b>coach,</b> and a guard's van, with Edward Hughes serving as the guard. The whole train went {{over the side of the}} bridge into the river. Edward Hughes dragged himself out, and was taken to the nearest farm. John Davies was scalded to death, and Taylor and Saunders were found injured, and could not be freed until mid-day. John Saunders later died from his injuries.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{needed a}} way to get people to Monte Ne. In 1900, there were few {{adequate}} roads, and automobiles were not yet practical. The natural solution seemed to be to build a railroad from Lowell, Arkansas to Monte Ne. The Arkansas Railroad Commission granted a charter on April 26, 1902, and the Monte Ne Railway Company was incorporated in May 1902, with a capital stock of $250,000. Besides Harvey, the company included: Carl A. Starck, P. G. Davidson, A. L. Williams, B. R. Davidson, J. H. McIlroy, J. W. Kimmons, F. F. Freeman, J. F. Felker, Robert H. Harven and Thomas W. Harvey (Coin's brother). Another of Harvey's brothers, a banker at Huntington, West Virginia, furnished $25,000. Of the 250 shares in the company, 240 were registered in Harvey's name. The five-mile (8km) private railroad spur started at the Lowell transfer station. Fourteen thousand oak railway ties were laid running through Cross Hollows, south of Rogers, where two ravines met. It then passed through Limedale, terminating above Big Spring Lake at a log cabin depot with open-air waiting rooms. Harvey leased an engine, a tender, and a <b>passenger</b> <b>coach</b> from the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad. The railway opened on June 19, 1902. Harvey imported a 50-foot (15m) gondola from Venice in July 1901 to meet guests arriving by rail and carry them to the resort.|$|E

25|$|In 1924 the Schwab family {{relocated}} to Saltwood in Kent, and the railway was dismantled and then recreated in {{the grounds of}} the new home. In 1931 public open days commenced, in support of charitable causes, and this led to a considerable expansion of the <b>passenger</b> <b>coach</b> fleet, and also the rebuilding of the locomotive into a far more powerful design.|$|E

25|$|Development of a {{new class}} of {{sleepers}} commenced in 1977 with a research and development project named T 22 Nytt Passasjervognmateriell ("New <b>Passenger</b> <b>Coach</b> Material"). The first phase looked at market demands and costs, and concluded that the new sleepers should be built exclusively as twin-berthed cabins. More details were developed, allowing the overall design to be established in 1981. An order was placed with Strømmen in June 1984. Each new unit cost 9 million Norwegian krone. The order allowed the most worn of the existing seventy sleeping cars to be retired.|$|E
25|$|The {{usage of}} the HGV {{shuttles}} had been approved with the plan that, in event of fire, the shuttle was to either continue to the terminal or to detach the locomotive and <b>passenger</b> <b>coach.</b> Neither of these happened, as the fire had damaged the train such that was forced to stop, and the overhead line failed four seconds after the train {{had come to a}} stand. The concept of an 'unconfirmed alarm' meant that the incident was not treated seriously until five minutes after the train entered the tunnel on fire. The CTSA report recommended that all alarms be treated seriously.|$|E
500|$|By 1899 the MR and the O were {{cooperating}} closely. Although {{the line}} had been upgraded {{in preparation for}} the Oxford extension and had been authorised as a railway in 1894, construction of the extension had yet to begin. On 27 November the MR arranged to lease the Tramway from the O, for an annual fee of £600 (about £ in [...] ) with an option to buy the line outright. From 1 December 1899, the MR took over all operations on the Tramway. The O's single <b>passenger</b> <b>coach,</b> a relic of Wotton Tramway days, was removed from its wheels and used as a platelayer's hut at Brill. An elderly Brown, Marshalls and Co <b>passenger</b> <b>coach</b> was transferred to the line to replace it, and a section of each platform was raised to accommodate the higher doors of this coach, using earth and old railway sleepers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{service from}} Eastry to Sandwich Road {{involved}} one train each way on weekdays in 1926, two on Wednesdays and Saturdays 1927, and one only on Saturdays 1928. Since the <b>passenger</b> <b>coach</b> doubled {{up as the}} brakevan, the published assertions that it was left at Sandwich Road (while {{the rest of the}} train went on) need confirmation (this statement may have been for official ears). It is likely that anybody actually wishing to go on to Richborough Port would be allowed to travel free [...] "at own risk", although there is no actual evidence that anybody did.|$|E
2500|$|Mostly, {{except in}} the early years, there were no proper {{passenger}} trains but a <b>passenger</b> <b>coach</b> attached to a goods train (forming the so-called [...] "mixed train"). Since the EKLR had no guard's vans until the 1940s, the passenger coaches performed this function (being independently braked). The obvious disadvantage was that shunting made the passenger timetable a work of fiction. One way of making up time was by not stopping at stations where no passengers were waiting. There is anecdotal evidence that sometimes train crews ignored prospective passengers anyway if no goods traffic was to be handled at that stop.|$|E
2500|$|The Channel Tunnel fire of 18 November 1996 {{occurred}} {{on a train}} carrying Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) and their drivers through the Channel Tunnel from France to the United Kingdom (UK).

However, after an indication of a serious problem with the train, the driver stopped at 21:58 CET, [...] into the tunnel. The locomotive and <b>passenger</b> <b>coach</b> were rapidly enveloped in thick smoke, and the locomotive lost power.

2500|$|In 1938, Disney {{animator}} Ward Kimball, {{a lifelong}} railfan, purchased a <b>passenger</b> <b>coach,</b> built in 1881 by the Barney and Smith Car Company, from the Carson and Colorado Railroad. The original {{intention was to}} use the coach to house his collection of model trains {{at his home in}} San Gabriel, California; however, Kimball's wife, Betty Kimball, suggested that he should also have a locomotive to pull the coach. A suitable locomotive was purchased for $400 from the Nevada Central Railroad, which was selling it for scrap. The locomotive was the Sidney Dillon, a 2-6-0 steam locomotive built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1881. Kimball renamed the locomotive Emma Nevada, after a famous opera star of the late 1800s. Over the course of several years, Kimball, his family, and his friends worked to restore the Emma Nevada to operating condition. Kimball's railroad became operational in 1942. Kimball named his railroad Grizzly Flats Railroad (GFRR), and it would eventually consist of [...] of [...] narrow-gauge track, including a [...] main line, in his backyard. The GFRR became the first full-size backyard railroad in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Some commentators, such as Gabriel J.

Both point to a passage of Harlan's Plessy dissent as particularly troubling: [...] "There is a race so different from our own {{that we do not}} permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race. But, by the statute in question, a Chinaman can ride in the same <b>passenger</b> <b>coach</b> with white citizens of the United States, while citizens of the black race in Louisiana, many of whom, perhaps, risked their lives for the preservation of the Union... and who have all the legal rights that belong to white citizens, are yet declared to be criminals, liable to imprisonment, if they ride in a public coach occupied by citizens of the white race".|$|E
