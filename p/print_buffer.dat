50|$|For printing, sixels {{are sent}} to the printer, decoded back into binary, and sent {{directly}} to the six pins of the print head. The only complexity involved expanding the RLEs into the internal <b>print</b> <b>buffer.</b> Display on a terminal is somewhat more difficult. On terminals supporting graphics, the ReGIS graphics system was used to directly draw the sixel pattern into the screen's bitmap. This was done at high speed by storing the bitmap patterns as a glyph and then bitting them.|$|E
50|$|An early {{mention of}} a <b>print</b> <b>buffer</b> is the Outscriber devised by image {{processing}} pioneer Russel A. Kirsch for the SEAC computer in 1952:One {{of the most serious}} problems in the design of automatic digital computers is that of getting the calculated results out of the machine rapidly enough to avoid delaying the further progress of the calculations. In many of the problems to which a general-purpose computer is applied the amount of output data is relatively big —so big that serious inefficiency would result from forcing the computer to wait for these data to be typed on existing printing devices. This difficulty has been solved in the SEAC by providing magnetic recording devices as output units. These devices are able to receive information from the machine at rates up to 100 times as fast as an electric typewriter can be operated. Thus, better efficiency is achieved in recording the output data; transcription can be made later from the magnetic recording device to a printing device without tying up the main computer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Microarrays {{allow the}} {{miniaturization}} and multiplexing of biological assays while only requiring minute amounts of samples. As {{a consequence of}} the small volumes used for spotting and the assays, evaporation often deterio-rates the quality, reproducibility of spots, and the overall assay performance. Glycerol is commonly added to antibody micro-array <b>printing</b> <b>buffers</b> to decrease evaporation; however, it often decreases the binding of antibodies to the surface, there-by negatively affecting assay sensitivity. Here, combinations of 14 hygroscopic chemicals were used as additives to <b>printing</b> <b>buffers</b> for contact-printed antibody microarrays on four dif-ferent surface chemistries. The ability of the additives to sup-press evaporation was quantified by measuring the residual buffer volume in open quill pins over time.

40|$|Producing {{high quality}} protein microarrays on {{inexpensive}} substrates like polystyrene {{is a big}} challenge {{in the field of}} diagnostics. Using a non-contact inkjet printer we have produced microarrays on polystyrene slides for two different biotinylated biomolecules, bovine serum albumin (BSA-biotin) and immunoglobulin-G (IgG-biotin), and studied the influence of buffer (composition and pH) on the spot morphology and signal intensity. Atomic force microscopy revealed the morphological pattern of the (biomolecule) spots <b>printed</b> from phosphate <b>buffer</b> (pH 7. 4), phosphate buffered saline (pH 7. 4) and carbonate buffer (pH 9. 6). The spots showed an irregular crust-like appearance when <b>printed</b> in phosphate <b>buffered</b> saline (pH 7. 4), mainly due to the high NaCl content, whereas spots of biomolecules <b>printed</b> in carbonate <b>buffer</b> (pH 9. 6) showed a smooth morphology. In addition, the rinsing of these dried spots led to the loss of a considerable fraction of the biomolecules, leaving behind a small fraction that is compatible with the (mono) layer. It was confirmed by confocal laser microscopy that the quality of the spots with respect to the uniformity and distribution of the biomolecules therein was superior when <b>printed</b> in carbonate <b>buffer</b> (pH 9. 6) as compared to other buffer systems. Particularly, spotting in PBS yielded spots having a very irregular distribution and morphology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{putative}} disease {{blood biomarkers}} discovered in genomic and proteomic studies await validation in large clinically annotated cohorts of patient samples. ELISA assays require {{large quantities of}} precious blood samples and are not high-throughput. The reverse phase protein microarray platform has been developed for the high-throughput quantification of protein levels in small amounts of clinical samples. Results In the present study we present the development of reverse-phase protein microarrays (RPPMs) for the measurement of clusterin, a mid-abundant blood biomarker. An experimental protocol was optimized for the printing of serum and plasma on RPPMs using epoxy coated microscope slides and a non-denaturing <b>printing</b> <b>buffer.</b> Using fluorescent-tagged secondary antibodies, we achieved the reproducible detection of clusterin in spotted serum and plasma and reached a limit of detection of 780 ng/mL. Validation studies using both spiked clusterin and clinical samples showed excellent correlations with ELISA measurements of clusterin. Conclusion Serum and plasma spotted in the reverse phase array format allow for reliable and reproducible high-throughput validation of a mid-abundant blood biomarker such as clusterin. </p...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Microarrays are {{high-throughput}} {{tools for}} parallel mini-aturized detection of biomolecules. In contrast to experiments using ratios of signals in two channels, experiments {{with only one}} fluorescent dye cause special problems for data analysis. The present work com-pares algorithms for quality filtering on spot level as well as array/slide level. Results: Methods for quantitative spot filtering are discussed and new sets of quality scores for data preprocessing are designed. As meas-ures of spot quality also reflect the quality of protocols, they were employed to find the optimal <b>print</b> <b>buffer</b> in an optimization experi-ment. In order to determine problematic arrays within a set of replicates we tested methods of outlier detection which can suitably replace the visual inspection of slides. Contact...|$|E

The array {{is produced in}} our laboratory for use by researchers studying gene expression in pine and other conifer species. PtGen 2 was developed {{as a result of}} our gene discovery efforts in loblolly pine, and is comprised of sequences identified primarily from root tissues, but also from needle and stem. 1, 2 PtGen 2 has been tested by hybridizing different Cy-dye labeled conifer target cDNAs, using both amplified and non-amplified indirect labeling methods, and also tested with a number of hybridization and washing conditions. This video focuses on the handling and processing of slides before and after pre-hybridization, as well as after hybridization, using some modifications to procedures developed previously. 3, 4 Also included, in text form only, are the protocols used for the generation, labeling and clean up of target cDNA s, as well as information on software used for downstream data processing. PtGen 2 is printed with a proprietary <b>print</b> <b>buffer</b> that contains high concentrations of salt that can be difficult to remove completely.

After pre-hybridization, the slides are washed vigorously in several changes of water to complete removal of remaining salts. LifterSlips ™ are then cleaned and positioned on the slides and labeled cDNA is carefully loaded onto the microarray by way of capillary action which provides for even distribution of the sample across the slide, and reduces the chance of bubble incorporation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sophisticated equipment, lengthy protocols, {{and skilled}} {{operators}} {{are required to}} perform protein microarray-based affinity assays. Consequently, novel tools are needed to bring biomarkers and biomarker panels into clinical use in different settings. Here, we describe a novel paper-based vertical flow microarray (VFM) system with a multiplexing capacity of at least 1480 microspot binding sites, colorimetric readout, high sensitivity, and assay time of < 10 min before imaging and data analysis. METHOD: Affinity binders were deposited on nitrocellulose membranes by conventional microarray <b>printing.</b> <b>Buffers</b> and reagents were applied vertically by use of a flow controlled syringe pump. As a clinical model system, we analyzed 31 precharacterized human serum samples using the array system with 10 allergen components to detect specific IgE reactivities. We detected bound analytes using gold nanoparticle conjugates with assay time of ≤ 10 min. Microarray images were captured by a consumer-grade flatbed scanner.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a rapid mastitis detection test based on the immobilization of tag-specific antibody molecules, the binding of double-tagged amplicons, and as a secondary signal a conjugate of black carbon nanoparticles having molecules of a fusion protein of neutrAvidin and alkaline phosphatase at their surface. The antibodies were inkjet printed onto three different nitrocellulose membrane slides, Unisart (Sartorius), FAST (GE Whatman), and Oncyte-Avid (Grace-Biolabs), and the final assay signals on these slides were compared. The blackness of the spots was determined by flatbed scanning and assessment of the pixel gray volume using TotalLab image analysis software. The black spots could be easily read by the naked eye. We successfully demonstrated the detection of specific amplicons from mastitis-causing pathogens in less than 3 h. Using a similar protocol, we also showed {{that it was possible}} to detect specific amplicons from four different mastitis-causing pathogens (six strains) on the same pad. The influence of two different <b>printing</b> <b>buffers,</b> phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7. 4) and carbonate buffer (pH 9. 6), on the functionality of the primary antibodies was also compared. ...|$|R

30|$|Tumors were {{collected}} for RPPA analyses 20 to 22 h after daily RO 4987655 administration for each [18 F] FDG-PET time point (days 0, 1, 3, and 9). Histological examination of 15 -µm thick frozen sections revealed good morphology of tissues, with 75 % to 90 % vital tumor content (10 % to 25 % fibrosis, no necrosis). Tumor extracts of all samples were prepared using 100 µL of lysis buffer CLB 1 for 30 min at room temperature. Protein concentrations of lysates {{were determined by}} Bradford Assay (Coomassie Plus-The better Bradford® Assay, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For the production of RPPA chips, the tumor lysates were adjusted to 3 mg/ml protein concentration in CLB 1 buffer and subsequently diluted tenfold with <b>printing</b> <b>buffer</b> CSBL 1. The lysates were printed onto Zeptosens chips (Bayer Technology Services GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany) using a Gesim NP 2.0 Nanoplotter (GeSiM, Grosserkmannsdorf, Germany) and single droplet deposition of lysate (0.4 nL per sample spot). Lysate samples were printed at four serial dilutions (start concentration 0.3 mg/mL, plus 1.6 -fold dilutions), each dilution as duplicate spots (in total eight spots per sample). Array images and data were analyzed with the software ZeptoVIEW 3.1 (Zeptosens, Witterswil, Switzerland).|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of inkjet-printed biomolecules in porous nitrocellulose substrates {{often results in}} a non-homogeneous spot morphology {{commonly referred to as}} 'doughnut-shaped' spots. We have studied the influence of Pluronic F 127 (an amphiphilic surfactant) on the functionality of inkjet-printed primary antibody molecules and on the final assay result by performing a one-step antibody binding assay in the nitrocellulose substrate. The primary antibody was printed with and without Pluronic, followed by the addition of double-labelled amplicons as antigen molecules and a fluorophore-labelled streptavidin as detection conjugate. The {{distribution of}} the fluorescence intensity down into the nitrocellulose substrate was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy in 'Z' stacking mode. Each horizontal slice was further analysed by applying a concentric ring format and the fluorescence intensity in each slice was represented in a colour-coded way. The mean and total fluorescence intensity of the antibody binding assay (fluorescent streptavidin) showed a peak at 0. 2 % (w/v) Pluronic F 127. In addition, an improved spot morphology was observed also peaking at the same Pluronic concentration. Subsequently, we investigated the direct influence of Pluronic F 127 on the location of the primary antibody molecules by labelling these molecules with the fluorophore Alexa- 488. Our results show that upon increasing the concentration of Pluronic F 127 in the <b>printing</b> <b>buffer,</b> the spot diameter increased and the number of primary antibody molecules bound in the spot area gradually decreased. This was confirmed by analysing the distribution of fluorescently labelled primary antibody molecules down into the membrane layers. We conclude that a particular ratio between primary antibody and Pluronic F 127 molecules in combination with available substrate binding capacity results in an optimal orientation, that is Fab-UP, of the primary antibody molecules. Consequently, an increased number of antigen molecules (in our case the labelled amplicons) and of the fluorescent detection conjugate (streptavidin) will give an optimal signal. Moreover, distribution of the primary antibody molecules was more homogeneous at the optimal Pluronic F 127 concentration, contributing to the better spot morphology observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
