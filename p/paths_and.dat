50|$|IA-BF - The Impairment Aware Best Fit (IA-BF) {{algorithm}} {{was proposed}} in. This algorithm is a distributed approach that is dependent upon {{a large amount of}} communication to use global information to always pick the shortest available <b>path</b> <b>and</b> wavelength. This is accomplished through the use of serial multi-probing. The shortest available <b>path</b> <b>and</b> wavelength are attempted first, and upon failure, the second shortest available <b>path</b> <b>and</b> wavelength are attempted. This process continues until a successful <b>path</b> <b>and</b> wavelength have been found or all wavelengths have been attempted.|$|R

5|$|In recent decades, many {{free and}} public sports {{facilities}} {{have sprung up}} across the city, such as street football, basketball, climbing walls, skateboarding and beach volley.

5|$|Also {{aiding the}} B-1's {{survivability}} is its relatively low radar cross-section (RCS). Although not technically a stealth aircraft {{in a comprehensive}} sense, thanks to the aircraft's structure, serpentine intake <b>paths</b> <b>and</b> use of radar-absorbent material its RCS is about 1/50th of the similar sized B-52's RCS; this is about 26ft² or 2.4m², roughly equivalent to the RCS of a small fighter aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Completing stages {{allow the}} player to {{progress}} through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat; the first seven worlds feature an airship controlled {{by one of the}} Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world. Other map icons include large boulders and locked doors that impede <b>paths,</b> <b>and</b> mini-games and bonus screens that provide the player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are stored in a reserve until activated by the player from the map screen.|$|E
5|$|During 2005–2006 Bristol Water started {{restoring}} two artificial islands. These {{are intended}} to provide safe nesting and roosting sites {{for a range of}} wildfowl.

They can be obtained from Woodford Lodge and include conditions of use imposed by the owners.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries a ferme ornée was established, with {{planting}} of various tress and the damming of streams to form ponds with <b>paths</b> <b>and</b> seating around them.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{determining}} the average transition <b>path</b> <b>and</b> the free energy along this path {{in the space of}} selected collective variables. The formalism is based upon a history-dependent bias along a flexible path variable within the metadynamics framework but with a trivial scaling of the cost with the number of collective variables. Controlling the sampling of the orthogonal modes recovers the average <b>path</b> <b>and</b> the minimum free energy path as the limiting cases. The method is applied to resolve the <b>path</b> <b>and</b> the free energy of a conformational transition in alanine dipeptide...|$|R

5|$|In April 2011, {{after many}} years of {{proposals}} and delays, construction began on a major upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange. An underpass was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents, and would have been very costly, and was subsequently scrapped. The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier left and right turns, speeding up queue times. Cycle <b>paths</b> <b>and</b> safer pedestrian crossings were included.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) {{announced}} {{a campaign to}} redesign the buildings on the island, and six designs were submitted.

The design called for many windows in the building to create a large panorama of the surrounding seascape. In September 2010 Urban Splash placed the pier up for sale, citing a downfall in business caused by the recession as their reason.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two <b>paths</b> <b>and</b> then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E
