The quality of testing was questioned when the BBC reported that samples positive for EPO were labeled as negative by Chinese laboratories in July. The rate of positive findings is lower than at Athens four years ago, but it cannot be deduced that the prevalence of doping has decreased; possibly, doping technology has become more sophisticated {{and a number of}} drugs cannot be detected.|$|E

40|$|International audienceObjectives: To {{compare the}} {{proportions}} of Chlamydia trachomatis <b>positive</b> <b>specimens</b> detected by Cobas Amplicor CT/NG (CA PCR; Roche Diagnostics) to C trachomatis positives in cell culture from 1999 to 2006 in order to estimate when the new variant of C trachomatis (nvCT) with a deletion in the cryptic plasmid (in the target region for CA PCR that resulted in false negative results) emerged in Örebro County, Sweden. Methods: The annual number of specimens analysed using CA PCR in 1999 - 2006 ranged from 5077 to 11622 and using cell culture (McCoy cells) from 5201 to 7425. Logistic regression was applied to evaluate the change of proportion of C trachomatis positive tests over the years between the two methods. The statistical interaction effect of year and method was estimated using both unadjusted and adjusted (age, gender and clinic) models. Results: From 2002, the proportion of C trachomatis <b>positive</b> <b>specimens</b> using CA PCR annually decreased, whereas the proportion of culture <b>positive</b> <b>specimens</b> annually increased. The logistic regression showed a statistically significant interaction effect between periods (1999 - 2006) and groups of specimens analysed with CA PCR or cell culture. A statistically significant association between the interaction of CA PCR/cell culture and period was observed in the unadjusted and adjusted models. Conclusion: This study indicates that in Örebro County, Sweden, the nvCT was already present before 2002, i. e. when the difference between {{the proportions of}} C trachomatis <b>positive</b> <b>specimens</b> in CA PCR compared to cell culture <b>positive</b> <b>specimens</b> began to show a statistically significant decline...|$|E
40|$|Screening enrichments {{of surface}} water {{specimens}} {{by means of}} a polyvalent fluorescent antibody reagent for the salmonellae yielded approximately 60 % more <b>positive</b> <b>specimens</b> than was obtained by cultural procedures.

Massachusetts and Michigan used fourth-generation and differentiation IAs with NAT conducted by a referral laboratory. In Maryland, fourth-generation IA repeatedly reactive specimens were followed by a Western blot (WB), and those with negative or indeterminate results were tested with a differentiation IA and HIV- 1 NAT, and if positive by NAT, confirmed by a different HIV- 1 NAT. Specimens from WB-positive persons at risk for HIV- 2 were tested with a differentiation IA and, if positive, with an HIV- 2 WB and/or differential HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 proviral DNA polymerase chain reaction. ResultsAmong 7, 914 specimens from Massachusetts PHL, 6, 069 from Michigan PHL, and 36, 266 from Maryland PHL, 0. 10 %, 0. 02 % and 0. 05 % acute infections were identified, respectively. Massachusetts and Maryland PHLs each had 1 HIV- 2 <b>positive</b> <b>specimen.</b> The median time from specimen receipt to laboratory reporting of results for acute infections at Massachusetts, Michigan and Maryland PHLs was 8, 11, and 7 days respectively. The laboratory cost per HIV <b>positive</b> <b>specimen</b> was $ 336 (Massachusetts), $ 263 (Michigan) and $ 210 (Maryland). ConclusionsAcute and established infections were found by PHLs using fourth-generation IA in conjunction with antibody tests and NAT. Time to reporting of acute HIV test results to clients was suboptimal, and needs to be streamlined to expedite treatment and interrupt transmission.

SIFA and WB were 99 % sensitive (99 of 100 <b>positive</b> <b>specimens)</b> and specific (140 of 140 negative specimens); FTA-ABS showed a sensitivity and a specificity of 90 and 89 % (90 of 100 positive and 125 of 140 negative specimens), respectively.

Finally, TPI had a sensitivity of 52 % (52 of 100 <b>positive</b> <b>specimens)</b> and a specificity of 100 % (140 of 140 negative specimens). The T. pallidum SIFA was therefore highly specific, showing no equivocal reactivities with control sera, and sensitive.

40|$|A radioimmunoadsorbent assay for the {{detection}} of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG) is described. The method uses small DEAE-cellulose columns to adsorb HBsAg from serum or plasma samples, and it uses 125 I-labeled antibody to HBsAg to detect the adsorbed antigen. A single 2 -h incubation at 45 degrees C is used in the procedure. The sensitivity of the method was determined with the Bureau of Biologics HBsAg reference panels and was shown to be equivalent to other third-generation test methods. The specificity of the method was evaluated by testing specimens from blood donors, dialysis patients, and hospital staff in parallel with commercial radioimmunoassay kits for HBsAg.

40|$|The {{presence}} of human Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus-like sequences (KSHV) was examined in different epidemiological variants of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and in KS-derived cell cultures by {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR).

40|$|SUMMARY Many {{cases of}} {{giardiasis}} in the UK are undiagnosed and among other things, diagnosis {{is dependent upon}} the readiness of GPs to request a specimen. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the rate of specimens requested per GP practice in Central Lancashire, to examine the differences between GP practices and to estimate the pattern of unexplained spatial variation in the practice rate of specimens after adjustment for deprivation. To achieve this, we fitted a set of binomial and Poisson regression models, with random effects for GP practice. Our analysis suggests that there were differences in the rate of specimens by GP practices (P < 0 · 001) for a single year, but no difference in the proportion of positive tests per specimen submitted or in the rate of <b>positive</b> <b>specimens</b> per practice population. There was a difference in the cumulative rate of <b>positive</b> <b>specimens</b> per practice population over a 9 -year period (P < 0 · 001).
