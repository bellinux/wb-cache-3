40|$|Cationic {{polymers}} {{based upon}} poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) are synthesised with {{various levels of}} charge densities, molecular architectures and hydrophobicities. Furthermore, macroinitiators incorporating PVA segments are synthesized and subsequently used for single electron transfer - living radical polymerisation (SET-LRP) for the synthesis {{of a range of}} graft copolymers. Chapter 1 is a general introduction on cationic polymers, their use within conditioning shampoo formulations and the chemical properties required for this application. The polymerisation techniques: ring-opening polymerisation and reversible deactivation radical polymerisation (RDRP); as well as the polymeric materials: PVA and polyglycerol are also discussed. Chapter 2 involves the synthesis of cationic PVA through either etherification or esterification reactions. The etherification of PVA using either glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTMAC) or 1, 2 -chlorohydroxypropyltrimethyammonium chloride (CHPTMAC) to synthesise poly[(vinyl alcohol) -ran-(vinyl, 2 -hydroxypropyl ether trimethylammonium chloride) ] (P[VA) -r-(VETMAC) ]) is investigated. The charge densities of the polymers synthesised by slowing the rate of reaction with GTMAC were determined to be greater than the charge densities claimed in the literature. The synthesis of poly(vinyl betaine) (PVB) via the synthesis of <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>chloroacetate)</b> as an intermediate is discussed, as well as attempts to control the charge density of the resulting PVB. The charge density of the synthesised polymers were determined using UV-Vis spectroscopy and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Chapter 3 discusses the synthesis of a novel hyperbranched graft copolymer, poly[(vinyl alcohol) -graft-(hyperbranched glycerol) ] (P[(VA) -g-(hPG) ]). The effects of the reaction conditions on the mole fraction of hyperbranched polyglycerol (x(hPG)), the degree of branching (...|$|E
