40|$|Background: The {{transcription}} factor Nrf 2, encoded by the NFE 2 L 2 gene, {{is an important}} regulator of the cellular protection against oxidative stress. <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is a neurodegenerative disease highly associated with oxidative stress. In a previously published study, we reported associations of NFE 2 L 2 haplotypes with risk and age at onset of idiopathic <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in a Swedish discovery material and a Polish replication material. Here, we have extended the replication study and performed meta-analyses including the Polish material and four new independent European patient-control materials. Furthermore, all SNPs included in the haplotype windows were investigated individually for associations with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in meta-analyses including all six materials. Methods: Totally 1038 patients and 1600 control subjects were studied. Based on previous NFE 2 L 2 haplotype associations with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> five NFE 2 L 2 tag SNPs were genotyped by allelic discrimination and three functional NFE 2 L 2 promoter SNPs were genotyped by sequencing. The impact of individual SNPs and haplotypes on risk and age at onset of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> were investigated in each material individually and in meta-analyses of the obtained results. Results: Meta-analyses of NFE 2 L 2 haplotypes showed association of haplotype GAGCAAAA, including the fully functional promoter haplotype AGC, with decreased risk (OR = 0. 8 per allele, p = 0. 012) and delayed onset (+ 1. 1 years per allele, p = 0. 048) of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> These results support the previously observed protective effect of this haplotype in the first study. Further, meta-analyses of the SNPs included in the haplotypes revealed four NFE 2 L 2 SNPs associated with age at onset of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (rs 7557529 G > A, - 1. 0 years per allele, p = 0. 042; rs 35652124 A > G, - 1. 1 years per allele, p = 0. 045; rs 2886161 A > G, - 1. 2 years per allele, p = 0. 021; rs 1806649 G > A, + 1. 2 years per allele, p = 0. 029). One of these (rs 35652124) is a functional SNP located in the NFE 2 L 2 promoter. No individual SNP was associated with risk of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Conclusion: Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} variation in the NFE 2 L 2 gene, encoding a central protein in the cellular protection against oxidative stress, may contribute to the pathogenesis of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Functional studies are now needed to explore these results further...|$|E

40|$|This study {{consists}} of two parts: first, the thesis with a general theoretical overview of the topic. Second, the draft paper Impulsivity and impulse control disorders in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> – A pilot study of assessment instruments in a clinic. The purpose of this work has been {{to contribute to the}} awareness of ICDs as a potential problem in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (PD), and to investigate possible tools and their utility to assess this problem in a specialised neurologic policlinic in Norway. In the pilot study we translated the Questionnaire for Impulse-Compulsive Disorders in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>Disease</b> (QUIP) and the Barrat Impulsiveness Scale (BIS- 11) to Norwegian and administered them to a convenience sample of PD patients. Statistical analyses was undertaken with SPSS version 15. 0. The analyses showed comparable numbers of ICDs in our sample of patients compared with previous findings and we found a significant correlation between the presence of an ICD and the degree of impulsivity. This study emphasizes the need for an increased awareness about ICDs and other compulsive disorders in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> as a possible side effect of their medication. The sensitive nature of these disorders requires a systematic and cautious approach, although an appreciation of their presence in a process of normalization seems equally important. Even though the pilot study was done on a small population after convenience sample our findings support previous studies that encourage clinicians to do routine testing for ICDs and other compulsive behaviours in PD patients...|$|E

40|$|<b>Parkinson</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (PD) is {{a common}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorder of unknown cause. The key feature of PD is the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta.

Although PD is traditionally thought of as a disease of neurons several observations indicate that astrocytes are active contributors to the initiation or progression of PD. To elucidate the PD pathogenesis different mouse lines carrying PD-inducing gene mutations have been generated. One line carries a homozygous deletion of parkin Exon 3 and two transgenic lines overexpress human doubly mutated 3 ̆b 1 -synuclein (A 30 P, A 53 T). In summary, this work strengthens the hypotheses that the spinal cord could and the olfactory bulb could be early contributors to the disease progression in PD.

Patient N., 75 years old, suffering for 15 years from <b>Parkinson,</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> akinetic­rigid form of the disease, stage 4 by Hyun–Yar. Since 2009, he received levodopa/carbidopa 250 / 25 mg 5 times/day (daily dose of 1250 mg of levodopa); pramipexole 3. 5 mg per day (daily dose 3. 5 mg), amantadine sulfate 100 mg 5 times/day (daily dose 500 mg). While taking antiparkinsonian drugs the patient developed behavioral disorders such as dopamine disregulatory syndrome combined with punding, hypersexuality and compulsive shopping accompanied by visual hallucinations. The total equivalent dose of levodopa was 1600 mg per day. The second clinical case. Patient R., 52 years old, suffers from <b>Parkinson,</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> about 5 years, a mixed form. She complained of slowness of movement, tremor in her left hand, sleep disturbances, poor mood. The clinic was appointed piribedil 50 mg 3 times per day. Despite {{the fact that the}} patient took only one of dopaminergic drugs in a therapeutic daily dose, she developed impulsive­compulsive disorder as hyper­ sexuality, compulsive shopping and binge eating.   Results. In the first clinical case for correction of behavioral disorders in patients with <b>Parkinson,</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> levodopa/carbidopa dose was reduced to 750 mg per day (3 / 4 Tab. 4 times a day); added to levodopa/benserazide dispersible 100 mg morning and levodopa/benserazide 100 mg before sleep (total dose of levodopa of 950 mg per day). Amantadine sulfate and pramipexole were canceled. It was added to the therapy of atypical neuroleptic clozapine dose 6, 25 mg overnight. After 3 months marked improvement, regressed visual hallucina­ tions, improved family relationships, background mood became more stable. The patient continue to sing karaoke, but this hobby has be­ come less intrusive.   In the second clinical event correction impulsive­compulsive disorders piribedil was replaced with pramipexole 1. 5 mg prolonged form one time a day.

DEPARTMENT: Special education department SUPERVISOR: Ji ina Klenková, Doc. PaedDr., PhD. ABSTRACT: The doctoral thesis deals with diagnosing communication disability for people with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (PD). PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with high occurrence of hypokinetic dysarthria (HD). The theoretical part of the thesis characterizes <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> weak and strong points of logopaedic diagnostics and describes HD. The empirical part of the thesis is based on quantitative research. The aims of our study were to modify test Dysarthric profile 3 F {{to be more sensitive}} to mild stage of HD, to detect HD symptoms in early untreated PD patiens, to notice HD progression in retest, to objectify results of clinical evaluation by acoustic measurments and to detect subjective perception of patient s own speech. We studied people with PD and neurologically healthy control speakers. We evaluated HD in 50 % PD subjects in early untreated stage of PD and in 74 % PD speakers in retest. We observe that between the most sensitive diagnostical tasks in clinical evaluation with high correlation with acoustic analysis belong evaluation of hoarse voice in sustained phonation of vowels and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Mesencephalic {{dopamine}} (mesDA) neurons degenerate {{in patients}} with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In order to develop new treatment strategies for rescuing or replacing degenerating mesDA neurons, an improved understanding of the development and survival of these neurons in the normal brain is required. In paper I we identify two key players, Lmx 1 a and Msx 1, implicated in the specification of mesDA neurons. Lmx 1 a and Msx 1 are important for ensuring the correct mesDA neuron differentiation cascade by suppressing alternative cell fates, promoting neurogenesis and inducing the generation of mesDA neurons. In papers I and II we provide evidence that over-expression of Lmx 1 a both in mouse and human embryonic stem cells leads to an efficient generation of authentic mesDA neurons. These in vitro engineered mesDA neurons might, in the future, {{be used as a}} cell source in cell replacement therapy for patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> However, to ensure a safe treatment, the use of embryonic stem cells depends on avoiding adverse effects such as uncontrolled cell growth. In papers II and III we show that an enrichment for embryonic stem cellderived progenitor cells or mature neurons, prior to grafting, removes unwanted dividing cells. Moreover, a higher number of mesDA neurons are present in the grafts after transplantation of sorted neurons, compared to progenitor cells. In paper IV, we show that ligands for the retinoic X receptor are present in the mesDA neuron domain in vivo, and that they mediate neuronal survival in primary mesDA neurons expressing both Nurr 1 and the retinoic X receptor. These factors might be of interest as a potential treatment strategy to enhance survival of endogenous or transplanted mesDA neurons for patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> The work presented in this thesis has increased the knowledge concerning the development of mesDA neurons and has helped to establish a protocol enabling the production of highly purified mesDA neurons. This knowledge can facilitate the establishment of new therapies for patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> be a useful tool in drug screenings and help to identify additional factors important for the development, survival and maintenance of the mesDA system...|$|E
40|$|<b>Parkinson</b> 3 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (PD) {{is largely}} {{attributed}} to disruptions in the nigrostriatal dopamine system. These neurodegenerative changes {{may also have}} a more global effect on intrinsic brain organization at the cortical level. Functional brain connectivity between neurocognitive systems related to cognitive processing is critical for effective neural communication, and is disrupted across neurological disorders. Three core neurocognitive networks have been established as playing {{a critical role in}} the pathophysiology of many neurological disorders: the default-mode network (DMN), the salience network (SN), and the central executive network (CEN). In healthy adults, DMN–CEN interactions are anti-correlated while SN–CEN interactions are strongly positively correlated even at rest, when individuals are not engaging in any task. These intrinsic between-network interactions at rest are necessary for efficient suppression of the DMN and activation of the CEN during a range of cognitive tasks. To identify whether these network interactions are disrupted in individuals with PD, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to compare between-network connectivity between 24 PD participants and 20 age-matched controls (MC). In comparison to the MC, individuals with PD showed significantly less SN–CEN coupling and greater DMN–CEN coupling during rest. Disease severity, an index of striatal dysfunction, was related to reduced functional coupling between the striatum and SN. These results demonstrate that individuals with PD have a dysfunctional pattern of interaction between core neurocognitive networks compared to what is found in healthy individuals, and that interaction between the SN and the striatum is even more profoundly disrupted in those with greater disease severity...|$|R

Furthermore, concepts for protective shielding also pose a technically challenging issue {{due to the nature}} of cosmic radiation and current mass and power constraints with modern exploration technology. As biological damage from exposure is associated with increased oxidative stress, it would be enabling to mitigate and/or prevent stress prior to the development of clinical symptoms and disease. This paper hypothesizes a "systems biology" approach in which a combination of chemical and biological mitigation techniques are used conjunctively. It proposes using new, therapeutic, medical gases as both chemical radioprotectors for radical scavenging and biological promoters for management of the body s response to exposure. From reviewing radiochemistry of water, biological effects of CO, H 2, NO, and H 2 S gas, and mechanisms of radiation biology, it is concluded that this approach may have great therapeutic potential for exposure. Furthermore, it also appears to have potential for curtailing the pathogenesis of other diseases in which oxidative stress has been implicated including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic inflammatory disease, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> and Alzheimer <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> cataracts, and aging...|$|R

40|$|Dopamine is {{fundamental}} in human behavior for movement, cognition and reward. A dysfunctional dopamine system is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric {{disorders such as}} <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and schizophrenia. Dopamine mediates its effects through five receptors. Dopamine D 2 receptors are well studied and successful drug targets {{in the treatment of}} <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and schizophrenia. The functional role of dopamine D 1 receptors is not fully understood and the clinical potential remains elusive. In the present thesis, full dopamine D 1 receptor agonists were used to characterize the functional roles of these dopamine receptor subtypes. A number of aspects of psychomotor activation relevant for <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and schizophrenia were examined with the full dopamine D 1 receptor agonists dihydrexidine and A 68930. Stimulation of dopamine D 1 receptors by dihydrexidine and A 68930 resulted in inhibition of locomotor activity in rats exploring an open-field. In habituated animals, with a low baseline activity, as well as in dopamine depleted rats, no locomotor activation was evident following dopamine D 1 receptor stimulation. The results suggest inhibitory actions of dopamine D 1 receptors in psychomotor activation. In fact, dihydrexidine and A 68930 blocked amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, a traditional sign of antipsychotic action. A possible site of action for the effects of dihydrexidine and A 68930 is stimulation of prefrontal dopamine D 1 receptors, as indexed by neuronal activation (c-fos). A different approach to examine dopamine D 1 receptor agonism was used with clozapine that previously has been shown to possess dopamine D 1 receptor agonist properties in vivo. Clozapine does not cause extrapyramidal side effects and can be used in drug-induced psychosis in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Two new atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine and quetiapine, that both have a similar pharamacological profile to clozapine, were compared with clozapine on drug-induced catalepsy. In contrast to olanzapine and quetiapine, clozapine blocked catalepsy. It is concluded that the pharmacological profile of clozapine differs from olanzapine and quetiapine, a finding that possibly can be explained by dopamine D 1 receptor agonism as a feature of clozapine. Whether the inhibition of psychomotor activity by dihydrexidine and A 68930 reside in specific D 1 or D 5 receptor stimulation is not known. In an attempt to functionally separate dopamine D 1 and D 5 receptor function, siRNA for induction of RNA interference (RNAi) was used to specifically knock-down D 1 receptors. Despite high efficacy in an in vitro system, no receptor knockdown was obtained in rodent brain with siRNA. The results suggest that a refinement of the RNAi technology is needed before functional studies in vivo is possible. The present thesis suggests important functional roles of brain dopamine D 1 receptors that may have relevance for schizophrenia and <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> A particularly interesting finding is an inhibitory role of prefrontal dopamine D 1 receptors on psychomotor activation, a finding that may have clinical implications in the treatment of schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|Background Recent {{quantitative}} neuroimaging {{studies have}} been successful in capturing phenotype and genotype-speci fi c changes in dementia syndromes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, <b>Parkinson</b> ? <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and other neurodegenerative conditions. However, the majority of imaging studies are cross-sectional, despite the obvious superiority of longitudinal study designs in characterising disease trajectories, response to therapy, progression rates and evaluating the presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative conditions. Objectives The aim of this work is to perform a systematic review of longitudinal imaging initiatives in neurodegeneration focusing on methodology, optimal statistical models, follow-up intervals, attrition rates, primary study outcomes and presymptomatic studies. Methods Longitudinal imaging studies were identi fi ed from ? PubMed ? and reviewed from 1990 to 2014. The search terms ? longitudinal ?, ? MRI ?, ? presymptomatic ? and ? imaging ? were utilised in combination with one of the following degenerative conditions; Alzheimer ? s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington ? s disease, multiple sclerosis, <b>Parkinson</b> ? <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> ataxia, HIV, alcohol abuse/ dependence. Results A total of 423 longitudinal imaging papers and 103 genotype-based presymptomatic studies were identi fi ed and systematically reviewed. Imaging techniques, follow-up intervals and attrition rates showed signi fi cant variation depending on the primary diagnosis. Commonly used statistical models included analysis of annualised percentage change, mixed and random effect models, and non-linear cumulative models with acceleration ? deceleration components.

40|$|Acquired color {{deficiency}} in the tritan axis in Parkinson’s disease {{has already been}} reported, manifesting itself as impaired performance in various visual tasks. However, its clinical significance has always been controversial. In this study we evaluated the performance of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> patients in Lanthony 15 -desaturated clinical test {{and for the first}} time, compared it with the standard Farnsworth-Munsell 15 -dichotomous test, {{in order to determine the}} clinical value of the color vision {{deficiency in}} these shorter tests and their relationship with other factors such as age, duration and severity of the disease, and the presence of signs and symptoms of depression and hallucinations. This blind case-control study was performed on 39 definitely diagnosed patients (of which 14 patients were excluded because of confounding variables) and 25 sex and age-adjusted controls in a neurologic referral center. The subjects were selected by consecutive sampling. Eleven patients in Farnsworth-Munsell and 3 patients in Lanthony showed normal function, however, overall patients had significantly weaker performance than controls (P-value= 0. 003 and 0. 000 for FM and Lanthony respectively). The pattern of responses in Lanthony was consistent with a mild tritanomalia and had a significant correlation with the severity of motor signs and symptoms (Spearman coefficient= 0. 44, P-value= 0. 027). The weaker correlation of color deficiency with age in patients (Spearman coefficient= 0. 42) in comparison with controls (Spearman coefficient= 0. 60) also signifies the role of the pathophysiology of the disease. We concluded that color deficiency is a clinically significant visual dysfunction in patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction Although {{symptomatic}} {{therapy is}} available for Parkinson's disease, patients and relatives are faced with continuous severe psychological problems. These psychological problems include: 1. lack of emotional expression, 2. bradephrenia, 3. depression, 4. lack of motivation,S. social anxiety, 6. stress induced increase of symptoms. The first four of these may be {{at least in part}} due to the dopamine deficiency. However, even as part of the primary symptoms they have social and communicative impact for patients and relatives. Social anxiety and stress induced increase of symptoms on the other hand clearly result from an interaction of somatic and psychological factors. Social anxiety mainly develops in <b>Parkinson</b> I <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> as an indirect consequence of the motor symptoms. Patients are afraid of being negatively evaluated in the public, of receiving negative comments etc. Thus r social withdrawal increases and the improvement of neurological symptoms following drug treatment may not be fully exploited on the psychosocial level. Stress induced increase of motor symptoms is a commonly observed phenomenon in Parkinson's disease. Even minor stressors, mainly social in nature, can have extreme effects and may elicit or increase tremor or rigidity. A patient can be well in one moment, but unable to move in the next when being aware that he has to leave the house in an hour. Given this situation, patients and relatives have to develop strategies fo~ an emotional balance {{in the presence of a}} continuous confrontation with the direct and indirect consequences of the disease. A precondition for developing new psychologically based strategies is an optimwn medical treatment. The integrated approach for neurological and psychological support has the following goals: 1. improving medical treatment for the individual patient, 2. improving psychological coping and psychosocial adaptation for patients and relatives, and 3. evaluating and improving medical and psychological therapy. CONCLUSION Psychological intervention can provide considerable help for a substantial part of Parkinson patients. The main target is coping with stressful social situations. Relaxation and cognitive restructuring together with situational behavioral analysis and training of social skills specifically adapted to the disease are" the main strategies. Various problems remain open at the moment, like the maintenance of motivation which is especially critical for Parkinson patients. Parkins on 's disease is a neurological disease with a known pathological substrate and a therapy which is effective at least for several years on a symptomatic level. The symptoms are tightly connected with psychological emotional and cognitive processes. Moreover, patients and relatives have to cope with symptoms which strongly influence social interaction. And they have to cope together with this situation over a period of ten or twenty years. Thus not only for the patient but also for the health of the relatives, psychological aid is urgently needed. We suggest to integrate psychological approach into the neurological diagnosis and treatment...|$|R

They overcome the ethical issues inherent to the use of human fetal tissue or embryonic stem cells.

It has therefore been hypothesized that androgen supplementation may be beneficial in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In recent studies, animal models have been used to elucidate the molecular mechanism behind this relationship between androgens and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> These studies have shown that androgen depletion results in increased levels of beta amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, changes which are thought to be associated with subsequent neuronal death. Summary: Androgen depletion results in molecular changes associated with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Further human trials are needed to determine whether androgen modulating therapy for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> has clinical significance...|$|R
40|$|Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a {{surgical}} intervention {{that is known}} to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of common movement disorders, such as <b>Parkinson.</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> dystonia, or tremor. During the intervention the surgeon places electrodes inside of the patient. s brain to stimulate speci. c regions. Since these regions span {{only a couple of}} millimeters, and electrode misplacement has severe consequences, reliable and accurate navigation is of great importance. Usually the surgeon relies on fused CT and MRI data sets, as well as direct feedback from the patient. More recently Microelectrode Recordings (MER), which support navigation by measuring the electric. eld of the patient. s brain, are also used. We propose a visualization system that fuses the different modalities: imaging data, MER and patient checks, as well as the related uncertainties, in an intuitive way to present placement-related information in a consistent view with the goal of supporting the surgeon in the. nal placement of the stimulating electrode. We will describe the design considerations for our system, the technical realization, present the outcome of the proposed system, and provide an evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS- 21) is a {{frequently}} used measure of emotional disturbance symptoms in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (PD). However, {{the factor structure}} of the DASS- 21 in PD has yet to be explored. Objective: To assess whether the scale is measuring these symptoms in PD {{in the same way as}} the general population. Methods: The present study fit a series of established DASS- 21 factor structures with both confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) using data from 251 participants with PD. Results: The 3 -factor ESEM provided the best fit. The depression and stress scales fit well, however, few items on the anxiety subscale loaded clearly, with several items significantly loading onto the depression or stress factors. Conclusions: Whilst the depression and stress subscales appear suitable in PD, poor loadings and internal consistency indicate the anxiety subscale may not accurately assess anxiety symptomology in PD. This may be due to the scale s reliance on physiological symptoms as indicators of anxiety, when many of these are present in PD. Thus, the anxiety subscale of the DASS- 21 may not be a suitable measure of anxiety in PD...|$|E
40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease fail {{to fully}} profit from advance {{information}} about a target's movement in tracking tasks, possibly indicating deficient anticipation of the target's movement. Time estimation has been claimed to be deficient in Parkinson's disease. On the background of these studies, we tested the hypothesis that motion imagery is impaired in Parkinson's disease. Eleven non-demented patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and nine age-matched controls participated in experiments testing their ability to anticipate trajectories of moving points (prediction whether two moving points would crash or not) and to estimate the time needed for completion of an invisible target's movement (a point moving around a circle). In addition, mirror drawing, a task involving motor learning and adjustment of movement to incongruent visual feedback, was tested. The Parkinson's disease patients, who failed to improve on mirror drawing, were not impaired on the imagery tasks: they estimated movement time and predicted trajectories with equal precision as the controls. Motion imagery thus appears to be intact in Parkinson's disease. However, Parkinson's disease patients did not accelerate their predictions of trajectories with practice {{as fast as the}} controls, a deficit which may be interpreted in terms of the fronto-striatal dysfunction repeatedly demonstrated in Parkinson's disease...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{review the}} role played by the {{mitochondrial}} permeability transition pore (MPTP) in different physiological and pathological processes. METHOD: Both genetic and functional alterations in mitochondria can lead to errors that trigger programmed cell death, which in turn give rise to a number of diseases that affect the nervous system. Over the last few years the mitochondrion has been seen as the link between the different signalling pathways involved in some degenerative processes. The mitochondrion seems to play an important part in the cellular decision making that leads, irreversibly, toward the execution phase in cellular death processes. This being the case, the action would be mediated by the permeability of its membranes, through the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and would involve phenomena such as the dissipation of the mitochondrial electrochemical potential and the release of substances from within it. These substances include apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), apoptosis protease activating factor 1 (apaf 1), cytochrome c and members of the protease family: the caspases. These alterations have been described in neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer s and <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and transmissible spongiform encephalopaties. CONCLUSIONS: Designing pharmaceutical products capable of interfering with the functions of MPTP would allow a better therapeutic approach in neurological pathologies...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} fast method with high {{reliability}} {{is necessary for}} the identification of mutations, polymorphisms and sequence variants (MPSV) within many genes and many samples, e. g. for clarifying the genetic background of individuals with multifactorial diseases. Here we review our experience with the polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) analysis to identify MPSV in a number of genes thought {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of multifactorial neurological disorders, including autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and neurodegenerative disorders like <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (PD). The method is based on the property of the DNA that the electrophoretic mobility of single stranded nucleic acids depends not only on their size but also on their sequence. The target sequences were amplified, digested into fragments ranging from 50 - 240 base pairs (bp), heat-denatured and analysed on native polyacrylamide (PAA) gels of different composition. The analysis of a great number of different PCR products demonstrates that the detection rate of MPSV depends on the fragment lengths, the temperature during electrophoresis and the composition of the gel. In general, the detection of MPSV is neither influenced by their location within the DNA fragment nor by the type of substitution, i. e., transitions or transversions. The standard PCR/SSCP system described here provides high reliability and detection rates. It allows the efficient analysis of a large number of DNA samples and many different genes...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{present a}} new {{evaluation}} of levodopa plasma concentrations and clinical effects during duodenal infusion of a levodopa/carbidopa gel (Duodopa) in 12 patients with advanced <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (PD), {{from a study}} reported previously (Nyholm et al, Clin Neuropharmacol 2003; 26 (3) : 156 - 163). One objective was to investigate in what state of PD {{we can see the}} greatest benefits with infusion compared with corresponding oral treatment (Sinemet CR). Another objective was to identify fluctuating response to levodopa and correlate to variables related to disease progression. Methods: We have computed mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) for the clinical rating from - 3 (severe parkinsonism) to + 3 (severe dyskinesia) as measures of the clinical state over the treatment periods of the study. Standard deviation (SD) of the rating was used as a measure of response fluctuations. Linear regression and visual inspection of graphs were used to estimate relationships between these measures and variables related to disease progression such as years on levodopa (YLD) or unified PD rating scale part II (UPDRS II). Results: We found that MAE for infusion had a strong linear correlation to YLD (r 2 = 0. 80) while the corresponding relation for oral treatment looked more sigmoid, particularly for the more advanced patients (YLD> 18) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. Recent neuroanatomical work has identified pathways for communication across striatal subdivisions, {{suggesting that the}} striatum provides a platform for integration of information across parallel corticostriatal circuits. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> both “on” and “off” their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the “off” state. The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “off” state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “on” state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> when in the “off” state. Taken together our findings emphasize the central role of dopamine in integrated striatal function and the pathological consequences of striatal dopamine denervation in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
