40|$|BACKGROUND: Peer {{pressure}} {{is regarded as}} an important determinant of substance use, sexual behavior and juvenile delinquency. However, few peer pressure scales are validated, especially in French or German. Little {{is known about the}} factor structure of such scales or the kind of scale needed: some scales takes into account both peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do and peer <b>pressure</b> not <b>to</b> do, while others consider only peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do. The aim {{of the present study was}} to adapt French and German versions of the Peer Pressure Inventory, which is one of the most widely used scales in this field. We considered its factor structure and concurrent validity. METHODS: Five thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven young Swiss men filled in a questionnaire on peer pressure, substance use, and other variables (conformity, involvement) in a cohort study. RESULTS: We identified a four-factor structure, with the three factors of the initial Peer Pressure Inventory (involvement, conformity, misconduct) and adding a new one (relationship with girls). A non-valued scale (from no peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do only) showed stronger psychometric qualities than a valued scale (from peer <b>pressure</b> not <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do). Concurrent validity was also good. Each behavior or attitude was significantly associated with peer pressure. CONCLUSION: Peer <b>pressure</b> seems <b>to</b> be a multidimensional concept. In this study, peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do showed the strongest influence on participants. Indeed, peer <b>pressure</b> not <b>to</b> do did not add anything useful. Only peer <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> do affected young Swiss men's behaviors and attitudes and was reliable...|$|R

5|$|After {{the success}} of his {{previous}} film The Life of Oharu, Mizoguchi was offered to make a film by his old friend Masaichi Nagata at Daiei Film studios. The deal promised Mizoguchi complete artistic control and a large budget. Despite this, Mizoguchi was eventually <b>pressured</b> <b>to</b> make a less pessimistic ending for the film. Mizoguchi's sceenwriter and long-time collaborator Yoshikata Yoda said that originally, Mizoguchi did not envision making an anti-war film, instead wishing to capture the sensations and lucidity of Ueda's book Ugetsu Monogatari.|$|E

However, in April 2009 Fox confirmed that Stone would be returning as both director and producer, alongside Douglas and Edward R. Pressman. Stone stated that he reconsidered passing on directing the film after the stock market crash. The film was co-produced by Eric Kopeloff with Alessandro Camen and Celia D. Costas serving as executive producers. In addition to screenwriter Loeb, the film's overall writer is Schiff. Bryan Burrough received credit as a consultant, and may have done uncredited work on the story.|$|E
5|$|Despite rising {{traffic to}} Las Vegas, WAE reduced {{service to the}} city amid the Great Depression.

When the city attempted to purchase the field and build a more modern terminal, WAE refused. With the advent of World War II, however, WAE was <b>pressured</b> <b>to</b> sell the airfield. Nevadan Senator Pat McCarran helped obtain federal funding {{for the city to}} buy the field and construct a new terminal. He also helped establish a gunnery school by the United States Army Air Corps at the field. For the senator's contributions, the airport was named McCarran Field in 1941.|$|E

40|$|Every {{linguistics}} undergraduate {{student is}} by now familiar with the fact of linguistic imperialism in academic publishing where the <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> publish in international journals translates into the <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> publish in English, leaving researchers from non-English-speaking backgrounds at a competitive disadvantage. I have often joked in my introductory sociolinguistics lectures that discovering a cure for cancer {{and not being able}} to publish it in English would probably be little different from not discovering a cure for cancer at all. The academic <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> publish in English is thus old news but I’d never before thought about the fact that there might be more to the story: does the dominance of US- and UK-based journals among the most highly-ranked journals not only constitute <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> publish in English but also <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> conduct particular types of research? I. e. is there not only a form effect but also a content effect...|$|R

30|$|Natural gas {{diffusion}} experiments in saturated oil and dead oil {{at the same}} pressures were studied in a similar process except the method to simulate saturated oil and dead oil before the diffusion process. The saturated oil was simulated by decreasing the cell pressure from the reservoir <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> 4.0  MPa, and disengaging the released solution gas from oil by strong agitation in the PVT cell. The dead oil was made by decreasing the cell <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> release all the solution gas in the recombined oil, and then the cell <b>pressure</b> increased <b>to</b> 4.0  MPa.|$|R

5|$|The Portuguese {{government}} forced black Mozambican {{farmers to}} grow rice or cotton for export, providing little return {{with which the}} farmers could support themselves. Many other workers—over 250,000 by 1960—were <b>pressured</b> <b>to</b> work on coal and gold mines, in neighbouring territories, mainly in South Africa, where they comprised over 30% of black underground miners. By 1950, only 4,353 Mozambicans out of 5,733,000 had been granted {{the right to vote}} by the Portuguese colonial government. The rift between Portuguese settlers and Mozambican locals is illustrated in one way by the small number of people with mixed Portuguese and Mozambican heritage (mestiço), numbering only 31,465 in a population of 8–10 million in 1960 according to that year's census.|$|E
5|$|The era {{of record}} labels {{investing}} in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited {{control over their}} content and marketing, ended with the late 1970s. Corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to the artists, and established acts were <b>pressured</b> <b>to</b> create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for a harder sound in the style of arena rock.|$|E

5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was <b>pressured</b> <b>to</b> do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{government}} decree on 20October Oerip became subordinate {{to both the}} acting Minister of Defence Soeljoadikoesoemo and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces Soeprijadi. However, neither man showed up to assume his duties. Soeprijadi, a PETA soldier who had led an uprising against Japanese forces in Blitar in February 1945, was thought dead. While Soeljohadikosomo's position remained unfilled, the guerrilla leader Moestopo declared himself Minister of Defence. As such, Oerip had little oversight and felt <b>pressured</b> <b>to</b> quickly establish a stable command structure. On 2November, he appointed leaders for military operations {{in various parts of}} the country: Didi Kartasasmita for western Java, Soeratman for central Java, Mohammad for eastern Java, and Soehardjo Hardjowardojo for Sumatra; each of these sub-commanders was given the rank of major general. Oerip also began appropriating weapons to different TKR commands. He took confiscated Japanese weapons from well-equipped forces and distributed them as needed. However, the results were less successful than he had hoped. PETA had been organised locally during the Japanese occupation, and as such its members were unable to accept a centralised leadership.|$|E

The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E
