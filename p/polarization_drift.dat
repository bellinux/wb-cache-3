50|$|These drifts, in {{contrast}} to the mirror effect and the non-uniform B drifts, do not depend on finite Larmor radius, but are also present in cold plasmas. This may seem counterintuitive. If a particle is stationary when a force is turned on, where does the motion perpendicular to the force come from and why doesn't the force produce a motion parallel to itself? The answer is the interaction with the magnetic field. The force initially results in an acceleration parallel to itself, but the magnetic field deflects the resulting motion in the drift direction. Once the particle is moving in the drift direction, the magnetic field deflects it back against the external force, so that the average acceleration {{in the direction of the}} force is zero. There is, however, a one-time displacement in the direction of the force equal to (f/m)ωc−2, which should be considered a consequence of the <b>polarization</b> <b>drift</b> (see below) while the force is being turned on.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research was to begin {{the development of a}} non-invasive optical sensor for measuring glucose concentration in the output medium of cell cultures grown in a unique NASA bioreactor referred to as an integrated rotating-wall vessel (IRWV). The input, a bovine serum based nutrient media, has a known glucose concentration. The cells within the bioreactor digest a portion of the glucose. Thus, the non-invasive optical sensor is needed to monitor the decrease in glucose due to cellular consumption since the critical parameters for sustained cellular productivity are glucose and pH. Previous glucose sensing techniques have used chemical reactions to quantify the glucose concentration. Chemical reactions, however, cannot provide for continuous, real time, non-invasive measurement as is required in this application. Our effort while in the fellowship program was focused on the design, optical setup, and testing of one bench top prototype non-invasive optical sensor using a mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy technique. Glucose has a fundamental vibrational absorption peak in the mid-infrared wavelength range at 9. 6 micron. Preliminary absorption data using a CO 2 laser were collected at this wavelength for water based glucose solutions at different concentrations and one bovine serum based nutrient medium (GTSF) with added glucose. The results showed near linear absorption responses for the glucose-in-water data with resolutions as high at 108 mg/dl and as low as 10 mg/dl. The nutrient medium had a resolution of 291 mg/dl. The variability of the results was due mainly to thermal and <b>polarization</b> <b>drifts</b> of the laser while the decrease in sensitivity to glucose in the nutrient medium was expected due to {{the increase in the number}} of confounders present in the nutrient medium. A multispectral approach needs to be used to compensate for these confounders. The CO 2 laser used for these studies was wavelength tunable (9. 2 to 10. 8 micrometers), however, it was to unstable across wavelengths to test the multispectral approach. From this research, further NASA support was obtained to continue the work throughout the year in which a more stable light source will be used at smaller, near-infrared, wavelengths. It is anticipated that a more compact, non-invasive, optical glucose sensor will be realized which can be used with a bioreactor on future space shuttle missions.

The fluid is described by a system of equations: Navier–Stokes and Euler equations for the macroscopic normal and superfluid velocity fields respectively. The two equations couple via a mutual friction force exerted on superfluid (quantum) vortices by the normal component. The magnitude of this force, calculated via the analysis of dynamics of quantum vortices in the microscopic scale, {{is proportional to the}} value of the counterflow (relative velocity of two helium components) and to the density of quantum vortices. The latter is determined by the generalized Vinen equation, adequate for flows having a net macroscopic vorticity. The generalized equation includes the drift of the anisotropic vortex tangle caused by Magnus force. The derived system of equations is applied first to the analysis of steady state solution of rotating turbulence, and then to the numerical analysis of formation of plane Couette flow between two infinite parallel material surfaces z = 0 andz = D. Fort< 0 both surfaces and the fluid are at rest, then at t = 0 one material surface starts moving along the x axis with velocity V 0.
