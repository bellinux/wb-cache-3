40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a {{particle}} accelerator aimed at exploring deeper into matter than ever before, {{is currently being}} constructed at CERN. Beam optics of the LHC, requires stringent control of the field quality of about 8400 superconducting magnets, including 1232 main dipoles and 360 main quadrupoles to assure the correct machine operation. The measurement challenges are various: accuracy on the field strength measurement up to 50 ppm, harmonics in the ppm range, measurement equipment robustness, low measurement times to characterize fast field phenomena. New magnetic measurement systems, principally based on analog solutions, have been developed at CERN to achieve these goals. This work proposes the introduction of digital technologies to improve measurement performance of three systems, aimed at different measurement target and characterized by different accuracy levels. The high accuracy measurement systems, based on rotating coils, exhibit high performance in static magnetic field. With varying magnetic field the system accuracy gets worse, independently from coil speed, due to the limited resolution of the digital integrator currently used, and the restrictions of the standard analysis. A new integrator based on ADC conversion and numerical integration is proposed. The experimental concept validation by emulating the proposed approach on a PXI platform is detailed along with the improvements {{with respect to the}} old integrators. Two new analysis algorithms to reduce the errors in dynamic measurements are presented. The first combines quadrature detection and short time Fourier transform (STFT) of the acquired magnetic flux samples; the second approach is based on the extrapolation of the magnetic flux samples. Unlike other algorithms presented in the literature, both the proposals do not require the information about the magnet current and are able to work in real time so, can be easily implemented in firmware on DSP. The performance of the new proposals are assessed in simulation. As far as medium accuracy systems are concerned, at CERN was originally developed a probe to measure the sextupolar and decapolar field harmonics of the superconducting dipoles using a suitable Hall plates arrangement for the bucking of the main dipolar field, which is, 4 orders of magnitude higher than the measurement target. The output signals of each Hall plate belonging to the same measurement ring are mixed using analog cards. The resultant signal is proportional to the field harmonic to measure. A complete metrological characterization of this sensor was carried out, showing the limitation of a fully analog solution. The main problems found were the instability of the analog compensation cards and the impossibility to correct the non linearity effects beyond the first order. An automatic calibration procedure implemented in the new instrument software is presented to guarantee measurement repeatability. In alternative a digital bucking solution, namely the compensation of the main field after the sampling of each hall plate signal by means of numerical sum, is proposed. An implementation of this approach, based on 18 bit ADC converter, over-sampling and dithering techniques as well as compensation of the Hall plates non linearity in real time is analyzed. Finally, as far as the low accuracy measurement systems are concerned, the design of an instrument based on a rotating Hall plate to check the polarity of all LHC magnets is presented. Even if this architecture is characterized by low accuracy in the measurement of field strength and phase, the results are sufficient to identify main harmonic order, type and polarity with practically no errors, thanks to an accurate definition of the measurement algorithm. A complete metrological characterization of the prototype developed and a correction of all the systematic measurement errors was carried out. This instrument, integrated in a test bench developed ad hoc, is become the standard at CERN for the <b>polarity</b> <b>test</b> of all the magnets will compose the machine...|$|E

The experiments were conducted involving 115 milk samples of Sumbawa mare and three different groups of control milk i. e. from 20 milk samples of working/ cart mares from Java, 2 samples of racing mares from Tangerang horse farm and 15 samples of dairy cows from Bogor. The results concluded that all milk samples of Sumbawa mares contained strong antimicrobial activity as tested to 9 species of bacteria. All control samples did not show antimicrobial activity, except milk samples from racing mares which showed low antibacterial activity. The racing mares were then indentified as crossbred between male Thoroughbred and female Sumbawa horse. This finding supports and suggests that the native Sumbawa horses have genetic potential to the antimicrobial activity in their milk produced. <b>Polarity</b> <b>tests</b> using 5 organic solvents of different polarity indicated that the antimicrobial activity compound was very polar but had lower polarity than water.

40|$|SummaryPrecise {{regulation}} {{of stem cell}} self-renewal/differentiation is essential for embryogenesis and tumor suppression. Drosophila neural progenitors (neuroblasts) align their spindle along an apical/basal polarity axis to generate a self-renewed apical neuroblast and a differentiating basal cell. Here, we genetically disrupt spindle orientation without altering cell <b>polarity</b> to <b>test</b> the role of spindle orientation in self-renewal/differentiation. We perform correlative live imaging of polarity markers and spindle orientation over multiple divisions within intact brains, followed by molecular marker analysis of cell fate. We find that spindle alignment orthogonal to apical/basal polarity always segregates apical determinants into both siblings, which invariably assume a neuroblast identity. Basal determinants can all be localized into one sibling without inducing neuronal differentiation, but overexpression of the basal determinant Prospero can deplete neuroblasts. We conclude that the ratio of apical/basal determinants specifies neuroblast/GMC identity, and that apical/basal spindle orientation is required for neuroblast homeostasis and neuronal differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Cdc 42 {{is a small}} GTPase {{involved}} in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell <b>polarity.</b> To <b>test</b> whether Cdc 42 has {{an essential role in}} the formation of filopodia or directed cell migration, we generated Cdc 42 -deficient fibroblastoid cells by conditional gene inactivation. We report here that loss of Cdc 42 did not affect filopodium or lamellipodium formation and had no significant influence on the speed of directed migration nor on mitosis. Cdc 42 -deficient cells displayed a more elongated cell shape and had a reduced area. Furthermore, directionality during migration and reorientation of the Golgi apparatus into the direction of migration was decreased. However, expression of dominant negative Cdc 42 in Cdc 42 -null cells resulted in strongly reduced directed migration, severely reduced single cell directionality, and complete loss of Golgi polarization and of directionality of protrusion formation toward the wound, as well as membrane blebbing. Thus, our data show that besides Cdc 42 additional GTPases of the Rho-family, which share GEFs with Cdc 42, are {{involved in}} the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity during directed migration...|$|R
40|$|Human {{observers}} {{were trained to}} criterion in classifying compound Gabor signals with sym- metry relationships, and were then tested with each of 18 blob-only versions of the learning set. General- ization to dark-only and light-only blob versions of the learning signals, {{as well as to}} dark-and-light blob versions was found to be excellent, thus implying virtually perfect generalization of the ability to classify mirror-image signals. The hypothesis that the learning signals are internally represented in terms of a 'blob code' with explicit labelling of contrast <b>polarities</b> was <b>tested</b> by predicting observed generalization behaviour in terms of various types of signal representations (pixelwise, Laplacian pyramid, curvature pyramid, ON/OFF, local maxima of Laplacian and curvature operators) and a minimum-distance rule. Most representations could explain generalization for dark-only and light-only blob patterns but not for the high-thresholded versions thereof. This led to the proposal of a structure-oriented blob-code. Whether such a code could be used in conjunction with simple classifiers or should be transformed into a propo- sitional scheme of representation operated upon by a rule-based classification process remains an open question. ...|$|R

Zebrafish are acceptable {{drug toxicity}} screening models; we used these animals with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method in a multiple reaction monitoring mode to quantify drug uptake in zebrafish to better estimate drug toxicity. Analytes were recovered from zebrafish homogenate by collecting supernatant. Measurements were confirmed for drugs {{in the range of}} 10 - 1, 000 ng/mL. Four antibiotics with different <b>polarities</b> were <b>tested</b> to explore any correlation of drug polarity, absorption, and toxicity. Zebrafish at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) absorbed more drug than those at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf), and different developmental periods appeared to be differentially sensitive to the same compound. By observing abnormal embryos and LD 50 values, zebrafish embryos at 6 hpf were considered to be suitable for evaluating embryotoxicity. Also, larvae at 3 dpf were adapted to measure acute drug toxicity in adult mammals. Thus, we can exploit zebrafish to study drug toxicity and can reliably quantify drug uptake with LC-MS/MS.

40|$|Click-evoked otoacoustic {{emissions}} (CEOAEs) {{are reduced}} in amplitude by {{the presentation of}} ‘suppressor’ clicks that either closely lead or follow the stimulus (‘test’) clicks. This suppression of the response represents nonlinear temporal interactions between the test and suppressor clicks and/or the CEOAEs they evoke. There are some discrepancies amongst previous reports of the phenomenon, and the underlying mechanisms are not understood. In particular, {{it is unclear whether}} the suppression reported simply reflects the compressive nonlinearity of the CEOAE input–output (I–O) function. This paper presents a simple model of the nonlinear interactions between CEOAEs evoked by two closely-spaced clicks. The model shows that suppression as reported may be entirely derived from CEOAE I–O nonlinearity, in combination with the extended duration of the cochlear responses to click stimuli. It is also shown experimentally that suppression is insensitive to the <b>polarities</b> of <b>test</b> and suppressor clicks, which is consistent with the model based on I–O nonlinearity.

The findings are compared with the pattern of results generated by the above model, in order to assess the role of I–O nonlinearity in these nonlinear interactions...|$|R

Cytotoxicity on MRC- 5  cell lines (human lung fibroblasts) as well as, in vitro radical scavenging activity was evaluated using the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical assay. ResultsThe highest antiprotozoal activity was observed for the CHCl 3 fractions of Z.  oxyphylla roots and leaves, and C.  serrata bark. The CHCl 3 and EtOAc fractions of Z.  oxyphylla roots, the CHCl 3 fraction of Z.  oxyphylla leaves, the EtOAc and the residual MeOH: H 2 O fraction of C.  serrata bark showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The same residual MeOH: H 2 O fraction of C.  serrata bark was active against Candida albicans. The highest antioxidant activity was observed for the more hydrophilic EtOAc fractions of Z.  oxyphylla leaves, C.  serrata bark and leaves, and the residual MeOH: H 2 O fraction of C.  serrata bark. ConclusionsThis study supports {{at least in part}} the traditional uses of these plants for antimicrobial purposes and against liver diseases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the primate retina, blue-OFF {{cells are}} less {{numerous}} than blue-ON cells but no psychophysical equivalent of this asymmetry {{has been found}} so far. The hypothesis put forward {{in the present study}} is that the ON–OFF asymmetry should manifest itself in the size and effectiveness of spatial summation of S-cone signals of opposite <b>polarity.</b> To <b>test</b> this hypothesis upon selective stimulation of the S-cones in man, a 3 cd/m 2 blue light was superimposed on a 300 cd/m 2 yellow background and the test stimulus consisted in a luminance increment or decrement of the blue light from its steady level over a circular area of variable size. The test stimuli were presented at 12. 5 ° retinal eccentricity. Within the test-stimulus spectral band, sensitivity was that of Stiles’ π 1 mechanism. Increasing stimulus area reduced more the decrement threshold than the increment threshold, and Ricco’s area was larger for luminance decrements (0. 8 – 2 °) than for increments (0. 6 – 0. 9 °). Experiments with red-on-red stimuli confirmed that the large summation area and stimulus-polarity-dependent spatial summation are specific for the isolated S-cone signals. The sign-dependency of spatial summation is probably a psychophysical correlate of the asymmetry of the ON- and OFF- visual pathways receiving S-cone input...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of biphasic waveform defibrillation threshold reduction is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that, during refractory period stimulation, sarcolemmal hyperpolarization {{by the first}} pulse of biphasic waveforms facilitates excitation channel recovery, which enhances graded responses produced by the second depolarizing pulse. This prolongs cellular refracto-riness to fibrillation wavefronts when compared with a monophasic depolarizing stimulus. Monophasic (10 msec, rectangular wave) or symmetrical biphasic (10 msec, each pulse) current injection S 2 stimuli at 1. 5 and two times S, threshold were used to scan the S, action potential refractory period (S 1 cycle length, 600 msec) in myocardial cell aggregates. S 2 waveforms were delivered with normal and reversed <b>polarity</b> to <b>test</b> the hyperpolarizing action of biphasic waveforms. Responses to an S 3 stimulus, which simulated a potential incoming fibrillation wavefront, were also determined. Results showed that biphasic S 2 waveforms produced longer graded responses during and immediately after the S, refractory period than did corresponding monophasic S 2 waveforms. The maximum difference in response duration produced by the biphasic and monophasic waveforms was 58. 6 + 10. 0 msec (p< 0. 001). This maximum difference occurred 10 msec {{before the end of}} the S, refractory period. The longer response duration...|$|R
40|$|Repolarization alternans {{is related}} to the {{initiation}} of life threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Experimental and computational studies suggest that the abolishment of alternans using dynamic pacing protocols may prevent abnormal heart rhythms. In a recent animal study, refractory period pacing (RPP) on every other beat has shown promising results in alternans reduction. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this therapy and its efficiency in human patients remain unclear. In this study, in vivo unipolar electrograms acquired during RPP from 240 epicardial sites from one patient were analysed. Current clamp of 18 channels was performed in silico to elucidate the ionic mechanisms underlying action potential modulation by RPP. Its efficacy with positive and negative <b>polarities</b> was <b>tested</b> on a population of 87 calibrated human ventricular models exhibiting alternans. In vivo electrograms showed significant changes in T-wave alternans when applying RPP. In silico, results showed APD shortening for RPP with positive polarity and APD prolongation with RPP negative. Under current clamp protocols, voltage rectification of L-type Ca(2) + (ICaL) and inward rectifier K+ (IK 1) currents were identified as the key determinants for the observed changes. RPP pacing successfully reduced alternans on the in silico models using a negative polarity stimulus in the short beat...|$|R
30|$|Figure  4 b,d {{shows the}} {{open-circuit}} voltage and closed-circuit current {{obtained for the}} e 33 and e 31 geometries, respectively. Through the <b>polarity</b> reversal <b>test,</b> we confirmed that the signals originated from the piezoelectricity of LiNbO 3. With {{an increase in the}} strain, both the voltage and current increased as well. We note that the obtained voltage (current) for the e 33 geometry was almost 20 times (100 times) larger than that for the e 31 geometry for a similar value of the strain. For example, the open-circuit voltage and closed-circuit current (current density) for e 33 with ϵ[*]=[*] 0.0168 % were 0.46  V and 9.11  nA (4.64  nA[*]·[*]cm- 2), respectively; whereas, for e 31 with ϵ[*]=[*] 0.018 %, values of 0.02  V and 0.09  nA (0.044  nA[*]·[*]cm- 2) were obtained, respectively. Note that due to the low output voltage and current for e 31, we could not detect a signal for strain lower than ϵ[*]=[*] 0.018 %. The electric power generated from the piezoelectric nanostructures was affected by the piezoelectric coefficient, dielectric constant, and strained length of the nanowire[9]. All of the other parameters were the same for both the e 33 and e 31 geometries, which implied that the significant difference in power generation was related to the different piezoelectric coefficients of d 33 [*]=[*] 27 pmV- 1 and d 31 [*]=[*] 4.3 pmV- 1 for LiNbO 3 [26].|$|R
40|$|AbstractDetailed {{knowledge}} of tissue response to both systolic and diastolic shock {{is critical for}} understanding defibrillation. Diastolic field stimulation has been much less studied than systolic stimulation, particularly regarding transient virtual anodes. Here we investigated high-voltage-induced polarization and activation patterns in response to strong diastolic shocks of various durations and of both <b>polarities,</b> and <b>tested</b> {{the hypothesis that the}} activation versus shock duration curve contains a local minimum for moderate shock durations, and it grows for short and long durations. We found that 0. 1 – 0. 2 -ms shocks produced slow and heterogeneous activation. During 0. 8 – 1  ms shocks, the activation was very fast and homogeneous. Further shock extension to 8  ms delayed activation from 1. 55 ± 0. 27  ms and 1. 63 ± 0. 21  ms at 0. 8  ms shock to 2. 32 ± 0. 41  ms and 2. 37 ± 0. 3  ms (N = 7) for normal and opposite polarities, respectively. The traces from hyperpolarized regions during 3 – 8  ms shocks exhibited four different phases: beginning negative polarization, fast depolarization, slow depolarization, and after-shock increase in upstroke velocity. Thus, the shocks of > 3  ms in duration created strong hyperpolarization associated with significant delay (P < 0. 05) in activation compared with moderate shocks of 0. 8 and 1  ms. This effect appears as a dip in the activation-versus-shock-duration curve...|$|R
40|$|The University of Michigan 26 -m {{paraboloid}} {{was dedicated}} to obtaining linear polarization and total flux density observations of blazars from the mid- 1960 s until June 2012 providing an unprecedented record tracking centimeter-band variability over decades at 14. 5, 8. 0, and 4. 8 GHz for both targeted objects and members of flux-limited samples. In the mid- 1970 s through the mid- 1980 s, and {{during the last decade}} of the program, observations were additionally obtained of circular polarization for a small sample of radio-bright (S> 5 Jy), active sources. Key program results include evidence supporting class-dependent differences in the magnetic field geometry of BL Lac and QSO jets, identification of linear polarization changes temporally associated with flux outbursts supporting a shock-in-jet scenario, and determination of the spectral evolution of the Stokes V amplitude and <b>polarity</b> for <b>testing</b> proposed models. Recent radiative transfer modeling during large flares supports a jet scenario with a kinetically-dominated, relativistic flow at parsec scales with embedded turbulent magnetic fields and dynamically-weak ordered components which may be helical; the circular polarization observations are consistent with linear-to-circular mode conversion within this turbulent jet environment.
