5|$|Despite taking {{victory in}} the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, Alonso was facing {{pressure}} heading into {{the second half of}} the season; he was forty-seven points behind Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship after scoring four points in the last two races. Alonso had been largely affected by safety car periods in Valencia and Silverstone despite his team having narrowed the <b>performance</b> <b>gap</b> on their championship rivals. However, Alonso remained upbeat about his title chances and said his team had more motivation to succeed despite his recent results. Hamilton, the defending race winner at the Hockenheimring, felt the race would give an indication on form for {{the second half of the}} year and believed McLaren should have a successful balance of their car in order to be competitive at the track.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} summarises {{the results of}} {{selected}} empirical studies on <b>performance</b> <b>gaps</b> between multinational enterprises and their domestic counterparts. <b>Performance</b> <b>gaps</b> arise in such fields as productivity, profitability, wages, skills, factor intensity and growth. Of central interest is the question {{to what extent is}} foreign ownership an explanatory factor of <b>performance</b> <b>gaps?</b> Empirical evidence supports the existence of <b>performance</b> <b>gaps</b> between foreign and domestic firms, yet foreign ownership is a much less important explanatory factor than normally assumed. Structural factors like industry, size and multi-nationality per se are more important. It is argued that such results are broadly consistent with those derived in the literatures on ownership change, on foreign entry and on spillovers. The concluding section discusses the normative issue whether there is a case for investment promotion policies to discriminate between firms on the basis of <b>performance</b> <b>gaps</b> by ownership.

40|$|Abstract]: The most {{important}} technology and management priorities {{considered to be}} problematic and challenging for the chief information officer (CIO) can be identified by determining where significant <b>performance</b> <b>gaps</b> exist for individual priorities. Previous studies have identified the key technology and management priorities for CIOs but, surprisingly, have not evaluated the performance of these priorities. In 30 in-depth interviews, CIOs rated the importance and performance of 10 key technology and 10 key management priorities identified in a previous large-scale survey of CIOs. Significant <b>performance</b> <b>gaps</b> exist for four management and four technology priorities. Furthermore, the following technology and management priorities which exhibited <b>performance</b> <b>gaps</b> have remained constant priorities over time: align IT with business goals; IT-enabled process improvement; integrate/enhance systems and processes; and ensure data security and integrity. This research contributes to theory by identifying the {{most important}} technology and management priorities in ICT which exhibit <b>performance</b> <b>gaps.</b> Where the <b>performance</b> <b>gaps</b> exist in technology and management priorities, more attention and resources need to be dedicated by CIOs to the management of ICT, and to resolving the associated technology challenges...|$|R

The Tuscan V6, {{equipped with the}} 3.0L Ford Essex V6, was intended to fill the <b>performance</b> <b>gap</b> between the four-cylinder Vixens and the V8 models. The long wheelbase widebody Tuscan V8 was built to address the cramped interior dimensions of the car, but was not commercially successful and {{only a very small}} number were produced. The Vixen S3 incorporated several minor updates to the Vixen S2, which had continued to be successful. The new 2500 model was fitted with the Triumph 2.5L inline-six engine. Working together in 1971, Martin Lilley and Mike Bigland created yet another new model, the TVR 1300. This used the 1.3L engine from the Triumph Spitfire and was intended to offer an inexpensive model option that was also cheaper to insure.|$|E
25|$|Due to the LCD layer {{that generates}} the desired high {{resolution}} images at flashing video speeds using very low power electronics {{in combination with}} these excellent LED based backlight technologies, LCD technology has become the domination display technology for products such as televisions, desktop monitors, notebooks, tablets, smartphones and mobile phones. Although competing OLED technology is pushed to the market, such OLED displays does not feature the HDR capabilities like LCDs in combination with 2D LED backlight technologies have, reason why the annual market of such LCD-based products is still growing faster (in volume) than OLED-based products while the efficiency of LCDs (and products like portable computers, mobile phones and televisions) may even be further improved by preventing the light to be absorbed in the colour filters of the LCD. Although until today such reflective colour filter solutions are not yet implemented by the LCD industry and did not made it further than laboratory prototypes, such reflective colour filter solutions still likely will be implemented by the LCD industry to increase the <b>performance</b> <b>gap</b> with OLED technologies).|$|E

[...] A spokesman for Abbott's campaign pointed out that the biggest difference in spending is that Davis has proposed universal pre-K education while Abbott wants to limit state funding to only programs that meet certain standards.

2500|$|Discussions about parity had {{returned}} in 2000, with 100 millimetres trimmed {{from the front}} spoiler of the Commodore after Holden, in particular, the Holden Racing Team, had dominated in 1998 and 1999. This {{was in response to}} the 300mm removed from the Falcon in previous seasons, and coincided with a 10mm trim from the Falcon's rear spoiler. The small reduction for the Holden teams was quickly addressed with both cars receiving the same front splitter shortly afterwards, [...] but the Falcon's rear wing remained trimmed. Ford had threatened to withdraw from the series, but nothing came of this. After Holden again dominated in 2001 and 2002, a new set of regulations, dubbed 'Project Blueprint', was introduced in 2003 to close the <b>performance</b> <b>gap</b> between the Commodore and the Falcon, thus creating closer, fairer racing.

In-game tutorials have been found to bring both sexes into games faster, and new controllers such as Nintendo's Wii Remote, Microsoft's Kinect, and the various rhythm game controllers have affected demographics by making games easier to pick up and by providing a level playing-field. This trend has continued through the efforts of Nintendo in its release of the Wii. Leigh Alexander argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.

Microprocessors have advanced much faster than memory, especially in terms of their operating frequency, so memory became a performance bottleneck. While it was technically possible to have all the main memory as fast as the CPU, a more economically viable path has been taken: use plenty of low-speed memory, but also introduce a small high-speed cache memory to alleviate the <b>performance</b> <b>gap.</b> This provided an order of magnitude more capacity—for the same price—with only a slightly reduced combined performance.|$|E

This Capstone Project examined the implementation of three reforms intended to addresses the academic needs of students in the Rowland Unified School District: The Ball Foundation, English Learner Instructional Support Leads, and Three Essential Priorities.
