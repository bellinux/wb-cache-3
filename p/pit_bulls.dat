25|$|In Cochrane v.

25|$|States, cities, {{and towns}} in Western nations {{commonly}} enact local ordinances {{to limit the}} number or kind of pets a person may keep personally or for business purposes.

Animal bites, most of which are from dogs, are the reason for 1% of visits to an emergency department in the United States.

25|$|In Holt v.

The Pulaski County circuit court made a summary judgment dismissing the suit, and Mr. Holt appealed. In 1991, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's decision, finding that the pit bull ordinance was not impermissibly vague, that the restrictions were reasonable, and that any agreement made by the city to limit its own legislative powers was null and void since the city's first duty was to protect the public interest.|$|E
25|$|The Pit Bull Terrier {{was created}} by {{breeding}} Old English Terriers and Old English Bulldogs together to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog. These dogs (Bull and Terriers) were bred in England, and arrived in the United States where they became the direct ancestors of the American Pit Bull Terrier. In the United Kingdom, Bull-and-terriers were used in bloodsports such as bull baiting, bear baiting. These bloodsports were officially eliminated in 1835 as Britain began to introduce animal welfare laws. Since dogfights were cheaper to organise and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, bloodsport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a bloodsport (often involving gambling) {{and a way to}} continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain and America. In the early 20th century, <b>pit</b> <b>bulls</b> were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and drive livestock, and as family companions. Some have been selectively bred for their fighting prowess.|$|E
