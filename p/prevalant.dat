40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{show the}} effect of {{myeloperoxidase}} (MPO), hsCRP, TNF-alpha values and leukocyte count {{on the development of}} coronary collateral arteries in patients with severely diseased coronary arteries. Methods: Current study is an observational cross-sectional study. In the study, 295 patients who had functional obstruction or total coronary occlusion at least 1 month on their angiograms were included. We divided the study population into two groups according to their collateral grade as good collateral (Group 1) (169 patients) and poor collateral (Group 2) (126 patients). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used for independent variables associated with the coronary collateral grade. Results: History of stable angina pectoris was statistically more <b>prevalant</b> in good collateral group (61. 5 % and 48. 4 %, p= 0. 025). Furthermore, MPO activation was higher in good collateral group and the difference was statistically significant (3. 7 U/mL and 3. 0 U/mL p= 0. 001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, stable angina pectoris [OR 1. 7, 95 % CI (1. 05 - 2. 8), p= 0. 03] and high MPO levels [OR 2. 7, 95 % CI (1. 7 - 4. 3), p< 0. 001] were found to be independent predictors of good collateral development.

40|$|The {{congestion}} minimization {{techniques have}} become more important due to the shrinking geometries and “taller” interconnects, causing numerous design convergence problems. Also, multilevel placement algorithms are becoming more <b>prevalant</b> due {{to their ability to}} natively incorporate mixed-mode placement, in addition to their ability to scale to very large design sizes. In this context, we have developed a number of implicit heuristics for minimizing congestion in the process of fortifying an existing industrial multilevel placment tool (Dolphin). In contrast to the explicit congestion heuristics that explicity measure congestion either by stochastic estimators or by approximate global routing, our techniques primarily rely on pre-emptively identifying congestion prone clusters and making amends to them. Essentially, we intervene during the clustering phase of the multilevel placement to identify such congestion prone clusters and try to increase the supply of routing resources to those clusters. Increasing the supply of routing resources can be done by whitespace injection. Cell/cluster inflation is however, not a new technique, but what is new in our techniques is that we inflate the clusters before any placement information is obtained. In addition to the effective schemes of cluster inflation that reduce congestion substantially (upto 25 % on average), we have also modified the clustering formulation to generate clusters that are less prone to congestion. These new clustering schemes do not use any additional area and as a result a more attractive option for designs with very high utilization...|$|E
40|$|Lepra bubalorum or leprosy {{in water}} buffaloes, is an exotic disease in buffaloes. It {{is a very}} {{interesting}} phenomenon in Veterinary Medicine because until to date it has been found only in Indonesia. Kok and Rusli (1926) has published their first report in 1926 describing the disease in Java. Since then the diagnosis of leprosy has been established by histological examinations in about 146 water buffaloes (Lobel, 1934). It has also been found in Holstein-Freisen cow (Ressang and Titus, I 960), one case in Ongole breed and another in an unidentified cow breed. For leprosy infection in bovine, Kraneveld and Roza (1954) proposed to use the name Lepra bovina Lobel (1934) was the first scientist who brought the attention of this unusual disease to the International scientific world. His extensive works gave vs a clear description of the clinical signs and symptoms, histopathological changes and the microbiological arrangement of the acid fast baccili of the infectious agent in the affected tissues. The changes found in the cutaneous tissue of these animals resembled to those found in the skin of lepromatous lessions in humans. The rod-shape bacteria which is acid fast, are always present in the nodules of the diseases animals. In central Sulawesi (Celebes), leprosy in humans was found as the second most <b>prevalant</b> chronic diseases after pulmonary tuberculosis. It is interesting to know that apparently human leprosy was also found in great numbers in the same area where leprosy in water buffaloes was found frequently. This phenomenon is an interesting subject for investigation to see whether the genus of the bacteria found in humans and that in water buffaloes have the anthropozoonotic properties. * Makalah ini disajikan pada Simposium "Kemajuan Dalam Penyakit Tropis dan Parasit" di Fakultas Kedokteran, Universitas Tarumanagara, Jakarta, 12 Desember 1992 ** Bagian Patologi Anatomi, Fakultas Kedokteran Universitas Tarumanagara, Jakarta, Indonesia.

It suppose that adenoviral infections are <b>prevalant</b> in these patients Due to using medicines for preventing transplant rejection. This study was performed to compare the incidence of adenoviruses in urine samples taken before and after BMT from individuals undergoing BMT. In addition, The correlation between age, sex, etiology and kind of transplantation and adenovirus infection was studied. Materials and Methods: From 11 November 2002 to 12 June 2003, 91 patients received BMT in Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation center of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. From 72 patients, 2 urine samples were taken before and 4 weeks after transplantation The DNA samples were examined by PCR using primers that detect 134 bp sequence in Hexon gene shared in human adenovirus DNA was extracted using Phenol-Chloroform method and concentrated by sodium acetate and ethanol. In Faculty of Medicine, Shahed University. Results: Adenovirus DNA was found in 39 patients (54. 2 %) before transplantation and in 37 patients (51. 4 %) after that. Both before and after BMT samples were negative for adenoviruses in 21 patients and positive in 25 patients. In 14 patients only before BMT and in 12 patients only after BMT urine samples were positive. No statistical difference between before and after BMT viruria was shown by McNemar’s test. Also, no statistical difference was shown between mean age of infected and non-infected patients by t-test. In spite of higher frequency of males, malignant and allogeneic transplant among studied patients, there was no statistical difference between two mentioned patients (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: In the present study, increase of prevalence of viruria in patients after bone marrow transplantation was not seen.

40|$|A full {{dissertation}} submitted in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree of Master in Education Presented to the Faculty of Education and Social Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 Writing in rural multigrade Foundation Phase schools is a largely negelected area for research and teacher development. Even those teaching multigrade classes are {{not sure how to}} approach it. There are almost no regulations or guidelines in PIRLS or government documents and reports. Nevertheless multigrade rural schooling is <b>prevalant</b> throughout South Africa. This gap between widespread practice and lack of theoretical acknowledgement or knowledge prompted this study. For {{the purposes of this study}} two rural multigrade Foundation Phase classes were selected in the Northern District of the Western Cape. This study answers one main question: What writing practices are being implemented in these two rural Foundation Phase multigrade classes? Two sub-questions are: How do the two Foundation Phase teachers teach writing skills to rural multigrade learners? What challenges do these two Foundation Phase teachers experience when teaching writing? Lack of research in this area required considerable time to consolidate an appropriate research methodology. To establish a scientific structure for this research certain theoretical approaches were adopted. Socio-cultural theories of learning, particularly focusing on Bronfenbrenner’s socio-ecological model, Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) and social constructivism were used. Piaget’s developmental contributions add to this research project. Cambourne’s principles and strategies were invaluable in understanding constructivism in a language classroom. Because this was a pioneering research project it took over four years to complete analysis of data from the schools and link it to the theoretical framework. A qualitative interpretative case study research design was specifically formulated to provide an objective understanding of the research questions. The data were analysed qualitatively. Four themes emerged from sub-question one and include: the pedagogy of teaching writing in a multigrade class, the importance of creating a writing ethos in the classroom, elements of writing and supporting learners in the writing process. The following six themes were identified in answering sub-question two: teacher challenges, poor socio-economic backgrounds, writing support from the WCED, creating a writing ethos including discipline, parental literacy and learner challenges. In conclusion, this research indicates that multigrade education is, far from being a recalcitrant problem or cause for apology, useful as a template for curriculum development in many other areas of education. Multigrade education provides a realistic and flexible tool for meeting urgent educational problems...|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{presents the}} results of the study of a corpus of relevant literature on communes and commune movements in Western society. The study is descriptive-analytical, and the communes analyzed belong partly to the past and partly to the present. The analysis was predominantly based upon some 40 descriptions of different communes or commune movements, the relevant characteristics of which are mentioned in an appendix. The social entities selected for this study had to satisfy the following criteria:- they had to be established in the now capitalist West;- they had to have an experimental character when established;- they had to embrace three or more socially autonomous members;- they should not reject per se sexuality, socialization, production/ consumption, and emotional- affective care as activities for their own group, but should rather aim at the fulfilment of at least one of these functions as an activity of the group as a whole;- they had to be territorial units;- their duration as a functioning whole should not have been determined in advance. The problem to be studied was threefold. The first question dealt with the profile of the communes in the now capitalist West. The answer to that question has been given in terms of motivation, membership, social characteristics of the members, selection, the functions of the group in a family sociological perspective (sexuality, procreation, etc.), structural aspects, duration, and causes of success or failure. On a motivational basis the communes and commune movements were classed into three main categories, viz. :I. religious communes (a. old religious communes; b. communes proceeding from convents/monasteries; c. communes originating from new religious movements);II. political communes (a. passive political communes; b active political communes);III. communes emphasizing interpersonal relations. Communes of type Ia were already established centuries ago, those of type II were not founded before the nineteenth century, while communes of type Ic and III are a phenomenon of the last decade. The foregoing suggests that the different types distinguished are fairly closely related to different socio-cultural epochs. However, one further conclusion deserves special mention, viz. that the contemporary commune attacks the family much more often on a broad front than the commune of the past. The second question pertains to the social background and the ideologies that stimulated commune formation. An attempt is made to analyse the relationship between developments in society and ideologies living in the communes. Regarding this relation, it appears that commune ideologies reflect in extreme form ideas and accents <b>prevalant</b> within society. Because communes (or the absence of commune formation) can be more or less considered as corollaries of societal development, the emphasis differed from era to era. Up to the present time, as a consequence of the extremity of the underlying ideas, commune formation has remained a marginal phenomenon. The third and last question bears on what might be expected of commune formation in the future. Despite the fact that elements of speculation are unavoidable in predicting social phenomena, expectations for each type of commune have been formulated both as regards the ultimate chances of success and future numerical occurrences. In formulating the expectations the following three points were considered: the inner strenght of a commune type (mainly the character and strength of motivation); structural support and resistance existing in contemporary Western society; and the ideological basis of the commune type in relation to existing and changing values in that society. The cautious expectations formulated via these starting-points pertain to each of the types as such (the religious commune in its three different forms, the two types of the political commune, and the commune emphasizing the improvement of interpersonal relations). The final chapter gives a survey of the existing commune studies and recommendations for further research...|$|E

Denique ex analysi relationum Pastoralis etluris auctor infert insequentes conclusiones: 1) Actlo pastoralis ut sit vere actio aedificans Eccleslae, prlus debet esse actio iusta. 2) lus Canonicum, quod est tutela identitatis, unitatis ordinisque socia¡'¡s Ecoleslae, est suppositum et basis necessaria activitatis pastora lis. [...] Abstract lo explain the existing harmony between {{the legal and}} pastoral dimensions of the social reality of the Church is a difficult task, especially when. one takes into consideration the ambiguity of the term pastoral which, apart fron its technical significance, has been the object of tactical, vulgarized and equivocal use. In any case, the author not only shares the view that this term makes reference {{to the order of}} actions through whi. ch the Church finds its place in History by fulfilling its mission, but also accepts the most widely accepted meanings of the term: a) material meanings: pastoral action is synonymous with ecclesiastical o c:hristi. a. n ac:tion, ministerial or priestly actionand introductory or leading action. b) formal meanings: pastoral action is synonymous with efficacious action, an intermediary action between God and man, an action shaped by the condiyionings of the hie et nune and a planned action. Subsequently the importance of the meanings accepted in the historical and doctrinal evolution of pastoral lheology is analysed so as to detect what the conception of Canon Law, {{in the minds of the}} members of the pastorate, is. In order not to fall into «cientifismo. on analysing the. edifying actions of the Church., one has to start from the authentic nature of the pastorate, that ¡s, from the pastorate as a manifestation of the nature of the Church [...] . because it is in this way that the reality of the. pastoral» concept is found; thus the pastorate refers to the very and exclusive dynamics of the priestly ministry, in such a way that,Pastoral Theology ought to make itself, as far as science is concerned, into a reflection on. the ministerial actions of the priestly hierarchy». Nevertheless, as the term has today come to,be used as a purely scientific concept (and not as a concept per se), three orders of realities have c 1 early been distinguished to show that there is nonexus of efficient and formal causa lit y; the scientific order (pastoral theology), ontological and sacramental personal realities (pastorate) and the acquisition of the. salus animarum. (pastoral efficacy); but one conclusión is crystal clear: that in the transplantation of technical notions and methods of the profane sciences into the Church, the <b>prevalant</b> and absolute principie is the respect for the nature of the Church and the peculiar characteristics of her realities. With these explanations the point of convergente of the Pastora te and Canon Law Is delimited; the Canon Law is the nature of the Church, because pastorate and legality are dimensions of the only reaHty which is the Church, rather than separate realities. The real contribution of Law to the historical edification of the Church is the dimension of justic;e, which affects the entire -Mysterium Ecclesiae., so that it cannot be said that before the legis'lature of the human ecclesiastical Law there exists an cajuridical camp a priori.; likewise there doesn't exist an -adivine camp a priori.; and neither do the historica'l and concrete realities appear void of all norms and all exlgencies of justice. The author next writes about the hypertrophy which the term pastoral has undergone in the attempt to understand and solve all the facets of the mystery of the Church exolusively and solely under thls perspective; thls pastorate has led to confusion and the violation of the very formalities of other sciences among which Canon Law needs a special mentlon. Later on, the characteristic traits of the actual patarate are described: substitution of orthodoxy for orthopraxls, loss of clarity in the essential difference between the common priest and the ministerial prlest, hlstorlclty and sociology in the appreciation of the efficacy, In History, of the salvation found in the Church.,Finally, the author deduces the following conclusions, concerning the analysis of the relatlonship between Pastorate and Law: 1) in order that a pastoral action might be authentically an action which edifies the Church, It has to be a just action a priori. 2) Canon Law, as a guardianship of Identity, unity and social order of the Church, Is a necessary leit motiv of pastoral activity...|$|E
