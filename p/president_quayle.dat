2500|$|Throughout {{his time}} as vice <b>president,</b> <b>Quayle</b> was widely {{ridiculed}} {{in the media and}} by many in the general public, both in the U.S. and overseas, as an intellectual lightweight and generally incompetent. Contributing greatly to the perception of Quayle's incompetence was his tendency to make public statements that were either self-contradictory ("The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. ... No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history"), self-contradictory and confused ("I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future") or just confused (such as his address to the United Negro College Fund, whose slogan is [...] "A mind is a terrible thing to waste," [...] where he said [...] "You take the UNCF model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.") ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 16, 1988, at the Republican {{convention}} in New Orleans, Louisiana, George H. W. Bush chose Quayle {{to be his}} running mate in the 1988 United States presidential election. The choice immediately became controversial. Outgoing President Ronald Reagan praised Quayle for his [...] "energy and enthusiasm". Press coverage of the convention was dominated with questions about [...] "the three Quayle problems", in the phrase of Brent Baker, {{executive director of the}} Media Research Center, a conservative group that monitors television coverage. The questions involved his military service, a golf trip to Florida with Paula Parkinson, and whether he had enough experience to be vice <b>president.</b> <b>Quayle</b> seemed at times rattled and at other times uncertain or evasive as he tried to handle the questions. Delegates to the convention generally blamed television and newspapers for the focus on Quayle's problems, but Bush's staff said they thought Quayle had mishandled the questions about his military record, leaving questions dangling. Although Bush was trailing by up to 15 points in public opinion polls taken before the convention, in August, the Bush/Quayle ticket took the lead, which they did not relinquish {{for the rest of the}} campaign.|$|E

5000|$|Immersion journalism {{has been}} criticized for being too {{subjective}} and partial to the journalist's opinion.

50|$|On February 12, 1992, {{friction}} between the largely astronaut-based management at NASA and the National Space Council led to Richard Truly, then NASA Administrator and a former astronaut, being forced out. Truly was forced out after Vice <b>President</b> <b>Quayle</b> and the space council's executive director, Mark J. Albrecht, enlisted the aid of Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, in urging Pres. Bush to remove Truly.
