50|$|In {{addition}} to being a prolific deep water marine source rock (it has been called the world's largest oil source rock) the formation is believed to contain substantial reserves of tight oil. An estimate by Wood Mackenzie of the Bazhenov Formation puts oil in place at 2 trillion barrels. In 2013, the Russian oil company Rosneft estimated recoverable reserves of 22 billion barrels for the formation. The Russian government agency Rosnedra estimated in 2012 that the Bazhenov contained 180 to 360 billion barrels of recoverable reserves. According to U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates published in June 2013:For the total Bazhenov shale <b>prospective</b> <b>area</b> in the West Siberian Basin, we estimate a risked shale oil in-place of 1,243 billion barrels, with 74.6 billion barrels as the risked, technically recoverable shale oil resource....

30|$|Using {{statistical}} seismology, {{the possibility}} of applying the frequency-magnitude distribution (FMD; Gutenberg and Richter 1944) model as an earthquake precursor was demonstrated along the SASZ (e.g., Nuannin et al. 2005; Pailoplee and Choowong 2014). In particular, utilizing the 50 closest earthquakes in an individual site of interest, Nuannin et al. (2005) found that a low-FMD b-value was related to a high accumulated tectonic stress and so implied a <b>prospective</b> <b>area</b> of upcoming earthquakes. Thereafter, using Nuannin et al.’s (2005) assumption, the comparative low-FMD b-value areas along the northern segment of the SASZ were evaluated, revealing that (i) Sittwe city, western Myanmar, and (ii) offshore northern Nicobar Islands might be subject to strong-to-major earthquakes soon (Pailoplee et al. 2013). However, up to 2014, all the seismic risk areas mentioned above are still quiescent and so should be monitored carefully.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{paradigm}} of Granular Computing has quite recently {{emerged as an}} area of research on its own; in particular, t is pursued within rough set theory initiated by Zdzis̷law Pawlak. Granules of knowledge consist of entities with a similar in a sense information content. An idea of a granular counterpart to a decision/information system has been put forth, along with its consequence {{in the form of}} the hypothesis that various operators, aimed at dealing with information, should factorize sufficiently faithfully through granular structures [7], [8]. Most important such operators are algorithms for inducing classifiers. We show results of testing few well-known algorithms for classifier induction on well–used data sets from Irvine Repository in order to verify the hypothesis. The results confirm the hypothesis in case of selected representative algorithms and open a new <b>prospective</b> <b>area</b> of research...|$|E
