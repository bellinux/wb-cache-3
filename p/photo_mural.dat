He began by photographing San Francisco architecture, paintings, and sculptures before being made supervisor of the photographic department, which paid him ten more dollars a month than his previous position, totaling approximately $94 a month in income. He primarily photographed San Francisco homes and a selection were published in books and newspapers, exhibited at then San Francisco Museum of Art, and used in a <b>photo</b> <b>mural</b> co-designed by Abbenseth and Ben Cunningham for the San Francisco City Hall. Abbenseth also worked for the Index of American Design, documenting the architecture of and artwork within Spanish missions. He had an interest in film, and began to film his activities related to the Federal Art Project, documenting work by Sargent Johnson at Aquatic Park and the art of making stained glass, which was funded by the University of California. He also created a documentary about the San Francisco Housing Authority. During his involvement in the FAP he photographed artists such as Benny Bufano and Reuben Kadish. Abbenseth credited his work with the Federal Art Project as being an educational, which allowed him to work with and learn from the photographers of Group f/64 and filmmaker Ralph Steiner.|$|E

40|$|Excavation {{considers}} {{an imagined}} geography that is constructed from created or found objects pertinent {{to try and}} understanding one’s place in the world. The work originates from a melancholic mediation on memory; of gathering and appropriating images and artefacts to suggest an illusion that is determined by a desire for place. Bricked up doorways and windows in uninhabited spaces – appearing entirely two-dimensional – are the subjects of several photographs in the exhibition. These spaces resemble layers of strata in an archeological excavation: traces of concrete, crushed aggregate, tiles and evidence of chased services in masonry walls that look like suspended pieces of airborne rope. These black and white photographs are each photo-silkscreened with a surface image depicting a tarpaulin ‘portal’ using lustrous bronze ink. In this process the two things are compound: old and new, present and past, real and imagined. The life-size <b>photo</b> <b>mural,</b> Folly, 2014, depicts a stone wall in a type of tromp l’oeil. In a historical context mural wallpaper conventionally pictured luscious forest vistas and epic panoramas while this image gives a sense of space closing in on us. This work treats the prefabricated ruin {{as a catalyst for}} the psychological resonances implicit in architectural follies and ‘eye-catchers’ of classical structures. The illusionary power of the image behind which hidden readings and relationships are formed is central to the works in Excavation. Mirrored misalignments, structures collapsing away and into each other and photographic collages each allude to ways of thinking about illusion and perception – their content and materiality are used to articulate the relationship between physical and emotional experience...|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} this paper refers {{to a sense of}} being in drift. The French term à la dérive seemed {{appropriate}} to adopt because the work was conceived and made in France, and the meaning of it umbrellas the ideas I have attempted to explore in my MFA. à la dérive is comprised of two parts. Firstly, the paper presents an investigation of several ideas and concerns revolving around the broad notion of the concept 'place'. In this paper, the concept of 'place' addresses a physical definition of belonging that exists within a specific cultural framework. I discuss Marc Augé's theory of place in relation to Nikos Papastergiadis' idea of the absence of it through diaspora. Importantly the relevance of these ideas to my creative interests stem from my personal history and dual nationality (Polish-Australian) as well as the notion of absence and presence in the concept 'place'. Secondly, the paper then discusses these theories in relation to the various works I have produced over the past two and a half years, including photographs, <b>photo</b> <b>mural</b> installations, collected objects, prints and drawings. Here I refer directly to artists including Tacita Dean, Simryn Gill, Peter Bialobrzeski and Vittorio De Sica's Ladri di biciclette. These artists inspire and provoke me to consider why I make work, what influences have defined my practice and why I respond to particular places. It has been important to identify these interests in order to learn from what has always been an intuitive art making process. I am drawn to how each artist considers aspects of place, time, history, nostalgia and temporality. I conclude by discussing three projects that comprise my MFA practical work: Making Traces (2007), in (and against) time (2009) and à la dérive (2009) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, {{more so than}} at any other time, media {{transformed}} architecture. No architect employed media as extensively and as consciously as did Le Corbusier in the conveyance of a modern architecture, an architecture that ostensibly privileged structure, function and material. Yet in his hands the very act of mediation served to transform architecture, de-materializing it, and eventually leading to an architecture of illusion. As a Purist painter, he believed the goal of art to be the evocation of an elevated sensation. He achieved this goal through mathematical regulation of the canvas and its contents. Such ordering resulted in ambiguous and illusory visual space, space that had a physiological effect on the viewer. He 2 ̆ 7 applied 2 ̆ 7 this order to both his architecture and the image of his architecture. Photographs of buildings were made to conform to Purist vision, underscoring the illusion of representation and evoking in the 2 ̆ 7 reader 2 ̆ 7 a sensation parallel to that of an ordered architecture. Such representation offered Le Corbusier new space, and he strove to translate this into a three-dimensional architecture by making representation itself into architecture. With his <b>photo</b> <b>murals,</b> photographs became walls. With his exhibition pavilions, publicity became facades. An architecture of illusion evolved which valued phenomenal sensation over the 2 ̆ 7 thing 2 ̆ 7 itself. Such sensation became the essence of Le Corbusier 2 ̆ 7 s 1946 theory of architecture in which a synthesis of the arts would result in what he termed 2 ̆ 2 ineffable space, 2 ̆ 2 the 2 ̆ 7 four-dimensional 2 ̆ 7 equivalent of the sensation of illusion found in the Purist canvas. With illusion the basis of a new architecture, a dialectical relationship with material reality itself was established. In this way, representation served Le Corbusier not to record modern architecture, but to transform it, opening the door to an architecture antithetical to its principles. ...|$|R
