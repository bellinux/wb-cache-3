5|$|Long War is a <b>partial</b> <b>conversion</b> mod for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM: Enemy Within. It {{was first}} {{uploaded}} to NexusMods on 4 January 2013, and exited beta {{with the release}} of version 1.0 on 28 December 2015. The developers announced in July 2015 with beta 15f2 that they had finished adding new features, and that any future releases would only correct bugs or balance issues. At the time that it exited beta, the mod's development was led by four core members, JohnnyLump (John J. Lumpkin), Amineri (Rachel Norman), XMarksTheSpot, and Ellatan (Alex Rozenfeld). They were joined by four senior contributors, 20 voice actors, and 29 contributors assisting with programming, art, sound engineering, translations, research, and porting the mod to Mac and Linux. Three members of Firaxis Games also provided assistance. The team released separate versions for Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within until the end of 2013, and thereafter only released versions for Enemy Within. Long War has been downloaded from NexusMods over 900,000 times by over 333,000 separate users.|$|E
25|$|The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations {{have seen}} the fleet divided into three parts: the 'A' fleet of 16 Flexity 2 trams, fully {{compliant}} with the RVAR; the 'B' fleet of 9 converted double-deck trams that have partial exemption through <b>partial</b> <b>conversion</b> to improve accessibility; and the 'C' fleet, the exempt heritage fleet.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} this neglect, the Indian towns at San Juan Capistrano, San Dieguito, and Las Flores did {{continue}} {{on for some time}} under a provision in Governor Echeandía's 1826 Proclamation that allowed for the <b>partial</b> <b>conversion</b> of missions to new pueblos. After the secularizing of the Missions, many of the surviving Mission Indians switched from being unpaid workers for the missions to unpaid laborers and vaqueros (cowboys) of the about 500 large Californio owned ranchos.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{made its}} first hover on 16 November 1954. This was performed with the aircraft raised on a platform to avoid the reingestion of its exhaust gases. Wheeled landing gear - from a Cessna - {{was added to the}} aircraft, which went on to make horizontal flights in 1955. It proved able to make <b>partial</b> <b>conversions</b> at altitude, however it lacked sufficient engine thrust to complete the transition.|$|R
50|$|A WAD {{that gives}} the game an {{overhaul}} to incorporate an entirely different game setting, character set, and story, instead of simply providing new levels or graphic changes, is called a total conversion. The phrase was coined by Justin Fisher, {{as part of the}} title of Aliens TC, or Aliens Total Conversion. Add-ons that provide extensive changes to a similar degree but retain distinctive parts or characteristics of the original games, such as characters or weapons, are often by extension called <b>partial</b> <b>conversions.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{study by}} x-ray {{diffraction}} and optical microscopy the photoswitching, initiated {{by a single}} ns laser pulse, of the spin-crossover {Fe II (pz) [Pt(CN) 4]} material inside its thermal hysteresis. The single-crystal study shows that a complete conversion from low spin to high spin states can be reached with a single laser shot. <b>Partial</b> <b>conversions</b> obtained with weaker laser energy gives rise to HS domains. Our {{results indicate that the}} non-linear response to light excitation is mainly driven by the temperature jump of the crystal following laser excitation...|$|R
25|$|Shared space schemes {{extend this}} {{principle}} further {{by removing the}} reliance on lane markings altogether, and also removing road signs and signals, allowing all road users to use {{any part of the}} road, and giving all road users equal priority and equal responsibility for each other's safety. Experiences where these schemes are in use show that road users, particularly motorists, undirected by signs, kerbs, or road markings, reduce their speed and establish eye contact with other users. Results from the thousands of such implementations worldwide all show casualty reductions and most also show reduced journey times. After the <b>partial</b> <b>conversion</b> of London's Kensington High Street to shared space, accidents decreased by 44% (the London average was 17%).|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} this neglect, the Indian towns at San Juan Capistrano, San Dieguito, and Las Flores did {{continue}} {{on for some time}} under a provision in Gobernador Echeandía's 1826 Proclamation that allowed for the <b>partial</b> <b>conversion</b> of missions to pueblos. According to one estimate, the native population in and around the missions proper was approximately 80,000 {{at the time of the}} confiscation; others claim that the statewide population had dwindled to approximately 100,000 by the early 1840s, due in no small part to the natives' exposure to European diseases, and from the Franciscan practice of cloistering women in the convento and controlling sexuality during the child-bearing age. (Baja California Territory experienced a similar reduction in native population resulting from Spanish colonization efforts there).|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{suggest the}} start and {{widespread}} acceptance of FGM in Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, undermines the argument that female circumcision is purely a pre-Islamic custom, or the theory that religion never introduced this practice. Buddhism and Hinduism were the predominant religions in Southeast Asia {{before the arrival of}} Islam; male as well as female genital mutilation is prohibited in its religious beliefs. Islam introduced FGM into Indonesia and Malaysia from the 13th century as part of its drive to convert people to Islam. Populations in some islands of Indonesia underwent only <b>partial</b> <b>conversion</b> to Islam in the 17th century. In these islands, only Muslim females are circumcised. Even in modern times, some in Indonesia refer to FGM as an 'Arab custom'.|$|E
50|$|Wisdom Tree's titles {{always had}} a Christian theme to them, and were often sold in Christian bookstores and the like. Most games {{attempted}} to use the medium to tell Bible stories {{in such a way}} as to make them interesting to children of the video game era. Interestingly, many of their games were <b>partial</b> <b>conversions</b> of titles previously released by Color Dreams, with appropriate changes in theme. A Wisdom Tree product catalog shows screenshots from Joshua & The Battle of Jericho displaying a side-scrolling game using the Bible Adventures engine. The actual released game used the Crystal Mines/Exodus engine.|$|R
50|$|As fuel {{subsidies}} were gradually {{removed in}} Malaysia starting June 5, 2008, the subsequent 41 percent price hike on {{petrol and diesel}} led to a 500 {{percent increase in the}} number of new CNG tanks installed. National car maker Proton considered fitting its Waja, Saga and Persona models with CNG kits from Prins Autogassystemen by the end of 2008, while a local distributor of locally assembled Hyundai cars offers new models with CNG kits. Conversion centres, which also benefited from the rush for lower running costs, also perform <b>partial</b> <b>conversions</b> to existing road vehicles, allowing them to run on both petrol or diesel and CNG with a cost varying between RM3,500 to RM5,000 for passenger cars.|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} {{exerted by}} a large city determines non-agricultural forms of land use in areas situated in its neighbourhood. Among the most alarming consequences of urban sprawl onto the surrounding areas are a steady and irreversible shrinkage of farmland and conflicts resulting from a mix of functions performed by the areas. This article describes the dynamics, scale and spatial differences {{of the process of}} taking agricultural land out of production in the Poznań agglomeration in the 21 st century in terms of changes in the land-use pattern. In characterising the converted land, it also presents chief directions of its transformation, the regulations in force, and the resultant lack of full information about factual, and not only <b>partial,</b> <b>conversions...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{conversion}} proposal—which {{would have}} involved a continuous tunnel running from Lake Street station in Brighton to Maverick Square in East Boston, plus a second through route from Lechmere to Tremont Street in Roxbury—was never implemented {{except for the}} partial completion of the Huntington Avenue Subway in 1941. However, {{many of the other}} extension proposals were partially or wholly completed, {{with the opening of the}} Blue Line to Wonderland in 1954, the Highland Branch conversion to light rail in 1959, the <b>partial</b> <b>conversion</b> of the Reading Hill Line to the Haymarket North Extension in 1977, the extension of the Red Line to Braintree in 1980, and the relocation of the Orange Line to the Southwest Corridor in 1987. Two additional projects were considered in the report but not recommended for immediate work: a circumferential route which would reappear years later as the Urban Ring, and an extension of Tremont Street Subway through service from Lechmere to Woburn via the Lowell Line.|$|E

[...] Ruminants, which may digest cellulose, are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high-quality protein if supplied in excess. Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive (see also Environmental impact below), several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of feed with formalin to protect amino acids during their passage through the rumen, the recycling of manure by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates, or the <b>partial</b> <b>conversion</b> of petroleum hydrocarbons to protein through microbial action.|$|E
60|$|Similar to {{the traditions}} of the Icelanders, are those current among the Laplanders of Finland, {{concerning}} a subterranean people, gifted with' supernatural qualities, and inhabiting the recesses of the earth. Resembling men in their general appearance, the manner of their existence, and their habits of life, they far excel the miserable Laplanders in perfection of nature, felicity of situation, and skill in mechanical arts. From all these advantages, however, after the <b>partial</b> <b>conversion</b> of the Laplanders, the subterranean people have derived no farther credit, than to be confounded with the devils and magicians of the dark ages of Christianity; a degradation which, as will shortly be demonstrated, has been also suffered by the harmless Fairies of Albion, and indeed by the whole host of deities of learned Greece and mighty Rome. The ancient opinions are yet so firmly rooted, that the Laps of Finland, at this day, boast of an intercourse with these beings, in banquets, dances, and magical ceremonies, and even in the more intimate commerce of gallantry. They talk, with triumph, of the feasts which they have shared in the elfin caverns, where wine and tobacco, the productions of the Fairy region, went round in abundance, and whence the mortal guest, after receiving the kindest treatment and the most salutary counsel, has been conducted to his tent by an escort of his supernatural entertainers.--Jessens, de Lapponibus.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel 10 -bit A/D {{converter}} {{based on}} a pipeline-like architecture specific for low-noise, self-triggered sensors, (e. g., X-rays and-rays spectrometry) is presented. The main innovative feature of the proposed A/D structure is the concept that, for a sampled input signal, a pipeline ADC may behave as a combinatorial logic and may operate without any timing signal (clock). The conversion is obtained asynchronously propagating the <b>partial</b> <b>conversions</b> and the residues through the various stages. This concept is validated {{by means of a}} prototype ADC fabricated in a standard 0. 35 m CMOS technology. The active area is 2. 24 mm, and it provides a conversion in 2. 5 s (i. e., it can operate with a 400 kS/s data rate) featuring an ENOB equal to 8. 91.

Since the enzyme affinity for this second substrate {{is greater than}} for the monoepoxy (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, under <b>partial</b> inhibition <b>conversion</b> of 2,3;22,23-diepoxysqualene to 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol is favored over lanosterol synthesis.
