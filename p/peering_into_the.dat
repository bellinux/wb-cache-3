25|$|According {{to friends}} and neighbors of Zimmerman, three weeks prior to the {{shooting}} on February 2, Zimmerman called police to report a young man <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> windows of an empty Twin Lakes home. By the time police arrived, the suspect had fled. On February 6, workers witnessed two young black men lingering in the yard of a Twin Lakes resident {{around the same time}} a new laptop and some gold jewelry was stolen from her home. The next day police discovered the stolen laptop in the backpack of a young black man whom Zimmerman identified as the same person he had spotted peering into windows on February 2.|$|E
500|$|Astronomers in the 1970s {{saw some}} major {{advances}} in astronomical imaging technology beginning with Antoine Labeyrie's invention of speckle interferometry, {{a process that}} significantly reduced the blurring effect caused by astronomical seeing. It increased the optical resolution of ground-based telescopes, allowing for more precise measurements of Betelgeuse's photosphere. With improvements in infrared telescopy atop Mount Wilson, Mount Locke and Mauna Kea in Hawaii, astrophysicists began <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> complex circumstellar shells surrounding the supergiant, causing them to suspect the presence of huge gas bubbles resulting from convection. [...] But {{it was not until}} the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Betelgeuse became a regular target for aperture masking interferometry, that breakthroughs occurred in visible-light and infrared imaging. Pioneered by John E. Baldwin and colleagues of the Cavendish Astrophysics Group, the new technique employed a small mask with several holes in the telescope pupil plane, converting the aperture into an ad-hoc interferometric array. [...] The technique contributed some of the most accurate measurements of Betelgeuse while revealing bright spots on the star's photosphere. These were the first optical and infrared images of a stellar disk other than the Sun, taken first from ground-based interferometers and later from higher-resolution observations of the COAST telescope. The [...] "bright patches" [...] or [...] "hotspots" [...] observed with these instruments appeared to corroborate a theory put forth by Schwarzschild decades earlier of massive convection cells dominating the stellar surface.|$|E

2500|$|The novel opens by a {{conversation}} between two eminent physicians in an insane asylum. A beautiful woman had {{attracted the attention of}} the visiting physician. The strange story of her life is given in succeeding chapters, carrying the reader from story to philosophy, from pure description to metaphysical speculation without any break in continuity of thought. The story is not startling, and it has few strong dramatic passages. By stages, the reader is carried from the world of the physical into the realm of dreams. At one moment, he is with Mr. and Mrs. Varien; the next, he finds himself <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> beyond, gazing through the entranced vision of Mrs. Varien on the daily life of the little child which died when only three years old. The life story of Mrs. Varien is set as an odd tale. During the day, she is the same as other people, while at night, for 15 years, she is entranced, and her soul dwells with her child. In this other world, many life mysteries are explained. Many passages, especially the utterances of the mystic master, resemble prose poems. The chapters which aid in forming a conception of the character of the work include: “Doctors Agree,” “She Dreamed a Dream,” “The Dream World,” “The Beginning of the End,” “Science Fails,” “The Watch,” “The Voice of the Master,” “A Star Was Shining,” “A Strange Quest,” “The Gates Are Passed,” “A Successful Experiment,” “Such is the Law,” “Whom God Hath Joined,” “For all Eternity,” “An Innumerable Company.” ...|$|E
