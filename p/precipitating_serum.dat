He was managed with intravenous insulin and fluids and later shifted to basal bolus insulin regimen and during further evaluation was diagnosed to be suffering from primary hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency. He was started on thyroxin replacement and steroids only during stress. After three months of follow up he was clinically euthyroid. His glycemic control was adequate on oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs and adrenal insufficiency recovered. However, his thyrotropin levels were persistently elevated on adequate replacement doses of thyroxin.

40|$|A {{new group}} of {{synthetic}} random polymers of α-L-amino acids has been studied for immunogenicity. With the glutamic acid and alanine copolymers, those consisting of almost equimolar amounts of the two (G 60 A 40 and G 40 A 60) were effective antigens in rabbits whereas those with higher glutamic acid contents (G 75 A 25, G 90 A 10) were poor antigens. The substitution of alanine by valine or leucine (G 75 V 25 and G 80 Leu 20) produced copolymers which were poor antigens in rabbits but effective in guinea pigs. L 70 A 30, although capable of "non-specifically" <b>precipitating</b> <b>serum</b> proteins, was shown not to be antigenic in either rabbits or guinea pigs. The introduction of alanine into glutamic acid and lysine polymers (GLA series) enhanced the immunogenicity of the terpolymers, i. e., GLA 30 > GLA 20 > GLA 10 > GL. The mechanism by which this may be accomplished is discussed as possibly being related to {{the reduction of the}} interactions between glutamyl and lysyl residues which allows the carboxyl groups to act as strong immunogenic determinants...|$|E

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a syndrome seen in patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis, and is characterized by hypersensitivity to chronic colonization of the airways with A. fumigatus. We report the case of a patient with ABPA presenting with pleural effusion. A 27 -year-old male was referred with recurrent right pleural effusion. Past medical history was remarkable for asthma, allergic sinusitis, and recurrent pleurisy. Investigations revealed peripheral eosinophilia with elevated serum immunoglobulin E and bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral upper lobe proximal bronchiectasis. <b>Precipitating</b> <b>serum</b> antibodies to A. fumigatus were positive and the A. fumigatus immediate skin test yielded a positive reaction.

ABPA may present with diverse atypical syndromes, including paratracheal and hilar adenopathy, obstructive lung collapse, pneumothorax and bronchopleural fistula, and allergic sinusitis.

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{to be described}} were {{carried out in the}} attempt to distinguish by serological methods the pepsins from several different animal species, as well as to compare the serological behavior of pepsin and its precursor, pepsinogen. The concept of organ specificity was established by Uhlenhuth (1) who showed that the lens protein of one species would give rise to antibodies having no relation to the serum proteins of the same species, although these antibodies would react with lens proteins from unrelated species. Enzyme proteins {{have been shown to be}} antigenic. Sumner and Kirk (2, 3) were able to produce a <b>precipitating</b> <b>serum</b> with crystalline urease, and to demonstrate the protective effect of such antibodies against the toxicity of the enzyme in ~vo. Although the antiure~se would completely remove the urease from solution, the resulting precipitate apparently retained most of its activity. Northrop (4) found that crystalline swine pepsin protein gave rise to pepsin precipitating antibodies. By means of the Dale technique, TenBroeck (5) was able to differentiate pig and beef trypsin, as well as chymotrypsin and its precursor, chymotrypsinogen, each /) f which had been purified by five crystallizations. l~epsin presents a special problem since, according to Northrop (4), it is inactivated above pH 6; as a more alkaline condition is approached the enzyme is converted into a typical denatured protein. At 37 °C. and pH 7. 6, almost all of the pepsin is inactivated or denatured immediately, and on being returned to pH 2 - 3, the denatured pepsin precipitates. It is therefore most likely that active pepsin cannot exist in the body fluids, and that inactive, denatured pepsin is responsible for antibodies developed following the injection of active pepsin. Northrop (4) and Kirk and Sumner (3) have commented on this likelihood, and it must be borne in mind in the interpretation of these experiments, since the denaturation of a protein may produce a new specificity very different from that of the original native protein (8 - 11) ...|$|E
40|$|A commercially {{available}} phytohaemagglutinin derived from Phaseolus vulgaris (PHAP) {{was subjected to}} CM Sephadex and Sephadex G- 150 chromatography. Two major mitogenic fractions were isolated; one (L-PHAP), appeared homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and was virtually lacking in haemagglutinating activity, while the other (H-PHAP) was a potent haemagglutinin. H-PHAP was a complex material as shown by its behaviour on CM Sephadex chromatography. Electrophoretic analysis revealed three distinct bands of protein, all migrating cathodally to L-PHAP. With increasing cathodal mobility H-PHAP subfractions showed diminishing mitogenicity, increasing haemagglutinating potency, {{and the appearance of}} the ability to <b>precipitate</b> <b>serum</b> proteins non-specifically.

In order to determine whether these complexes contain parasite antigens, sera were collected from Brazilian patients with visceral leishmaniasis and from hospitalized control subjects with other diagnoses. High-molecular-weight complexes were precipitated from pooled sera with 2. 5 % polyethylene glycol. Approximately 140 -fold-more protein was precipitated from patient sera than from control sera; 12 % of the total patient <b>serum</b> protein was <b>precipitated.</b> Patient <b>serum</b> <b>precipitates</b> contained immunoglobulins G (525 mg/dl), M (27 mg/dl), and A (8 mg/dl). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the patient <b>serum</b> <b>precipitates</b> revealed multiple bands, including a prominent band at 70 kilodaltons, that were not seen in precipitates of control sera. The 70 -kilodalton band was recognized by human and hamster sera with antileishmanial antibodies, but not by control sera. Finally, immunization of BALB/c mice with the high-molecular-weight precipitates from patients elicited antileishmanial antibodies against L. donovani chagasi antigens as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot (immunoblot) assay.

Unashed iodide standards are used in a sodium carbonate solution rather than an internal standard. A temperature-correction formula is employed to allow the ceric-arsenite-iodide reaction {{to be carried out}} at room temperature, and a stable cerate color is producedwith brucine sulfate so that the colorimetry is carried out with greater convenience. The serum PBI concentrations are read directly from a graph, which simplifies the calculations.

Although most of the commonly employed methods for this deter-mination are considered to be accurate and reproducible, they are not completely satisfactory for busy clinical and research labora-tories because they are time consuming and require constant atten-tion by the analyst. In this laboratory, several published methods were tried. The method of Barker et at.

40|$|AbstractThe {{conformational}} {{nature of}} the B cell epitopes on the hepadnavirus surface antigens makes its characterization difficult. Here, a new approach by DNA vaccination with plasmids expressing chimeric hepadnavirus surface antigens was explored to determine B cell epitopes on the surface antigens of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHsAg). A series of chimeric genes consisting of complementary fragments of WHsAg and hepatitis B virus surface antigens (HBsAg) was constructed. These plasmids expressed the following: (i) middle chimeric surface antigens (MCSAgs), including pre-S 2 region and small surface antigens; (ii) small chimeric surface antigens (CSAgs); (iii) a mutated WHsAg with two amino acid substitutions, the Leu 136 to Thr and Ala 140 to Asp, within the central immunogenic region. The mutated region from amino acid 135 to 143 within WHsAg mimics the second loop of the HBsAg a-determinant. MCSAgs and CSAgs were expressed in transiently transfected mammalian cells and were reactive to anti-HBsAg and anti-WHsAg, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence staining and ELISA. Vaccination with plasmids encoding MCSAgs induced strong antibody responses to the pre-S 2 region. Anti-pre-S 2 antibodies were directed to a linear, immunodominant region within the amino-terminal region of the pre-S 2 region {{and were able to}} <b>precipitate</b> <b>serum</b> WHsAg. Vaccinations with the plasmids expressing the CSAgs led to the conclusion that an extended region aa 116 – 169 of WHsAg, analogous to the HBsAg a-determinant, was sufficient for the induction of anti-WHsAg antibodies. The mutated WHsAg with the second loop of the HBsAg a-determinant efficiently induced anti-WHsAg antibodies, but also a low titer of anti-HBsAg. Thus, multiple B cell epitopes of a linear and conformational nature are present on WHsAg.

Here we report that serum specimens obtained from patients with chlamydiosis contain elementary bodies of C. trachomatis shown by culture and immunogold electron microscopy. We have found that 31 of the 52 patients had <b>serum</b> <b>precipitates</b> which were infective to McCoy cells. Immunostaining revealed very small inclusions resembling those reported during persistent C. trachomatis infection in vitro. DNA specimens from 49 (out of 52) patients with chlamydiosis gave positive PCR readings. The viability of the pathogen present in the sera was confirmed by chlamydial RNA detection in the cell monolayer inoculated by the <b>serum</b> <b>precipitates.</b> By using DNA isolation protocol from 1 [*]mL of serum and quantitative TaqMan PCR, it was estimated that bacterial load in patients’ sera was 2 × 102 – 103 [*]GE/mL. These findings for the first time demonstrated that C. trachomatis can be disseminated directly by the plasma, independently from blood cell, which may represent a new possible pathway of the chronic infection development. Therefore, new methodological approaches for detection of C. trachomatis in the serum of patients with complicated and chronic chlamydiosis could be important in the diagnosis of the infection regardless of its anatomical localization...|$|R
40|$|Circulating M antigen (CMA) of Schistosoma mansoni {{was found}} in the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) soluble {{fraction}} of a polyethylene glycol <b>precipitate</b> of <b>serum</b> from infected hamsters. It was also found as a TCA-soluble component in an immunoglobulin-containing fraction eluted from infected hamster kidneys. It was not found in similarly treated control sera nor in the products of acid dissociation of circulating immune complexes (CIC) from infected hamster sera. CMA was not detected in the kidneys of normal hamsters. Precipitating anti-M antigen antibodies were present in one of 10 sera from infected hamsters, but not in the eluates of hamster kidneys. These results indicate that CMA is present in circulating immune complexes in infected hamsters. The presence of CMA in kidneys from the same hamsters suggests a possible role for circulating antigens in immune-complexed form in the aetiology of glomerulonephritis in S. mansoni infection.

40|$|The Arthus {{reaction}} was studied in guinea pigs passively immunized with human diphtheria antitoxin. Diphtheria toxoid was given intradermally 24 hours following the intravenous administration of antitoxin {{and the subsequent}} reactions were graded and measured. The intensity of Arthus reactions was dependent upon the relative amounts of precipitating antitoxin and toxoid used. Severe lesions were caused by intravenous sensitization with 0. 48 mg. precipitating antitoxin N and intradermal challenge with 0. 05 or 0. 17 toxoid N. Reactions of lesser intensity were caused by smaller amounts of antitoxin and toxoid. The nature of the antibody used for sensitization was of importance in the severity of Arthus reactions. In contrast to the behavior of precipitating antitoxin, amounts of non-precipitating antitoxin equivalent to 0. 48 mg. N did not cause severe Arthus reactions when 0. 05 or 0. 17 mg. toxoid N was given intradermally. <b>Precipitating</b> antitoxic whole <b>serum</b> is altered by heating at 56 °C. for 5 hours so that its precipitability is lost without any appreciable loss of antitoxic strength. This modified antitoxin produced Arthus reactions of only intermediate severity in guinea pigs sensitized with 0. 48 mg. antitoxin N. When fractions of <b>precipitating</b> antitoxic <b>serum</b> were obtained using a cold ethanol technique described by Deutsch (16), a mixture of the purified γ 2 -globulin and the crude albumin fraction heated together at 56 °C. for 5 hours behaved similarly to whole serum. However, γ 2 -globulin alone was not affected by the heating procedure, remained precipitable by toxoid, {{and was able to}} cause a severe Arthus reaction following sensitization with 0. 48 mg. antitoxin N...|$|R
