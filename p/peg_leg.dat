500|$|On Stranger Tides {{employed}} 1,112 {{shots of}} computer-generated imagery, which were done by ten visual effects companies. Cinesite visual effects supervisor Simon Stanley-Clamp {{claimed that the}} most difficult part was doing the effects in 3D: [...] "Rotoscoping is tricky. Cleaning up plates is double the work, and tracking has to be spot on." [...] The lead companies, with over 300 effects each, were Industrial Light & Magic—responsible for, among others, the mermaids and most water effects—and Moving Picture Company, who created digital ships and environment extensions, such as changing weather and designing cliffs and waterfalls. Filming the mermaids involved eight model-actresses, who portrayed them outside the water, as well as 22 synchronized swimming athletes and a group of stuntwomen, both of whom wore motion capture suits to be later replaced by digital mermaids. Mermaid corpses were depicted by plaster models. The design tried to avoid the traditional representations of mermaids in paintings and literature, instead going for a scaly body with a translucent membrane inspired by both jellyfish and the fabric employed in ballet tutus. To make the mermaids more menacing underwater, the faces of the actresses had some digital touch-ups on the underwater scenes, adding sharper teeth and a shimmery fish scale quality on the skin. ILM also handled Blackbeard's death, where Ian McShane's actual performance was covered by digital doubles which turned him into a [...] "boiling mass of blood and clothing", and a hurricane-like formation that represented [...] "the waters of the Fountain taking his life". Cinesite handled the recreation of London and Barbossa's <b>peg</b> <b>leg,</b> CIS Hollywood did 3D corrections and minor shots, and Method Studios created matte paintings.|$|E
2500|$|Hoskins {{refused to}} allow his wound to force his {{premature}} exit from the Navy, asserting his fitness to visiting friend Admiral William Halsey: [...] "... the Navy doesn't expect a man to think with his feet. That blast didn't knock off my head." [...] Recovering in the Naval Hospital Philadelphia, Hoskins's rank allowed him to choose the location of his hospital bed, which he selected for its view of the naval shipyard where the next [...] was being laid down. While rehabilitating, he received both the Purple Heart and Navy Cross for his actions aboard Princeton. Fitted with a prosthetic foot, Hoskins started a vigorous exercise program, including paying visits to the shipyard to oversee construction of the new Essex-class carrier. When Princeton was commissioned in November 1945, Hoskins became her first commanding officer. A year later, {{he was promoted to}} rear admiral and given command of Carrier Division Seventeen. Air Group 81, formerly from Princeton, asked Walt Disney to design a mascot patch, [...] "a saber-slinging pirate with an aircraft carrier under one arm and a <b>peg</b> <b>leg</b> firing ammunition like a machine gun", and were for a time known as Peg-Leg Petes.|$|E

When a bat with a crippled wing and <b>peg</b> <b>leg</b> bursts into the family's workshop, he kidnaps Hiram. Olivia searches {{to find the}} famed Great Mouse Detective named Basil of Baker Street, but gets lost. A surgeon named Dr. David Q. Dawson, who returned from a lengthy service of the Mouse Queen's 66th Regiment in Afghanistan, meets Olivia, and escorts her to Basil's house. Upon their arrival at his residence, Basil is initially indifferent, but when Olivia mentions the peg-legged bat that kidnapped her father, Basil realizes that Olivia saw Fidget, a henchman of Professor Ratigan, a villain Basil attempted to arrest for years. It is then revealed that Ratigan kidnapped Hiram to create a clockwork robot, which mimics the Queen of the Mice so Ratigan can rule England. Hiram initially refuses {{to participate in the}} scheme, but gives in when Ratigan threatens to harm Olivia.

The Pirates are led by a man with no eyes, two hooks for hands and two <b>peg</b> <b>legs.</b> Pilgrim befriends Billy Shepard, a young boy who keeps a diary and sticks up for him. Most of the refugees do not trust Pilgrim, as their numbers keep dwindling and, according to a few, his stories do not make sense. Eventually, Pilgrim leads them in a climactic battle, revealing that he had knowingly used the refugees as bait to lure the pirates into a trap. The battle annihilates both the refugees and the pirates, and leaves Pilgrim the only survivor.|$|R

5000|$|A prinny is a small, usually blue, pouch-wearing penguin-like {{creature}} with disproportionately small bat wings, two <b>peg</b> <b>legs</b> where feet {{would normally be}} and stitches next to the mouth. When thrown, they explode on impact. A common trait of prinnies is their upbeat attitude and frequent {{use of the word}} [...] "dood" [...] as an interjection. They constantly end their sentences with [...] "-ssu" [...] in the Japanese game versions' dialogue. Prinnies stand roughly three feet, three inches (100 cm) tall, though the weight can vary. Prinnies attack with knives, bombs, and occasionally other weapons stored in their bags. While rarely mentioned in the game, prinnies have been known to dispense a beverage known as prinny juice, which according to a Nippon Ichi Software America interview is produced from [...] "the most flavorful and delicious parts of our fresh, vine-grown Prinnies".|$|R
2500|$|In English-speaking popular culture, {{the modern}} pirate {{stereotype}} owes its attributes {{mostly to the}} imagined tradition of the 18th century Caribbean pirate sailing off the Spanish Main and to such celebrated 20th century depictions as Captain Hook and his crew in the theatrical and film versions of Peter Pan, Robert Newton's portrayal of Long John Silver in the 1950 film of Treasure Island, and various adaptations of the Eastern pirate, Sinbad the Sailor. In these and countless other books, movies, and legends, pirates are portrayed as [...] "swashbucklers" [...] and [...] "plunderers." [...] They are shown on ships, often wearing eyepatches or <b>peg</b> <b>legs,</b> having a parrot perched on their shoulder, and saying phrases like [...] "Arr, matey" [...] and [...] "Avast, me hearty." [...] Pirates have retained their image through pirate-themed tourist attractions, traditional film and toy portrayals of pirates, and the continued performance and reading of books and plays featuring pirates.|$|R

5000|$|Prinnies (Purini) {{are common}} servants, {{and one of}} the protagonists as well as enemies in the series. They {{resemble}} small pouch-wearing penguins with disproportionately small bat wings and two <b>peg</b> <b>legs</b> for feet. Their personalities are upbeat, and they are required to use the word [...] "dood" [...] {{at the end of their}} sentences to signify their status ("-ssu" [...] in the Japanese dialogue). While Prinnies use machetes as their primary weapons, they are also able to use [...] "Prinny Bombs" [...] from their pouch and fire a laser called the [...] "Pringer Beam". They are created when a human who has led a worthless life or committed a mortal sin in life dies, leading to the soul being sewn into the body of a Prinny. After being reborn, they serve as maids and domestic servants in Celestia, where their good deeds lead to their reincarnation, or as servants and slaves (and sometimes cannon fodder) in the Netherworld, where they obtain money towards their reincarnation, often under lords who treat them horribly for little pay.|$|R
40|$|In most {{developing}} countries, {{the physically}} handicapped often have rehabilitation setbacks such as unavailability of modern rehabilitative aids which {{may result in}} non-achievement of the desired goals in activities of daily living. Children with poliomyelitis, hemiplegics, amputees and paraplegics top the list of patients requiring rehabilitation at University College Hospital, Ibadan. The amputees depend on wooden <b>peg</b> <b>legs</b> or pylons made by the occupational therapy department since modular and P. T. B. prostheses are presently not available in this hospital. Physiotherapists, therefore, encounter problems in teaching correct patterns of walking and other functional activities to the above-knee amputee because knee joints are absent. Rural amputee farmers use pylons as they can wade through water and mud with them. Calipers, toe raising devices, knee cages and spinal supports are required by 75 % of the 300 children with poliomyelitis {{and some of the}} paraplegics receiving physiotherapy in this hospital. Due to lack of imported parts, materials and experienced personnel, it has not been possible to meet the required demands. The occupational therapy department, as well as indigenous shoe maken and uon welders, rescue the situation as much as possible. Similarly, cervical collars are made from PVC buckets. It is therefore necessary that research on the use of local materials for prostheses and orthoses be canied out. Difficulties encountered with imported parts and materials will be removed to the advantage of patients. All cones ondence to be addressed to Mr. T...|$|R

5000|$|Vowels are {{commonly}} accentuated and pronounced for longer. The 'a' for example, is pronounced [...] "aa" [...] rather than [...] "ah" [...] {{which gives the}} accent a slow, soft sound.The 'ea' sound in some words, such as bean, clean, lean and mead, is voiced as a diphthong {{but this is not}} always the case, bead, meat, read keep the single syllable sound but use the short 'e' sound between the 'ee' in meet and the 'a' in mate. The words head and lead, pronounced hed and led in standard English, also use this 'e' sound. Words containing the 'a' sound as in lame, are generally spoken with the 'ea' diphthong. Words such as bake,cake, late and lane for example, employ the same vowel sound as meat. The standard English 'e' in words such as beg, <b>leg,</b> <b>peg,</b> are given the short 'a' sound to become bag, lag and pag. Egg thus becomes agg which gives rise to the Dorset dialect word for egg collecting, 'aggy'. When 'a' precedes a vocalised 'r', as in arm, charm and garden, the 'ah' sound is pronounced as somewhere between the 'ee' in meet and the 'a' in father. The short 'u' sound in words such as dust, crust and rut is usually pronounced in the Dorset dialect as a 'o' and 'oo' diphthong or an 'ow' to make dowst, crowst and rowt.|$|R

And the great black horse with the round red spots all over him--the horse that I could even get upon--I never {{wondered what}} had brought him to that strange condition, or thought that such a horse was not commonly seen at Newmarket. The four horses of no colour, next to him, {{that went into the}} waggon of cheeses, and could be taken out and stabled under the piano, appear to have bits of fur-tippet for their tails, and other bits for their manes, and to stand on <b>pegs</b> instead of <b>legs,</b> but it was not so when they were brought home for a Christmas present. They were all right, then; neither was their harness unceremoniously nailed into their chests, as appears to be the case now. The tinkling works of the music- cart, I DID find out, to be made of quill tooth-picks and wire; and I always thought that little tumbler in his shirt sleeves, perpetually swarming up one side of a wooden frame, and coming down, head foremost, on the other, rather a weak-minded person--though good-natured; but the Jacob's Ladder, next him, made of little squares of red wood, that went flapping and clattering over one another, each developing a different picture, and the whole enlivened by small bells, was a mighty marvel and a great delight.|$|R
