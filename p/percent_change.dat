25|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{variable}} climatic regimes across the Great Plains, {{many aspects of}} climate change {{are not expected to}} affect all areas of the ecoregion equally. In regards to precipitation, this means an exacerbation of extremes where dry areas in the south are expected to get drier and wetter areas in the north to get wetter. In turn this will increase the intensity of already problematic droughts across the region as well as creating the potential for flooding in the wetter north. The <b>percent</b> <b>change</b> in precipitation for both areas is dependent upon different emission scenarios; with higher emission levels in the future being conducive to greater extremes. Dramatic increases in average annual temperature are also expected, with average winter temperatures already having risen 7°F in the past 30 years. These increased temperatures are expected to cause warmer winters with warmer springs as well as hotter summers in the south-central plains.|$|E

This study examined whether the representative bone absorption marker serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 b (TRACP- 5 b) or bone formation marker bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) could estimate primary OP status and denosumab efficacy in a real-world setting. We retrospectively enrolled 114 female postmenopausal primary OP patients in Japan. Values and <b>percent</b> <b>changes</b> in TRACP- 5 b, BAP, lumbar 1 – 4 bone mineral density (L-BMD), and total hip BMD (H-BMD) were assessed before treatment and at 4, 8, and 12  months of therapy to identify the correlations between the <b>percent</b> <b>changes</b> in bone metabolic markers and BMD. We also established two sets of subgroups based on the upper limits of reference values in Japan for serum: TRACP- 5 b (< 420  mU/dL) and (≥ 420 mU/dL) and BAP (< 14. 5 µg/L) and (≥ 14. 5 µg/L). Negative correlations were observed for the <b>percent</b> <b>changes</b> of TRACP- 5 b and H-BMD at 4 months (r=– 0. 3476) and 8 months (r=– 0. 3880), for the <b>percent</b> <b>changes</b> of BAP and H-BMD at 8 months (r=– 0. 3354), and for the <b>percent</b> <b>changes</b> of BAP and L-BMD at 12  months (r=– 0. 3186). We observed {{a significant difference between the}} subgroups for the <b>percent</b> <b>changes</b> of L-BMD at 8 months (p= 0. 013) and 12  months (p= 0. 004) in BAP values. These results suggest that TRACP- 5 b and BAP had negative correlations with BMD, and that BAP represented a useful serum marker to evaluate L-BMD during denosumab therapy for OP.

25|$|Mercury's {{equatorial}} plane is inclined less than 2° to its orbital plane (Klaasen, 1976; Murray and others, 1981, p. 28); its rotation period of 58.64 terrestrial days is in two- thirds resonance with its orbital period of 87.97 terrestrial days (Colombo, 1965; Colombo and Shapiro, 1966). The resulting lag and orbital eccentricity create {{a variation of}} mean temperature not only with latitude, as on the Earth, but also with longitude. However, because of Mercury's relatively slow rotational period, diurnal variations in temperature probably greatly exceed mean-temperature variations along latitude and longitude, even in the high latitudes. Its pronounced orbital eccentricity (0.2563) causes the apparent solar intensity at Mercury to vary {{by more than a}} factor of 2 throughout a Mercurian year, corresponding to about a 20 <b>percent</b> <b>change</b> in equilibrium temperature. Further, conservation of orbital angular momentum and spin-orbit coupling cause considerable variation in the length of daylight. Dawns and sunsets are prolonged by the long transit time of the Mercurian horizon across the solar disk, so that daylight is lengthened and nighttime reduced by several terrestrial days at sunset and vice versa at sunrise (Robert Wildey, U.S. Geological Survey, oral commun., 1982). Despite these considerations and despite the daily range in surface temperatures of several hundred kelvins, the subsurface temperature in the polar regions always remains well below freezing (Murray, 1975).|$|E

However, frequencies and courses of risky use of alcohol, drugs and cigarettes are rarely investigated in patients at psychosis units. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe the use of alcohol, drugs and cigarettes in patients at a psychosis unit over a 1 1 / 2 year period after them having taken part in a screening investigation including a feed-back of the results to personnel. Relationships with sex and age are also described. METHODS: The patients' use of the substances was examined at baseline and at follow-up using three self-reporting instruments: Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) and Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-six patients out of 238 at baseline (78 percent) took part in the follow-up. Total AUDIT score decreased in women. Older men more often developed a risky alcohol use. Older women tended to reduce their risky drug habits. On a group level the habits mostly were stable, but 11 <b>percent</b> <b>changed</b> their alcohol habits and 15 <b>percent</b> <b>changed</b> their smoking habits from risky to no/low risky use, or vice versa.
