40|$|Palmtop {{computers}} {{provide a}} possible avenue for the convenient collection of subjective ratings from individuals {{outside of a}} fixed laboratory setting. One disadvantage of these computers is {{the small size of}} their display screens, which may reduce the resolution of responses available as compared with standard display screens. One plausible solution to this problem is to use a scale that expands contingent on an initial response made by the subject, so that the final response is made from a scale with finer resolution. To validate this approach, we compared taste intensity judgments of six sucrose solutions (0. 03, 0. 06, 0. 12, 0. 24, 0. 48, and 0. 96 M), using a labeled magnitude scale either presented in expandable form on a palmtop computer (<b>Palm</b> <b>scale)</b> or in conventional (nonexpandable) form on a standard 17 $ PC monitor (PC scale). Twenty-four subjects rated all six sucrose solutions thrice, using both scale types, the different scales being used on different days of testing. The scales led to very similar taste intensity ratings at all but the lowest concentration, which was rated less intense on the <b>Palm</b> <b>scale.</b> The <b>Palm</b> <b>scale</b> was used with slightly less precision than the PC scale for the weakest solution concentrations.

The oil palm industry in Malaysia is very competitive and&# 13; {{become one of the}} major economic sectors contributing to the total revenue of the country. In year 2009,&# 13; there was a total of 22. 40 million tons of oil palm products including palm oil, palm kernel oil, palm kernel&# 13; cake, oleo-chemicals and finished products, equivalent to RM 49. 59 billion of export revenue. However,&# 13; cost of production for Crude Palm Oil (CPO) varies in a big gap. Therefore, it is essential to identify the&# 13; major cost influencing factors in the production of CPO. Approach: The study system started with&# 13; collection of Fresh Fruits Bunches (FFB) from oil palm plantation to the production of CPO at palm oil&# 13; mills.

40|$|Oil palm {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} oil crops in the world. Because of its high productivity and perennial nature, it has been expanding quickly. Commercial plantations consist mostly of the African palm E. guineensis Jacq. However, producers in Latin America are increasingly planting the O Ã— G interspecific hybrid, a cross between African palm (E. guineensis) and the American palm (E. oleifera (Kunth) CortÃ©s). This interspecific hybrid has emerged as a promising solution to diseases such as the bud rot of oil palm because of the apparent partial resistance of this genotype to the disease. This work studied and described the phenology of the O Ã— G interspecific hybrid. The phenology stages were coded using the BBCH scale. The scale for the phenophases was defined using a three-digit code. Due to the nature of the palm, no descriptions were used for stage two (formation of side shoots/tillering) and stage four (development of harvestable vegetative plant parts or vegetative reproductive organs) because these stages do not apply to oil <b>palm.</b> The <b>scale</b> was constructed using germinating seeds, pre-nursery and nursery plants and five year-old palms. For the description of the stem elongation, different age palms of the same O Ã— G hybrid were used. Observations were performed during an 18 -month period.

Many cases of species loss have already been recorded in Asian countries, although research is still incipient in the Amazon basin, and the environmental impacts of these monocultures on freshwater ecosystems in the Neotropical region are still poorly understood. The present study evaluated the effects of oil palm plantations on the physical structure of stream habitats and the resulting changes in the taxonomic and functional composition of aquatic insect communities. A total of 2100 specimens of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera were collected during the present study, representing 40 genera and 16 families. The hypothesis tested was that the taxonomic and functional diversity of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (Insecta) decreases in streams surrounded by oil palm plantations in comparison with those embedded in forested areas. In the plantation streams, the taxonomic richness and composition, and the functional richness are modified significantly. Functional composition appeared unaltered despite reduced canopy cover associated with oil palm streams.

CHAPTER 7 - EMPIRICAL RESEARCH: QUESTIONNAIRE: Different aspects, {{as well as the}} course of the empirical research, are discussed in this chapter. The descriptive method is selected as the scientific method for this research project. A questionnaire was composed to gather information on the set classification methods and training programs for the child with Down's Syndrome in training centres in the Republic. Firstly in this chapter the questionnaire is motivated as the most suitable scientific research method to deal with the topic of this study. The composition and application, respondents and returns are discussed afterwards. A prerequisite for significant diversions was set at a minimum return of 70 % completed questionnaires. A follow-up letter was sent when the return was 63 %. Telephone calls to the remaining respondents lifted the return percentage to 71 %, so that the set criterium was reached. CHAPTER 8 - TRAINING FACILITIES FOR THE TRAINABLE MENTALLY RETARDED DOWN'S SYNDROME CHILDREN: In this chapter attention is especially devoted to responses in connection with the total number of trainable mentally retarded Down's Syndrome children in the training centres, different school departments and the average number of children in groups in the centres. 1. Occurrence of trainable mentally retarded Down's Sindrome children: Questionnaires were sent to 31 training centres in the Republic. Areturn of 71 % (22) questionnaires was obtained. A number of 264 (20, 3 %) Down's Syndrome children and 1 037 (79, 7 %) other trainable mentally retarded children are enrolled in 21 (68 % respondents} training centres, so that the total number is 1 301 trainable mentally retarded children. 2. School departments: The training centres are organized in the following departments (the number of centres which have a certain department are given in brackets) : nursery class (10 }, adaptation class (10), junior class (12), senior class (11). 3. Average number of children in different groups The 68 % centres that completed this item in the questionnaire reported an average of 14 children in a group. The conclusion is also reached that the trainable mentally retarded Down's Syndrome child shows the best progress when he receives sufficient stimulation in the early years at home. Ways of maintenance of the centres up to 1 / 4 / 75 is discussed in {{the last part of the}} chapter. CHAPTER 9 - GROUPING CRITERIA FOR THE TRAINABLE MENTALLY RETARDED DOWN'S SYNDROME CHILDREN: Grouping criteria for the trainable mentally retarded children, general differences in skills between Down's Syndrome and other trainable children and promoting criteria for trainable mentally retarded children are discussed in this chapter. 1. Grouping criteria for the trainable mentally retarded children: Responses show that 27 % of the respondent's grade I. Q. as an important grouping criterium. The I. Q. 's of only 36 % of the children in the centres are known by members of staff. Chronological age is graded as an important criterium by 73 % respondents, mental age by 32 %, visual-motor skills by 45 % and social competence by 50 % of the respondents. 2. Differences in skills between Down's Syndrome and non-Down's Syndrome trainable mentally retarded groups of children: No difference is noticed in visual-motor skills by 40 % respondents. Down's Syndrome children are graded weaker in these skills by 18 % respondents. As seen by 5 % respondents, Downâ€™s Syndrome children are much better in self-help skills, 10 % as better, 40 %â€¢as the same and 5 % respondents as weaker than other trainable children in the centres. In connection with scholastic work the Down's Syndrome child is seen as the same by 40 % respondents, weaker by 10 % and much weaker by 5 % respondents. Social competence is graded as much better by 18 % respondents, better by 23 %, the same by 14 % and weaker by 5 % respondents. 3. Promoting criteria for trainable mentally retarded children: Visual-motor skills are the most important promoting criterium, as graded by training centres. Chronological age is placed second. CHAPTER 10 - A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR THE TRAINABLE MENTALLY RETARDED DOWN'S SYNDROME CHILDREN IN THE TRAINING CENTRE: In this chapter the necessity for a special adapted training program for the trainable mentally retarded Down's Syndrome children, differences in skills between Down's Syndrome children of the same chronological age, psychometric media to determine the functioning of different skills are discussed. Based on this knowledge a training program for the trainable mentally retarded Downâ€™s Syndrome child is set out. 1. The necessity for a special adapted training program for the trainable mentally retarded Down's Syndrome child: A special or adapted training program for the trainable Downâ€™s Syndrome children is suggested by 40 % respondents. Another 40 % respondents believe that Downâ€™s Syndrome children can take part in the same program (without adaptation) with other trainable children, while 20 % respondents did not respond to this item. Information collected from literature and the rest of the empirical research, however, shows without any doubt that the trainable mentally retarded Down's Syndrome child is inferior in certain skills (see par. 10. 2. 2) and shows possibilities for improvement in other skills, when compared with other trainable children. The conclusion is therefore reached that a specially adapted program must be set for the Down's Syndrome child to give more opportunity for stimulation in skills in which he is inferior, 2. Differences in skills amongst Down's syndrome children of the same chronological age: Responses show that 45 % respondents notice great individual differences amongst Down's Syndrome children of the same chronological age; 32 % respondents see no markable differences in skills and 23 % respondents did not respond to this item. Individual differences amongst trainable Down's Syndrome children are not denied, but specific inferiorities in motory, auditory, language and tactual skills are present in all the trainable mentally retarded Down's Syndrome children. 3. Psychometric media to determine the functioning level of certain skills: It is concluded that the Stanford-Binet Intelligence <b>Scale,</b> the Merrill <b>Palmer</b> <b>Scale</b> and the Goodenough-Harris Drawing Test (elaborated from the Goodenough-Draw-a-Man Test) can, after adaptation to South African circumstances, be used as intelligence scales to differentiate between educable, trainable and untrainable children. The Vineland Social Maturity Scale and the Gunzburg Progress Assessment Charts must be used to determine the improvement in connection with the following skills: self-help, knowledge of his own body and perception, communication, socialization and occupation. 4.
