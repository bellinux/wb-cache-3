40|$|The {{effect of}} bearing thermal growth on the {{effectiveness}} of the bearing preload springs on the space shuttle main engine high pressure oxygen turbopump (SSME HPTOP) were examined. The SSME HPTOP turbine end bearings, <b>preload</b> <b>spring,</b> and bearing mounting design were evaluated relative to spalling, excessive ball wear, possible thermal problems, and cage delamination. The magnitude of the thermal stresses required to cause high levels of ball wear were calculated. Plots of maximum sheer stress and maximum reversing shear versus the axial load for the 57 mm SSME HPTOP bearing were created. A plot of the bearing thermal growth versus <b>preload</b> <b>spring</b> deflection was generated. It was determined that metallic wear, rather than thermal growth, caused enlargement of the contact zone between ball and races, that high fatigue-inducing shear stresses are generated under increased loads, and that at temperatures between 100 and 150 deg C, the springs bottom out and very high loads are developed in the bearing. Allowance for adequate spring movement after assembly is recommended...|$|E

Inasmuch as the <b>spring</b> was <b>preloaded,</b> the tab-spring system was a nonlinear one. Frequency of the tab was the most significant parameter in this study, and an increase in flutter speed with increasing frequency is indicated. At a given frequency, the tab of high aspect ratio is shown to have a slightly lower flutter speed than the one of low aspect ratio. Because the frequency of the <b>preloaded</b> <b>spring</b> tab was found to vary radically with amplitude, the flutter speed decreased with increase in initial displacement of the tab...|$|R

The assembly comprises telescoped bushings and a <b>preload</b> <b>spring.</b> A tubular shaft extends through the spring assembly and openings in the first connector member and support structure, on which it is clamped. A plunger rod in the shaft is provided with a tip end and a recess in the rod near the other end thereof. A retainer precludes passage of the rod through the shaft {{in one direction and}} an end cap closes the bore of the shaft at the other end and provides a shoulder which extends radially of the shaft. A plunger return spring biases the plunger rod against the plunger retainer with the plunger tip protruding from the shaft and a spring assembly return spring engages at its ends the shoulder of the end cap and one end of the spring assembly. Detents received in lateral openings in the tubular shaft are held captive by the plunger rod and one end of the spring assembly to lock the spring assembly on the tubular shaft and apply a preload to the first connector member.

40|$|Advanced {{performances}} in nanospacecraft are {{typically associated with}} high onboard power availability, requiring deployed solar arrays. Nanospacecraft geometrical and weight constraints do not allow the use of reversible dynamics and lock systems used in conventional spacecraft. Most nanospacecraft deployed solar panel systems are therefore based on compact and reliable miniaturized mechanisms, such as simple passively deployed <b>preloaded</b> <b>springs.</b> The use {{of these kinds of}} deployed solar arrays may interfere with the performance of the attitude control system. Agile nanospacecraft, designed to perform rapid attitude maneuvers, may potentially be affected by the solar array dynamical interaction with the main satellite body motion. In addition, the presence of inherently nonlinear elements, such as bounds on allowed rotations and <b>preloaded</b> <b>springs,</b> deserve a dedicated analysis. The analysis developed in this paper is based on the performance of state-of-the art agile nanosatellite attitude control systems, specifically developed for delivering high torque and fast attitude maneuvering, such as miniaturized control moment gyros. By numerical simulation, it is shown that, despite the simplicity of the deployment system and the absence of locking mechanisms, the attitude dynamics remains substantially unaffected by the solar array dynamics. This is obtained straightforwardly by properly sizing the spring stiffness and by a sufficient level of preload...|$|R
40|$|Traditional azimuth-elevation ("az-el") stages {{are used}} to point a variety of devices ranging from large optical telescopes to tank guns. Such a stage {{typically}} has an elevation stage having a horizontal axis mounted on an azimuth stage with a vertical axis. Both stages are often motorized. Optical communications transceivers often require two-axis motorized control, as when the communications link is between a ground station and an aircraft or satellite. In such applications, the traditional azimuth-elevation stage has two important drawbacks: a gimbal lock exclusion zone at zenith and susceptibility to pointing errors caused by backlash. Az-el stages in which the azimuth stage cannot rotate a full 360 deg have the additional drawback of an azimuth exclusion zone. The diagonal-axes stage described here mitigates or eliminates all of these problems. Instead of one vertical axis and one horizontal axis, a diagonal-axes stage has two horizontal axes, both oriented at 45 to the trajectory of the target. For example, a ground station located on the equator tracking a satellite with an equatorial orbit would have one axis parallel to northeast and southwest, and the other axis parallel to northwest and southeast. The diagonal-axes stage is considerably less vulnerable to backlash. If it is correctly oriented, its axes rotate in only one direction during an overhead pass by a satellite. As a result, the effects of backlash may be inherently eliminated. If the gravity-induced torque on either axis changes during the pass, then backlash may become important during {{the part of the}} pass where the gravity torque, instead of opposing the motion of the stage, pushes the stage in the direction of motion. This can result in the loss of gear-to-gear contact in one or more stages of the gear reduction mechanism. In this case, a <b>preload</b> <b>spring</b> used to eliminate backlash need only be sufficiently strong to overcome the gravity torque, i. e. it need not overcome friction in the gear train. The diagonal-axes stage is not backlash-free for arbitrary target trajectories such as an aircraft might execute. If properly oriented for any particular satellite, however, it is backlash-free for all passes of that satellite, which will trace out parallel paths on the sky, and for all passes of any other satellite that are perpendicular to the first. It will also be backlash-free for some fraction of other satellite trajectories...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 221 Compared to {{leading edge}} {{technologies}} such as high speed turbomachinery, reciprocating pumps {{may appear to be}} a simple technology: A reciprocating plunger causes liquid to be drawn from a low pressure manifold through the suction check valves, and expelled into a high pressure manifold through the discharge check valves. However, the interaction of flow, valve dynamics, and the acoustics of the pump and piping system can generate high amplitude pressure pulsation, causing severe vibration and reliability problem in some systems. The effects of improperly operating valves, and the successful resolution of such problems with valve design modifications are examined. Since the pump vales are operated by the action of the fluid, valve components (including the spring, valve body, valve disc shape, and sealing surfaces, etc.) must be carefully selected to ensure that the valves open and close at the appropriate times. Problems associated with valve dynamics include over pressure spikes at the opening of discharge valves, under pressure spikes {{at the opening of the}} suction valves, high noise levels, and excessive wear of valve components. Severe over pressure spikes have been known to cause fatigue failures of pump working barrels, connecting rods, bearings, and even drive-train components. Under pressure spikes can cause cavitation that can also lead to plunger and valve failures, due to pitting damage. High level valve noise is usually indicative of sever impacts associated with the opening and closing of the valves. Impacts at the valve closing are sometimes referred to as valve hammer and can result in damage to the sealing surfaces. Impacts at the valve opening, which may be identified by damage to the back side of the valve disc, are due to the over pressure and under pressure spikes which can result in fatigue failures of the components. Excessive valve wear can also be experienced when the valve disc material is not suitable for the pumping conditions. The use of field data coupled with a computer model to analyze the valve dynamics will be presented. Using this tool, the effect of various valve modifications such as changes in sealing surfaces, valve lift, spring preload, and spring stiffness can be observed. Instrumentation and data analysis techniques to evaluate these problems will also be discussed. The effects of modifications to valves (including changes in lift, spring <b>preload,</b> <b>spring</b> construction and stiffness, valve disc geometries, etc.) will be examined using data from actual systems...|$|E

40|$|A micro-positioning {{table for}} {{precision}} machining applications is developed utilizing a piezoelectric translator to generate high speed precision motions with accelerations up to 33. 51 g. The piezoelectric translator is <b>preloaded</b> by four <b>springs</b> {{such that the}} moving part in the table keeps contact with the translator. The contact between the translator and the moving part is of the hertz contact type. It is a typical design for high performance micro-positioning devices. It is found that the hertz contact may not be maintained and detachment occurs when implementing large step motions. The detachment phenomenon is analyzed and the models to determine the separation time and the maximum overshoot are established. It is found that the stiffness of the <b>preloading</b> <b>springs</b> and the distance of compression for preloading are the key parameters of the detachment.

40|$|A {{high speed}} {{permanent}} magnet alternator with a power rating of 4. 5 kW at 30, 000 rpm rated speed is indigenously developed for Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE). An integrated test rig is designed and fabricated to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} alternator. The mechanical design of the alternator and the integrated test rig is presented in this report. The alternator mainly consisted of a rotor and a stator. The rotor is constructed with a cylindrical iron core, several magnets arranged circumferentially over the core and sleeve containment over the magnets in a concentric manner. The containment sleeve is the most critical component in the rotor assembly as it experiences very high circumferential stress resulting from the centrifugal loads of the magnets and its inertia due to high speed of rotation. A high degree of interference is required in the rotor assembly between the core, magnets and the sleeve in order to avoid slippage at high speed. A novel concept introduced relaxes the interference requirement and makes the assembly easier. Finite element analysis is carried out for the rotor by simulating interference and contacts between rotor core, magnet and the sleeve. The rotor shaft is supported at its ends using angular contact ball bearings with <b>preloading</b> <b>spring.</b> Critical speed analysis of the rotor is carried out and the first critical speed is well above the design speed.

40|$|Shaft {{bearing system}} {{analysis}} codes were developed, improved, {{and used to}} investigate Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Liquid Oxygen (LOX) turbopump bearing problems, and to support the Marshall Space Flight Center Bearing and Seal Materials Test (BSMT) program. Thermal network modeling uses the SINDA thermal code, and the modeling of bearing quasi-dynamic characteristics uses the SHABERTH bearing/shaft code. These codes are solved concurrently for a bearing/shaft system using software developed for this purpose. Simulation of the SSME LOX turbopump turbine and pump end bearings and the MSFC BSMT operating in liquid nitrogen (LN sub 2) and LOX was done. The thermal network models include the bearing components, bearing carriers, shaft, housing, frictional heat, and viscous fluid energy.
