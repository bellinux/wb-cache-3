40|$|Background/purpose: In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} oral uracil–tegafur (UFUR) as a <b>postoperative</b> <b>adjuvant</b> treatment for patients with advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Materials and methods: The study cohort consisted 80 patients with advance cancer treated between January 2003 and December 2007. Half of the patients received oral UFUR as <b>postoperative</b> metronomic <b>adjuvant</b> <b>chemotherapy,</b> while the other half received no treatment. No patients received postoperative radiotherapy or other systemic chemotherapy. Disease-free survival and toxicity were evaluated in these two groups. Twenty-two patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively for viable circulating endothelial progenitor cells using flow cytometry. Results: The disease-free survival rates at 4 years were 84. 6 % with oral UFUR treatment and 60. 9 % without UFUR therapy (P =  0. 02). The toxicity and disease progression profiles {{did not differ significantly}} between the two groups, but viable circulating endothelial progenitor cell counts decreased after the administration of oral UFUR. Advanced OSCC patients who received oral UFUR had a better prognosis than those who did not.

40|$|Abstract. Background: The optimum regimen and optimum {{duration}} of administration of postoperative chemotherapy would {{vary with the}} postoperative residual tumor volume. Whether or not prolonged administration of oral uracil/tegafur (UFT) with leucovorin (LV) would prolong the survival period was assessed experimentally. Materials and Methods: Murine models of pulmonary metastasis with different volumes of residual tumor after primary tumor resection were prepared, and the efficacy of 12 -week and 4 -week oral administration of UFT/LV as <b>postoperative</b> <b>adjuvant</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> was compared. Results: In the model with only a small volume of occult residual tumor after early resection of the primary tumor, the survival period in the 12 -week UFT/LV group was significantly increased as compared with that in the untreated group, whereas no significant difference was noted between the 4 -week UFT/LV group and the untreated group. Conclusion: Long-term administration of UFT/LV as <b>postoperative</b> <b>adjuvant</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> may be potentially beneficial.

Methods: A literature search was conducted to identify studies that employed <b>postoperative</b> <b>adjuvant</b> IP <b>chemotherapy</b> after CRS or combined CRS and intraoperative HIPEC in patients with ovarian cancer. Data of interest included chemotherapy protocol, morbidity and mortality, and survival data. Results: Three large randomized controlled trials comprising 707 patients with advanced ovarian cancer who received <b>postoperative</b> <b>adjuvant</b> IP <b>chemotherapy</b> were reviewed. Morbidity rate ranged from 56 % to 94 % in IP chemotherapy, and mortality rate ranged from 1 % to 2 %. Median disease-free survival ranged from 24 to 28 months, and overall survival ranged from 49 to 66 months. Planned chemotherapy completion rates ranged from 42 % to 71 %. Twenty-four nonrandomized studies that reported HIPEC comprised 1167 patients with both advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer. In patients with advanced ovarian cancer, mortality ranged from 0 % to 5 %, minor morbidity ranged from 16 % to 90 %, and major morbidity ranged from 0 % to 40 %. Median disease-free survival ranged from 13 to 56 months, and overall survival ranged from 14 to 64 months. Survival at 5 years ranged from 35 % to 70 %. In patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, the mortality rate ranged from 0 % to 10 %, minor morbidity ranged from 7 % to 90 %, and major morbidity ranged from 0 % to 49 %. Median disease-free survival ranged from 13 to 24 months and overall survival from 23 to 49 months. Survival at 5 years ranged from 12 % to 54 %.

40|$|CONTEXT: The role of <b>adjuvant</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> remains poorly defined for the {{management}} of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The last meta-analysis evaluating <b>adjuvant</b> <b>chemotherapy,</b> conducted in 2005, had limited power to fully support its use. OBJECTIVE: To update the current evidence of the benefit of <b>postoperative</b> <b>adjuvant</b> cisplatin-based <b>chemotherapy</b> compared with control (ie, surgery alone) in patients with MIBC. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing <b>adjuvant</b> cisplatin-based <b>chemotherapy</b> with control for patients with MIBC. The search included the Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases, and abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings up to May 2013. An updated systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 945 patients included in nine RCTs (five previously analyzed, one updated, and three new) were examined. For overall survival, the pooled hazard ratio (HR) across all nine trials was 0. 77 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 59 - 0. 99; p= 0. 049). For disease-free survival, the pooled HR across seven trials reporting this outcome was 0. 66 (95 % CI, 0. 45 - 0. 91; p= 0. 014). This disease-free survival benefit was more apparent among those with positive nodal involvement (p= 0. 010). CONCLUSIONS: This updated and improved meta-analysis of randomized trials provides further evidence of an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in patients with MIBC receiving <b>adjuvant</b> cisplatin-based <b>chemotherapy</b> after radical cystectomy...|$|R

Methods Of 102 patients with breast cancer in stage Ⅱ to Ⅲ, 23 were assigned to control group and 79 to catheter and pump-placement group. Quadrantectomy plus axillary lymph node dissection or modified radical mastectomy was performed in both groups,followed by the insertion of a catheter for pumping of chemotherapeutic drug in pump-placement group. The catheter was inserted into axillary artery through the lateral thoracic artery or subscapular artery,connecting with a chemotherapy pump for instillation of chemotherapeutic drug and it was fixed on the skin for local <b>adjuvant</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> thereafter. The catheter was washed with heparin {{once a week to}} prevent occlusion. 10 - 14 days after surgery,patients in pump-placement group underwent local chemotherapy with 5 -FU at a dose of 0. 25 g once for 4 times up to a total dose of 1. 0 g. Routine systematic chemotherapy,radiation and endocrine therapy were given to both groups. Local recurrence was examined during an 18 -to 48 -month follow-up. Results It took 94 - 137 (103 ± 14) minutes in control group to perform surgery alone,while it took 105 - 158 (126 ± 17) minutes in pump-placement group to perform surgery plus chemotherapy pump placement,in which insertion of the catheter took 15 - 60 (25 ± 3) minutes. In pump-placement group,exudation in or around the skin at the exit of the catheter occurred in 5 cases(6. 3 %),small hematoma in axillary fossa less than 3 cm in diameter occurred in 3 cases(3. 8 %),but there was no limitation of upper extremity movement.
