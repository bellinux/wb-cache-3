5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile to human life. On the brink of extinction, humanity creates Basel, a giant air purification module controlled by the Zenith System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding Basel, the remnants of humanity gathered around it and built a great city {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While Basel and the Zenith System control the surrounding environment to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: each person has their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. Basel evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those {{at the top of the}} tower are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the <b>people</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> religion deifying the Zenith System.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new plan for the {{elimination}} of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Since transporting masses of <b>people</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E

25|$|As an {{epistemology}} (the {{study of}} knowledge, its nature and verifiability), as an ethics (moral philosophy), {{and as a}} politics (affairs of the citizenry), the field of postcolonialism address the politics of knowledge—the matters that constitute the postcolonial identity of a decolonized people, which derives from: (i) the colonizer's generation of cultural knowledge about the colonized people; and (ii) how that Western cultural knowledge was applied to subjugate a non–European <b>people</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> colony of the European mother country, which, after initial invasion, was effected {{by means of the}} cultural identities of 'colonizer' and 'colonized'.|$|E
25|$|In Northern Alberta, oil {{development}} activities bring {{an enormous number}} of <b>people</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fragile ecosystem. Historically, population figures have been very low for this region. Water is easily polluted because the water table reaches the surface in most areas of muskeg. With the ever-increasing development and extraction of resources, wildlife are recipient to both direct and indirect effects of pollution. Woodland Caribou are particularly sensitive to human activities, and as such are pushed away from their preferred habitat during {{the time of year when}} their caloric needs are greatest and food is the most scarce. Humans' effect on the Caribou is compounded by road construction and habitat fragmentation that open the area up to deer and wolves.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, the Factory and Workshop Act 1901 was {{amended to}} include laundries, {{and under the}} Labour Exchanges Act 1909 labour exchanges were set up {{in order to help}} {{unemployed}} people find work, by providing centres where a large number of employers and the unemployed could post jobs and apply for them respectively. By February 1910, eighty-three labour exchanges were open, and proved to be invaluable in helping people find employment. In 1913 these labour exchanges were putting around 3000 <b>people</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> job each day. Another measure taken was the 1909 Development Fund, which was an attempt to provide work in times of Depression. This fund was devoted to increasing employment opportunities through measures such as afforestation and the provision of smallholdings in the countryside. In addition, the government encouraged the adoption of Fair Wages contracts by local authorities. In 1908, special regulations were made for electrical safety.|$|E

500|$|In all, seven {{policemen and}} at least four workers were killed. Another {{policeman}} died {{two years after the}} incident from complications related to injuries received on that day. About 60 policemen were wounded in the incident. They were carried, along with some other wounded <b>people,</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> nearby police station.

500|$|The APRF had {{a history}} of {{opposing}} mental health legislation; earlier in 1955, it had {{played a key role in}} stalling the passage of three mental health bills in the California Assembly. It was part of a wider network of far-right organizations which opposed psychiatry and psychology as being pro-communist, anti-American, anti-Christian and pro-Jewish. The Keep America Committee, another Californian [...] "superpatriot" [...] group, summed up the anti-mental health mood on the far right in a pamphlet issued in May 1955.

500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked <b>people</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Insane Clown Posse albums, The Tempest is {{not connected}} to the Dark Carnival mythology, which {{formed the basis for}} ICP's [...] "Joker's Cards" [...] series, which began in 1992 with Carnival of Carnage and concluded with the albums [...] and Hell's Pit; however, it references themes, concepts and songs from previous albums. Joseph Bruce (Violent J) said that The Tempest is a concept album in its own right. Bruce describes the album's concept as relating to both a violent storm which turns into a tornado and pulls <b>people</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hurricane as well as a roller coaster. According to Bruce, [...] "That's a lot like riding on a violent roller coaster, I'd assume. You get jerked to the left, jerked to the right, sucked way up into the sky, and then you go shooting down to the floor, and then you jerk up to the left and then you whip around to the right. Well, The Tempest is a storm {{in the form of a}} roller coaster." [...] As a result of this concept, the album focuses on a variety of different moods.|$|E

500|$|For settlers, MacGregor {{deliberately}} targeted {{his fellow}} Scots, assuming {{that as a}} Scotsman himself {{they would be more}} likely to trust him. Their emigration served to reassure potential investors in the Poyaisian bonds and land certificates firstly that the country was real, and secondly that it was being developed and would provide monetary returns. In Sinclair's assessment, this aspect of the scheme [...] "turn what would have been an inspired hoax into a cruel and deadly one". Tamar Frankel posits in her analysis that, at least to some degree, MacGregor [...] "probably believed his own story" [...] and genuinely hoped to forge these <b>people</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Poyaisian society. MacGregor told his would-be colonists that he wished to see Poyais populated with Scots as they possessed the necessary hardiness and character to develop the new country. Alluding to the rivalry with England and the Darien episode—which, he stressed, had involved a direct ancestor of his—MacGregor suggested that in Poyais they might right this historic wrong and salvage Scottish pride. Skilled tradesmen and artisans were promised free passage to Poyais, supplies, and lucrative government contracts. Hundreds, mostly Scots, signed up to emigrate—enough to fill seven ships. They included a City of London banker named Mauger (who was to head the Bank of Poyais), doctors, civil servants, young men whose families had bought them commissions in the Poyaisian Army and Navy, and an Edinburgh cobbler who accepted the post of Official Shoemaker to the Princess of Poyais.|$|E

It was successful enough to be moved Off Broadway for another ten-week run in 2008. The play's writers commented on the difficulty of lesbian-themed works finding financial success. They were tempted {{to make it more}} appealing by turning to camp for comedy. However, one of the writers said, [...] "I just felt like, how can you turn these <b>people</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> joke? I mean, these people are real people! Why would I direct a play where I held the characters in some sort of contempt or felt that they were ridiculous? We are allowed to do something else besides camp." [...] The stage adaptation of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles was produced by Lily Tomlin and Jane Wagner, and it won the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Media Award for [...] "fair, accurate, and inclusive" [...] portrayals of gay and lesbian people in New York Theater. In April 2008, Bannon appeared with the Seattle Women's Chorus in a performance called [...] "Vixen Fiction".

Put them together and there’s just sparks, it was real good." [...] When asked about the music video's concept would redefine the word [...] "freak", commenting: [...] "My general idea was to take the word and show its many faceted sides, twisting and turning it to where there’s really no distinguishing between one freak and another. Usher went there. When you’re engaging in sexual activity, there are many transitions and this is not about what they look like literally, but what they look like metaphorically. It’s about luring <b>people</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> situation. Because you have your thoughts on a ménage à trois, but then we’re doing it in a non-obvious way." [...] On Minaj and her pairing with Usher, Stansberry said, [...] " [...] had a few looks that I really liked. She played the part, but still was her. If you really listen to her words in the song, you can kinda visualize her outfit." [...] Stansberry also confirmed that R singer Ciara and singer-actor Jamie Foxx would make appearances in the video. In an interview with MTV News on the set of her video for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said that [...] "The video is freaky. And it's a great concept, a great story line," [...] Minaj told MTV News. [...] "It felt just like one of the sequels to Saw. It was dope." [...] Stating that the video had a [...] "secret society" [...] concept, Usher told Access Hollywood that the place symbolized locations where people use to get away from pressures, and also said the movie Eyes Wide Shut was some sort of inspiration of the video. On March 22, 2010 a thirty second preview of the music video was surfaced onto the internet. Two days later on March 24, 2010, Usher premiered the full music video on BET's 106 & Park.|$|E
