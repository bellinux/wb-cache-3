40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Word</b> <b>deafness</b> {{refers to}} an {{inability}} to understand spoken words despite intact hearing. In a cognitive approach, <b>word</b> <b>deafness</b> {{could be explained by}} a deficiency at the lower perceptive level of the auditory process. The impairment of the auditory analysis system would explain a disorder of identification of speech sounds. Only few studies addressed rehabilitation of central auditory processing and have described therapy focused on phoneme discrimination. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a specific auditory analysis rehabilitation addressing phoneme discrimination and phoneme recognition may improve oral comprehension and communication. METHOD: A single-case experimental design was used in a 65 year-old woman, with <b>word</b> <b>deafness</b> consecutive to a cerebral infarction which occurred 10 months before. Verbal naming, written expression and written comprehension were normal. Verbal comprehension, repetition and phoneme discrimination and recognition were impaired. In terms of cognitive model of auditory processing, the patient showed impairment of the auditory analysis system affecting verbal comprehension. A computerized rehabilitation of auditory analysis system was carried out in two consecutive tasks: phoneme discrimination and phoneme recognition. Errorless learning therapy was used, with a difficulty hierarchy practised from the easier to the most difficult phoneme and systematic visual cues which were progressively delayed and suppressed. This study tested the efficacy and the specificity of this therapy on the addressed tasks (phoneme discrimination and recognition), related tasks (oral comprehension and repetition), independent tasks (recognition of environmental sounds) and daily life (questionnaire). RESULTS: The phoneme discrimination and recognition impairment was stable over 4 months before therapy. After therapy, phoneme discrimination (p < 0. 001) and phoneme recognition (p < 0. 0001) were improved. The improvement was specific to verbal sounds recognition, while non-verbal sounds recognition was unchanged. An improvement occurred for repetition (p < 0. 05) and oral comprehension (p < 0. 01). The communication disability decreased (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: In a case of <b>word</b> <b>deafness,</b> this study demonstrates not only the efficacy of a specific phoneme processing therapy but also its efficacy in the improvement of higher level of cognitive treatment such as oral comprehension and its transfer in daily life. The role of errorless therapy using systematic visual cues and difficulty hierarchy must be underlined...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Word</b> <b>deafness</b> {{is a rare}} {{condition}} where pathologically degraded speech perception {{results in}} impaired repetition and comprehension but otherwise intact linguistic skills. Although impaired linguistic systems in aphasias resulting from damage to the neural language system (here termed central impairments), have been consistently shown to be amenable to external influences such as linguistic or contextual information (e. g. cueing effects in naming), {{it is not known}} whether similar influences can be shown for aphasia arising from damage to a perceptual system (here termed peripheral impairments). Aims: This study aimed to investigate the extent to which pathologically degraded speech perception could be facilitated or disrupted by providing visual as well as auditory information. Methods and Procedures: In three word repetition tasks, the participant with <b>word</b> <b>deafness</b> (AB) repeated <b>words</b> under different conditions: words were repeated {{in the context of a}} pictorial or written target, a distractor (semantic, unrelated, rhyme or phonological neighbour) or a blank page (nothing). Accuracy and error types were analysed. Results: AB was impaired at repetition in the blank condition, confirming her degraded speech perception. Repetition was significantly facilitated when accompanied by a picture or written example of the word and significantly impaired by the presence of a written rhyme. Errors in the blank condition were primarily formal whereas errors in the rhyme condition were primarily miscues (saying the distractor word rather than the target). Conclusions: Cross-modal input can both facilitate and further disrupt repetition in <b>word</b> <b>deafness.</b> The cognitive mechanisms behind these findings are discussed. Both top-down influence from the lexical layer on perceptual processes as well as intra-lexical competition within the lexical layer may play a role. ...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "agnosia" [...] {{refers to}} a loss of knowledge. Acquired music agnosia is the [...] "inability to {{recognize}} music in the absence of sensory, intellectual, verbal, and mnesic impairments". Music agnosia is most commonly acquired; in most cases it is a result of bilateral infarction of the right temporal lobes. In his article, Satoh states [...] "when <b>pure</b> <b>word</b> <b>deafness,</b> auditory sound agnosia, and receptive amusia occur simultaneously, the state is called auditory agnosia" [...] (Satoh 2007). However, one must understand the subtle difference between auditory and music agnosia; the former refers to the inability to recognize environmental sounds while the latter refers to the inability to recognize music.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "pure word deafness" [...] is {{something}} of a misnomer. By definition, individuals with <b>pure</b> <b>word</b> <b>deafness</b> are not deaf - in the absence of other impairments, these individuals have normal hearing for all sounds, including speech. The term [...] "deafness" [...] originates from the fact that individuals with AVA are unable to comprehend speech that they hear. The term [...] "pure word" [...] refers to the fact that comprehension of verbal information is selectively impaired in AVA. For this reason, AVA is distinct from other auditory agnosias in which the recognition of nonspeech sounds is impaired. Classical (or pure) auditory agnosia is an inability to process environmental sounds. Interpretive or receptive agnosia (amusia) is an inability to understand music.|$|E
50|$|Auditory verbal agnosia {{is caused}} by {{bilateral}} damage to the posterior superior temporal lobes or disruption of connections between these areas. It {{is often associated with}} lesions to the left posterior superior temporal lobe, but no such unilateral case has yet been documented without damage to the white matter tract connecting superior temporal lobes bilaterally or bilateral damage to the superior temporal lobe. In cases where unilateral damage to the left superior temporal lobe has been documented, patients exhibited problems processing both speech and non-speech sounds (in other words, not typical of auditory verbal agnosia). These facts, in combination with the existence of cases of damage to these white matter tracts without detectable cortical damage, in combination with cases of <b>pure</b> <b>word</b> <b>deafness</b> resulting enlargement of the III ventricle alone suggest that the disorder results from damage to the left-right superior temporal circuit rather than the superior temporal area on one hemisphere or the other.|$|E
50|$|Classification of the {{disorder}} is distinguished by {{the location of the}} lesions formed, which causes certain symptoms to be present or amplified.

The formation of bilateral lesions confined to the posterior operculum has a distinct symptom of <b>word</b> <b>deafness,</b> an inability to understand language.|$|R

5000|$|Persons {{with global}} aphasia can neither read nor write, have poor word retrieval, repetition, and {{comprehension}} skills.

Performance of nonverbal tasks can range from satisfactory to normal. However, it is possible for those affected by global aphasia to be able to express themselves using facial expressions, intonation, and gestures. Most persons with global aphasia are unable to functionally read sentences and usually cannot even read simple words. Extensive lexical impairment is also noted. Global aphasia is usually accompanied by weakness of {{the right side of the}} face and right hemiplegia but can occur with or without hemiparesis.
