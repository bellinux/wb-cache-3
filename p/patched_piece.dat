Tarnished silver candlesticks and lamps which might have come from England a century ago, and a scarred piano littered with tattered music, were in keeping with the tapestry; for signs of taste were balanced by those of neglect, while here and there a roughly <b>patched</b> <b>piece</b> of furniture conveyed a plainer hint that dollars were scanty with Allonby. He was from the South, a spare, grey-haired man, with a stamp of old-fashioned dignity, and in his face a sadness not far removed from apathy and which, perhaps, accounted for the condition of his property.|$|E

The room in which the miner lay was very small, and its furniture scanty; nevertheless it was clean and neatly arranged. Everything in and about the place bore evidence {{of the presence of}} a thrifty hand. The cotton curtain on the window was thin and worn, but it was well darned, and pure as the driven snow. The two chairs were old, as was also the table, but they were not rickety; it was obvious that they owed their stability to a hand skilled in mending and in <b>patching</b> <b>pieces</b> of things together. Even the squat little stool {{in the side of the}} chimney corner displayed a leg, the whiteness of which, compared with the other two, told of attention to small things. There was a peg for everything, and everything seemed to be on its peg. Nothing littered the well-scrubbed floor or defiled the well-brushed hearthstone, and it did not require a second thought on the part of the beholder to ascribe all this to the tidy little middle-aged woman, who, with an expression of deep anxiety on her good-looking countenance, attended to the wants of her injured husband.|$|R

5000|$|Show Way is a {{story about}} ancestry. The author is telling a story about her {{ancestors}} to her daughter. She tells her about their past and how they all had their own [...] "Show Way." [...] Every piece of quilt starting from Soonie’s great grandmother had a significant meaning. When Soonie's great-grandmother made the quilts, the pieces signified roads, moons, and stars to follow, a way to escape their slavery. Soonie's grandmother was sold into slavery, and she made clothes for everyone in the big house, even for slaves. At night she sewed stars, and moons, and roads into quilts, each piece a picture signifying what to follow to find the north star; her own show way. Mathis Soonie’s grandmother married a slave, which died before meeting his baby girl, a girl-child born free in 1863. Years later—Soonie came. Soonie and her mother grew up on a land where they’d pick cotton and got paid little and a piece of ground to farm on. They called this land home and they shared this land with other free people. On this land they worked hard, from pink day to blue-black nights, but it was a free life nevertheless; {{at the end of the}} day they could find a thing or two to smile about. Soonie made <b>patch</b> <b>pieces</b> with stars and moons and roads; sewed fields and rivers and trees. She <b>patched</b> these <b>pieces</b> together so her mother could sell them come market day. She called her creation “Trail to the North” she also called them “Show Way.” They no longer needed the secret trial to the north, but rather they lived well off of the money those quilts brought in, her own show way. She married a man named Walter Scott who owned land in Anderson, South Carolina; she had a baby and named her Georgiana. Georgiana was born a reader, and they said about her that she always had a book in her hand; she grew up to teach a small school in Anderson. She had two daughters named Caroline and Ann, these two girls walked in a line to change the laws that kept black and white people living separate. They sometimes were scared but regained their confidence when they saw the show way patches that their grandmother Soonie had pinned inside their dresses. Ann grew up to be a poet, which sometimes she converted to song, and Caroline stitched those songs into art for people to buy and hang up on their walls. Ann Had The Author, Jacqueline Woodson, who grew up to read and write, but when she couldn’t write she was sew stars and moons and roads because her mother told her that everything that happened before Jacqueline was born was her own kind of show way. She grew up to read and write, and her writing turned into books where she told stories of other people’s show ways. A story which she enjoys repeating to her daughter.|$|R

Growth continues to take place for several months, when scab and scutulum come away, leaving a shining bare patch destitute of hair. The disease is essentially chronic, lasting from ten to twenty years. It is caused by the growth of a fungus, and pathologically is the reaction of the tissues to the growth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{geometrical}} dissection {{that divides}} a spherical surface into two identical pieces is considered. When {{the piece is}} symmetric in two perpendicular directions, the two pieces are called yin and yang and the dissection is yin-yang dissection of a sphere. The yin and yang are mapped each other by a rotation M on the sphere where M 2 = 1. Therefore, the yin’s landscape viewed from yang {{is exactly the same}} as the yang’s land-scape viewed from yin, and vice versa. This complemental nature of the yin-yang dissection leads to the idea of new spherical overset grid named Yin-Yang grid. The flexibility of the yin-yang dissection of a sphere enables one to <b>patch</b> the <b>piece</b> with an orthogonal, quasi-uniform grid mesh. Since the two pieces are identi-cal, one computational routine that involves individual calculation in each grid is used for two times, one for yin grid and another for yang. Other routines that involve data transformation between yin and yang are also recycled for two times because of the complemental nature of the grids. Due to the simplicity of the underly-ing grid geometry, the Yin-Yang grid suits to massively parallel computers...|$|R

He knew that, though they had accomplished so much, {{there was still a}} great deal to be done, for the prizes might even yet be recaptured before they got them out to sea. Without a moment’s delay, therefore, he sent a boat to take possession of the cutter. The sail and wreckage were cleared away, and the boat proceeded to tow her out of the inlet. In the meantime a warp was taken from L’Agile to the schooner, the sails of the latter were lowered, and Will sailed proudly out with his second prize in tow. Once fairly at sea the crew began to repair damages. Five men in all had been killed and eleven were wounded. Several of the latter, however, were able to lend a hand.

They are easily interpretable but have limitations when used as approximations to general dependence structures. To improve the approximation property of the BF copulas and keep the advantage of easy interpretation, we develop a new copula approximation scheme by using BF copulas locally and <b>patching</b> the local <b>pieces</b> together. Error bounds and a probabilistic interpretation of this approximation scheme are developed.

These humble cloths, tangible remnants of stories lived by the common people – farmers, fishermen, and lumberjacks – who lived in rural areas along the Sea of Japan and northeastern Honshu Island until several decades ago, point to a material’s aesthetic and functional transformation. A majority of pieces in the collection are futon, bedding which are made of or patched with various shades of blue fabric pieces mostly recycled from cotton clothing and other castaway rags brought via the “Kitamaesen,” a commercial shipping route servicing the northern sea coast, used by ships originating from the port of Sakai for transporting fish meal, oil, and collecting “rice tax. ” By way of China, cotton cultivation was brought to Japan. By the eighteenth century it was firmly established in the country’s warmer regions where commoners could enjoy this new material just like their more well-to-do urban counterparts. However, cotton was precious in these areas where available fibers were the local hemp, ramie, mulberry, etc. Owing to a harsh economy and long bitter winters, the inexpensive, warm cotton cloths were a treasure. High demands led to cotton’s transformation into regional folk textile traditions such as sakiori, rag weaving; sashiko and kogin, stitching or quilting combined with bast fibers, as well as vernacular boro...|$|R

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{considered}} the implications for astrophysics and cosmology of some possible nonclassical properties of spacetime at the Planck scale. The new effects, such as a Planck-scale-modified energy-momentum (dispersion) relation, are often inferred from the analysis of some quantum versions of Minkowski spacetime, and therefore the relevant estimates depend heavily {{on the assumption that}} there could not be significant interplay between Planck-scale and curvature effects. We here scrutinize this assumption, using as guidance a quantum version of de Sitter spacetime with known Inonu-Wigner contraction to a quantum Minkowski spacetime. And we show that, contrary to common (but unsupported) beliefs, the interplay between Planck-scale and curvature effects can be significant. Within our illustrative example, in the Minkowski limit the quantum-geometry deformation parameter is indeed given by the Planck scale, while in the de Sitter picture the parameter of quantization of geometry depends both on the Planck scale and the curvature scalar. For the much-studied case of Planck-scale effects that intervene in the observation of gamma-ray bursts we can estimate the implications of "quantum spacetime curvature" within robust simplifying assumptions. For cosmology at the present stage of the development of the relevant mathematics one cannot go beyond semiheuristic reasoning, and we here propose a candidate approximate description of a quantum FRW geometry, obtained by <b>patching</b> together <b>pieces</b> (with different spacetime curvature) of our quantum de Sitter. This semiheuristic picture, in spite of its limitations, provides rather robust evidence that in the early Universe the interplay between Planck-scale and curvature effects could have been particularly significant.

40|$|Killing {{is perhaps}} the most {{definite}} form of communication possible. Microbes such as yeasts and gutbacteria have been shown to exhibit killer phenotypes. The killer strains are able to kill othermicrobes occupying the same ecological niche, and do so with impunity. It would therefore beexpected that, wherever a killer phenotype has arisen, all members of the population would soon bekillers or dead. Surprisingly, (i) one can find both killer and sensitive strains in coexistence, both inthe wild and in in-vitro experiments, and (ii) the absolute fitness cost of the killer phenotype oftenseems to be very small. We present an explicit model of such coexistence in a fragmented or discreteenvironment. A killer strain may kill all sensitive cells in one <b>patch</b> (one <b>piece</b> of rotting fruit, onecave or one human gut, for example), allowing sensitives to exist only in the absence of killer strainson the same patch. In our model, populations spread easily between patches, but in a stochasticmanner: One can imagine spores borne by the wind over a field of untended apple trees, or entericdisease transmission in a region in which travel is effectively unrestricted. What we show is thatcoexistence is not only possible, but that it is possible even if the absolute fitness advantage of thesensitive strain over the killer strain is arbitrarily small. We do this by performing a specificallytargeted mathematical analysis on our model, rather than via simulations. Our model does not assumelarge population densities, and may thus be useful in the context of understanding the ecology ofextreme environments...|$|R
