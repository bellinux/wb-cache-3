25|$|On January 23, 1959, Noyce {{documented}} {{his vision}} of the planar integrated circuit, essentially re-inventing the ideas of Kilby and Lehovec on the base of the Hoerni's <b>planar</b> <b>process.</b> Noyce claimed in 1976 that in January 1959 he did not know about the work of Lehovec.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 1957, Jean Hoerni first {{proposed}} a planar technology of bipolar transistors. In this process, all the p-n junctions {{were covered by}} a protective layer, which should significantly improve reliability. However, in 1957, this proposal was considered technically impossible. The formation of the emitter of an n-p-n transistor required diffusion of phosphorus, {{and the work of}} Frosch suggested that SiO2 does not block such diffusion. In March 1959, Chi-Tang Sah, a former colleague of Hoerni, pointed Hoerni and Noyce to an error in the conclusions of Frosch. Frosch used too thin oxide layers, whereas the experiments of 1957–1958 showed that a thick layer of oxide can stop the phosphorus diffusion. Armed with this knowledge, by March 12, 1959 Hoerni made the first prototype of a planar transistor, and on May 1, 1959 filed a patent application for the invention of the <b>planar</b> <b>process.</b> In April 1960, Fairchild launched the planar transistor 2N1613, and by October 1960 completely abandoned the mesa transistor technology. By the mid-1960s, the <b>planar</b> <b>process</b> has become the main technology of producing transistors and monolithic integrated circuits.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{development}} of clean rooms to reduce contamination to levels never before thought necessary, and of photolithography and the <b>planar</b> <b>process</b> to allow circuits {{to be made in}} very few steps, the Si–SiO2 system possessed the technical attractions of low cost of production (on a per circuit basis) and ease of integration. Largely because of these two factors, the MOSFET has become the most widely used type of transistor in integrated circuits.|$|E
25|$|In August 1959, Noyce {{formed at}} Fairchild {{a group to}} develop {{integrated}} circuits. On May 26, 1960, this group, led by Jay Last, produced the first planar integrated circuit. This prototype was not monolithic – two pairs of its transistors were isolated by cutting a groove on the chip, according to the patent by Last. The initial production stages repeated the Hoerni's <b>planar</b> <b>process.</b> Then the 80-micron-thick crystal was glued, face down, to the glass substrate, and additional photolithography was carried on the back surface. Deep etching created a groove down to the front surface. Then the back surface was covered with an epoxy resin, and the chip was separated from the glass substrate.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} for {{the realization of}} true 3 D polymer structures is presented in this paper.

In this way, some shape limitations of the planar technologies can be overcome for new functional applications. Moreover, the direct processing of microstereolithography on predefined structures eliminates manipulations which are associated with micro-assembly of separated parts. To demonstrate this combination of microstructuration processes, an example showing a conical axle added by microstereolithography on a SU- 8 piece of gearing is presented.

Both increases or decreases in resonator frequency are possible via the {{laser trimming}} due a geometrically-derived location-dependence, where {{the direction of the}} frequency change depends strongly on the location at which the laser removes material.

2500|$|In 1963 Fairchild's analog IC lineup, {{designed}} to military specifications, {{consisted of three}} amplifier circuits.

When the original schematic required resistor values that were too low or too high for <b>planar</b> <b>process,</b> the designers employed external nichrome thin film resistors. The resulting hybrid ICs performed poorly and were prohibitively expensive. Fairchild's R chief Gordon Moore directed the company to favor digital integrated circuits, which were relatively robust and promised high production volumes.

2500|$|Work at Ball Research brought Widlar {{in contact}} with Jean Hoerni and Sheldon Roberts, the creators of {{radiation}} hardened transistors and co-founders of Fairchild Semiconductor. Widlar {{decided to move to}} a semiconductor manufacturing company, and in 1963 Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor salesman, provided him the opportunity. According to Thomas Lee, Fairchild also wanted to have Widlar on board, and breached professional ethics by recruiting a key employee of their customer. In September 1963 Widlar was invited for an interview with Fairchild research and development (R) manager Heinz Ruegg. Widlar arrived at the interview intoxicated, and frankly told Ruegg what he thought about Fairchild's analog circuits: [...] "What they are doing is bullshit". Widlar was sent to another interview with the company's Applications Engineering division, which was based in Mountain View, California. The division head, John Hulme, hired Widlar despite objections from the first round interviewers. Widlar's first assignment at Fairchild targeted IC reliability through adjustments in fabrication processes. This early work, directed by process engineer David Talbert, reduced the price of <b>planar</b> <b>process</b> and made possible development of monolithic (fully integrated) linear ICs. Widlar, who formally reported to John Barrett, proved himself capable of quickly improving Barrett's own designs and very soon squeezed his nominal boss out of the company.|$|E
