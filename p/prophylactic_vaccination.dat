40|$|Introduction: <b>Prophylactic</b> <b>vaccinations</b> play a {{significant}} role in health care. As a relatively cost-effective preventive measure they can help to avert transmissible diseases and thus protect not only the vaccinated individuals themselves but also those who have not been vaccinated. In order to achieve this, a high vaccination rate is necessary; for many <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccinations</b> this rate is not reached in Germany. In order to counteract this trend the importance of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccinations</b> was upgraded in 2007 within the scope of the reform of the health system. The reimbursement of patients' vaccination fees was made compulsory for the statutory health insurance companies and statutory requirements were imposed on the insurers to ensure a nationwide provision of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccinations</b> for insured persons. The objective of this paper is to evaluate to what extent the health insurance companies promote the increasing of vaccination coverage rate today and what measures are being used to present this topic to the public. Methods: In order to assess the public presentation of the topic "prophylactic vaccinations" we have examined the websites of 68 statutory health insurance companies. We have assessed the attitude of the companies towards the promotion of participation in vaccination programs by conducting qualitative, structured interviews with representatives of 8 health insurers. Results: Measures to promote vaccinations, such as information, recall offers, projects to educate people or even monetary incentives, are employed relatively extensively by the health insurers and are considered important. However, it became clear that the discussion about <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccinations,</b> in particular concerning the costs and benefits thereof, had not been completed yet within the companies. Vaccination-specific data is not collected or evaluated on a regular or even isolated basis. There are no concrete targets concerning specific vaccination rates and incentives are neither evaluated nor compared with one another. Conclusions: The relatively extensive range of measures used to promote the vaccination rate contrasts with insufficient knowledge about their efficacy and efficiency. There is an urgent requirement for more research here...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{are living}} in an “aluminium age” with {{increasing}} bioavailability of the metal for approximately 125 years, contributing significantly to the aluminium body burden of humans. Over the course of life, aluminium accumulates and is stored predominantly in the lungs, bones, liver, kidneys and brain. The toxicity of aluminium in humans is briefly summarised, highlighting links and possible causal relationships between a high aluminium body burden {{and a number of}} neurological disorders and disease states. Aluminium salts have been used as depot-adjuvants successfully in essential <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccinations</b> for almost 100 years, with a convincing positive benefit-risk assessment which remains unchanged. However, allergen-specific immunotherapy commonly consists of administering a long-course programme of subcutaneous injections using preparations of relevant allergens. Regulatory authorities currently set aluminium limits for vaccines per dose, rather than per treatment course. Unlike <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccinations,</b> numerous injections with higher proportions of aluminium-adjuvant per injection are applied in subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and will significantly contribute to a higher cumulative life dose of aluminium. While the human body may cope robustly with a daily aluminium overload from the environment, regulatory cumulative threshold values in immunotherapy need further addressing. Based on the current literature, predisposing an individual to an unusually high level of aluminium, such as through subcutaneous immunotherapy, has the potential to form focal accumulations in the body with the propensity to exert forms of toxicity. Particularly in relation to longer-term health effects, the safety of aluminium adjuvants in immunotherapy remains unchallenged by health authorities – evoking the need for more consideration, guidance, and transparency on what is known and not known about its safety in long-course therapy and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimise its risks. The possibility of providing an effective means of measuring aluminium accumulation in patients undergoing long-term SCIT treatment as well as reducing their aluminium body burden is discussed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Allergen-specific {{immunotherapy}} {{is generally}} accepted {{as the only}} causal therapy for allergic rhinitis. Up to now {{there has been a}} dogma in immunotherapy for inhalation allergies that at least allergen components are necessary for effective therapy. This dogma could, however, be swayed by current results of effective immunotherapy without allergens. Virus-like particles (VLP) represent a novel and interesting aspect for immunotherapy for inhalation allergies. AIM: Initial experiences with successful immunotherapy without allergens are available. This article describes the currently available clinical experiences with bacteriophage VLPs filled with oligonucleotides which contain CpG motifs with tumor antigens on the surface for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. RESULTS: Vaccination with VLPs was found to be well tolerated, immunogenic and effective for prophylactic treatment of various infections. Bacteriophage VLPs filled with CpG motifs with tumor antigens on the surface led clinically to an induction of specific T-cells in tumor patients and were successfully implemented as adjuvants during <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccinations.</b> CONCLUSION: The VLP technique in combination with the use of CpG motifs could contribute to the causal treatment of complex diseases, such as malignancies, autoimmune diseases and allergies...|$|R

The recent heavily publicized vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) such as Gardasil™, or Cervarix™ for prevention of cervical cancers or meningitis vaccines that target young generation, particularly in the United States raise concerns for safety and efficacy of such vaccines [39, 44, 45]. The short or long-term health hazards, efficacy and safety of pathogen-specific vaccines such as virus-contaminated polio vaccines, pneumonia, meningitis, HPV or Swine flu vaccines in the induction of vaccine-(antigen-load) related allergies, autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases have been raised in a number of reports [39 – 45, 76 – 78]. Concerned parents often have to make religion and faith to resist or protest forced vaccination of their school-aged children (Khatami personal communication). The elaborate epitopic targets of cancer seem to have limited prospects and therapeutic cancer vaccination is an area of questionable efficacy for immunotherapy and safety [39 – 45].|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its annual}} death {{rate and the}} {{potential}} to cause pandemics, Influenza remains a major public health concern. Efforts to control the annual spread of influenza have centered on <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccinations.</b> Influenza viruses for human vaccine production are currently grown on embryonated eggs. However, this production process conveys major drawbacks such as lack of scalability, inability of some strains to replicate on eggs to high enough yields, and possible allergic reactions induced by egg proteins.

In recent years several continuous cell lines such as the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) have been successfully established for the production of influenza vaccines. These processes require the modification of existing downstream strategies to account for the modified upstream technology. The presented study focuses on the development of two downstream processing schemes for the purification of human Influenza A/PR/ 8 / 34 (H 1 N 1) virus. Purification scheme 1 is based on a combination of size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography. Scheme 2 is centered on a lectin affinity chromatography.

40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocyte}} (CTL) responses play {{a central}} role in viral suppression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. <b>Prophylactic</b> <b>vaccination</b> resulting in effective CTL responses after viral exposure would contribute to HIV control. It is important to know how CTL memory induction by vaccination affects postexposure CTL responses. We previously showed vaccine-based control of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenge in a group of Burmese rhesus macaques sharing a major histocompatibility complex class I haplotype. Gag 206 - 216 and Gag 241 - 249 epitope-specific CTL responses were responsible for this control. In the present study, we show the impact of individual epitope-specific CTL induction by <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccination</b> on postexposure CTL responses. In the acute phase after SIV challenge, dominant Gag 206 - 216 -specific CTL responses with delayed, naive-derived Gag 241 - 249 -specific CTL induction were observed in Gag 206 - 216 epitope-vaccinated animals with prophylactic induction of single Gag 206 - 216 epitope-specific CTL memory, and vice versa in Gag 241 - 249 epitope-vaccinated animals with single Gag 241 - 249 epitope-specific CTL induction. Animals with Gag 206 - 216 -specific CTL induction by vaccination selected for a Gag 206 - 216 -specific CTL escape mutation by week 5 and showed significantly less decline of plasma viral loads from week 3 to week 5 than in Gag 241 - 249 epitope-vaccinated animals without escape mutations. Our results present evidence indicating significant influence of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccination</b> on postexposure CTL immunodominance and cooperation of vaccine antigen-specific and non-vaccine antigen-specific CTL responses, which affects virus control.

The evaluation of humoral response was performed on a basis of agglutinin titre after administered antigen and the cellular immunity index was the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. The pheasants were prophylactically vaccinated against Newcastle Disease (ND) on the 1 st, 28 th and 56 th day of life.

40|$|Many {{countries}} have eliminated {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD), but outbreaks remain common in other countries. Rapid development {{of international trade}} in animals and animal products has increased the risk of disease introduction to FMD-free countries. Most mathematical models of FMD are tailored to settings that are normally disease-free, and few models have explored the impact of constrained control measures in a ‘near-endemic’ spatially distributed host population subject to frequent FMD re-introductions from nearby endemic wild populations, as characterizes many low-income, resource-limited countries. Here we construct a pair approximation model of FMD and investigate the impact of constraints on total vaccine supply for prophylactic and ring vaccination, and constraints on culling rates and cumulative culls. We incorporate natural immunity waning and vaccine waning, which are important factors for near-endemic populations. We find that, when vaccine supply is sufficiently limited, the optimal approach for minimizing cumulative infections combines rapid deployment of ring vaccination during outbreaks with a contrasting approach of careful rationing of <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccination</b> over the year, such that supplies last as long as possible (and with the bulk of vaccines dedicated toward <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccination).</b> Thus, for optimal long-term control of the disease by vaccination in near-endemic settings when vaccine supply is limited, it is best to spread out <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccination</b> as much as possible. Regardless of culling constraints, the optimal culling strategy is rapid identification of infected premises and their immediate contacts at the initial stages of an outbreak, and rapid culling of infected premises and farms deemed to be at high risk of infection (as opposed to culling only the infected farms). Optimal culling strategies are similar when social impact is the outcome of interest. We conclude that more FMD transmission models should be developed that are specific to the challenges of FMD control in near-endemic, low-income countries...|$|E

In a mouse model for Influenza vaccinations the specific alterations of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) Foxp 3 (+) regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the immune modulation induced by orally supplied oligosaccharides containing scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS was assessed. This dietary intervention increased vaccine specific DTH responses. In addition, a significant increased percentage of T-bet(+) (Th 1) activated CD 69 (+) CD 4 (+) T cells (p< 0. 001) and reduced percentage of Gata- 3 (+) (Th 2) activated CD 69 (+) CD 4 (+) T cells (p< 0. 001) was detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of mice receiving scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS compared to control mice. Although {{no difference in the}} number or percentage of Tregs (CD 4 (+) Foxp 3 (+)) could be determined after scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS intervention, the percentage of CXCR 3 (+) /T-bet(+) (Th 1 -Tregs) was significantly reduced (p< 0. 05) in mice receiving scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS as compared to mice receiving placebo diets. Moreover, although no absolute difference in suppressive capacity could be detected, an alteration in cytokine profile suggests a regulatory T cell shift towards a reducing Th 1 suppression profile, supporting an improved vaccination response. These data are indicative for improved vaccine responsiveness due to reduced Th 1 suppressive capacity in the Treg population of mice fed the oligosaccharide specific diet, showing compartmentalization within the Treg population. The modulation of Tregs to control immune responses provides an additional arm of intervention using alternative strategies possibly leading to the development of improved vaccines...|$|R

Control of annual spreading of influenza has centered on <b>prophylactic</b> <b>vaccinations</b> in combination with antiviral medications. Currently, efforts are undertaken to switch from conventional vaccine production processes using embryonated hen’s eggs, to continuous cell line cultures. Therefore, new downstream processing strategies have to be developed. One unit operation, which is often used in influenza virus purification, is column chromatography based on cellufine® sulphate. The main disadvantage of this method for this application is the limited flow rate due to the high back pressure, leading to a suboptimal productivity rate of the process. The present study describes a capturing method for cell culture derived influenza viruses based on sulphated reinforced cellulose membranes.

Purification efficiency concerning viral yield as well as total protein and host cell dsDNA reduction using sulphated membranes was directly compared to commercially available cation exchange adsorbers and to column based cellufine® sulphate resin. The modified membranes achieved high product recoveries and contaminant reduction. Due to a fast binding kinetic and a low back pressure, membrane adsorbers enable to operate the capturing process at an increased flow rate.

To help address this issue, we developed in vitro and {{in vivo models}} of dendritic cell (DC) immuno-therapy {{for the prevention of}} influenza virus infection. Methods. Human cord blood (CB) –derived or mouse splenocyte–derived DCs were loaded with purified re-combinant hemagglutinin (rHA). T-cell responses to HA-loaded CB-derived DCs were determined by ELISpot. Protective efficacy was determined by vaccination of BALB/c mice with a single injection of 106 autologous DCs. DC migration to peripheral lymphoid organs was verified by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester staining, and HA-specific antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mice were then challenged intranasally with BALB/c-adapted A/New Caledonia influenza virus derived from four consecutive lung pool pas-sages. Antigen-presenting cell (APC) dysfunction was modeled using the MAFIA transgenic system, in which the Csf 1 r promoter conditionally drives AP 20178 -inducible Fas. Results. CB-derived human DCs were able to generate de novo T-cell responses against rHA, as determined by a system of rigorous controls. Mice vaccinated intraperitoneally developed HA titers detectable at serum dilutions of> 1 : 1000. HA seroconverters survived virus challenge, whereas unvaccinated controls and vaccinated nonsero-converters lost weight and died. Furthermore, use of a model of APC-specific immunosuppression revealed that DC vaccination could generate HA-specific antibody titers under conditions in which protein vaccination could not. Conclusions. The model demonstrates that DC immunotherapy for the prevention of influenza is feasible, and studies are underway to determine whether populations of immunosuppressed individuals might ultimately benefit from the procedure...|$|R
