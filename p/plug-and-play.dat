The <b>plug-and-play</b> console will support HDMI, two-player modes, and have a controller similar to the original NES controller. The controller would be able to connect to a Wii Remote for use with Wii and Wii U Virtual Console titles. The NES Classic Edition came with 30 games pre-installed, including Final Fantasy, Kid Icarus, The Legend of Zelda, , and Dr. Mario, among others. It was released in November 2016. Additional controllers were also available.|$|E
25|$|Released October 26, 2007, the Sansa TakeTV {{is an easy}} to use <b>plug-and-play</b> {{storage device}} that allows the {{playback}} of DivX, Xvid, and M-PEG 4 files on an external display via the included dock and remote. Unlike other Sansa products, the TakeTV is not a digital audio player. The device comes in 4 and 8GB. While the user is free to use his own videos, TakeTV comes with FanFare, a program similar to iTunes, allowing the user to purchase premium content. On December 11, NBC Universal signed up with SanDisk to provide content on FanFare after having left Apple Inc in a similar deal. The TakeTV along with FanFare was discontinued on May 15, 2008.|$|E

2500|$|A senior Israeli {{air force}} {{official}} stated, [...] "the aircraft will be designated F-35I, as {{there will be}} unique Israeli features installed in them." [...] The United States initially refused to allow the integration of Israel's own electronic warfare systems into the aircraft’s built-in electronic suite. However, Israel planned {{the introduction of a}} <b>plug-and-play</b> feature added to the main computer to allow for the use of Israeli electronics in an add-on fashion, and to fit its own external jamming pod. The IAF dispatched two officers to the US where they discussed issues involving the integration of Israeli technology into the fighter with Pentagon and Lockheed Martin officials. In July 2011, it was reported that the U.S. had agreed to allow Israel to install its own electronic warfare systems and missiles in its F-35s in the future. In 2012 Lockheed was awarded a contract to make changes to the first Israeli F-35s to allow the installation of Israeli electronic warfare equipment produced by Elbit Systems. This equipment will use [...] "specific apertures... in the lower fuselage and leading edge". Israel also plans to install its own indigenously-produced guided bombs and air-to-air missiles in the F-35's internal weapon bays. Benni Cohen compared the Israel Aerospace Industries Command and control system to an iPhone App that would run on top of the central avionics.|$|E
