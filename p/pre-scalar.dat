40|$|Quantum {{detailed}} balance {{conditions are}} often formulated as relationships between a the generator of a Quantum Markov Semigroup and the generator of a dual semigroup {{with respect to}} a certain scalar product defined by an invariant state. In this paper we survey some results describing the structure of norm continuous Quantum Markov Semigroups on satisfying a quantum detailed balance condition when the duality is defined by means of <b>pre-scalar</b> products on of the form 〈 x,y〉_s:=(ρ^ 1 -sx^*ρ^sy) (s∈[0, 1]) in order to compare the resulting quantum versions of the classical detailed balance condition. Moreover, we discuss the structure of generators of Quantum Markov Semigroup which commute with the modular automorphism because this condition appears when we consider <b>pre-scalar</b> products with s= 1 / 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{mainstay}} of the paper {{is to use a}} PLL using self healing <b>pre-scalar.</b> When a CMOS technology approaches to a nanometer scale, the non-idealities like variability and leakage current may affect the circuit performances. The process variability leads to the large variations to degrade the device matching and performances. The leakage current is highly dependent upon the process variations. In the existing method the key parameter is to be change the modulus value of the pre- scalar. By changing the value of the <b>pre-scalar</b> the PLL frequency range will be extended. In the proposed design we are planning to implement the digital PLL technique with self correcting DCO. The structure utilizes the DDR synthesizer as a base for generating the DCO frequency, so many methods are there to correct the DCO errors, here we detect the error or delay and correct it by using smooth jumping method. The DPLL varies from minimum system clock frequency 60 to 1489 MHZ (Minimum) maximum of GHZ frequency of any range we can generate, since our design act as a general platform for any kind of application...|$|E
