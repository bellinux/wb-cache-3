As {{for the effort}} involved in the materials development, {{in addition to the}} ALS findings already mentioned (ALS, 1998), Rumble (2001, p. 79) reviews a study by Sparkes (1984, p. 219) who states that an academic needs between 2 to 10  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> conference, 1 to 10  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> small group session, 3 to 10  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> video recording, 50 to 100  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> text, around 100  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> live TV session, 200  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> tutorial and about 300  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> interactive software, not counting the time of the technical staff supporting the process. Many faculty would agree that these figures are not far from current ones, being the expertise of the academic and the possibility of repurposing available resources what makes the difference. Rumble points out that one way of keeping production costs within an acceptable range is by using an author-editor model with advisors supporting the author, rather than having permanent staff in charge of producing materials. He also states (p. 80) that because the quality of materials is critical, to achieve cost-efficiency, it is better to seek savings in recurrent costs such as course promotion.|$|R

The Union branches of the Ministry of Finance then <b>prepared</b> <b>a</b> budget estimate with information received from the lower Union ministries and information given {{to them by the}} all-Union Ministry of Finance. The state budget was conceived after the Union Ministry negotiated a compromise with its republican and local branches and each Soviet republic was given its own state budget.

The British ambassador was enthusiastic about the idea, and within one week he arranged for Montefiore a meeting with Reshid Pasha.

Rosario's real estate firms <b>prepared</b> <b>a</b> list of houses for rent without charging victims their regular fee.

According to al-Tabari, his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and freebooters. These numbers—and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor of 300,000 men—are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era and {{far more than the}} estimated strength of the entire Byzantine army.
