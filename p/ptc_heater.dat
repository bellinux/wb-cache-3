50|$|A ceramic <b>PTC</b> <b>heater</b> is made {{of small}} ceramic pieces pressed between two metal plates. The {{constraint}} compartment causes them to get a strong PTC effect. The typical temperature of ceramic stones is 140-250 °C (284-482 °F). Ceramic stones actually have Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) properties at low temperatures which makes them slow to heat up.|$|E

They can be powered with any voltage between 5 and 400 V, AC or DC.|$|R

50|$|A rubber <b>PTC</b> <b>heater</b> is {{made from}} a special type of rubber which conducts electricity, but only up to a {{temperature}} which is defined at {{the production of the}} PTC rubber. Typical design temperatures are between 0-80 °C (32-176 °F). The resistivity of the rubber increases exponentially with temperature for all temperatures up to the design temperature. Hence, it has strong PTC properties for all temperatures and heats up rapidly. Above this temperature the rubber is an electrical isolator and cease to produce heat. This makes the heater self-limiting. The rubber foil is thin and flexible and can be formed to any shape and size.|$|E
50|$|When {{a voltage}} {{is applied to}} a <b>PTC</b> <b>heater</b> {{electrical}} current flows through the material and the resistivity of the material causes it to heat up (P(T)=U∧2÷R(T)). As it heats up the resistivity increases rapidly and the power (heat) produced decreases. At the same time heat is being transferred from the heater to the object it is attached to, and its surrounding. Eventually the amount of heat produced is in equilibrium {{with the amount of}} heat conducted and radiated away from the heater. The heater reaches its equilibrium temperature and remains there. The exponential PTC properties of the material assures that the equilibrium temperature is virtually insensitive to changes in the ambient temperatures.|$|E
40|$|At present, {{efforts are}} made to improve the passenger’s thermal comfort inside the vehicle. The thermal comfort level depends on the air {{conditioning}} and heating system. The conventional heating systems use the heat excess delivered by the vehicle’s engine. Nevertheless, this heat excess is insufficient for warming the interior air to a comfort level. In order to improve the conventional heating method, auxiliary heating devices are required. The paper deals with the analysis and measurement of the <b>PTC</b> <b>heater</b> characteristics.

40|$|Today, the {{automobile}} industry {{is driven by the}} urge to reduce emissions and to achieve the low CO 2 emission targets that are set by the European Legislation to reduce the average CO 2 emissions of a manufacturer's eet below 95 g/km by 2021. This has led to the focus on Mild Hybrid technology. This involves the introduction of a higher system voltage i. e. 48 V. However, the initial generation of Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicles is expected to have both 48 V and 12 V systems. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the potential benets of shifting electrical loads to the 48 V supply in the future Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicles at Volvo Car Corporation (VC). A literature study has been carried out to identify the loads on the existing 12 V automotive electrical network that could be considered to be suitable for a 48 V operation. The whole system has been modelled in MatLab R Simulink R and simulations were carried out to evaluate their performance at three temperatures (20 C, + 20 C and + 40 C). The savings in fuel consumption due to moving of loads to the 48 V bus have been analysed. Also, new loads that could improve the user experience have been identied. The complete system has been evaluated for its electrical performance and fuel consumption. The weight reduction by shifting loads to the 48 V bus have also been looked into. The results suggest that the 48 V mild hybrid system eciency is high during high loading condition primarily due to the increased eciency of Belt Driven Starter Generator (BSG). The fuel savings at 20 C, + 20 C and + 40 C have been estimated to be 376 ml/ 100 km, 32 ml/ 100 km and 103 ml/ 100 km respectively for the WLTP cycle. The considerable benet on reduced fuel consumption is also due to the higher amount of energy that is recuperated at 48 V. Due to these abilities of the BSG, it is still advantageous to supply the present day 12 V electrical network from a 48 V BSG through a DC/DC converter. The <b>PTC</b> <b>heaters,</b> defrosters, blowers, EPS, cooling fan and fuel pump could be supplied from a 48 V network in the initial generation of MHEVs...|$|R
40|$|It is {{essential}} to optimize HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning) system for a thermal plant or an electric vehicle since it has {{a significant effect on}} the thermal efficiency. PTC (positive temperature coefficient) heaters are often used for a heating system and the power module of the PTC heaters, IGBT (insulated gate bipolar mode transistor), requires thermal management. In this study, in order to maximize the cooling performance for IGBT, a novel method that uses forced convection inside the HVAC duct with heat sinks was developed. In addition, heat sinks were optimized in terms of IGBT junction temperature and heat sink weight by 3 -dimensional CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation. The results show that the junction temperature of IGBT for 5. 6 kW <b>PTC</b> <b>heater</b> can be maintained at about 335 K...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-voltage}} positive {{temperature coefficient}} (<b>PTC)</b> <b>heater</b> has a simple structure and a swift response. Therefore, for cabin heating in electric vehicles (EVs), such heaters are used either {{on their own or}} with a heat pump system. In this study, the sintering process in the manufacturing of PTC elements for an EV heating system was improved to enhance surface uniformity. The electrode production process entailing thin-film sputtering deposition was applied to ensure the high heating performance of PTC elements and reduce the electrode thickness. The allowable voltage and surface heat temperature of the high-voltage PTC elements with thin-film electrodes were 800 V and 172 °C, respectively. The electrode layer thickness was uniform at approximately 3. 8 μm or less, approximately 69 % less electrode materials were required compared to that before process improvement. Furthermore, a heater for the EV heating system was manufactured using the developed high-voltage PTC elements to verify performance and reliability...|$|E
