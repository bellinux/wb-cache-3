40|$|The {{ensemble}} Kalman filter (EnKF) {{is increasingly}} {{used to improve}} the real-time prediction of groundwater states and the estimation of uncertain hydraulic subsurface parameters through assimilation of measurement data like groundwater levels and concentration data. At the interface between surface water and groundwater, measured groundwater temperature data can provide an additional source of information for subsurface characterizations with EnKF. Additionally, an improved prediction of the temperature field itself is often desirable for groundwater management. In this work, we investigate the worth of a joint assimilation of hydraulic and thermal observation data on the state and parameter estimation with EnKF for two different model setups: (i) a simple synthetic model of a river-aquifer system where the parameters and simulation conditions were perfectly known and (ii) {{a model of the}} Limmat aquifer in Zurich (Switzerland) where an exhaustive set of real-world observations of groundwater levels (87) and temperatures (22) was available for assimilation (year 2007) and verification (year 2011). Results for the synthetic case suggest that a joint assimilation of <b>piezometric</b> <b>heads</b> and groundwater temperatures together with updating of uncertain hydraulic parameters gives the best estimation of states and hydraulic properties of the model. For the real-world case, the prediction of groundwater temperatures could also be improved through data assimilation with EnKF. For the validation period, it was found that parameter fields updated with <b>piezometric</b> <b>heads</b> reduced RMSE's of states significantly (heads − 49 %, temperature − 15 %), but an additional conditioning of parameters on groundwater temperatures only influenced the characterization of the temperature field...|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{aquifers}} salinization is {{an urgent}} problem driven by groundwater resources overexploitation and climate changes. This phenomenon is enhanced in areas lying below the sea level, like the Po river lowland (Italy). In these reclaimed lands the saltwater intrusion is usually {{stopped by a}} dense canals network that supply freshwater to agricultural lands, maintaining soil salinity at acceptable levels. 2012 was a terrible year for irrigation, since the whole Po river plain experienced a prolonged drought. Despite of this, a continuous monitoring of <b>piezometric</b> <b>heads</b> and salinity near a canal demonstrated that freshening was occurring in the first 4 m of the unconfined aquifer. The unconfined aquifer is characterized by elevated relic salinity, especially in its bottom part. A two-dimensional model, implemented via SEAWAT 4. 0, was calibrated using <b>piezometric</b> <b>heads</b> and salinity depth profiles in a section perpendicular to the canal. The calibrated model was then used to forecast the behaviour of this cross section using a multiple scenario approach: increase of evapotranspiration induced by temperature raise, onset of extreme events in the temporal distribution of rainfall and managed canal dry up due to salinization of surface water. The first two scenarios have only minor influence on the aquifer salinization rate, while the third one could create serious upconing of the high salinity groundwater actually residing {{in the bottom of}} the unconfined aquifer. The scenario modelling quantified the possible future effects on groundwater salinization and could be useful to find adaptation strategies to manage the water resources of this area...|$|R
40|$|In 2003, Crenshaw and Santi {{developed}} {{a method for}} calculating average <b>piezometric</b> <b>heads</b> between horizon-tal drains in a slope. The method relies on drain flow rates, slope geometry, and soil hydraulic conductivity. The corrugated shape of groundwater profiles between drains and {{the departure of the}} groundwater surface from the drain near its uphill end were verified using laboratory-scale physical and computer modeling. In 2007, a study was conducted seeking to confirm these findings using field-scale modeling. The test site con-sists of a 2 H: 1 V (2 horizontal: 1 vertical), 30 3 12 ft (9. 1 3 3. 7 m) concrete slope representing low-perme-ability bedrock. Five perforated pipes embedded in the concrete are used to simulate base-flow recharge. The concrete was covered with a lean clay, and two wick drains were installed at a spacing of 8 ft (2. 4 m). Fifty standpipe piezometers were installed to measure ground-water profiles between and along drains. Measurements were taken during recharge and drawdown events. The test was repeated with a clayey sand. Test results generally confirm the findings of Crenshaw and Santi, with some localized variations in groundwater profiles. The variations are most likely due to factors such as heterogeneous soil properties, the development of preferential pathways, boundary effects, etc. Field-testing also yielded additional information about the behavior of drained slopes that may be useful for future slope-stability projects. As a result of this research, recommendations for using Crenshaw and Santi’s method to estimate <b>piezometric</b> <b>heads</b> between short, high-angle sub-horizontal drains in shallow landslides for use in slope-stability analyses are provided...|$|R
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} embodies {{research work}} pertaining to two broad categories of groundwater flow problems, i. e. identification of parameters and simulation of groundwater flow. The first category, i. e. the identification problems, researched and {{presented in this}} dissertation include: identification of aquifer parameters i. e. Storage coefficient, S, and Transmissivity, T; and identification of well hydraulic parameters i. e. the formation loss coefficient, entry loss coefficient and turbulence loss coefficient. In the first attempt, a formulation is developed in framework of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a computer model is developed, which inversely and optimally identifies aquifer parameters, Transmissivity and Storativity. The model and its formulation are validated by comparing the model results with the ones obtained through the Theis conventional approach and also with the prototype data. Minimization of the objective function logically convinces towards substantiation of the solution obtained {{in the framework of}} GA technique. Next, an optimal identification of the well hydraulic parameters, i. e., formation loss coefficient, entry loss coefficient, turbulence loss coefficient, and eventually determination of well efficiency, is achieved. Jacob’s equation is formulated in the framework of GA, which ultimately resulted {{in the development of a}} computer model coded in C++ language. The parameters are identified through minimization of an objective function. Moreover, validity of the model is also endorsed on the basis of statistical analysis while comparing simulated drawdowns against the observed ones. Through the present research, Jacob and Singh’s assumptions for constant value of turbulence loss coefficient is found misleading; whereas, Rorabaugh and Todd’s opinion is ascertained. Hence, it may be concluded that, the formulation made in the sense of GA technique and the computer model developed in this study, are valid enough to use. Under the second category, i. e. simulation of groundwater flow, firstly a twodimensional simulation of steady-state groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer is carried out. A computer model in the framework of FEM is developed, coded in FORTRAN language, and applied to a real field problem consisting of twodimensional horizontal domain for prediction of <b>piezometric</b> <b>heads,</b> flow field under the most drought period of the year. The results are substantiated on the basis of minimization of residuals between observed and simulated <b>piezometric</b> <b>heads</b> at the Dirichlet points. Furthermore, the model estimates the effective lift and accordingly a tubewell zoning map is prepared, which is deemed to be a good tool for guidance of irrigation practitioners to opt for appropriate tubewell technology by signifying the proper locations. Lastly, a two-dimensional equation of mass conservation; governing saturated groundwater flow under transient conditions in a confined aquifer is simulated with source or sink terms by developing a computer model, coded in FORTRAN language, in the framework of FEM. While employing FEM in spatial sense, weighted residual technique is used as per Galerkin’s approach; whereas time derivative is solved by using interpolation functions and lumped element type scheme of Crank-Nicholson. The model is implemented to a real field problem consisting of two-dimensional horizontal domain together with a sink penetrating fully into a confined aquifer for prediction of <b>piezometric</b> <b>heads</b> (equipotential lines) and thereby by formation of cone of depression, distribution of flow field signifying stream lines with velocity vectors and determination of the radius of influence of the well when it achieves stationary condition.

The GIS was used as additive tool to develop supportive data for numerical groundwater flow modeling, integration, analysis and presentation of image processing and modeling results. The thematic layers of landforms, landuse, hydrology, infrastructure and climate were developed using Geographic Information System (GIS). The RS data was used to analysis surface hydrological conditions and landcover/landuse status in order to conceptualize the recharge/discharge sources involved in groundwater system and to observe the behaviour of waterlogging and salinity in the area. A steady-state model was calibrated for 1985 hydrologic conditions when water levels in the aquifer were near equilibrium. The model was calibrated to an average residual of 0. 06 m and variance of 1. 46 m using automatic parameter method - PEST. The model was calibrated again in transient-state condition over a six-month period of wet period using steady-state heads as initial condition.

The 2012 was dramatic in terms of agricultural water supply, since the Po River plain experienced a prolonged drought. Despite this, continuous monitoring of <b>piezometric</b> <b>heads</b> and total dissolved solids (TDS) near a canal (Canale della Gronda) demonstrated that freshening was occurring in the shallow portion (first 4 m) of the unconfined aquifer, while the bottom part was characterized by elevated relic salinity.

Moreover, for each scenario, two sub-scenarios were run to account for projected sea level rise.
