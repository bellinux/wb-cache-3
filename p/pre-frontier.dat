40|$|Using {{the concept}} of pre-open set, we {{introduce}} and study topological properties of pre-limit points, pre-derived sets, preinterior and pre-closure of a set, pre-interior points, pre-border, prefrontier and pre-exterior. The relations between pre-derived set (resp. pre-limit point, pre-interior (point), pre-border, <b>pre-frontier,</b> and preexterior) and α-derived set (resp. α-limit point, α-interior (point), α-border, α-frontier, and α-exterior) are investigated...|$|E
40|$|Urbanization of forested {{wilderness}} {{could threaten}} biodiversity if expanding cities drive demand for wildlife as food. We examined {{the scale and}} drivers of urban wildlife consumption in the forested <b>pre-frontier</b> of Brazilian Amazonia, defined as municipalities (n = 73) with over 90 % of their original forest cover still intact. A representative survey of two <b>pre-frontier</b> cities indicated that virtually all urban households consume wildlife, including fish (99 %), bush-meat (mammals and birds) (79 %), chelonians (48 %) and caimans (28 %) – alarming evidence of an under-reported wild-meat crisis {{in the heart of}} Amazonia. We also report rapid growth of cities and inadequate resources to deter illegal consumption in this urbanized wilderness covering 1. 86 million square kilometres. We evaluate relevant policy levers and conclude that poverty-alleviation programs may accelerate a long-term transition from consumption of wildlife as an economical source of protein for the poor to luxury food for the wealthy. We argue that innovative environmental governance could limit wildlife consumption to only harvest-tolerant species. Researchers and policy-makers should engage with policies and ideas that promote poverty alleviation and supply poor city-dwellers with affordable alternatives to eating wildlife...|$|E
