5|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, {{given the lack of}} a precise census and variations in definitions during that era.

The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of Demosthenes, corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BC and 307 BC, the tyrant Demetrius Phalereus ordered a general census of Attica, which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves. The orator Hypereides, in his Against Areistogiton, recalls that the effort to enlist 15,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Southern Greeks at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), which corresponds to the figures of Ctesicles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The paper {{analyzes}} the characteristics {{and evolution of}} income distribution in the Brazilian agricultural sector, comparing it with the overall distribution or with the non-agricultural sector, considering two dimensions: the <b>per</b> capita <b>household</b> income and the income of occupied persons. The main data source is the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD). In order to fulfill this purpose, the <b>per</b> capita <b>household</b> income was divided into nine components (for Brazil and considering only the agricultural households) to evaluate {{their contributions to the}} decrease in inequality. In the second part, the paper {{analyzes the}} characteristics of occupied persons and the determining factors of their income, always comparing the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. The estimated effects were analyzed over the period 1992 - 2012, adjusting one earnings equation for each year. In both cases (<b>per</b> capita <b>household</b> income and earnings of occupied persons), the agricultural sector showed a markedly different behavior. Regarding the <b>per</b> capita <b>household</b> income, though from 2001 to 2009 the rate of reduction in inequality among agricultural households is similar to the one observed in Brazil as a whole, the determinants associated with this reduction are clearly different in the agricultural sector. Concerning the income of occupied persons, the reduction in inequality is less intense and more irregular in the agricultural sector. The various factors that determin...|$|R
