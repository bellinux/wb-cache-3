50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>reporting</b> {{is a part}} of Monitoring {{control and}} {{surveillance}} of Commercial fishing. Depending on national and local fisheries management practices, <b>catch</b> <b>reports</b> may reveal illegal fishing practices, or simply indicate that a given area is being overfished.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the local}} fishery economy permits, perhaps with {{international}} funding, near-real-time <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> {{will become a}} basic feature of vessel management systems. Software at fisheries management centers will cross-correlate VMS position information, <b>catch</b> <b>reports,</b> and spot inspection reports.|$|R

50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>reports</b> are not {{themselves}} part of VMS, but often will {{be correlated with}} VMS data {{as part of an}} overall fisheries MCS program.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} basic component, aboard fishing vessels, are the logs and <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> {{completed}} by the fishers themselves. Closely associated are reports prepared by onboard observers.|$|R
50|$|In the EU and US {{there is}} a {{distinct}} trend to making <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> {{part of an overall}} MCS program, although current VMS systems rarely integrate this capability with position reporting. One system that does to this is Fulcrum Maritime Systems Limited's Vessel Tracking Service which uses the latest data rich satellite application technology to enable electronic <b>catch</b> <b>reports</b> to be sent from the vessel to the VMS directly and automatically sends the report and vessel position data to the appropriate RFO or Regulatory Fishing Body, such as the NEAFC.|$|R
50|$|The salmon fish <b>catches</b> <b>{{reported}}</b> {{from this}} area are, sockeye/red salmon, herring, chum/dog salmon, chinook/king salmon, and pink salmon (humpies). Other fauna reported are bear, beaver, mink and sea otter.|$|R
50|$|Of the 280,000 tons of lobster <b>catches</b> <b>reported</b> to the Food and Agriculture Organization for {{the year}} 2010, 188,000 t (67%) was of true {{lobsters}} (family Nephropidae), 80,000 t (28%) was of spiny lobsters (Palinuridae) and about 10,000 t (4%) was of slipper lobsters (Scyllaridae).|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} of {{economic}} importance, commercially sought after, and caught by trawl by Japanese and Taiwanese fishermen. The total <b>catch</b> <b>reported</b> for this species in 1999 was 10,871 t, with Taiwan (5,075 t), and Japan (4,996 t) making up {{nearly all the}} catch.|$|R

"Croakers do not {{get much}} ink in the fishing news these days, {{but there was a}} time when they were a major item in {{newspaper}} <b>catch</b> <b>reports</b> (in Southern California).

50|$|Some Vessel {{monitoring}} systems have features that collect, from keyboard input, {{the data that}} constitutes a <b>catch</b> <b>report</b> for the entire voyage. More advanced systems periodically transmit the current catch as electronic mail, so fisheries management centers can determine if a controlled area needs to be closed to further fishing.|$|R
50|$|Not all VMS {{systems are}} {{required}} to record and transmit <b>catch</b> <b>reports.</b> On the systems with separate PCs, it is reasonably easy to distribute separate software, although the fishermen {{may or may not}} be able to install it without assistance and additional equipment. For VMS with dedicated PCs, additional software can be made part of software support with established channels.|$|R
50|$|The general {{industry}} {{practice is}} to write out a <b>catch</b> <b>report</b> on paper, and present it to a fisheries management official when they return to port. If information does not seem plausible to the official, the report may be verified by physical inspection of the catch. Alternatively, a suspicious vessel may need to carry an independent observer on future voyages.|$|R
50|$|FMC {{software}} can note {{the time a}} vessel leaves and returns to port, and the time it is inside or outside designated areas. There may be restrictions on trip length, time in an area, etc., which can be calculated directly from VMS data. Other observations may require correlation of <b>catch</b> <b>reports</b> with the vessel's presence in given areas. Presence in other areas may require an onboard observer.|$|R
50|$|VMS is a {{planning}} and analysis tool {{as well as}} an aid to operations. Treated as a research database, the cumulative position reports gives an analysis of fishing vessel tracks in search of fish. Coupled with species-specific fishing licenses and <b>catch</b> <b>reports,</b> fisheries managers can estimate the amount of a given fish in an area, the amount taken by fishing vessels, and project overfishing before it happens.|$|R
25|$|Considerable {{catches of}} {{northern}} whiting are made but generally not {{reflected in the}} fishery statistics of countries they are taken in. In Pakistan the main fishery takes place in June to July. The <b>catches</b> <b>reported</b> in this single country range from 102 t (1980) to 859 t (1982) {{with an average of}} 404 t. The species has come under heavy threat in Chinese waters from overfishing and environmental pollution.|$|R
50|$|Black marlin {{are still}} found in Peruvian waters, {{but the main}} sport-fishing {{destination}} in the region nowadays is further north in Salinas, Ecuador. Black marlin are normally outnumbered in <b>catch</b> <b>reports</b> by the more prolific striped and blue marlin, but some big fish continue to be caught. The traditional method of sport fishing is trolling with natural baits, large ballyhoo being commonly used, while searching for finning fish.|$|R

50|$|Resource {{degradation}} {{has reduced}} output from forestry. In 2004 roundwood removals came to 22,162,000 cubic meters. Fisheries are of local importance around Lake Victoria and have potential on Lake Turkana. Kenya's total <b>catch</b> <b>reported</b> in 2004 was 128,000 metric tons. However, output from fishing {{has been declining}} because of ecological disruption. Pollution, overfishing, {{and the use of}} unauthorised fishing equipment have led to falling catches and have endangered local fish species.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999 {{the total}} <b>catch</b> <b>reported</b> by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation was 35,411 tonnes {{with the two}} biggest <b>catches</b> being <b>reported</b> from the United Kingdom and France which landed 19,108 tonnes and 12.745 tonnes respectively. It is {{believed}} that some natural stocks are showing indications of over exploitation resulting in strict enforcement of fisheries legislation and {{by the development of}} stock enhancement practices. [...] Great scallops are fished for using Newhaven scallop dredges although a very small percentage, i.e. less than 5% is gathered by hand by divers. In total the scallop fisher for P. maximus. and for the Queen scallop Aequipecten opercularis are one of the top five fisheries by value in United Kingdom waters. However, the use of towed great to harvest scallops causes damage to the wider ecosystem.|$|R
40|$|Global {{fisheries}} are overexploited worldwide, yet crucial <b>catch</b> statistics <b>reported</b> to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) by {{member countries}} remain unreliable. Recent advances in remote-sensing technology allowus to viewfishing practices from space andmiti-gate gaps in <b>catch</b> <b>reporting.</b> Here, we use Google Earth to count intertidal fishing weirs {{off the coast}} of six countries in the Persian Gulf, otherwise known as the Arabian Gulf. (Although the name of this body of water remains contentious, we use the name used in Google Earth). Combining, in a Monte Carlo procedure, the number of weirs (after correcting for poor resolution and imagery availability) with assumptions about daily catch and fishing season lengths, we estimate that 1900 (+ 79) weirs contribute to a regional catch up to six times higher than the officially <b>reported</b> <b>catches</b> of 5260 t. These results, which speak to the unreliability of officially reported fisheries sta-tistics, provide the first example of fisheries catch estimates from space, and point to the potential for remote-sensing approaches to val-idate catch statistics and fisheries operations in general...|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} of the cod stock in NAFO Division 3 M is performed. A Bayesian model, as used in the last assessments, was used to perform the analysis. As there are inconsistencies with total catch {{of the last four}} years, a prior was added for 2011 and 2012 catch, the Daily <b>Catch</b> <b>Report</b> data were used in 2013 and the STATLANT 21 A in 2014. Results indicate a general increase in SSB since 2005, reaching a value well above Blim since 2009...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of wild fish stocks {{by means of}} catch quotas requires reliable data on fishing mortality. Norwegian authorities have attempted to ensure the reliability of this data through <b>catch</b> <b>report</b> procedures and a ban on dumping. The reliability of data on fishing mortality depends on the fishers' compliance with these regulations. This article outlines the main factors that govern compliance and non-compliance in the Norwegian pelagic fisheries. Data was generated during fieldwork in the offshore pelagic fishing fleet.

25|$|The {{study of}} fish in India was also {{initially}} restricted to that which was of commercial value. Sport fishing was also popular but restricted to major hill areas. Not much is documented of the sport fishing beyond record <b>catches</b> <b>reported</b> in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. Notable publications on the fishes of India were made by Sir Francis Day (1829–1889), Captain Robert Cecil Beavan (1841–1870) and Francis Buchanan-Hamilton (1762–1829). Some works on sport fishing were also published with several notable works by Henry Sullivan Thomas.|$|R

25|$|The main {{duty of the}} IWC is to keep {{under review}} and revise as {{necessary}} the measures laid down in the Schedule to the Convention which govern the conduct of whaling throughout the world. These measures, among other things, provide for the complete protection of certain species; designate specified areas as whale sanctuaries; set limits on the numbers and size of whales which may be taken; prescribe open and closed seasons and areas for whaling; and prohibit the capture of suckling calves and female whales accompanied by calves. The compilation of <b>catch</b> <b>reports</b> and other statistical and biological records is also required.|$|R

40|$|Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) assign {{property rights}} in fisheries by granting individual fishers a tradable {{share of the}} total allowable catch (TAC). ITQs were originally proposed to enhance profitability and safety, but may also provide incentives for more conservation-minded fishing practices. Indeed, recent empirical evidence shows {{a reduction in the}} likelihood of stock collapse and a threefold increase in catches two decades after ITQ implementation. Yet these spectacular catch increases follow modest 20 % reductions in <b>reported</b> <b>catches.</b> We used standard fisheries models to analyze whether these catch trends are consistent with the theory underlying conservation benefits from property rights. We find that it appears unlikely that catch increases are attributable to ITQs alone. Improved <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> systems are often enacted concurrent with ITQs and may plausibly explain sustained catch increases. The existence of this alternative explanation warrants caution about claims that property rights are the cause of sustainable catch gains...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{used the}} X- 11 census {{technique}} for modelling and forecasting the monthly swordfish (Xiphias gladius) catches in the Greek Seas during 1982 - 1996 and 1997 respectively, using <b>catches</b> <b>reported</b> by the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG). Forecasts built with X- 11 were also compared with those derived from ARIMA andWinter’s exponential smoothing (WES) models. The X- 11 method captured {{the features of the}} study series and outperformed the other two methods, in terms of both fitting and forecasting performance, for all the accuracy measures used. Thus, with the exception of October, November and December 1997, when the corresponding absolute percentage error(APE) values were very high (as high as 178. 6 %) because of the low level of the catches, monthly catches during the remaining months of 1997 were predicted accurately, with a mean APE of 12. 5 %. In contrast, the mean APE values of the other two methods for the same months were higher (ARIMA: 14. 6 %; WES: 16. 6 %). The overall good performance of X- 11 andthe fact that it provides an insight into the various components (i. e. the seasonal, trend-cycle and irregular components) of the time series of interest justify its use in fisheries research. The basic features of the swordfish catches revealed by the application of the X- 11 method, the effect of the length of the forecasting horizon on forecasting accuracy and the accuracy of the <b>catches</b> <b>reported</b> by NSSG are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|Snares {{are one of}} the {{simplest}} traps and are very effective. They are cheap to produce and easy to set in large numbers. A snare traps an animal around the neck or the body; a snare consists of a noose made usually by wire or a strong string. Snares are widely criticised by animal welfare groups for their cruelty. UK users of snares accept that over 40% of animals caught in some environments will be non-target animals, although non-target captures range from 21% to 69% depending on the environment. In the USA, non-target <b>catches</b> <b>reported</b> by users of snares in Michigan were 17 +/- 3%.|$|R
