40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{consists of}} the theoretical introduction into pressing the nuts, familiarization with used machines followed by testing and evaluating of outcomes. <b>Pressing</b> the <b>nuts</b> is tested for torque and pulling force. In the practical part of the thesis chosen <b>press</b> <b>nuts</b> will be tested. Objective of this thesis {{is to find out}} suitable pressing parameters, which can substitute present unsuitable practices...|$|R

5000|$|Jam Nuts - Two nuts, {{tightened}} on each other. In {{this application}} a thinner nut {{should be placed}} adjacent to the joint, and a thicker nut tightened onto it. The thicker nut applies more force to the joint, first relieving the force on the threads of the thinner nut and then applying a force in the opposite direction. In this way the thicker <b>nut</b> <b>presses</b> tightly {{on the side of}} the threads away from the joint, while the thinner <b>nut</b> <b>presses</b> {{on the side of the}} threads nearest the joint, tightly locking the two nuts against the threads in both directions.|$|R

50|$|Tung oil is <b>pressed</b> {{from the}} <b>nuts</b> of the tung tree. Raw tung cures better than raw linseed {{and so it}} is often used in this form. As tung oil yellows with age less than linseed, it is favoured for high quality and {{furniture}} work.|$|R
40|$|Tiger nut (Cyperus esculentus) tuber {{contains}} {{oil that}} {{is high in}} monounsaturated fatty acids, and this oil makes up about 23 % of the tuber. The study aimed at evaluating the impact of several factors and enzymatic pre-treatment on the recovery of <b>pressed</b> tiger <b>nut</b> oil. Smaller particles were more favourable for pressing. High pressure pre-treatment did not increase oil recovery but enzymatic treatment did. The highest yield obtained by enzymatic treatment prior to mechanical extraction was 33 % on a dry defatted basis, which represents a recovery of 90 % of the oil. Tiger nut oil consists mainly of oleic acid; its acid and peroxide values reflect the high stability of the oil...|$|R
30|$|Three {{different}} oil-borne preservatives were used. The {{first was}} a water-miscible commercial product, Elit Träskydd (Beckers, Stockholm, Sweden). This preservative contains additives such as propiconazole (0.6  %) and 3 -iodo- 2 -propynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC, 0.3  %), with modified linseed oil as a binder and water as a solvent. The second preservative was a commercially produced pine tar mixed in boiled linseed oil with turpentine (Claessons Trätjära AB, Göteborg, Sweden) for thinning the oil-based preservatives {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 4 : 2, respectively. The third preservative was commercial 100  % tung oil (Pelard AB, Stockholm, Sweden). This oil, <b>pressed</b> from <b>nuts</b> of tung tree (Aleurites fordii Hemsl.), is reported to confer fungal resistance to treated wood [25]. All preservative solutions were stirred properly before use. Elit Träskydd and pine tar are referred to as Beckers and tar, respectively, in the following sections.|$|R

The nuts yield 70 - 75% of the greenish-yellow inedible oil. The oil originates in Polynesia, where it continues {{to play an important}} cultural role.

40|$|A {{composite}} nut {{is shown}} which permits a fastener to be inserted or removed {{from either side}} with an indicator of fastener engagement. The nut has a plurality of segments, preferably at least three segments, which are internally threaded, spring loaded apart by an internal spring, and has detents on opposite sides which force the nut segments into operative engagements with a threaded member when pushed in and release the segments for quick insertion or removal of the nut when moved out. When the nut is installed, end pressure {{on one of the}} detents <b>presses</b> the <b>nut</b> segments into operative engagement with a threaded member where continued rotation locks the structure together with the detents depressed to indicate positive locking engagement of the nut. On removal, counterclockwise rotation of the nut relieves the endwise pressure on the detents, permitting internal springs to force the detents outward and allowing the nut segments to move outward and separate to permit quick removal of the fastener...|$|R

50|$|The {{second type}} of captive nut is a {{threaded}} insert. These are either pressed into holes in the material to be joined or moulded in. In either case, part of the insert is generally knurled {{to get a good}} grip on the material supporting the insert. One variant, the swage nut, has a knurled portion that swages the sides of a soft metal hole to more tightly grip the <b>nut.</b> <b>Press</b> fit and swaged captive nuts are used in panels that are too thin to be threaded or in soft materials that are too weak to be threaded. They are installed by pressing them in with an arbor press.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to study cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) utilized as rubber plasticizer in shoe soles preparation. CNSL found from <b>pressed</b> cashew <b>nut</b> shells. CNSL consists of anacardict acid (90 %) and cardol (10 %). To remove the poison ivy, CNSL was treated by heating them at temperature 1200 C for two hours. Sulfuric acid was also added to remove the impurities such as nitrogenous, sulphur and inorganic matters. Compounding process was carried out on two roll mill. Shoe sole compounds were prepared in various level of CNSL and Minarex B oil either separated formulation or in combination. Vulcanized rubber was then tested based on SNI 12 - 0172 - 1987 : Canvas shoes for general. The result of the research showed that CNSL can be utilized as rubber plasticizer in the shoe soles preparation. Compound with 5 phr CNSL provided good physical properties and conformed the requirements of SNI 12 - 0172 - 1987, such as tensile strength 136, 4 kg/cm 2, elongation at break 198, 3 %, tear resistance 63, 56 kg/cm 2, hardness 62, 3 shore A, density 1, 13 g/cm 3, Grasselli abrasion resistance 0, 711 mm 3 / kgm, permanent set 6, 40 % and no crack detected on the flex cracking test. The research showed also that compound {{with the addition of}} 5 phr Minarex B oil into the compound, the CNSL provided better physical properties...|$|R
2500|$|Andrew Culbertson {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{settlers}} to have success in the Duboistown area. He purchased several tracts of land beginning in 1773, including the parcel owned by Samuel Boone, near the mouth of Mosquito Run. Culbertson is thought to have moved into the by crossing an Indian Trail over White Deer Mountain that is now known as Culbertson's Path. He built a sawmill on the mouth of the creek so after moving to the area and there he lived for several years. Culbertson was forced to flee the area during the American Revolutionary War, when settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the [...] "Big Runaway" [...] occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Settlers abandoned their homes and fields, drove their livestock south, and towed their possessions on rafts on the river to Sunbury. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the [...] "Little Runaway". Culbertson returned to the area and rebuilt his sawmill. He also built a gristmill, distillery, and a <b>press</b> that extracted <b>nut</b> and linseed oils. His gristmill was especially important to the development of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. It was easily accessible by canoe. Farmers could float their grain in their canoes or other watercraft right up to the mill. Other farmers from the surrounding valleys reached his mill via Culbertonson's Path. Culbertson saw another business opportunity with the farmers who were coming to his mill. He quickly built a tavern in which the weary farmers could enjoy a drink and get some food while they waited for their grain to be ground into flour. This tavern became a popular destination for the young people of the West Branch Valley. Today Culbertson's Mill and tavern are long gone, and the area is a largely overgrown riverbank with an abandoned softball field surrounded by a railroad, bridge, and woods.|$|R
