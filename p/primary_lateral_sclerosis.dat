How-ever, little research has been conducted to test whether nutritional interventions might ameliorate the disease course in humans. Here we review the currently available evidence supporting the potential role of dietary interventions as a therapeutic tool for amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Ultimately, determining whether a high-fat or ketogenic diet could be beneficial in amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> will require large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} nature of pathomolecular {{alterations}} preceding onset of symptoms in amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> is largely lacking. It could not only pave the way for the discovery of valuable therapeutic targets but might also govern future concepts of pre-manifest disease modifying treatments. MicroRNAs are central regulators of transcriptome plasticity and participate in pathogenic cascades and/or mirror cellular adaptation to insults. We obtained comprehensive expression profiles of microRNAs in the serum of patients with familial amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> asymptomatic mutation carriers and healthy control subjects. We observed a strikingly homogenous microRNA profile in patients with familial amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> that was largely independent from the underlying disease gene. Moreover, we identified 24 significantly downregulated microRNAs in pre-manifest amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> mutation carriers up to two decades or more before the estimated time window of disease onset; 91. 7 % of the downregulated microRNAs in mutation carriers overlapped with the patients with familial amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Bioinformatic analysis revealed a consensus sequence motif present {{in the vast majority of}} downregulated microRNAs identified in this study. Our data thus suggest specific common denominators regarding molecular pathogenesis of different amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> genes.

To clarify whether cortical hyperexcitability contributes to development of clinical features of acquired neuromyotonia, the present study investigated whether threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation could detect cortical hyperexcitability in acquired neuromyotonia, and whether this technique could differentiate acquired neuromyotonia from amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Cortical excitability studies were undertaken in 18 patients with acquired neuromyotonia and 104 patients with amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> with results compared to 62 normal controls. Short-interval intracortical inhibition in patients with acquired neuromyotonia was significantly different when compared to patients with amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (averaged short interval intracortical inhibition acquired neuromyotonia 11. 3 +/- 1. 9 %; amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> 2. 6 +/- 0. 9 %, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease of motor neurons with a median survival of 2 years. Most patients have no family history of amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> but current understanding of such diseases suggests {{there should be an}} increased risk to relatives. Furthermore, it is a common question to be asked by patients and relatives in clinic. We therefore set out to determine the risk of amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> to first degree relatives of patients with sporadic amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> attending a specialist clinic. Case records of patients with sporadic amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> seen at a tertiary referral centre over a 16 -year period were reviewed, and pedigree structures extracted. All individuals who had originally presented with sporadic amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> but who subsequently had an affected first degree relative, were identified. Calculations were age-adjusted using clinic population demographics. Probands (n = 1502), full siblings (n = 1622) and full offspring (n = 1545) were identified. Eight of the siblings and 18 offspring had developed amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> The unadjusted risk of amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> over the observation period was 0. 5 % for siblings and 1. 0 % for offspring. Age information was available for 476 siblings and 824 offspring. For this subset, the crude incidence of amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> was 0. 11 % per year (0. 05 - 0. 21 %) in siblings and 0. 11 % per year (0. 06 - 0. 19 %) in offspring, and the clinic age-adjusted incidence rate was 0. 12 % per year (0. 04 - 0. 21 %) in siblings. By age 85, siblings were found to have an 8 -fold increased risk of amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> in comparison to the background population. In practice, this means the risk of remaining unaffected by age 85 dropped from 99. 7 % to 97. 6 %.

40|$|SummaryWe {{investigated}} the biochemical and morphologic alteration in skin of amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> patients.

The thickness and cell density, {{as well as the}} leukemia inhibitory factor immunostain density, of the epidermis in amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> patients correlated positively with duration of illness. The striking fact was the significant epidermal hyperplasia correlating with leukemia inhibitory factor expression in amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> patients (r = 0. 94, p < 0. 001). In vitro experiments revealed that leukemia inhibitory factor stimulated keratinocyte proliferation in primary keratinocyte culture and induced epidermal hyperplasia in skin organ culture.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> is {{a rapidly}} progressive, fatal {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{for which there}} is no effective treatment. The diagnosis is dependent on the clinical presentation and consistent electrodiagnostic studies. Typically, there is a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs as well as electrodiagnostic studies indicative of diffuse motor axonal injury. The presentation of amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> however, may be variable. At the same time, the diagnosis is essential for patient prognosis and management. It is therefore important to appreciate the range of possible presentations of amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Case presentation We present the case of a 57 -year-old Caucasian man with pathological findings on postmortem examination consistent with amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> but atypical clinical and electrodiagnostic features. He died after a rapid course of progressive weakness. The patient did not respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Conclusion Amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> should be considered in patients with a rapidly progressive, unexplained neuropathic process. This should be true even if there are atypical clinical and electrodiagnostic findings. Absence of response to therapy and the development of upper motor neuron signs should reinforce the possibility that amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> may be present. Since amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> is a fatal illness, however, the possibility of this disease in patients with atypical clinical features should not diminish the need for a thorough diagnostic evaluation and treatment trials. </p...|$|R
50|$|In a study {{conducted}} by Kihira et al., eight individuals with amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> were compared to nine control cases. The results indicated that the total number of neurons in Onuf’s nucleus in patients with amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> did not differ from the control patients. However, normal neurons decreased in number while atrophic neurons increased. It was also shown that the {{decrease in the number of}} normal neurons was not due to aging. Patients with amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> also contain less RNA in their motoneurons than normal individuals. The decrease in RNA is correlated with the decrease in size of the nucleolus. Thus, the size of the nucleolus may be an early indicator of amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mutations in the ALS2 gene, {{found on}} Chromosome 2, are {{responsible}} for causing Juvenile <b>Primary</b> <b>Lateral</b> <b>Sclerosis.</b> The ALS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alsin. Alsin is abundant in motor neurons,but its function is not fully understood. Mutations in the ALS2 gene in this disorder disrupt the instructions for producing alsin. As a result, alsin is unstable and decays rapidly, or it is disabled and cannot function properly. It is currently unknown how the loss of functional alsin protein causes the death of motor neurons and the symptoms of juvenile <b>primary</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Rapid and {{efficient}} uptake of glutamate via the high-affinity glutamate transporter EAAT 2 {{is important for}} limiting glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity involved in neuronal death. Furthermore, {{there is evidence of}} altered glutamate uptake and catabolism in motor neuron diseases. Such a defect has been reported in amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> the major motor neuron disease, and was associated with impairment in EAAT 2 processing. We recently reported the presence of enterovirus genome specifically in the anterior horn of amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> cases, suggesting the involvement of a chronic/persistent enterovirus infection in amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> To investigate a putative link between enterovirus infection and the glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity observed in amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> we developed an in vitro model consisting of a human glial cell line infected with ECHOvirus 6, one of the enteroviruses with sequences closely related to those detected in patients with amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> In these glial cells, an ECHOvirus 6 chronic infection was established, resulting in altered extracellular glutamate uptake. This correlated with an aberrant splicing of the EAAT 2 pre-messenger ribonucleic acid and a significant loss of EAAT 2 protein expression, similar to that observed in patients with amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> These results provide convincing evidence that an enterovirus chronic/persistent infection may alter glial glutamate uptake and catabolism. As enteroviruses are extremely common human pathogens, they may act as a trigger in the development of certain motor neuron diseases, such as amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis...</b>|$|R

Normal mean (2 SD) MUAP amplitude was 224 (97. 4) µV. Normal mean (2 SD) peak ratio (PR), turns/second (T/s), amplitude/turn (A/T), and time intervals (TI 1, TI 2, TI 3) were 1. 68 (0. 56), 732 (303. 9), 446 (180. 3) µV, 2. 62 (0. 34), 2. 31 (0. 14), and 1. 01 (0. 50) respectively. Mean MUAP duration and amplitude were significantly increased in limb onset (P= 0. 0001 and P= 0. 013) and bulbar onset amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (P= 0. 0001 and P= 0. 017). Peak ratio indices stayed unchanged in limb onset amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> but were significantly decreased (PR, T/s, A/T, TI 1, and TI 2) or increased (TI 3) in bulbar onset disease. The sensitivity of the MUAP analysis was 70 % in limb and 75 % in bulbar onset amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> The sensitivity of the peak ratio interference pattern analysis was 20 % in limb and 100 % in bulbar onset amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Subclinical involvement of the tongue was found in 20 % of the patients with limb onset amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis</b> and could be more accurately assessed with MUAP analysis than with automatic EMG.  CONCLUSIONS—both conventional and automatic needle EMG of the tongue are valuable electrophysiological devices to assess the clinical and subclinical involvement of the tongue in patients with limb and bulbar onset amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> ...|$|R
