40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of the engine air induction system has recently increased because of governmental engine exhaust particulate and evaporative emission regulations. This has created {{a renewed interest in}} optimizing the existing parameters of the air induction mechanism like the air filter, filter box, piping etc for better performance. Air filter provided on the engine intake is subjected to increased levels of abuse due to the diverse driving conditions. The OEM air filter in modern vehicles is usually a <b>paper</b> <b>type</b> air <b>filter.</b> Due to the increased presence of counterfeit air filter in the market, {{there is a possibility that}} filter may be of poorer quality resulting in get premature clogging. The presence of increased number of aftermarket performance filters has prompted automotive enthusiasts to replace their OEM filters with these performance filters for better performance. This study addresses the issue of whether OEM air filter replacement with aftermarket air filter (oiled media filter from K&N) improves fuel economy. The increasing air filter pressure drop in diesel-engine-powered vehicles due to clogging was measured, with primary focus on changes in vehicle fuel economy but also including acceleration and engine temperature. The performance of both <b>types</b> of <b>filters</b> in new and clogged condition in terms of pressure drop, air discharge and filtering efficiency are also studied...|$|R

The results are obtained by three steps in the filtering process. Step by step the noise is removed in a considerable amount. The noisy pixels are detected step by step with the help of Fuzzy rules and removed one by one, and the noise-free pixels are remained unchanged. Due to linguistic variables are used. The pixels that are detected as noisy is done by blockmatching based on a noise adaptive mean absolute difference. The proposed method is done by measuring different methods, such as the mean absolute error (MAE), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the normalized color difference (NCD), in terms of state-of-the-art filters...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} problem in {{biomedical}} data processing like electrocardiography is {{the separation of the}} wanted signal from noises caused by power line interference, external electromagnetic fields, random body movements and respiration. Different <b>types</b> of digital <b>filters</b> are used to remove signal components from unwanted frequency ranges. It is difficult to apply filters with fixed coefficients to reduce Biomedical Signal noises, because human behavior is not exact known depending on the time. Adaptive filter technique is required to overcome this problem. In this <b>paper</b> <b>type</b> of adaptive <b>filters</b> are considered to reduce the ECG signal noises like PLI and Base Line Interference. Results of simulations in MATLAB are presented. In this we have used Recursive Least Squares (RLS). RLS algorithm is proposed for removing artifacts preserving the low frequency components and tiny features of the ECG. Least-squares algorithms aim at the minimization of the sum of the squares of the difference between the desired signal and the model filter output. When new samples of the incoming signals are received at every iteration, the solution for the least-squares problem can be computed in recursive form resulting in the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithms. The RLS algorithms are known to pursue fast convergence even when the Eigen value spread of the input signal correlation matrix is large. These algorithms have excellent performance when working in time-varying environments. All these advantages come with the cost of an increased computational complexity and some stability problems, which are not as critical in LMS-based algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the head losses in several type metal body disc filters manufactured by domestic companies. In order to meet the objective, three different filter designs (L, LT and Y type), each at four different inlet and outlet pipe diameters, were used to measure the head losses at different flow rates in the laboratory. A total of sixteen filters manufactured by three domestic companies (A, B and C) and two different disc elements (linear and curly) were taken into consideration in this study. A comparison of the different filter designs in terms of measured the head losses indicated that in all cases while the L <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> gave the highest head loss, the other two designs provided less head losses at the same flow rate. Furthermore, the head losses in C−LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> with curly groove shape discs were less than B−LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> with linear groove shape discs in comparing with the LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> produced by two different manufacturers even though the design and the size of the filter body were similar. The differences in the head loss can be clarified with the help of the results obtained from the structural characteristic of filtering elements. As a result, in drip irrigation systems, the use of Y and LT <b>type</b> disc <b>filters</b> with curly groove shaped discs are recommended in order to obtain less head losses and low energy requirements when compared with filters used in this study.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} terminology integration {{characteristics of}} local specialty specific and general vocabularies {{in order to}} facilitate the appropriate inclusion and mapping of these terms into a large-scale terminology. METHODS: We compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratios for Automated Term Composition to correctly map 9050 local specialty specific (dermatology) terms and 4994 local general terms to UMLS using Metaphrase. Results were systematically combined among exact matches, semantic <b>type</b> <b>filtered</b> matches, and non-filtered matches. For the general set, an analysis of semantic <b>type</b> <b>filtering</b> was performed. RESULTS: Dermatology exact matches defined a sensitivity of 51 % (57 % for general terms) and a specificity of 86 % (92 % general terms). Including semantic <b>type</b> <b>filtered</b> matches increased sensitivity (75 % dermatology; 88 % general); as did inclusion of non-filtered matches (98 % and 99 %). These inclusions correspondingly decreased specificity (filtered: 82 % and 74 %; non-filtered: 52 % and 32 %). Positive predictive values for exact matches (93. 0 % dermatology, 97. 6 % general) were improved by small but significant (p < 0. 001) margins by including filtered matches (95. 1 % dermatology, 98. 4 % general) but decreased with non-filtered matches (89. 2 % dermatology, 87. 8 % general). Adding additional semantic <b>types</b> to the <b>filtering</b> algorithm failed to improve the positive predictive value or the positive likelihood ratio of term mapping, in spite of a 2. 3 % improvement in sensitivity.
