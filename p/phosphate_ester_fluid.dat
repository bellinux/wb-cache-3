The interaction of alkyl <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester,</b> an anionic surfactant, and the aqueous copolymer solutions was also investigated.

40|$|Because of {{a number}} of {{exceptional}} properties over mineral oil, <b>ester</b> <b>fluids</b> are now being used in more medium and large power transformers. At the same time, there are significant differences in the dielectric & thermal properties and other material parameters, between mineral oil and <b>ester</b> <b>fluids,</b> which need to be considered in the design, manufacture, retro – filling, and service of these transformers. This paper presents results of investigations, calculations, and measurements made to identify the special material characteristics that need to be considered when designing the core and windings of these transformers. The paper also presents the factors that must be considered in the selection, design, and determination of the voltage and current ratings of bushings and tap – changers to be used in <b>ester</b> <b>fluid</b> – filled power transformers. In addition, the paper identifies properties of <b>ester</b> <b>fluids</b> that would require different procedures in the processing of th e fluid during manufacture and impregnation of the solid insulation in the transformer. The factors that should be considered when an old mineral oil – filled power transformer is to be retro – filled with an <b>ester</b> <b>fluid</b> are presented.

During transformer service, some oil quality parameters of ester fluids; such as power factor, acidity, interfacial tension, etc do not reflect the same correlation to fluid dielectric or thermal performance as they do in mineral oil. Also, some diagnostic parameters which determine the condition of the solid insulation in a mineral oil - filled power transformers will need to be considered differently in relationship to the different properties of <b>ester</b> <b>fluids.</b> Finally, the paper presents how the advantageous property of longer life of cellulose in <b>ester</b> <b>fluids</b> could be evaluated and benefited from, resulting in more optimized design of <b>ester</b> <b>fluid</b> – filled power transformers...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of their {{improved}} aqueous solubility, the development of <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrugs is an interesting approach to increase intestinal absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs. Absorption of a drug from its <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrug is based on intestinal dephosphorylation of the prodrug which may result in intraluminal supersaturation of the parent drug, followed by an increased absorptive flux across the intestinal mucosa. In this study, we evaluated the behavior of fosamprenavir, a <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrug of amprenavir, in the Caco- 2 system and in aspirated human intestinal fluids (HIF), both showing phosphatase activity. Starting from a solution of fosamprenavir in HIF, a supersaturated solution of amprenavir was generated and maintained during a time period sufficient for absorption. Moreover, supersaturation of amprenavir resulted in an enhanced flux across Caco- 2 monolayers. To our knowledge, this is the first illustration of supersaturation in real intestinal media. Next, we showed an inhibitory effect of inorganic phosphate on the dephosphorylation of fosamprenavir, both in the Caco- 2 model and in HIF. As a consequence, phosphate-buffered media, including fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF), are incompatible with the study of <b>phosphate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrugs and should be replaced with media containing a biorelevant phosphate concentration (0. 4 - 1 mM) and another buffering compound such as 2 -morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES). status: publishe...|$|R
