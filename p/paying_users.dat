40|$|Online gaming {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{industries}} on the Internet, generating tens of billions of dollars in revenues annually. One core problem in online game is to find and convert free <b>users</b> into <b>paying</b> customers, which is of great importance for the sustainable development of almost all online games. Although much research has been conducted, there are still several challenges that remain largely unsolved: What are the fundamental factors that trigger the <b>users</b> to <b>pay?</b> How does <b>users?</b> <b>paying</b> behavior influence each other in the game social network? How to design a prediction model to recognize those potential users who are likely to pay? In this paper, employing two large online games as the basis, we study how a user becomes a new <b>paying</b> <b>user</b> in the games. In particular, we examine how users' paying behavior influences each other in the game social network. We study this problem from various sociological perspectives including strong/weak ties, social structural diversity and social influence. Based on the discovered patterns, we propose a learning framework to predict potential new payers. The framework can learn a model using features associated with users and then use the social relationships between users to refine the learned model. We test the proposed framework using nearly 50 billion user activities from two real games. Our experiments show that the proposed framework significantly improves the prediction accuracy by up to 3 - 11 % compared to several alternative methods. The study also unveils several intriguing social phenomena from the data. For example, influence indeed exists among <b>users</b> for the <b>paying</b> behavior. The likelihood of a user becoming a new <b>paying</b> <b>user</b> is 5 times higher than chance when he has 5 paying neighbors of strong tie. We have deployed the proposed algorithm into the game, and the Lift_Ratio has been improved up to 196 % compared to the prior strategy...|$|R

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} {{study was conducted}} in Dar es Salaam Municipal hospitals in the month June 2005, with the main objective of comparing perceived quality of health care services, amongst clients using user fees and National Health insurance Fund. A total of 563 exit interviews were conducted, of which, 281 were with clients using user fees and 282 were with NHIF members. Respondents were selected using convenience sampling method. A Structured questionnaire and facility checklists were used to collect data. The study findings show that provider client interaction was perceived to be good, with a higher proportion of NHIF clients (93. 6 %) compared to clients <b>paying</b> <b>user</b> fees (88. 3 %) reporting to have spent adequate consultation time with the prescriber (P< 0. 05), and almost similar proportions of respondents <b>paying</b> <b>user</b> fee and NHIF reporting to have been given adequate explanation about their health problems (i. e. 74. 4 % and 75. 5 % respectively) and that they had received adequate instructions on the use of prescribed drugs (i. e. 97. 2 % Versus 97. 3 % respectively). The study findings also show that Overall, 28. 4 % of the clients interviewed reported that were physically examined, with about 30 % of clients <b>paying</b> <b>user</b> fees reporting lack of enough privacy. Majority of the clients (81. 5 %) interviewed were satisfied with physical state of buildings and attitude of health worker (i. e. 85. 1 % user fees versus 86 % NHIF) at the facilities that they had attended. The respondents were also interviewed on aspect of duration of time spent waiting to get health care. Less than a quarter of clients interviewed perceived waiting time to be short, with significantly higher proportion of clients <b>paying</b> <b>user</b> fees (21. 4 %) compared to Vlll NHIF (13. 5 %) clients perceived waiting time as being short. Drug availability was reported to be a problem in this study, where more than two thirds (71. 2 %) of the client responded that drugs were not always available at the facilities they attended. The level of satisfaction with the quality of health care services was high (84. 4 %) among clients interviewed, with a small proportion (15. 6 %) being dissatisfied mainly due to long waiting time (72. 7 %) and lack of drugs (64. 8 %). In order to improve quality of health services clients suggested that waiting time should be reduced, drugs availability, attitude of health care provider, physical state of facility buildings and cleanliness of surroundings should be improved. The author recommends that clients' opinions be in cooperated in the strategies planned to improve quality of health care service...|$|R
