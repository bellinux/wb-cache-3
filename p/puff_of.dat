5|$|Like many earthstars, {{the fungus}} uses {{the force of}} falling raindrops to help {{disperse}} the spores, which are ejected in little bursts when objects (such as rain) strike the outer wall of the spore sac. The gleba is brown to grayish-brown, with a cotton-like texture that, when compressed, allows the endoperidium to flex quickly and create a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> air that is forced out through the ostioles. This generates a cloud of spores that can then be carried by the wind. There are columellae (sterile structures that start {{at the base of}} the gleba and extend through it), which are usually not evident in the mature gleba, but apparent {{at the base of the}} spore sac. The columellae are not connected to the ostioles, but rather, terminate within the gleba at some distance from them. The capillitia (sterile strands within the gleba) are long, slender, free, tapering, unbranched, and 2–5μm thick, with thickened walls. The spores are spherical, nonamyloid, and are ornamented with irregularly shaped flaring protuberances up to 2μm high. They measure 3.9–4.8μm in diameter (without ornamentation), and 5.4–7.0μm including the ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} AOM {{is related to}} {{childhood}} anatomy and immune function. Either bacteria or viruses may be involved. Risk factors include exposure to smoke, use of pacifiers, and attending daycare. It occurs more commonly among Indigenous peoples {{and those who have}} Down syndrome. OME frequently occurs following AOM and may be related to viral upper respiratory infections, irritants such as smoke, or allergies. Looking at the eardrum is important for making the correct diagnosis. Signs of AOM include bulging or a lack of movement of the tympanic membrane from a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> air. About 4.4% of the population develop CSOM.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{majority}} of the interviewed witnesses, the airplane suddenly rolled to the left until the wings were perpendicular to the ground. The aircraft then descended in a nose-down attitude and disappeared from sight behind trees near the airport. One witness told investigators that they saw a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> smoke emanate from the aircraft prior to or subsequent to the airplane rolling to the left. Others reported loud engine noises described as a squeal, whine, or an overspeeding or accelerating engine during the last moments of the flight, although they said that these noises seemed to have stopped, or at least faded before the aircraft impacted with flat ground two miles short of the runway.|$|E

25|$|Likewise {{there are}} {{different}} versions regarding Homer's preparatory methods. Downes recounted that Homer took to sea in a boat, accompanied by {{a man with a}} double-barreled shotgun, and studied the movements of birds as they were shot. In Beam's telling, Homer stood atop a cliff at Prouts Neck while his neighbor Will Googins, fired blank charges in his direction from a rowboat offshore. However, Homer was already familiar with this angle of shotgun blast, having in 1864 painted Defiance, a Civil War subject of a soldier being shot at, and in 1892 A Good Shot, Adirondacks, which shows the <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> distant rifle smoke and a mortally wounded deer hit in the foreground; the latter especially anticipates the composition and intent of Right and Left.|$|E
25|$|With either two {{or three}} overs {{remaining}} on day five (depending on how fast the overs were bowled) the game looked certain for a draw (as India still had three wickets in hand and were 122 runs behind). But Clarke, in just his second over, took two wickets in consecutive balls {{to be on a}} hat-trick. The first ball of his second over reared after drawing a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> dust, caught the shoulder of Harbhajan's bat and flew to Hussey at slip, and R. P. Singh padded up to his first ball and was adjudged lbw. There was an extensive delay as the last batsman Sharma took to the field with two right-handed gloves and had to wait for the correct glove to be brought out to him. This led to suspicion that the Sharma's actions were not accidental but a time-wasting ploy. Clarke took the final wicket, Sharma, in the same over, giving Australia victory. Kumble finished the day unbeaten on 45.|$|E
25|$|By 13:35, Winslow {{reached a}} point {{approximately}} 1,500 yards from her quarry when a white <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> smoke from Antonio Lópezs bow gun signaled {{the beginning of an}} artillery duel which lasted one hour and 20 minutes. Winslow responded with her 1-pounders. The Spanish concentrated their efforts on Winslow, and she soon received several direct hits. The first shot to score on the torpedo boat destroyed both her steam and manual steering gear. Her crew tried to rig an auxiliary steering system, but she swung broadside to the enemy and a shot pierced her hull near the engine room and knocked the port main engine out of commission. She maneuvered with her remaining engine to evade enemy fire and maintained a steady return fire with her 1-pounders. Wilmington and Hudson brought their guns to bear on the Spanish ship and shore, and the combined fire of the three American warships put the Spanish tugboat out of action while several waterfront buildings caught fire.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Inhaled anticholinergics and beta {{agonists}} {{are widely}} used {{in the treatment of}} patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, dosage requirements have not been thoroughly evaluated and comparative dose-response data for these agents are limited. METHODS [...] Twenty men with stable COPD of mean (SD) age 69. 4 (5. 8) years and FEV 1 0. 93 (0. 38) litres were studied in randomised, double blind, crossover, placebo controlled experiments. All of the patients received two, four, eight, and 16 <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> ipratropium bromide (20 micrograms/puff), flutropium bromide (30 micrograms/puff), oxitropium bromide (100 micrograms/puff), fenoterol (200 micrograms/puff), or placebo in random order on five separate days. Doses were administered by a metered dose inhaler at intervals of 60 minutes to give cumulative doses of two, six, 14, and 30 <b>puffs.</b> Five mg <b>of</b> nebulised salbutamol was administered 60 minutes after the patient had received the final 16 <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> each regimen. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), heart rate, and blood pressure were measured five minutes before each treatment and 30 minutes after treatment with nebulised salbutamol. RESULTS [...] FEV 1 and FVC reached a plateau after administration of a cumulative dose <b>of</b> 14 <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> ipratropium bromide (280 micrograms) or flutropium bromide (420 micrograms), and after six <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> oxitropium bromide (600 micrograms). There were no differences with respect to maximum increases in FEV 1 and FVC amongst the three anticholinergic agents. However, after six puffs oxitropium bromide produced a greater increase in FEV 1 than either ipratropium bromide or flutropium bromide. Fenoterol caused a greater increase in both FEV 1 and FVC than the three anticholinergic agents after six puffs, as well as a greater increase in pulse rate. Oxitropium bromide produced a greater increase in pulse rate than the other anticholinergics after 14 <b>puffs.</b> The incidence <b>of</b> side effects was dose-related and notable adverse effects were reported after 30 <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> ipratropium bromide, 14 <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> oxitropium bromide, and two <b>puffs</b> <b>of</b> fenoterol. CONCLUSIONS [...] Oxitropium bromide produced a greater bronchodilator effect than either ipratropium bromide or flutropium bromide when used at doses of less than six puffs, without apparent side effects. There were, however, no differences in maximal response between these drugs. Fenoterol may have a greater peak bronchodilator effect than the anticholinergic agents but it causes more adverse effects, even at lower doses. Depending upon the balance between efficacy and side effects, oxitropium bromide may be preferred in the treatment of patients with COPD...|$|R

500|$|As in English, voiceless stops are {{aspirated}} (articulated with a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> air {{immediately upon}} release) {{at the start}} of a word, while voiced stops may be incompletely voiced but are never aspirated.

500|$|News {{coverage}} of the battle produced television footage of ZNG air defence artillery at Zečevo firing at a Yugoslav Air Force Soko J-21 Jastreb and scoring a hit on another J-21 using a guided missile. The footage, ending in shouts claiming that both of the planes were downed, {{became one of the}} most significant pieces of material in terms of propaganda and morale in Croatia. Nonetheless, the footage proved controversial, since the first plane is not shown falling to the ground or into the sea, but diving towards the horizon after giving away a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> smoke [...] variously interpreted as smoke caused by the plane's cannon fire or anti-aircraft fire damage. While the first J-21 downing remains unconfirmed, the second J-21, piloted by Croat Valter Juršić of the 240th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron, was shot down by Neven Livajić using a 9K38 Igla and wreckage of the plane was retrieved.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{being caught}} {{unprepared}} by the attack, Sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly, fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous Union rout. Finding Grant {{at the end}} of the day sitting under an oak tree in the darkness and smoking a cigar, Sherman felt, in his words, [...] "some wise and sudden instinct not to mention retreat".

[...] After a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> his cigar, Grant replied calmly: [...] "Yes. Lick 'em tomorrow, though." [...] Sherman proved instrumental to the successful Union counterattack of April 7, 1862. At Shiloh, Sherman was wounded twice—in the hand and shoulder—and had three horses shot out from under him. His performance was praised by Grant and Halleck and after the battle, and he was promoted to major general of volunteers, effective May 1, 1862.|$|E
500|$|In {{designing}} the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer Daniel Kleinman {{was inspired by}} the cover of the 1953 British first edition of Casino Royale, which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, [...] "The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles," [...] like a club representing a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts. In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitised the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at Framestore CFC in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.|$|E
