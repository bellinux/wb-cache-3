40|$|Flexible <b>pipe</b> is a <b>layered</b> {{structure}} {{composed of}} plastic and steel materials. Under a large bending moment, the <b>pipe</b> <b>layers</b> may slide relative to each other due to internal friction. The moment curvature relationship for the flexible pipe is a tri-linear curve. Under cyclic bending moment, a hysteresis loop will be formed in the moment curvature curve. The area of the loop is the energy loss due to the internal friction. This thesis is aimed to {{study the effects of}} hysteresis damping on the global analysis of the flexible riser. To begin with, a review on the flexible pipe technology and nonlinear finite element method is performed. Then a local analysis is carried out in BFLEX to obtain the cross sectional characteristics. Then the global analysis is conducted to study the responses of the flexible riser in terms of the curvature, moment and axial force. From the study, slip behavior only occurs at the hang off part of the riser. For the rest part, <b>pipe</b> <b>layers</b> stay in the stick regime, meaning there is no energy loss due to the internal friction. Therefore for the global analysis of the flexible riser, {{there is no need to}} further study the equivalent linear damping models. In addition, the influence of linear and nonlinear bending models on the global response of the riser is investigated. It is found that the current standard industrial practice, namely applying the linear bending model with the full slip bending stiffness, gives an over conservative response prediction. It is therefore recommended to use the physically correct nonlinear moment curvature relationship for the global analysis of flexible riser. </p...|$|R

Specifically, part # 1 performed in-situ time/motion analyses of common mining jobs and part # 2 analyzed in-situ energy expenditures while working in a mine. Methodology. Part # 1 - task and sub-task duration and subjective work intensity were investigated for thirty eight subjects from six different mining jobs. These jobs were then organized into 4 groups for statistical analysis based on precedence: Group 1 (Bolting & Screening (attaching steel mesh to walls and ceiling), Group 2 (Conventional Mining (using a hand-held drilling carriage to drills holes in rock walls and ceiling)), Group 3 (Support Services (mechanic, welder, <b>pipe</b> <b>layer)),</b> Group 4 (Production Drill (using a machine mounted drilling unit), Scooptram(TM) (ore transport with no air conditioner), Shotcrete (concrete applied by spraying)). Part # 2 - In-situ metabolic energy expenditures were estimated through indirect open circuit calorimetry and deep tissue and skin temperatures were measured for those same groups. Results. Part # 1 - twenty three common mining tasks were identified with differences identified between various group for time and intensity. Part # 2 - metabolic requirements between groups were similar with one difference identified between groups 3 and 4 (P < 0. 05). Deep tissue and skin temperatures did not change significantly {{through the course of}} a work day. Conclusion.
