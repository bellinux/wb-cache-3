The analysis combines the experimental {{as well as}} simulation approach. Focus {{of the study is}} to study the effect of different intake and <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> parameters on in-cylinder mixture homogeneity. The degree of in-cylinder mixture homogeneity is judged by the overall equivalence ratio and evaporation concentration. A 3 -D simulation was carried out for <b>port</b> injected diesel <b>fuel</b> for fixed valve lift and steady state condition. The degree of homogeneity of incylinder mixture for <b>port</b> injected <b>fuel</b> is judged by the percentage volume occupied by the required equivalence ratio for different regions of total cylinder volume. The parametric simulation approach for intake air temperature, pressure, <b>port</b> wall temperature, <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> duration and <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pressure is used to optimize the homogeneity of in-cylinder mixture. Based on the simulation study selected number of experiments have been carried out on an experimental engine to study the effect of part port and part incylinder diesel injection to achieve the ultra low emission of Oxides of Nitrogen (below 100 ppm) with HC and CO less than 1000 ppm for heavy duty constant speed application engine.

In this investigation, HCCI engine operates with different inlet air temperature and <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pressure, and analysis {{the effect of}} these variables on HCCI engine performance and emissions. The inlet air temperatures are varied between 40 °C and 70 °C and the injection pressure in the <b>port</b> <b>fuel</b> injector is varied from 3 bar to 5 bar respectively.

GT-Power was utilized to develop the model for port injection engine. One dimensional gas dynamics was represented the flow and heat transfer in the components of the engine model. The governing equations are introduced first, followed by the performance parameters and model description. Air-fuel ratio was varied from stoichiometric limit to a lean limit. The rotational speed of the engine was varied from 2500 to 4500 rpm while the injector location was considered fixed in the midway of the intake port. The acquired results show that the air-fuel ratio is greatly influence on the performance of hydrogen fueled engine. It is shown that the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and brake thermal efficiency decreases with increases of the airfuel ratio however the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increases with increases of the air-fuel ratio. The cylinder temperature decreases with the increase of air-fuel ratio. The present model emphasizes the ability of retrofitting the traditional engines with hydrogen fuel with minor modifications.
