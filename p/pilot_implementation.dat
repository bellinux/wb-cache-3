40|$|Intel's Fab 17, {{located in}} Hudson, Massachusetts, has {{experienced}} dramatic improvements in its cycle time {{performance in the}} last two years. These improvements have been attributed to lean implementation efforts, reduced tool variability, as well as other key initiatives. In its efforts to continuously improve cycle time and cycle time variability, a new methodology of conducting wafer starts was developed and <b>pilot</b> <b>implementations</b> were conducted. The new methodology was based upon the concept of Little's Law of Cycle Time = Inventory / Output, whereby controlling the level of inventory through wafer starts would positively impact cycle time performance. Thus, by monitoring the current Work-in-Process levels at selected areas of operations and contrasting it with the optimal levels based upon Little's Law, an appropriate level of wafer starts could be determined. Close collaboration between the manufacturing, engineering, and planning departments allowed for the creation and <b>pilot</b> <b>implementations</b> of the wafer starts control model. The <b>pilot</b> <b>implementations</b> were conducted in three separate phases, providing opportunities for data analyses and methodology improvements. Model parameters and logic were modified between each phase to better reflect actual fab realities and to achieve more effective outcomes. Positive results were observed during the <b>pilot</b> <b>implementations,</b> as cycle time variability (as defined by standard deviations) decreased and overall fab cycle time remained consistently lower, all during a period of increased production.

Approved {{for use by}} European regulators in July 2015, {{it is not only}} the world's first licensed malaria vaccine, but the first vaccine licensed for use against a parasitic disease of any kind. The RTS,S vaccine was conceived of and created in the late 1980s by scientists working at SmithKline Beecham Biologicals (now GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines) laboratories in Belgium. The vaccine was further developed through a collaboration between GSK and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and has been funded in part by the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Its efficacy ranges from 26 to 50% in infants and young children. It is considered to be a milestone advance in the worldwide campaign against malaria.

40|$|Background The use of non-surgical {{treatment}} {{in patients with}} hip and/or knee osteoarthritis is not optimal as studies show a poor referral to physical therapy, overuse of radiological assessments, poor prescription of medication to relieve pain, and inadequate referral to secondary care. To improve use of non-surgical treatment, the Primary Care Stepped Care Strategy Osteoarthritis was developed and implemented in the Julius Healthcare Centres. Aim To compare health care use and sequence of care in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis before and after <b>pilot</b> <b>implementation</b> of the Primary Care Stepped Care Strategy Osteoarthritis. Methods A pilot evaluation was conducted after implementation of the Primary Care Stepped Care Strategy Osteoarthritis within four primary healthcare centres, using a retrospective analysis of medical records. Data on health care use and sequence of care were extracted from medical records of general practitioners and physical therapists. Newly diagnosed patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis were included before and after <b>pilot</b> <b>implementation.</b> Results The current study included 28 patients: 11 before and 17 after <b>pilot</b> <b>implementation.</b> After <b>pilot</b> <b>implementation,</b> {{a higher proportion of}} patients received physical therapy and medication to relieve pain. A lower proportion of patients received radiological assessments and secondary care. A higher proportion of patients received correct sequence of care before referral to physical therapy and medication according to the correct sequence after <b>pilot</b> <b>implementation.</b> Conclusion The results suggest that implementation of the Primary Care Stepped Care Strategy Osteoarthritis might positively influence health care use and sequence of care in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. Clinical Relevance Implementation of the Primary Care Stepped Care Strategy Osteoarthritis might improve use of non-surgical care and decrease referral to secondary care in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis.

40|$|Abstract. A {{recurrent}} {{problem in}} information-systems development (ISD) {{is that many}} design shortcomings are not detected during development, but first after the system has been delivered and implemented in its intended environment. Pilot implementations appear to promise a way to extend prototyping from the laboratory to the field, thereby allowing users to experience a system design under realistic conditions and developers to get feedback from realistic use while the design is still malleable. We characterize <b>pilot</b> <b>implementation,</b> contrast it with prototyping, propose a five-element model of <b>pilot</b> <b>implementation,</b> and provide three empirical illustrations of our model. We conclude that <b>pilot</b> <b>implementation</b> has much merit as an ISD technique when system performance is contingent on context. But we also warn developers that, despite their seductive conceptual simplicity, pilot implementations {{can be difficult to}} plan and conduct. It is sometimes assumed that pilot implementations are less complicated and risky than ordinary implementations. Pilot implementations are, however, neither prototyping nor small-scale versions of full-scale implementations; they are fundamentally different and have their own challenges, which will be enumerated and discussed in this article...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The article {{presents}} {{the concept and}} <b>pilot</b> <b>implementation</b> of wireless (Blutetooth-based) integration of the Braille notetaker environment and the environment of touchscreen-based devices (such as smartphones) operating under the Android system. Advanced functions of Android-based devices are hardly accessible to the blind using a touchscreen; one aim of such integration is to enable accessing them with a notetaker. Another is to allow the blind who work with notetakers {{on a daily basis}} and use common touchscreen-based smartphones and tablets to write using the physical Braille keyboard of a notetaker as well as its editing functions; this would solve many problems encountered and prevent numerous errors made by the blind when using the virtual QWERTY keyboard of a touchscreen-based device. <b>Pilot</b> <b>implementation</b> of the concept included developing a communication protocol for a notetaker operated under Windows CE and an Android-based smartphone; services to be provided to notetakers by smartphones have been developed as well. The implemented services dealt with managing contacts and composing messages – operations that normally require considerable interaction with a QWERTY keyboard. Favourable results of initial research on <b>pilot</b> <b>implementation</b> conducted among the blind indicate a need for further development of this concept. I...|$|E
