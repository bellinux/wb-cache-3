25|$|Even {{though the}} {{conductive}} channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, carriers are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel enhancement-mode device, a depletion region {{exists in the}} p-type body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free {{to move out of}} the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to silicon. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the <b>pinch-off</b> point, increasing the resistance of the depletion region in proportion to the drain-to-source voltage applied. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its ohmic behavior in the linear mode of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a constant-current source rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.|$|E

If drain-to-source voltage is increased further, the <b>pinch-off</b> point of the channel begins to move away from the drain towards the source. The FET is said to be in saturation mode; although some authors refer to it as active mode, for a better analogy with bipolar transistor operating regions.

50|$|When the {{depletion}} layer spans {{the width of}} the conduction channel, <b>pinch-off</b> is achieved and drain-to-source conduction stops. <b>Pinch-off</b> occurs at a particular reverse bias (VGS) of the gate-source junction. The <b>pinch-off</b> voltage (Vp) varies considerably, even among devices of the same type. For example, VGS(off) for the Temic J202 device varies from −0.8 V to −4 V. Typical values vary from −0.3 V to −10 V.|$|E

50|$|To {{understand}} the effect, first {{the notion of}} <b>pinch-off</b> of the channel is introduced. The channel is formed by attraction of carriers to the gate, and the current drawn through the channel is nearly a constant independent of drain voltage in saturation mode. However, near the drain, the gate and drain jointly determine the electric field pattern. Instead of flowing in a channel, beyond the <b>pinch-off</b> point the carriers flow in a subsurface pattern made possible because the drain and the gate both control the current. In the figure at the right, the channel is indicated by a dashed line and becomes weaker as the drain is approached, leaving a gap of uninverted silicon {{between the end of}} the formed inversion layer and the drain (the <b>pinch-off</b> region).|$|E

50|$|In an {{n-channel}} depletion-mode device, {{a negative}} gate-to-source voltage causes a depletion region {{to expand in}} width and encroach on the channel from the sides, narrowing the channel. If the active region expands to completely close the channel, {{the resistance of the}} channel from source to drain becomes large, and the FET is effectively turned off like a switch (see right figure, when there is very small current). This is called <b>pinch-off,</b> and the voltage at which it occurs is called the <b>pinch-off</b> voltage. Conversely, a positive gate-to-source voltage increases the channel size and allows electrons to flow easily (see right figure, when there is a conduction channel and current is large).|$|E
50|$|The triode is {{very similar}} in {{operation}} to the n-channel JFET; it is normally on, and progressively switched off as the grid/gate is pulled increasingly negative of the source/cathode.

50|$|Degradation in <b>pinch-off</b> voltage. This is {{a common}} failure mode for gallium {{arsenide}} devices operating at high temperature, and primarily stems from semiconductor-metal interactions and degradation of gate metal structures, with hydrogen being another reason. It can be hindered by a suitable barrier metal between the contacts and gallium arsenide.|$|E
50|$|Lambda diodes work {{at higher}} voltage than tunnel diodes. Whereas a typical tunnel diode may exhibit {{negative}} differential resistance approximately between 70 mV and 350 mV, this region occurs approximately between 1.5 V and 6 V in a lambda diode {{due to the}} higher <b>pinch-off</b> voltages of typical JFET devices. A lambda diode therefore cannot replace a tunnel diode directly.|$|E
50|$|The {{field effect}} tetrode {{can be used}} as a highly linear {{electronically}} variable resistor - resistance is not modulated by signal voltage. Signal voltage can exceed bias voltage, <b>pinch-off</b> voltage and junction breakdown voltage. The limit is dependent on dissipation. Signal current flows in inverse proportion to the channel resistances - signal does not modulate the depletion layer, meaning the tetrode can perform at high frequencies. The tuning ratio can be very large - the high resistance limit in the megohms range for symmetrical pinch off conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} channel-length {{modulation}} upon the MOSFET output resistance varies {{both with the}} device, particularly its channel length, and with the applied bias. The main factor affecting the output resistance in longer MOSFETs is channel length modulation as just described. In shorter MOSFETs additional factors arise such as: drain-induced barrier lowering (which lowers the threshold voltage, increasing the current and decreasing the output resistance), velocity saturation (which tends to limit the increase in channel current with drain voltage, thereby increasing the output resistance) and ballistic transport (which modifies the collection of current by the drain, and modifies drain-induced barrier lowering so as to increase supply of carriers to the <b>pinch-off</b> region, increasing the current and decreasing the output resistance). Again, accurate results require computer models.|$|E

50|$|Combat models, albeit very rarely, {{may have}} their lines cut or {{otherwise}} {{broken by the}} other airplane, and can fly outside the circle. Most combat competition today requires that the airplane be equipped with a device that shuts off fuel to the engine if the lines are cut. This can work by either using the centrifugal force to keep the shutoff from pinching the line, or by using the line tension to hold the <b>pinch-off</b> device open. This way, the engine is not running and tends to decelerate very quickly instead of accelerating quickly as it would otherwise (since the drag of the lines is removed). This technique {{has proved to be}} very effective in practice.

40|$|We report {{results from}} an {{experimental}} study of cavity formation during the impact of superhydrophobic spheres onto water. Using a simple splash-guard mechanism, we block the spray emerging during initial contact from closing thus eliminating the phenomenon known as 'surface seal', which typically occurs at Froude numbers Fr= V 0 2 /(gR 0) = O(100). As such, {{we are able to}} observe the evolution of a smooth cavity in a more extended parameter space than has been achieved in previous studies. Furthermore, by systematically varying the tank size and sphere diameter, we examine the influence of increasing wall effects on these guarded impact cavities and note the formation of surface undulations with wavelength λ =O(10) cm and acoustic waves λa=O(D 0) along the cavity interface, which produce multiple <b>pinch-off</b> points. Acoustic waves are initiated by pressure perturbations, which themselves are generated by the primary cavity <b>pinch-off.</b> Using high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques we study the bulk fluid flow for the most constrained geometry and show the larger undulations (λ =O (10 cm)) have a fixed nature with respect to the lab frame. We show that previously deduced scalings for the normalized (primary) <b>pinch-off</b> location (ratio of <b>pinch-off</b> depth to sphere depth at <b>pinch-off</b> time), Hp/H = 1 / 2, and <b>pinch-off</b> time, τ α (R 0 /g) 1 / 2, do not hold for these extended cavities in the presence of strong wall effects (sphere-to-tank diameter ratio), ε = D 0 /Dtank 1 / 16. Instead, we find multiple distinct regimes for values of Hp/H as the observed undulations are induced above the first <b>pinch-off</b> point as the impact speed increases.

40|$|Cavity {{formation}} {{resulting from}} the water-entry of solid objects {{has been the subject}} of extensive research owing to its practical relevance in naval, military, industrial, sports and biological applications. The cavity formed by an impacting hydrophobic sphere normally seals at two places, one below (deep seal) and the other above the water surface (surface seal). For Froude numbers, the air flow into the resulting cavity is strong enough to suck the splash crown above the surface and disrupt the cavity dynamics before it deep seals. In this research work we eliminate surface seals by means of a novel practice of using cone splash-guards and examine the undisturbed transient cavity dynamics by impact of hydrophobic spheres for Froude numbers ranging. This enabled the measurement of extremely accurate <b>pinch-off</b> heights, <b>pinch-off</b> times, radial cavity collapse rates, and jet speeds in an extended range of Froude numbers compared to the previous work of Duclaux et al. (2007). Results in the extended regime were in remarkable agreement with the theoretical prediction of scaled <b>pinch-off</b> depth, and experimentally derived <b>pinch-off</b> time for. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of confinement on cavity formation by varying the cross-sectional area of the tank of liquid. In conjunction with surface seal elimination we observed the formation of multiple <b>pinch-off</b> points where a maximum of four deep seals were obtained in a sequential order for the Froude number range investigated. The presence of an elongated cavity beneath the first <b>pinch-off</b> point 5 resulted in evident "kinks" primarily related to the greatly diminished air pressure at the necking region caused by supersonic air flows (Gekle et al. 2010).
