To better understand their role in the soil, they are often studied under controlled conditions. However, a persistent problem in such controlled experiments is the ability of earthworms to escape from experimental units with open tops (e. g. for plant growth). Here, we tested whether adhesive hook tape applied to the inside of mesocosms is effective in confining them to their experimental units. A mesocosm study was set up with hook tape treatments (control, one layer, two layers), mesocosm material (<b>polyvinylchloride</b> – <b>PVC,</b> polypropylene – PP) and earthworm species (Lumbricus rubellus (Hoffmeister), Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny), Lumbricus terrestris (L.) + Aporrectodea longa (Ude)) as different factors to study the escape of earthworms during 24 h. In the treatments without hook tape, individuals of L. rubellus and A. caliginosa escaped, with highest escape rates (80 %) for L. rubellus from the PP mesocosms, and lowest escape rates (20 %) for A. caliginosa from the PVC mesocosms. When hook tape was applied, in either one or two layers, no individuals of those species escaped. The two anecic earthworm species, L. terrestris and A. longa did not escape from any mesocosms, irrespective of the presence of hook tape. As not a single earthworm escaped from the hook tape treatments, we conclude that applying hook tape is a simple, inexpensive and effective method to keep earthworms confined to experimental units...|$|R

5000|$|Polymeric {{membranes}} {{lead the}} membrane separation industry market {{because they are}} very competitive in performance and economics. Many polymers are available, but the choice of membrane polymer is not a trivial task. A polymer has to have appropriate characteristics for the intended application. The polymer sometimes has to offer a low binding affinity for separated molecules (as {{in the case of}} biotechnology applications), and has to withstand the harsh cleaning conditions. It has to be compatible with chosen membrane fabrication technology. The polymer has to be a suitable membrane former in terms of its chains rigidity, chain interactions, stereoregularity, and polarity of its functional groups. The polymers can form amorphous and semicrystalline structures (can also have different glass transition temperatures), affecting the membrane performance characteristics. The polymer has to be obtainable and reasonably priced to comply with the low cost criteria of membrane separation process. Many membrane polymers are grafted, custom-modified, or produced as copolymers to improve their properties. The most common polymers in membrane synthesis are cellulose acetate, Nitrocellulose, and cellulose esters (CA, CN, and CE), polysulfone (PS), polyether sulfone(PES), polyacrilonitrile(PAN), polyamide, polyimide, polyethylene and polypropylene (PE and PP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), <b>polyvinylchloride</b> (<b>PVC).</b>|$|E
50|$|A tracer {{projectile}} {{is constructed}} with a hollow base {{filled with a}} pyrotechnic flare material, made of a mixture of a very finely ground metallic fuel, oxidizer, and {{a small amount of}} organic fuel. Metallic fuels include magnesium, aluminum, and occasionally zirconium. The oxidizer is a salt molecule which contains oxygen combined with a specific atom responsible for the desired color output. Upon ignition, the heated salt releases its oxygen to sustain combustion of the fuel in the mixture. The color-emitting atom in the salt is also released and reacts chemically with excess oxygen providing the source of the colored flame. In NATO standard ammunition (including US), the oxidizer salt is usually a mixture of strontium compounds (nitrate, peroxide, etc.) and the metallic fuel is magnesium. Burning strontium yields a bright red light. Russian and Chinese tracer ammunition generates green light using barium salts. An oxidizer and metallic fuel alone, however, do not make a practical pyrotechnic for the purposes of producing colored light. The reaction is too energetic, consuming all materials in one big flash of white lightwhite light being the characteristic output of magnesium-oxide (MgO), for example. Therefore, in the case of using Strontium Nitrate and Magnesium, to produce a red colored flame that is not over-powered by the white light from the burning fuel, a chlorine donor is provided in the pyrotechnic mixture, so that Strontium Chloride can also form in the flame, cooling it so that the white light of MgO is greatly reduced. Cooling the flame in this manner also lengthens the reaction rate so that the mixture has an appreciable burn time. <b>Polyvinylchloride</b> (<b>PVC)</b> is a typical organic fuel in colored light for this purpose. Some modern designs use compositions that produce little to no visible light and radiate mainly in infrared, being visible only on night vision equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{common type}} of {{removable}} retainer is the vacuum formed retainer (VFR). This is a polypropylene or <b>polyvinylchloride</b> (<b>PVC)</b> material, which is more economical and faster to make, typically [...]020" [...] or [...]030" [...] thick. Essix (invented by Dr. John Sheridan) and Zendura are the brand names commonly associated with this retainer. This clear or transparent retainer fits over the entire arch of teeth or only from canine to canine (clip-on retainer) and is produced from a mold. It is similar in appearance to Invisalign trays, though the latter are not considered [...] "retainers." [...] The retainer is virtually invisible and clear when worn. Hence, it can provide aesthetics value to the patient. VFRs, if worn 24 hours per day, do not allow {{the upper and lower}} teeth to touch because plastic covers the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Some orthodontists feel that {{it is important for the}} top and bottom chewing surfaces to meet to allow for [...] "favorable settling" [...] to occur. Besides that, it is advisable to wear VFRs only at night, every night. When eating is necessary, the retainer is removed to allow natural consumption and to avoid the crushing of the VFR. Patient should be informed never to drink, especially cariogenic or fizzy drinks, with VFR in situ as it will lead to substantial loss of tooth surface and dental caries. The retainer can behave like a reservoir, enclosing the incisal edges and cuspal tips with the cariogenic drink, leading to decalcification of teeth. VFRs are less expensive, less visible, and easier to wear than Hawley retainers; however, for patients with disorders such as bruxism, VFRs are prone to rapid breakage and deterioration, especially if the material is PVC, a short chain molecule which breaks down far more quickly than polypropylene, a long chain molecule.|$|E
40|$|The {{variation}} of electrical resistivity as will as the mechanical properties of <b>PVC</b> (<b>polyvinylchloride)</b> -NBR (acrylonitrile butadiene rubber) based conductive composites filled with different concentrations of graphite were studied. These samples were studied as {{function of the}} constant deformation fatigue test. When the specimen was subjected to {{a large number of}} rapidly repeating strain cycles, and different strain amplitudes, the conductivity, &# 963;(T), shows an initial rapid fall followed by dynamic equilibrium. Increasing the number of cycles and strain amplitudes, the conductivity remains almost constant over the temperature range 30 – 140 °C. The equilibrium state between destruction and reconstruction of graphite particles has been detected for all strains of certain values of strain cycles (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles for 30 % strain amplitude). A preliminary study was done to optimize the possibility to use Conductive Polymer Composites (CPC) as a strain sensor and to evaluate its performance by an intrinsic physico-mechanical modification measurement. The electromechanical characterization was performed to demonstrate the adaptability and the correct functioning of the sensor as a strain gauge on the fabric. The coefficient of strain sensitivity (K) was measured for 50 phr graphite/PVCNBR vulcanized at 3000 number of strain cycles and 30 % strain amplitude. There was a broad maximum of K, with a peak value of 82, which was much higher, compared to conventional wire resistors. A slight hysteresis was observed at unloading due to plasticity of the matrix. A good correlation exists between mechanical and electrical response to the strain sensitivity. Mechanical reinforcement was in accordance with the Quemada equation [1] and Guth model [2] attested to good particle-matrix adhesion. It was found that the viscous component of deformation gradually disappeared and the hardening occurred with increasing strain cycles.

40|$|Miel I is a 188 m high RCC dam in Colombia, at {{elevation}} 454 m a. s. l. The RCC mix has {{a cement}} content of 85 to 160 kg/m 3. To meet contractual schedule, {{the original design}} of an upstream face made of slip formed reinforced concrete was changed to a Carpi drained exposed composite <b>Polyvinylchloride</b> geomembrane (= <b>PVC</b> geocomposite) system, placed on a 0. 4 m thick zone of RCC material enriched with cement grout and vibrated. Placement of the geocomposite system in horizontal stages allowed starting of dam impoundment while RCC placement was still ongoing at higher elevation. The geocomposite system was completed in 2002, before finishing of complementary concrete works. ISAGEN, {{the owner of the}} dam, constantly monitors the dam’s and geocomposite system’s performance. The average leakage of the dam registered since the first impoundment of the reservoir has been of 2 l/s for the geocomposite’s drainage system, and of 25 l/s from the abutments. Such levels are below the design parameters that defined the maximum acceptable leakage through the geocomposite in 9. 7 l/s and the maximum acceptable leakage through the abutments in 30 l/s. The measured leakage has never surpassed the historical values (with stable lecture through 11 years), or overcome the maximum allowed drainage design values defined during the design stage. After 11 years of good performance and operation, in summer 2013 ISAGEN decided to have a comprehensive monitoring of the general conditions and the weathering behaviour of the waterproofing geocomposite at Miel I. The objectives of the investigation were: assessing the reason of small cuts that had been detected and repaired (in total 15 in 11 years on a 31, 000 square meters surface), assessing the conditions of the PVC geocomposite, ascertaining at which extent its characteristics had changed over service, and evaluating if the weathering behaviour was in accordance with the expected durability. Investigation started with inspection at the upstream face and in the drainage galleries, followed by sampling of the exposed PVC geocomposites. Testing in an independent laboratory allowed comparing the physical and chemical properties of the aged geocomposite sample collected at the dam with the physical and chemical properties of the same geocomposite as manufactured. Evaluation of test results, based also on most recent research on geomembrane weathering mechanisms, completed the investigation. Results confirmed that the behaviour of the PVC geocomposite is extremely good and fully in line with expectations.
