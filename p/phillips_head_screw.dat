50|$|The VHS {{cassette}} is a 187 mm wide, 103 mm deep, 25 mm thick (7 × 4 × 1 inch) plastic shell {{held together}} with five <b>Phillips</b> <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> The flip-up cover that protects the tape has a built-in latch with a push-in toggle {{on the right side}} (bottom view image). The VHS cassette also includes an anti-despooling mechanism consisting of several plastic parts between the plastic spools, near the front of the tape (white and black in the top view). The spool latches are released by a push-in lever within a 6.35 mm (¼ inch) hole accessed {{from the bottom of the}} cassette, 19 mm (¾ inch) inwards from the edge label.|$|R
5000|$|Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) {{cross-head}} screwdrivers {{are still}} another standard, often inaccurately {{referred to as}} Japanese <b>Phillips.</b> Compatible <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> are usually identifiable by a single depressed dot or an [...] "X" [...] {{to one side of}} the cross slot. This is a screw standard throughout the Asia market and Japanese imports. The driver has a 57° point with a flat tip.|$|R
40|$|Follow {{the steps}} below {{to install the}} Conifer Chamber, and read the {{operational}} considerations for information on configuring the LI- 6400 software to compute leaf temperature using energy balance. Figure 2. Unscrew the knurled adjustment nut. Installation The sensor head handle must be removed to accomodate the 6400 - 05, so a tripod is usually required for making measurements. 1. Remove the male end of the leaf temperature thermocouple connec-tor by pulling straight out, and pull the air hose from {{the underside of the}} leaf chamber. 2. Unplug the log switch (not used with the conifer chamber). If the log switch wires are threaded underneath the bottom cover of the sensor head, this cover must be removed to free the log switch con-nector. a. Turn the sensor head over and remove the 3 <b>Phillips</b> <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> as shown in Figure 1. b. Remove the hose barbs, if necessary. You may be able to slide the cover out from underneath the hose barbs; be careful not to damage the PC board under the cover. If you remove the hose barbs, be sure and note the position of the sample and reference air hoses; the sample hose is wrapped with a piece of black shrink wrap. c. Free the wires. d. Re-assemble the cover {{on the bottom of the}} sensor head. 3. Remove the handle assembly: a. Unscrew the knurled leaf chamber adjustment nut (turn clock-wise) until it is free of the handle (Figure 2). b. With the handle latching mechanism in the closed position, wrap tape or string around the handle (where your hand would nor-mally be) so that it will stay together. Failure to do so may result in the spring coming out. Leave the handle secured in this manner. c. Remove the 2 screws (3 on some instruments) on the back side of the handle, as shown in Figure 3, using a # 1 <b>Phillips</b> <b>head</b> screwdriver. Figure 1. Remove the 3 screws on the sensor head bottom cover...|$|R
50|$|By design, Torx <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> resist cam-out {{better than}} <b>Phillips</b> <b>head</b> or slot <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Whereas <b>Phillips</b> <b>heads</b> were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, <b>screw</b> <b>head,</b> and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the <b>head</b> of the <b>screw.</b> The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the <b>screw</b> <b>head.</b> This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R
