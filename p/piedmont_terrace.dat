40|$|The Vinga Plain, {{a unit of}} the Banato – Crişane Plain, is a <b>piedmont</b> <b>terrace</b> plain {{covered by}} a thick layer of loess and loess-like deposits. The soil cover belongs to seven classes and many soil types and sub-types. The {{utilization}} of the Romanian System of Soil Taxonomy new criteria of classification brought to the modification of most of the soils names, to the change of certain soils from one class to another or to the appearance of new types and subtypes. The modifications on the soils map are more important than these modifications. Here, some soil units were included in other units (the former alluvial gleyic soils are now {{to be found in the}} Fluvisols class) or there appeared new units due to the separation of new soil types and sub-types (the former units of the illuvial clay chernozems were sheared between argic chernozems and argic phaeozems) ...|$|E

Both the Las Tunas mountain catchment and its piedmont are strongly entrenched with maximal incision of over 100 m at the mountain front. Three main terrace levels are well exposed and are labelled T 1, T 2 and T 3 from the youngest to the oldest. We combined geological and geomorphological field observations, kinematic GPS data, satellite data and aerial photos with geochronological 40 Ar= 39 Ar and 10 Be analysis to provide {{a detailed description of}} terrace organization and a discussion of the evolution of the Las Tunas landscape. The surprisingly constant 10 Be concentrations in surface layers as deep as 1. 5 m show that gently dipping alluvial surfaces can be continuously and deeply mixed. Our data show a first period of deposition (Mesones Fm) before 0. 85 Myr (minimum T 3 age), followed by deep erosion and a second sedimentation period (Las Tunas Fm) that includes a ca. 0. 6 Myr ash deposit. T 2 and T 1 are inset in the Las Tunas Fm and were abandoned ca. 15 – 20 kyr ago. The similar ages for T 2 and T 1 show that post- 20 kyr entrenchment occurred very rapidly. Despite Quaternary deformation in the Las Tunas <b>piedmont,</b> <b>terrace</b> entrenchment is best explained by paleo-climatic changes. The terrace organization reveals that the erosion-sedimentation phases affected the entire system from the piedmont toe to 10 km upstream of the mountain front. Finally, contrary to the neighbouring more deeply incised Diamante River system, where late Quaternary piedmont uplift is {{more likely to have been}} a factor causing incision, the more stable Las Tunas system provides an incomplete geomorphological record of Pleistocene and Holocene climate variations. We suggest that climate variations are better recorded in uplifting piedmonts than in stable ones, where the magnitude of incision and sedimentation and the fact that they occur repeatedly at the same elevation can erase a large part of the record...|$|E
40|$|Dis) {{connectivity}} {{within and}} between landscape compartments affects the extent and rate of transfer of energy and matter through catchments. Various landforms may impede sediment conveyance in a river system, whether laterally to the channel (termed buffers) or longitudinally along the channel itself (termed barriers). A generic approach to analysis of landscape (dis) connectivity using slope threshold analysis in GIS, tied to air photograph interpretation and field mapping of buffers and barriers, is tested in the upper Hunter catchment, Australia. Under simulated conditions, effective catchment area, which {{is a measure of}} the proportion of a catchment that has the potential to contribute sediment to the channel network, varies from 73 % to just 3 % of the total catchment area for differing subcatchments in the upper Hunter. This variability can be explained by the spatial distribution and assemblage of buffers and barriers in each subcatchment. Multiple forms of disconnectivity are evident in some subcatchments, such that when one buffer or barrier is breached, other features still impede sediment transfer within the system. The importance of the position of buffers and barriers within any given subcatchment is emphasised. Spatial variability in valley width exerts a critical control on catchment connectivity, with more efficient sediment conveyance in narrow valleys relative to wider valleys characterised by <b>piedmonts,</b> <b>terraces,</b> fans and extensive floodplains in which conveyance is impeded. This variability reflects the landscape history and geological setting of each subcatchment. The framework developed in this paper can be used to assess the impact of natural or human-induced buffers and barriers on catchment-scale sediment flux in any landscape setting, providing a physical template atop which other biogeochemical fluxes could be examined. 20 page(s...|$|R
