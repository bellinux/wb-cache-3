40|$|An {{electrical}} {{variable transmission}} (EVT) {{can be used}} as a <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> <b>device</b> in hybrid electrical vehicles. The EVT analyzed in this paper is a rotating field electrical machine having two concentric rotors. On the outer rotor, permanent magnets (PMs) are combined with a dc-field winding, being the first implementation of its kind. The magnetic field in the machine as well as the electromagnetic torque on both rotors are a function of the q- and d-axis currents of the stator and inner rotor, as well as the dc-field current. To describe and fully understand this multiple-input multiple-output machine, this paper gives an overview of the influence of the different current inputs on the flux linkage and torque on both rotors. Focus is given to the hybrid excitation in the d-axis by combining the dc-field current and the alternating currents. This has the advantage compared to other EVT topologies that unwanted stator torque can be avoided without stator d-axis current flux weakening. Results of the analysis are presented by means of the torque to current characteristics of a double rotor PM-assisted EVT, as well as the torque to current ratios.

The transaxle and traction motor have been redesigned, delivering a reduction in their combined weight. The traction motor itself is considerably more compact and gains a better power-to-weight ratio. Notably there is a 20 percent reduction in mechanical losses due to friction compared to the previous model. The Motor Speed Reduction Device (a second planetary gear set found only in the Third Generation P410 and P510 transaxles), and which connects the traction motor directly to the <b>Power</b> <b>Split</b> <b>Device,</b> and thereafter to the wheels, has been replaced with parallel gears on the Fourth Generation P610 transaxle.

40|$|An {{electrical}} {{variable transmission}} (EVT) is an electrical machine {{consisting of a}} stator and two concentric rotors. It is a competitive alternative for <b>power</b> <b>split</b> <b>devices</b> used in current series-parallel HEV's. Although tending to have high power densities, PM machines suffer from no-load iron losses. Since the torque interaction between stator and outer rotor is low during large time intervals, the EVT in this paper possesses a flux bridge with dc-field winding to modulate the stator field, while maintaining the inner rotor flux linkage. In this paper, a torque controller is proposed that optimally combines the stator, dc-field and inner rotor currents {{in order to minimize}} the copper and iron losses in every operating point of torque and speed on both rotors. Also the electromagnetic coupling between both rotors is considered. It turns out that there are two optimal load angles for the stator currents, of which one of the two is dominant depending on speed and torque. The control is tested on a $ 120 $kW prototype EVT, and measurement results are given to illustrate the optimal performance obtained with the proposed torque control.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{simultaneous}} transmission of a 10 Gbps RZ-DPSK data signal for downstream {{as well as}} for upstream is proposed and successfully simulated. An OCS (Optical Carrier Suppression) scheme for generation of second order dual side-band optical carrier is utilized by quadrupling a 10 GHz clockfrequency with a 10 GHz LN-MZM (Lithium-Niobate Mach-Zehnder-Modulator). The upper side second order band is used to generate a RZ-DPSK (Return to Zero-Differential Phase Shift Keying) data signal at the OLT (Optical Line Terminal). At the receiving ONU (Optical Network Unit) 50 km away from the OLT the unmodulated lower side second order band coupled with the downlink transmitted signal is utilized for the uplink modulation of 10 Gbps data in RZ-DPSK format. The simulation results show that the performance of the single-tone RZ-DPSK data modulation format is a suitable choice for the WDMPON (Wavelength Division Multiplexing-Passive Optical Network) link with a transmission span of 50 km.
