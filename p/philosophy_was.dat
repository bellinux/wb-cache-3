5|$|Adi Da {{initially}} {{became known}} in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s for his books and public talks, and for the activities of his religious community. His <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> essentially similar to many eastern religions which see spiritual enlightenment as the ultimate priority of human life. Distinguishing his from other religious traditions, Adi Da declared {{that he was a}} uniquely historic avatar (incarnation of a god or divinity in human form). As such, Adi Da stated that henceforth devotional worship of him would be the sole means of spiritual enlightenment for anyone else.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Himmler {{joined the}} Artaman League, a Völkisch youth group. There he met Rudolf Höss, who was later commandant of Auschwitz {{concentration}} camp, and Walther Darré, whose book, The Peasantry as the Life Source of the Nordic Race, caught Hitler's attention, leading to his later appointment as Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture. Darré was {{a firm believer}} in the superiority of the Nordic race, and his <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> a major influence on Himmler.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E

5|$|Intellectually, Scott {{and figures}} like Thomas Carlyle {{played a part}} in the {{development}} of historiography and the idea of the historical imagination. Romanticism also influenced science, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy, giving Scotland a prominence in these areas that continued into the late nineteenth century. Scottish <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> dominated by Scottish Common Sense Realism, which shared some characteristics with Romanticism and was a major influence on the development of Transcendentalism. Scott also played a major part in defining Scottish and British politics, helping to create a romanticised view of Scotland and the Highlands that fundamentally changed Scottish national identity.|$|E
5|$|Kannada {{literature}} {{during this}} period consisted of writings relating to the socio-religious developments of the Jain and Veerashaiva faiths, {{and to a lesser}} extent that of the Vaishnava faith. The earliest well-known brahmin writers in Kannada were from the Hoysala court. While most of the courtly textual production was in Kannada, an important corpus of monastic Vaishnava literature relating to Dvaita (dualistic) <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> written by the renowned philosopher Madhvacharya in Sanskrit.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolina Tar Heels were {{coached by}} Frank McGuire, {{who was in}} his fifth season as {{head coach of the}} Tar Heels. His {{offensive}} <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> centered around passing before shooting. McGuire's starting line up and most of the roster consisted of players primarily from around the New York area. Tommy Kearns and Pete Brennan were two offensive specialists. Center Joe Quigg provided a solid presence in the paint and grabbed almost nine rebounds per game. Guard Bob Cunningham was one of the teams best defensive players. The team was led by Lennie Rosenbluth who averaged almost twentyeight points a game and served as the team's clutch performer.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{at least}} two senses in which the term <b>philosophy</b> <b>is</b> used: a formal and an {{informal}} sense. In the formal sense, <b>philosophy</b> <b>is</b> an academic study of the fields of aesthetics, ethics, epistemology, logic, metaphysics, as well as social and political philosophy.

5|$|The {{conservative}} {{tradition of}} the mosque, with its {{lack of attention to}} science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> also added to the study program.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher Aristotle was {{the most}} {{influential}} scholar of the living world from classical antiquity. Though his early work in natural <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> speculative, Aristotle's later biological writings were more empirical, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes {{of plants and animals}} in the world around him, which he devoted considerable attention to categorizing. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, formal causes, guided all natural processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} of the eastern areas of the Roman Empire from the Persians once again raised the problem of religious unity centering on {{the understanding of the}} true nature of Christ. Most of the inhabitants of these provinces were Monophysites who rejected the Council of Chalcedon. Heraclius tried to promote a compromise doctrine called Monothelitism but this <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> rejected as heretical by both sides of the dispute. For this reason, Heraclius was viewed as a heretic and bad ruler by some later religious writers. After the Monophysite provinces were finally lost to the Muslims, Monotheletism rather lost its raison d'être and was eventually abandoned.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach to the}} comparison of Buddhist thought with Western <b>philosophy</b> <b>is</b> to use {{the concept of the}} Middle Way in Buddhism as a critical tool for the assessment of Western philosophies. In this way Western <b>philosophies</b> can <b>be</b> classified in Buddhist terms as eternalist or nihilist. In a Buddhist view all <b>philosophies</b> <b>are</b> considered non-essential views (ditthis) and not to be clung to.|$|R
50|$|For Proclus, <b>philosophy</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} because {{it is one of}} the primary ways to rescue the soul from a fascination with the body and restore it to its station. However, beyond its own station, the soul has Intellect as its goal, and ultimately has unification with the One as its goal. So higher than <b>philosophy</b> <b>is</b> the non-discursive reason of Intellect, and the pre-intellectual unity of the One. <b>Philosophy</b> <b>is</b> therefore a means of its own overcoming, in that it points the soul beyond itself.|$|R

5|$|Although modern {{biology is}} a {{relatively}} recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> studied {{as early as the}} ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece. While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E
5|$|O'Malley's Irish father, Edwin Joseph O'Malley, was {{politically}} connected. Walter, a University of Pennsylvania salutatorian, {{went on to}} obtain a Juris Doctor, and he used the combination of his family connections, his personal contacts, and both his educational and vocational skills to rise to prominence. First, he became an entrepreneur involved in public works contracting, and then he became an executive with the Dodgers. He progressed from being a team lawyer to being both the Dodgers' owner and president, and he eventually made the business decision to relocate the Dodgers franchise. Although he moved the franchise, O'Malley {{is known as a}} businessman whose major <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> stability through loyalty to and from his employees.|$|E

5000|$|Whereas {{science is}} {{instrumental}} and limited, <b>philosophy</b> <b>is</b> {{a form of}} inclusive knowledge that recognizes the shortcomings of systematic thought; <b>philosophy</b> <b>is</b> that which establishes the limitations {{as well as the}} boldness of the sciences, and it is the role of philosophy to integrate all human knowledge.|$|R

5|$|The {{decisions}} reached {{during this}} period vary, however, mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time. While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> one of laissez faire thanks {{to the influence of}} philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith, Michael W. Flinn asserted that: Another common error... has been the assumption that the classical economists were the only effective influence on social and economic policy in the early and mid-nineteenth century. This is a curiously perverse view, since it ignores powerful voices like those of Bentham, Chadwick, the social novelists, many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession, the humanitarians, the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many working class movements. There was in short, nothing approaching a consensus of opinion concerning laissez-faire and state intervention, even in the very narrow social sector represented by governments, Parliament, and the press. In practice the ears of ministers were assaulted by a confused babble of voices rather than bewitched by the soft whisper of a single plea for inaction.|$|E
5|$|The known {{history of}} Gaza spans 4,000 years. Gaza was ruled, {{destroyed}} and repopulated by various dynasties, empires, and peoples. Originally a Canaanite settlement, it {{came under the}} control of the ancient Egyptians for roughly 350 years before being conquered and becoming one of the Philistines' principal cities. Gaza fell to the Israelites in about 1000 BCE but became part of the Assyrian Empire around 730 BCE. Alexander the Great besieged and captured the city in 332 BCE. Most of the inhabitants were killed during the assault, and the city, which became a center for Hellenistic learning and <b>philosophy,</b> <b>was</b> resettled by nearby Bedouins. The area changed hands regularly between two Greek successor-kingdoms, the Seleucids of Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt, until it was besieged and taken by the Hasmoneans in 96 BCE.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} {{philosophy}} of science trace back to Plato and Aristotle who distinguished {{the forms of}} approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of abductive, deductive, and inductive inference, and also analyzed reasoning by analogy. The eleventh century Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied geometry, especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the reflection and refraction of light. Roger Bacon (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized {{by many to be}} the father of modern scientific method. His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.|$|E

5|$|This simple <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> tested as Texas A transitioned from an all-male {{military}} {{college to}} a coeducational research university. The addition {{of women to}} the Corps presented some challenges, including one high-profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former Corps and Band members. When women were finally admitted to the band under court order (Fall Semester, 1985); the first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within the band dorms. Reporters were relentless and Haney finally called an open press conference with the three young ladies. The female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies (members of their freshman class in their unit) {{were included in the}} photos. With a band dropout rate of 33% the odds were against all of the female cadets succeeding, only Andrea Abat remained in the band through her senior year. Haney realized the separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated the dorms, grouping females {{at one end of the}} dorm and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use.|$|E
5|$|Various esoteric {{organizations}} {{that emerged in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the Theosophical Society and the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, repeated the beliefs that had originated with Sethos: that Egyptians underwent initiation within the pyramids and that Greek philosophers were initiates who learned Egypt's secret wisdom. Esoteric writers influenced by Theosophy, such as Reuben Swinburne Clymer in his 1909 book The Mystery of Osiris and Manly Palmer Hall in Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians in 1937, also wrote of an age-old Egyptian mystery tradition. An elaborate example of these beliefs is the 1954 book Stolen Legacy by George James, which claims that Greek <b>philosophy</b> <b>was</b> built on knowledge stolen from the Egyptian school of initiates. James imagined this mystery school as a grandiose organization with branches on many continents, so that the purported system of Egyptian mysteries shaped cultures all over the world.|$|E
