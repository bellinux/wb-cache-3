40|$|AbstractThis study assesses {{and compares}} the nutritional, textural and sensory {{characteristics}} of Coalho cheese made from goat's (CGM) or cow's milk (CCM) and their mixture (CCGM) during cold storage for 28 days. Among the assessed physiochemical parameters, {{the type of}} milk used during production only influenced (P <  0. 05) the moisture, fat and salt contents of the cheeses. CGM and CCGM showed higher (P <  0. 05) content of short- and medium-chain fatty acids, such as C 6, C 8 and C 10 and C 12, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids C 18 : 2 n 6 c, and lower content of C 16 and C 16 : 1. All cheeses presented satisfactory sensory characteristics {{for most of the}} assessed parameters. However the addition of cow's milk to goat's milk improved sensory acceptability, mainly through the reduction of goat's milk odor and flavor. Coalho cheese made with the mixture of cow's and goat's milk maintained <b>particular</b> positive <b>nutritional</b> <b>characteristics</b> of goat's cheese, especially with respect to the fatty acids profile, with improved acceptability.

The polyunsaturated/saturated ratio was found equal to 0. 25, that of ω 6 /ω 3 equal to 4. 1.

The present article proposes a scientific evaluation of the physical, chemical and <b>nutritional</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the horse meat with a comparison between the meat coming from other species of domestic animals focusing also on its production for human consumption, the traditional consumption in different areas of the world, arguments for consumption, the reaction of the European Commission and the measures taken in order to avoid critical situations of such kind. The materials and methods used for research consisted in treaties and scientific articles regarding the <b>characteristics</b> and <b>nutritional</b> facts of the horse meat, statistical databases, data about its production and consumption, studies among consumers and media items on the horse meat scandal, and official documents concerning the food fraud. Although the horse meat scandal has affected the European consumer behavior, the main problems are not nutritional or food safety.

At {{the end of the}} cool storage, fruits were maintained for a week at 25 °C (S 1 + 7 d and S 2 + 7 d). The flesh firmness was reduced at the end of cool storage and the soluble solids content significantly increased, for exception of fruits harvested at T 2 and stored for 6 months at 0 °C and a week at ambient temperature (S 2 + 7 d). Some <b>nutritional</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as vitamin C and carotenoids were higher in fruits gathered at T 1 but these parameters were strongly influenced by storage, with a general decrease {{at the end of the}} long cool storage (6 months). Differently, no influence of long storage was observed in the fruit collected at T 2 time. The maintenance for a week at room temperature, after long cool storage, determined an improvement of <b>nutritional</b> <b>characteristics</b> of kiwifruits. In conclusion, fruits harvested at T 2 seem to improve their quality after a long storage (6 months) because they reach nutritional values similar or higher than those recorded in fruits at the harvest time.
