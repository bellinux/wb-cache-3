40|$|ObjectiveParaplegia from {{spinal cord}} {{ischemia}} remains an unresolved complication in thoracoabdominal aortic surgery, with high morbidity and mortality. This study investigated postoperative effects of systemic blood pressure augmentation during ischemia. MethodsSpinal cord ischemia was induced in rabbits by infrarenal aortic occlusion for 15 minutes with infused phenylephrine (high blood <b>pressure</b> <b>group,</b> n = 8) or nitroprusside (low blood <b>pressure</b> <b>group,</b> n = 8) or without vasoactive agent (control, n = 8). Spinal cord blood flow, transcranial motor evoked potentials, neurologic outcome, and motor neuron cell damage (apoptosis, necrosis, superoxide generation, myeloperoxidase activity) were evaluated. ResultsMean arterial pressures during ischemia were controlled at 121. 9 ± 2. 8, 50. 8 ± 4. 3, and 82. 3 ± 10. 7 mm Hg in high blood pressure, low blood <b>pressure,</b> and control <b>groups,</b> respectively. In high blood <b>pressure</b> <b>group,</b> high spinal cord blood flow (P <. 01), fast recovery of transcranial motor evoked potentials (P <. 01), and high neurologic score (P <. 05) were observed after ischemia relative to low blood <b>pressure</b> and control <b>groups.</b> At 48 hours after ischemia, there {{were significantly more}} viable neurons, fewer terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling–positive neurons, and less α-fodrin expression in high blood <b>pressure</b> <b>group</b> than low blood <b>pressure</b> and control <b>groups.</b> Superoxide generation and myeloperoxidase activity at 3 hours after ischemia were suppressed in high blood <b>pressure</b> <b>group</b> relative to low blood <b>pressure</b> <b>group.</b> ConclusionsAugmentation of systemic blood pressure during spinal cord ischemia can reduce ischemic insult and postoperative neurologic adverse events...|$|R
