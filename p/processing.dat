40|$|In {{this paper}} we present three image <b>processings</b> {{intended}} to limit eye strain whene using stereoscopic displays. These <b>processings</b> {{are based on}} a compatibility of the disparity in the image and of the local spatial frequency: to measure this compatibility, we introduced a stereoscopic comfort function. According to the value of the function, one point in the image is processed or not. We suggest three filterings (a "Virtual Curtain ", a "Virtual Pane " and an "Adaptive Haze") that hide the points behind a gray curtain, a frosted pane or a kind of aerial perspective haze. These three <b>processings</b> were applied to synthetic images and presented to subjects in a human factors experiment. Whereas the less flexible <b>processings</b> ("Virtual Curtain " and "Virtual Pane ") were not very convincing, the "Adaptive Haze" proved to be more comfortable than the two others, and even more than the original images to a large extent...|$|R

5|$|Optimally, the speedup from parallelization {{would be}} linear—doubling {{the number of}} <b>processing</b> {{elements}} should halve the runtime, and doubling it a second time should again halve the runtime.

40|$|As one of {{the five}} basic senses, {{olfaction}} provides a unique channel to understand our sensory world and socioemotional experiences. It is phylogenetically old, highly conserved in evolution, and ubiquitously employed in the animal kingdom to communicate identity and motivation. Nevertheless, compared to vision and audition, human olfaction is poorly researched. Here six studies were conducted to probe the sensory properties of human olfactory system and its role in socioemotional communication. Study I examined whether sensory rivalry, as in binocular rivalry, also exists in the olfaction system. Study II looked at the influence of smells on visual perception. Study III tested the effect of chemosensory fearful cues on visual emotional perception. Study IV tested people's ability to detect chemosensory emotional cues and the role of familiarity in their sensitivity to such cues. Study V correlated one's chemosensory ability with his/her emotional capacity to probe the behavioral linkages between human olfaction and emotion. Lastly, Study VI examined the neural correlates of the social nature of natural human body odors by using a group of subjects with various degrees of social anxiety. The results demonstrate that there can be rivalry in olfactory <b>processings</b> between the two nostrils and in the cortex, and olfactory <b>processings</b> interact with visual <b>processings.</b> In addition, olfaction and emotion are closely related to each other. The olfactory system processes the socioemotional information conveyed by natural human body odors, which influences people's behavior and emotional <b>processings,</b> but often without their subjective awareness...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{oblivious}} (blind) {{information hiding}} methods {{from a new}} perspective. In [1], Costa introduced a communications framework that also applies to oblivious information hiding. We present an alternate and equivalent framework by carrying out the channel dependent nature of the optimal encoder in a different manner. Within the proposed framework, decoder structure is simplified, although in effect it's a slender advantage compared to overall complexity. This interpretation provides a better connection between the analytical results and practical designs. We evaluate the practical embedding-detection schemes employing scalar quantization procedures along with thresholding and distortion compensation types of <b>processings</b> from this perspective. Furthermore, we justify the assumptions for the optimality of {{the two types of}} <b>processings...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} model to predict the energy {{consumption}} of a H. 264 /AVC intra-only based encoder designed for the wireless video sensor networks (WVSNs). Such model is of great interest in an energy-constrained context like the WVSN, where the video streams are processed prior to transmission. In fact, accounting for both <b>processing's</b> and transmission's consumed energies allows the optimization of the global energy consumption. The proposed model predicts the <b>processing's</b> energy consumption based on the considered Quantization Parameter (QP) and the Frame Rate (FR) values. The generic form of this model enables it to predict the energy consumption of any H. 264 /AVC intra-only based encoder. Simulation results demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} proposed model, that is validated under different resolutions, QP and FR, with an average prediction error of 4 %...|$|R
