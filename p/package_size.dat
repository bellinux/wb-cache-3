25|$|As power {{dissipation}} of components increases and component <b>package</b> <b>size</b> decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal {{as well as}} its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in thermal contact with its heat sink with reasonable shock and vibration. The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy, wire-form z clips, flat spring clips, standoff spacers, and push pins with ends that expand after installing.|$|E

2500|$|FEV {{developed}} a DCT with an integrated electric motor, providing hybrid capability.

[...] Another spin-off from this design was the FEV xDCT that provides 10 forward speeds, but with the mechanical complexity of a standard six-speed DCT.|$|E

2500|$|Further complicating matters, under global {{nuclear war}} scenarios, with {{conditions}} similar to that during the Cold War, major strategically important cities, like Moscow, and Washington {{are likely to be}} hit not once, but numerous times from sub megaton multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles, in a cluster bomb or [...] "cookie cutter" [...] configuration. It has been reported that {{during the height of the}} Cold War in the 1970s Moscow was targeted by up to 60 warheads. The reasons that the cluster bomb concept is preferable in the targeting of cities is twofold, the first is down to the fact that large singular warheads are much easier to neutralize as both tracking and successful interception by anti-ballistic missile systems than it is when several smaller incoming warheads are approaching. This strength in numbers advantage to lower yield warheads is further compounded by such warheads tending to move at higher incoming speeds, due to their smaller, more slender physics <b>package</b> <b>size,</b> assuming both nuclear weapon designs are the same (a design exception being the advanced W88). The second reason for this cluster bomb, or ‘layering’ (using repeated hits by accurate low yield weapons), is that this tactic along with limiting the risk of failure, also reduces individual bomb yields, and therefore reduces the possibility of any serious collateral damage to non-targeted nearby civilian areas, including that of neighboring countries. This concept was pioneered by Philip J. Dolan and others.|$|E

40|$|Repackaging {{food into}} smaller servings {{has become a}} popular {{strategy}} among food marketers but recent research surprisingly suggests that smaller packs may lead to more food consumed. The aim of the present research is to explore the usefulness of using smaller <b>package</b> <b>sizes</b> {{as a tool for}} monitoring consumption. In particular, we explore this in situations where distractions are present. We find that smaller <b>package</b> <b>sizes</b> are beneficial for dieters, though usage needs to be in circumstances where no distractions are present.

50|$|The move {{to smaller}} units (e.g. {{millilitre}} vs fluid ounce, gram vs ounce) allows manufacturers to move <b>sizes</b> of <b>packaging</b> {{up and down}} with more precision using whole numbers. For example, a 2-ounce bag of chips may be altered to 50 grams, then to 45 grams. Likewise, a variety of <b>packaging</b> <b>sizes</b> may arise, such as 690 grams (about 24 oz) or 1200 grams (about 42 oz), resulting from conversion and rounding of customary units. However, the precise adjustment of <b>packaging</b> <b>sizes</b> is also possible using customary units, e.g. the 2-ounce bag can be downsized to 1.8 and 1.6 ounces as well.|$|R
