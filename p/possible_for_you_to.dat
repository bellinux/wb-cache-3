They’re playing “Ain’t Misbehavin’” over the radio. Boy honey, that’s no lie, ah ain’t- (ah can’t). Well anyhow they’re letting their little boys have beer tonight since we’ve been good all week. Gosh darling, the time is going so slow. I guess it’s because I don’t do anything all day around here. It seems like I haven’t seen you in weeks. And it’s only been four days. Honey, I think I’ll go nuts for the next 14. I miss you more now than I ever did while I was at Spence. Next weekend I’m going to try to get off if possible. I’m going to speak to the C. O. (only a 1 st LT.). And maybe honey, if I do, you could come down to Pensacola and I could meet you there. There’s no possible way you can even telegraph me so I’m just assuming <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> or can make it, darling. So if I can I will telegraph you Thursday night, the 22 nd you’ll probably get it Friday morning. I’ll send it in care of the Albert Hotel, O. K. I you don’t hear from me, don’t come down, but if <b>you</b> do, try <b>to</b> get to Pensacola Friday night so you can get a room, it’s very crowded, sticky with the Naivey! Stay in the largest hotel in town, ask someone which is, thank I can find you easily, honey. And if I can’t find you by 11 o’clock Saturday night call the U. S. O. in Pensacola and leave a message there. You’d better do that in the first place and I’ll go right there. And if there’s no U. S. O. just stay in the hotel. That’s the only thing I can think of honey, since there is no <b>possible</b> way <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> reach me here. So if I can make it I’ll telegraph you Thursday. Gosh I hope I can darling I miss you so much. And love you much more. It’s so awful being away from you. I love you darling with all my heart and soul. I will be that way- always.
