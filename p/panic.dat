5|$|The <b>Panic</b> of 1907 – {{also known}} as the 1907 Bankers' <b>Panic</b> or Knickerbocker Crisis – was a United States {{financial}} crisis that took place over a three-week period starting in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. <b>Panic</b> occurred, as this was during a time of economic recession, and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies. The 1907 <b>panic</b> eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy. Primary causes of the run included a retraction of market liquidity by a number of New York City banks and a loss of confidence among depositors, exacerbated by unregulated side bets at bucket shops.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav {{government}} of the newly formed FR Yugoslavia (successor to SFR Yugoslavia) ended up having three ideologically-opposed leaders occupying executive positions. From 1992, while Slobodan Milošević {{was the president of}} the Federal Republic of Serbia, national theorist Dobrica Ćosić was named President of FR Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, Milan <b>Panić,</b> a business magnate based in Newport Beach, California, accepted Milošević's invitation to be Prime Minister. <b>Panić</b> was subsequently elected as Prime Minister in the 1992 Yugoslav parliamentary elections. The United States did not revoke Panić's citizenship even though his occupation of an executive position in the Yugoslav government clearly contradicted the United States Constitution. Nevertheless, <b>Panić</b> would become a person of interest in US diplomatic circles, given his business and residence backgrounds. At a CSCE meeting in Helsinki in July 1992, US Secretary of State James Baker abruptly dismissed Panić's appeal to reduce the sanctions to Yugoslavia, even after an agreement (between <b>Panić,</b> Milošević, and Dušan Mitević) was reached by which Milošević would resign in return for sanction-relief. This ended up severely damaging Panić's unique diplomatic position internationally, as well as his standing in Yugoslavia. The Los Angeles Times published an article which described <b>Panić</b> as a doubtful upholder of potential American-Yugoslavian peacemaking, when in fact, many years later made to be known, <b>Panić</b> was actually invited by Baker in the first place rather than voluntarily coming to Helsinki.|$|E

40|$|Applying {{the ideas}} of Norbert Elias to the {{sociology}} of moral <b>panics,</b> this article argues that moral <b>panics</b> are processes of decivilization; occurring where civilizing processes break down and decivilizing trends become dominant. Examining the definitions of Goode & Ben-Yehuda (1994) and Stanley Cohen (2002), the article compares key characteristics of moral <b>panics</b> {{with some of the}} symptoms of decivilizing processes as proposed by Stephen Mennell (1990). Proposing two different types of campaigns that may accompany <b>panics</b> – integrative campaigns to ‘civilize’ the ‘other’; and exclusionary campaigns to isolate the ‘dangerous’ other – the article concludes by outlining how some of the fundamental concepts of figurational sociology can aid in our understanding of the complexities of moral <b>panics...</b>|$|R

40|$|By using bank-level data {{pertaining}} to {{the period of the}} Showa Depression in Japan, we examine whether banking <b>panics</b> caused solvent banks to close down and fail. We find that bank fundamentals were weakly related to the failures during the <b>panics.</b> This result implies that the confusion on the part of depositors regarding bank asset quality was not negligible during the <b>panics.</b> Further, we find that during the <b>panics,</b> the Bank of Japan (BoJ) selectively provided liquidity assistance to solvent banks that suffered heavy withdrawals. The BoJ as a lender of last resort prevented the closures of these solvent banks and mitigated the potential problems of the <b>panics.</b> Copyright 2009 Oxford University Press 2009 All rights reserved, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{competing}} theories explaining bank <b>panics.</b> One argues that <b>panics</b> {{are driven by}} real shocks, asymmetric information, and concerns about insolvency. The other theory argues that bank runs are self-fulfilling, driven by illiquidity and the beliefs of depositors. This paper tests predictions of these two theories using information uniquely available for the Crisis of 1893. The results suggest that real economic shocks were important determinants of the location of <b>panics</b> at the national level, however at the local level, both insolvency and illiquidity were important as triggers of bank <b>panics.</b> Banks and banking - History; Bank failures...|$|R

5|$|<b>Panic</b> {{reactions}} {{can occur}} after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected.

Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (disconnection from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E

40|$|Received: 03 Aug 2011 Accepted: 12 Oct 2012 Version {{of record}} first published: 09 Nov 2012 This paper {{presents}} {{a critical review}} {{of the use of}} “moral panics” theory as a means of understanding public debates about children and media, and specifically of the notion of “media <b>panics.</b> ” Following a brief presentation of the origins and key aspects of media <b>panics</b> theory, it focuses on six key issues that are at stake. It argues that there are some problems with the epistemology of media <b>panics</b> theory, with its account of intentionality, and with its claim to rationality. It further suggests that media <b>panics</b> theory tends to provide a “presentist” view of history, and a rather oversimplified account of cultural and generational politics; and that it neglects the positive positions that are also often rehearsed in public debate.

5|$|The {{frequency}} of crises and {{the severity of}} the 1907 <b>panic</b> added to concern about the outsized role of J.P. Morgan which led to renewed impetus toward a national debate on reform. In May 1908, Congress passed the Aldrich–Vreeland Act that established the National Monetary Commission to investigate the <b>panic</b> and to propose legislation to regulate banking.

5|$|The <b>panic</b> of 1907 {{occurred}} during a lengthy economic contraction—measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research as occurring between May 1907 and June 1908. The interrelated contraction, bank <b>panic</b> and falling stock market resulted in significant economic disruption. Industrial production dropped further than after any previous bank run, while 1907 saw the second-highest volume of bankruptcies to that date. Production fell by 11%, imports by 26%, while unemployment rose to 8% from under 3%. Immigration dropped to 750,000 people in 1909, from 1.2 million two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The <b>panic</b> was {{triggered}} by the failed attempt in October 1907 to corner the market on stock of the United Copper Company.
