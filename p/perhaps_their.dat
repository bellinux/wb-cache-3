5|$|The Aggies' {{first season}} {{as members of the}} SEC was led by {{freshman}} quarterback and 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Manziel, the Aggies posted a 6–2 conference record (10–2 overall), good for a second-place tie in the SEC West Division (tied with the LSU Tigers). In <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> biggest game of the season, the Aggies defeated defending national champions and 2013 BCS National Championship Game participants the Alabama Crimson Tide in Tuscaloosa, 29–24.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 season set {{several new}} {{records for the}} team, that had stood since the 1998 and 1999 seasons. They scored their most ever points (425), and most ever tries (42) in a season. Lima Sopoaga set a {{franchise}} record for most points in a season with 178, becoming just the third Highlander to score 25 points in a game. The 2000 year saw <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> greatest victory ever with their 65–23 win against the Bulls, setting several records; most points in a match, most tries in a match with nine, and largest winning margin of 42.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Hiroshima {{had reached a}} peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government. At {{the time of the}} attack, the population was approximately 340,000–350,000. Residents wondered why Hiroshima had been spared destruction by firebombing. Some speculated that the city was to be saved for U.S. occupation headquarters, others thought <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> relatives in Hawaii and California had petitioned the U.S. government to avoid bombing Hiroshima. More realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long, straight firebreaks, beginning in 1944. Firebreaks continued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of August 6, 1945.|$|E

25|$|The Akha are skilled hunters. Hunting is a male {{activity}} {{and a very}} popular one. It is a favorite pastime and a means of obtaining food. The barking deer is, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>their</b> favorite prey. Guns obtained from trading in the larger towns have begun to replace the use of crossbows in hunting.|$|E
25|$|In {{their place}} was a new core of players such as Luc Longley, Toni Kukoč, Steve Kerr, Ron Harper, Jud Buechler, Bill Wennington and Randy Brown. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> biggest {{addition}} to the team was Dennis Rodman, a nine-year veteran {{who had been a}} rebounding champion for four straight years, and whose controversial lifestyle has been well-documented.|$|E
25|$|Crabeaters have {{relatively}} slender bodies and long skulls and snouts {{compared to other}} phocids. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>their</b> most distinctive adaptation is the unique dentition that enables this species to sieve Antarctic krill. The postcanine teeth are finely divided with multiple cusps. Together with the tight fit of {{the upper and lower}} jaw, a bony protuberance near the back of the mouth completes a near-perfect sieve within which krill are trapped.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} women in the Hebrew Bible, the two women in this story are anonymous. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>their</b> names have not been {{mentioned}} so that they would not overshadow Solomon's wisdom, which is the main theme of the story.

25|$|If one {{replaces the}} inner {{product of a}} Euclidean space with an {{indefinite}} quadratic form, {{the result is a}} pseudo-Euclidean space. Smooth manifolds built from such spaces are called pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>their</b> most famous application is the theory of relativity, where flat spacetime is a pseudo-Euclidean space called Minkowski space, where rotations correspond to motions of hyperbolic spaces mentioned above. Further generalization to curved spacetimes form pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, such as in general relativity.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clearly}} stated in {{proceedings}} from the Australian Senate and policy {{statements from the}} government that the Australian emission reductions include land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) with the form of inclusion remaining undecided and whilst acknowledging that {{they are subject to}} the forming of accounting guidelines from this Copenhagen conference. In contention is the Australian Government's preference for the removal of non-human induced LULUCF emissions – and <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> abatement – from the account, such as from lightning induced bushfires and the subsequent natural carbon sequestering regrowth.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 {{the press}} widely {{reported}} suggestions by Alec Knight and Joanna Mountain of Stanford University {{that the original}} human language may have had clicks. The purported evidence for this is genetic: speakers of Juǀ'hoan and Hadza have the most divergent known mitochondrial DNA of any human populations, suggesting {{that they were the}} first, or at least among the first, surviving peoples to have split off the family tree. In other words, the three primary genetic divisions of humanity are the Hadza, the Juǀʼhoan and relatives, and everyone else. Because two of the three groups speak languages with clicks, <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> common ancestral language, which by implication is the ancestral language for all humankind, had clicks as well.|$|E
25|$|The Trio's lasting legacy, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> {{greatest}} innovation within professional wrestling, {{was the use}} of {{a regular}} group of wrestlers for a packaged show. Rather than paying traveling wrestlers to perform on certain dates and combining wrestlers in match-ups when they were available, they decided to keep wrestlers for months and years at a time, allowing long-term angles and feuds to develop. This was the key to their success; they were able to keep wrestlers from their competition, and were able to have regular wrestling cards. Their business succeeded quickly, gaining popularity for its freshness and unique approach to wrestling; a traveling stable of wrestlers. The Trio gained great popularity nationwide during their best years, roughly 1920 to 1925, when they performed in the Eastern territory, acquiring fans from the highly exposed big cities.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{and girls}} of citizen family wore amulets {{to protect them}} from immoral or baleful {{influences}} such as the evil eye and sexual predation. For boys, the amulet was a bulla, worn around the neck; the equivalent for girls was a crescent-shaped lunula. The toga praetexta, which was thought to offer similar apotropaic protection, was formal wear for freeborn boys until puberty, usually around 14 years of age, when they gave their toga praetexta and childhood bulla into the care of their family lares and put on the adult male's toga virilis. According to some Roman literary sources, freeborn girls might also wear - or at least, had the right to wear - a toga praetexta until marriage, when they offered their childhood toys, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> maidenly praetexta to Fortuna Virginalis; others claim a gift made to the family Lares, or to Venus, as part of their passage to adulthood. In traditionalist families, unmarried girls might be expected to wear their hair demurely bound in a fillet.|$|E

25|$|In late 2010 {{it became}} soon {{clear that the}} {{coalition}} would end its offensive activities in Afghanistan no later than {{by the end of}} 2014. With five infantry battalions now at its disposal, RC-N proceeded to secure the gains scored thus far. Fierce fighting - though less frequent in total due to the now-strong coalition presence - continued throughout 2011, with the Talibans' focus of operations shifting towards Baghlan province for a time until it came to a near-halt in late 2011. While this was regarded by some observers as a clear indication of the German success in the region, the insurgents continued to show their strength from time to time; <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> most humiliating blow dealt to the Germans took place on May 28, 2011 when Major General Markus Kneip, NATO's highest-ranking officer {{in the northern part of}} Afghanistan, was seriously wounded in an attack. Two soldiers of Kneip's entourage and several Afghans were also killed that day. Kneip is the highest ranking WIA of the Afghanistan War.|$|E
25|$|The {{same was}} {{generally}} true of other electric folk outfits. The late 1970s and early 1980s were {{a time to}} either abandon the genre or fight a losing struggle for survival. The reason is often said to be punk rock, which reached a peak in 1976-7. It changed the ethos of popular music, overturning certainties about musicianship and songwriting and had no greater target than the old fashioned folk musicians of the preceding generation. All popular music trends have a generational problem as their audiences grow and might not be replaced, but for folk rock the discontinuity was very acute. One result was a further hybridisation {{with the development of}} folk punk among younger acts in the later 1970s, some of which, like the Pogues and The Levellers, achieved some mainstream success. The early 1980s were the nadir of electric folk, when, in contrast to the mid-1970s only the Albion Band (with the associated Home Service) and the Oysterband remained as major exponents of the genre and this was <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> least productive period.|$|E

500|$|The feminist writer Cynthia Enloe {{has written}} that some pregnancies were {{intended}} by the soldiers and <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> officers as well. A report from the International Commission of Jurists said, [...] "Whatever the precise numbers, the teams of American and British surgeons carrying out abortions and the widespread government efforts to persuade people to accept these girls into the community, testify to the scale on which raping occurred". The commission also said that Pakistani officers not only allowed their men to rape, but enslaved women themselves.|$|E

500|$|Kurosawa quickly {{moved on}} to his next project, Red Beard. Based on a short story {{collection}} by Shūgorō Yamamoto and incorporating elements from Dostoyevsky's novel The Insulted and Injured, it is a period film, set in a mid-nineteenth century clinic for the poor, in which Kurosawa's humanist themes receive <b>perhaps</b> <b>their</b> fullest statement. A conceited and materialistic, foreign-trained young doctor, Yasumoto, is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutelage of Doctor Niide, known as [...] "Akahige" [...] ("Red Beard"), played by Mifune. Although he resists Red Beard initially, Yasumoto comes to admire his wisdom and courage, and to perceive the patients at the clinic, whom he at first despised, as worthy of compassion and dignity.|$|E
