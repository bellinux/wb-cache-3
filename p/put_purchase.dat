40|$|After the September 11 attacks, {{several major}} newswires {{reported}} that there were insiders who tried to profiteer from the futures market {{in anticipation of the}} event. We use the Student’s t-statistics and several non-parametric statistics to test whether there was abnormal trading in S&P 500 (SPX) index options prior to the September 11 attacks. Our findings from the out-of-the-money (OTM), at-the-money (ATM) and in-the-money (ITM) SPX index put options and ITM SPX index call options lead us to reject the null hypotheses that there was no abnormal trading in these contracts prior to the September 11 attacks. We also find evidence consistent with three bearish speculation strategies, namely the <b>Put</b> <b>Purchase</b> strategy, the Put Bear Spread strategy, and the Naked ITM Call Write strategy. In addition, we conclude that there is evidence of abnormal trading in the September 2001 OTM, ATM and ITM SPX index put options immediately after the 9 - 11 attacks. We also employ the CBOE VIX to confirm the conclusion drawn from the call and put options. This, in turn, is consistent with insiders anticipating the 9 - 11 attacks...|$|E

40|$|NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has {{recently}} partnered with Graftel Incorporated under an exclusive license agreement for the manufacture {{and sale of}} the Smart Current Signature Sensor. The Smart Current Signature Sensor and software were designed and developed to be utilized on any application using solenoid valves. The system monitors the electrical and mechanical health of solenoids by comparing the electrical current profile of each solenoid actuation to a typical current profile and reporting deviation from its learned behavior. The objective of this partnership with Graftel {{is for them to}} develop the technology into a hand-held testing device for their customer base in the Nuclear Power Industry. The device will be used to perform diagnostic testing on electromechanical valves used in Nuclear Power plants. Initially, Graftel plans to have working units within the first year of license in order to show customers and allow them to <b>put</b> <b>purchase</b> requests into their next year's budget. The subject technology under discussion was commercialized by the Kennedy Space Center Technology Programs and Partnerships Office, which patented the technology and licensed it to Graftel, Inc., a company providing support, instrumentation, and calibration services to the nuclear community and private sector for over 10 years. For the nuclear power industry, Graftel designs, manufacturers, and calibrates a full line of testing instrumentation. Grafters smart sensors have been in use in the United States since 1993 and have proved to decrease set-up time and test durations. The project was funded by Non-Destructive Engineering, and it is felt that this technology will have more emphasis on future vehicles. Graftel plans to market the Current Signature Sensor to the Electric Utility industry. Graftel currently supplies product and services to the Nuclear Power Industry in the United States as well as internationally. Product and services sold are used in non-destructive testing for valves, penetrations and other applications. Graftel also supplies testing services to an industrial customer base. The customer base includes 90 percent of the U. S. Nuclear plants and plants in Brazil, Europe, and Asia. Graftel works internationally with two representative groups and employees and has ten people at the principle location and a group of contract engineers around the country...|$|E

40|$|Soybean {{producers}} have faced considerable price risk in recent years. The large variations in soybean {{prices have been}} increasingly noticeable in the last 15 years or so {{as compared with the}} 1950 s and 1960 s. Harvest cash returns have been highly volatile and frequently low. Soybean {{producers have}} available a number of marketing alternatives which they can use to help reduce price risks for their product. These alternatives include futures as well as options markets for soybeans. However, less than ten percent of U. S. major-crop farmers currently employ futures and/or options contracts in the marketing of their products. This situation stems mainly from lack of enough information currently available on how the use of these contracts affects the prices received by farmers for their products. Relatively little research has been done thus far on marketing strategies for major-crop farmers. The {{purpose of this study is}} to partially remedy this situation;Forty-two marketing strategies involving cash sales, futures market contracts, and options market contracts for soybean farmers in Northcentral Iowa were simulated over the period of 1975 through 1985. Because soybean option contracts were not traded in the U. S. before November 1984, options premiums were estimated for the 1975 - 84 period with a modified version of the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) model. An attractive feature of this model is that it takes into account the effects of government price supports on options prices. The results of mean-variance and mean-semi-variance analysis (both in current and constant dollars) indicated that most of the pre-harvest routine hedging strategies, routine at-the-money <b>puts</b> <b>purchasing</b> strategies, and post-harvest selective hedging strategies based on cost of production increased the average net returns and reduced the variability of returns relative to the cash only strategy. However, post-harvest <b>put</b> option <b>purchasing</b> strategies and routine storage strategies did not perform well in comparison with the cash market...|$|R

5000|$|However, in Volume II of Das Kapital, he {{provides}} the following critique of underconsumptionist theory:"It is sheer redundancy {{to say that}} crises are produced {{by the lack of}} paying consumption or paying consumers. The capitalist system recognizes only paying consumers, with the exception of those in receipt of poor law support or the 'rogues.' When commodities are unsalable, it means simply that there are no purchasers, or consumers, for them. When people attempt to give this redundancy an appearance of some deeper meaning by saying that the working class does not receive enough of its own product and that the evil would be dispelled immediately it received a greater share,i.e., if its wages were increased, all one can say is that crises are invariably preceded by periods in which wages in general rise and the working class receives a relatively greater share of the annual product intended for consumption. From the standpoint of these valiant upholders of 'plain common sense,' such periods should prevent the coming of crises. It would appear, therefore, that capitalist production includes conditions which are independent of good will or bad will[...] [...] [...] " [...] quoted by Franz Mehring in his biography of Karl Marx, p. 404 of the 1935 Covici, Friede edition, tr. Edward Fitzgerald. Marx argued that the primary source of capitalist crisis was not located in the realm of consumption, but rather, in production. In general, as Anwar Shaikh has argued, production creates the basis for consumption, because it <b>puts</b> <b>purchasing</b> power into the hands of workers and fellow capitalists. To produce anything requires the individual capitalist to buy machines (capital goods) and employ workers.|$|R
