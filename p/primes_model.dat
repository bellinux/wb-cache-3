40|$|The {{definition}} of the Reference Scenario, given in the Energy Trends to 2030 publication by DG ENER (2009 update), assumes full implementation of the Climate and Energy package. The legislation included within the Climate and Energy Package is reflective of the legally binding targets {{to ensure that the}} EU meets its climate and energy targets for 2020. This scenario assumes that national targets under the Renewables directive (2009 / 28 /EC) and the GHG Effort-sharing decision (2009 / 406 /EC) are achieved. The Reference scenario is one of three energy trends scenarios, used so far for the Energy 2050 Roadmap Impact assessment. The scenarios are derived with the <b>PRIMES</b> <b>model</b> by a consortium led by the National Technical University of Athens (E 3 MLab). The <b>PRIMES</b> <b>model</b> is key to the {{definition of}} the scenarios because of its energy focus. The Reference Scenario itself is derived within PRIMES and is supported by other specialised models downstream. The purpose of this document is to describe how the LUMP was configured in order to be consistent with the PRIMES and other upstream models within the integrated modelling chain, including the incorporation of the legally binding objectives, directives and guidelines. In order to be coherent with the IA accompanying the Communication on the Energy Roadmap 2050, new policies adopted up until March 2010 were implemented in so far as possible. The implementation has not yet been finalized and this document will be refreshed and re-distributed in its final form once the Reference Scenario has been fully configured. JRC.

30|$|Overall the {{validation}} analyses {{have revealed}} {{a high level}} of consistency between HIGH-TOOL results and the EU Reference Scenario 2013. Any major differences, which occur for a limited number of results, can be well explained, largely by differences in data definition. Moreover, the differences between forecasts by HIGH-TOOL and the EU Reference Scenario are explained by the pattern that no information was accessible concerning how the policy measures underlying the EU Reference Scenario 2013 have been operationalized into the <b>PRIMES</b> <b>model</b> for the generation of the forecasts. Thus also differences how the policies underlying the EU Reference Scenario 2013 have been operationalized by HIGH-TOOL and PRIMES, explain differences among the results.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{expansion}} of the thermal generation in the long-term for the Western Balkan region. This paper concentrates on the estimation of long-term energy data for the (Western) Balkan countries. The process was implemented by the use of the <b>PRIMES</b> <b>model</b> in order to perform simulations for the future growth of electricity supply and demand in the region. Two scenarios were applied. The first (Baseline) scenario was based on the current energy path of each country and on the absence of any specific energy policy like tax emissions or renewable subsidies. The second (Reference) scenario was practically a series of “environmental” sub-scenarios, based on specific energy subsidy policy applied to the electricity generated by renewable sources. Results were given for the period between 2015 and 2050 in 5 -year steps and conclusions were made for the whole region. As such, the results can feed up trials of energy planning referring to the future energy condition...|$|E

30|$|Bottom–up model-based curves use {{a partial}} {{equilibrium}} {{model of the}} energy sector. A wide range of technologies in the energy sector can be considered, to estimate the substitution possibilities between energy types, processes, and the energy efficiency improvements. The effects on the energy sector are either simulated mathematically or through optimization (cost minimization or profit maximization). In this way, the model yields the least cost energy system for a certain energy demand given the restrictions concerning available technologies and implemented energy policies. Bottom–up models {{have been used to}} estimate marginal reduction costs or energy demand reduction curves occasionally. One example is the TIMER model (Targets Image Energy Regional) developed by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. It is a dynamic model which considers inertia, fossil fuel depletion, and inter-regional trade. Another example is the <b>PRIMES</b> <b>model,</b> which is used by the European Union to assess the consequences of climate and energy policies. The <b>PRIMES</b> <b>model</b> was for example used as a basis for a CO 2 emission reduction cost study for the European Union (see [25]. Wesselink et al. [26] apply the same technique to estimate a marginal cost curve of energy demand reduction for the EU area. Charlín and Watts [5] apply a similar approach to generate a marginal saving cost curve for the Chilean energy sector. Moreover, several adaptations and recalculations are made within the time frame until 2030 to take account of secondary effects and interdependencies between sectors. A curve for Spain was developed by Santamaría et al. [21] for CO 2 emissions in the industrial sector, concretely for the steel, cement and electricity generation industries. The authors construct bottom–up models for each sector and estimate the impacts of incremental constraints regarding CO 2 emissions. In this case, the model optimizes the use of the mitigation options. IDAE [15] also estimated the potential to save energy consumption in Spain with help of the MURE model (Mesures d’Utilisation Rationnelle de l’Énergie). The prime objective {{of the study was to}} estimate aggregate potentials, not the costs and potentials of individual technologies. Hence, the study does report an energy saving potential for Spain, but it does not provide a marginal energy savings curve.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present a summary of a {{consistent}} European Union (EU) energy and energy-related emissions outlook for the period to 2020. The material presented here is based on quanti-tative analysis and on a process of communication with and feedback from a number of energy experts and organizations. All the results presented for EU en-ergy trends are based on the PRIMES partial equilib-rium model for the European energy system, version 2. The <b>PRIMES</b> <b>model</b> provides simulation of the energy system and the decisions of the agents and the markets, covering in detail several sectors, uses, and technolo-gies. The results of this analysis indicate that the EU will not meet the obligations for greenhouse gas emis-sions reductions it undertook at Kyoto unless it intro-duces policy initiatives for the abatement of energy-related emissions. Although the industrial, tertiary, household, and transportation sectors can all make significant contributions to CO 2 emissions reductions, the electricity- and steam-generation sector appears to offer the greatest potential because of its relative flexibility in terms of technology and fuel choice. Fi-nally, when the only criterion for emissions reductions is economic efficiency, our analysis indicates that re-duction levels differ significantly among EU countries.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a coordinated modelling assessment that incorporates European energy efficiency and renewable policies with two potential gas market scenarios. First, the impact of EU energy efficiency and renewable policies on natural gas demand is calculated using the <b>PRIMES</b> <b>model</b> 2014 Baseline projection, the Fraunhofer ISI Low Policy Intensity Energy Efficiency scenario, and the Green-X model for renewable deployment. Next, the effect of these policies on the natural gas markets is assessed, using the European Gas Market Model. The model tests scenarios for different positions on long-term gas contracts with Russia assuming different stages of European gas infrastructure development. The findings show that dependency on Russian natural gas can be reduced to low levels without triggering a significant increase in natural gas prices for any single EU member country. In an extreme scenario whereby energy efficiency savings, higher renewable energy sources deployment and the assumed positive gas market developments take place simultaneously, gas cost savings can reach as high as 37 %. Benefits arise not only in the most recent round of EU Member States (12 MS) targeted in the study, but are visible across most EU gas markets. This underlines the interlinkages of the whole EU gas market, and the results suggest that security of gas supply is not only a challenge for new Member States, but in the broader European markets...|$|E
5000|$|The {{notion of}} {{saturated}} model is dual {{to the notion}} of <b>prime</b> <b>model</b> in the following way: let T be a countable theory in a first-order language (that is, a set of mutually consistent sentences in that language) and let P be a <b>prime</b> <b>model</b> of T. Then P admits an elementary embedding into any other model of T. The equivalent notion for saturated models is that any [...] "reasonably small" [...] model of T is elementarily embedded in a saturated model, where [...] "reasonably small" [...] means cardinality no larger than that of the model in which it is to be embedded. Any saturated model is also homogeneous. However, while for countable theories there is a unique <b>prime</b> <b>model,</b> saturated models are necessarily specific to a particular cardinality. Given certain set-theoretic assumptions, saturated models (albeit of very large cardinality) exist for arbitrary theories. For λ-stable theories, saturated models of cardinality λ exist.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we use the}} Global Gas Model {{to analyze}} the {{perspectives}} and infrastructure needs of the European natural gas market until 2050. Three pathways of natural gas consumption in a future low-carbon energy system in Europe are envisaged: i) a decreasing natural gas consumption, along {{the results of the}} <b>PRIMES</b> <b>model</b> for the EMF decarbonization scenarios; ii) a moderate increase of natural gas consumption, {{along the lines of the}} IEA (2012) World Energy Outlook's New Policy Scenario; and iii) a temporary increase of natural gas use as a bridge technology, followed by a strong decrease after 2030. Our results show that import infrastructure and intra-European transit capacity currently in place or under construction are largely sufficient to accommodate the import needs of the EMF decarbonization scenarios, despite the reduction of domestic production and the increase of import dependency. However, due to strong demand in Asia which draws LNG and imports from Russia, Europe has to increasingly rely on pipeline exports from Africa and the Caspian region from where new pipelines are built. Moreover, pipeline investments open up new import and transit paths, including reverse flow capacity, which improves the diversification of supplies. In the high gas consumption scenario similar pipeline links are realized-though on a larger scale, doubling the costs of infrastructure expansion. In the bridge technology scenario, the utilization rates of (idle) LNG import capacity can be increased for the short period of temporary strong natural gas demand...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of {{a model of the}} World Refining for the POLES model (Contract n° 151559 - 2009 A 08 FR – with the Joint Research Centre Institute for Prospective Technological Studies of Commission of the European Communities) aims to represent the oil product's supply at a world-wide level in a global energy model. The World oil refining industry faces to several challenges such as the increasing oil derivatives demand in the transport sector, the improvement of the specifications of these products, the crude oil availability and the limitation of carbon emissions. An aggregated refining model linked to the POLES energy model has been developed to study these questions. The OURSE (Oil is Used in Refineries to Supply Energy) model is a world-wide aggregated refining model which is designed to simulate the world oil product supply for the POLES (Prospective Outlook for the Long-term Energy System) model. OURSE is able to simulate the impact on the world refining industry of changes in the crude oil supply (in costs and qualities) {{as well as in the}} oil product demand (in terms of level, structure and specifications). OURSE also enables to assess the consequences of a carbon emission regulation (caps and taxes) as the adoption of various kinds of alternative fuel policies. More precisely, these impacts are evaluated as regards the world refining structure (investments), but also its balance (production and trade of petroleum products), its pollutant emissions (CO 2 and SO 2) and its costs (of production, investments, etc.). Simulations for 2030 were performed. Thus, the paper presents the results of a prospective exercise for the oil refining industry which has been carried out with the worldwide refining model OURSE according to the oil product demand projections of European Commission for Europe with the <b>PRIMES</b> <b>model</b> (European Commission, 2010) and the IFP projections for the rest of the World.
