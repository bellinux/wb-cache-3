40|$|After the {{implementation}} of new health inspection regulations in 2000 there was a precipitous decline {{of the number of}} slaughter plants in the United States. Particularly affected were small and very small slaughter plants. This loss of capacity is affecting local food supply chains and may limit local supply options. The empirical analysis in this thesis uses the spatial distribution of people and livestock to analyze the location choice decisions of existing and new meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> facilities. Utilizing a spatial probit estimator the model analyzes how location factors from the existing stock of USDA inspected meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> plants in 2007 are different from new USDA inspected plants established during the time period 2008 - 2010. This comparison provides an understanding of factors that affect the location decision of new USDA inspected plants. Empirical results reveal that slaughter plant location behavior is strongly affected by the location of existing firms, infrastructure, and agglomeration factors. Inspection type as well as input supplies also significantly influences the location choice of USDA inspected meat and poultry plants. The analysis further reveals that new USDA inspected meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> plants increasingly tend to locate in the Northeast region, as compared to the North Central Region and other areas of the United States. ...|$|R

This system provides slaughter manager to record the monitoring values of CCP (Critical Control Point) by connecting to Server through Internet. The system was developed by ASP. NET (Active Server Pages. NET) programming coordinated with the Microsoft Access 2003 Database and executed on web-page through Internet. Four HACCP models of <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> house including refrigerated chicken carcasses, frozen chicken cuts, refrigerated waterfowl carcasses, and frozen waterfowl cuts were offered by this system. Users could also append their monitoring items, adjust the control limits, and create new slaughter processes according to individual situation of slaughter house. After setting up of CCP, users selected the CCP items and input the values from monitoring data to accomplish the record. These input values compare with the values user set, to see if it is unusual or not, and saved into database. The output reports can either be selected by one period of a monitoring item, the records of batches, the records of dates, or the records of the abnormal monitoring item, and to help users to evaluate their HACCP system at slaughter houses. This system also provided the information of possible causes and executed the correction steps of common hazards so that could assist producers to promote the sanitation level of <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> houses and achieve the safety target of meat products. 本研究之目的，在建立家禽屠宰場之線上HACCP（危害分析與重要管制點）記錄與監控系統。經由網際網路連結至伺服器，家禽屠宰業者即可紀錄場內重要管制點之監測值。本系統以網頁之方式呈現，運用ASP.

Abstract. In this study, nutritional components that are obtained during <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtering</b> having significance with respect to processing into animal feeds were investigated. By-products obtained during <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtering</b> are considered very valuable raw materials for production of highly valuable animal feeds and energetic feeds. Recognition of chemical and physical characteristics of the raw materials represents essential prerequisite for conduction of any technological process, for proper raw materials handling {{as well as for the}} equipment and machines design that are necessary for acceptance and processing of the inedible slaughterhouse by-products. Authors have found that the nitrogen complex of the examined raw materials contains predominantly proteins. Digestible nitrogen for all investigated raw materials equals approximately with total nitrogen content, indicating that all proteins from these raw materials are accessible for utilization in animal organism, with exception of feathers that need special technological processing. Basic chemical composition, nitrogen fractions and amino acid composition of the inedible by-products from poultry slaughterhouses indicate that the processing of these raw materials could be directed into production of swine and pet feeds production, as well in production of bio fuels and biogas. Blood and feathers anyhow represent significant protein source, and soft wastes, heads and legs, as well as the mixed raw material, besides as protein source, can be regarded as raw fat source.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine changes in employment and wage patterns, industrial restructuring, and foreign competition that affect job opportunities of recent immigrants to the nonmetropolitan Midwest, especially to Iowa. The food and kindred products industry which includes meat packing and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtering</b> and processing is a significant employer of recent immigrants. The meat packing industry has a long history of employing immigrants, especially Irish and Polish immigrants during the first half of the 20 th century. U.

During 1945 to 1968, unions gained considerable wage advantage for hourly meat packing workers relative to other manufacturing workers. These relatively high wage rates of the unionized packing house workers were undoubtedly one of the contributing factors to these changes. The technical changes that occurred were somewhat unusual in that technical advances replaced a major component of skilled labor, the meat cutters, in meat packing and opened packing house employment again to less skilled workers, including recent immigrants.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain {{preliminary}} information on occupational exposures responsible for the excess of hematopoietic & lymphatic (H&L) cancers previously observed in cohort mortality studies of workers in <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtering</b> and processing plants. Methods: A pilot case-cohort study was conducted nested within a combined cohort of 30, 411 poultry workers and 16, 408 controls, identified from several United Food & Commercial Workers (UFCW) unions across the United States. Interviewed cases were 48 deaths out of a total of 130 deaths (37 %) from H & L tumors that occurred in the cohort between 1990 - 2003. Controls were N= 152 subjects that were successfully interviewed out of 1516 subjects (10 %) randomly selected from all cohort members alive as of January 1, 1990. Telephone interviews were obtained directly from live control subjects or next-of-kin for deceased cases and controls. Mortality risk was assessed using logistic regression odds ratios and hazard ratios. Results: Poultry farming [OR= 10. 8 (95 % CI: 3. 0 - 39. 1) ] and spreading chicken wastes as manure [OR= 5. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 5 - 20. 4) ] were significantly associated with lymphoma; handling raw eggs in supermarkets [OR= 4. 3 (95 % CI: 1. 0 - 18. 0) ] was significantly associated with leukemia.

40|$|Background and Aim: Salmonellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{digestive}} diseases in the world. Salmonellosis is caused by varieties of salmonella serotypes and there are concerns about the contamination of poultry and its products by this microorganism. Given that the carcasses of poultry, as a major source of infection with this microorganism, determine the frequency and the rate of this type of bacterial contamination, they are considered a criterion in the assessment of the health status of respective poultry farms and their potential health hazards to consumers. The present study aimed at determining prevalence of salmonella contamination of poultry carcasses in Birjand industrial slaughterhouses in 2012. Materials and Methods: Immediately after <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtering,</b> 550 samples were randomly taken from different slaughterhouses. Salmonella spp were isolated from suspected positive cultures. Then, they were identified and confirmed by means of biochemical and serological tests. Results: Based on the results of bacteriological tests, out of a total of 250 samples taken from the poultry slaughtered before putting in boiling water, 8 cases (3. 2 %) were positive for Salmonella contamination. Serotyping results revealed that all isolates belonged to Salmonella infantis serotype. Among a total of 300 samples taken from the cases after being placed in boiling water, only one sample (0. 3 %) was positive for Salmonella infantis. Conclusion: The results indicate that there is a relatively low prevalence of salmonella contamination in the poultry farms in the South Khorasan. Furthermore, lack of diversity in salmonella isolates reveals good health control and low levels of microbial transmission into poultry farms of this area. The outbreak of Salmonella infantis is uniformly consistent with the global spread of this serotype. Differences in the frequency of positive samples before and after placing the carcasses in boiling water may reveal the role of boiling process in reducing salmonella contamination of slaughtered poultry...|$|E

Design: We present an accurate and operable method for estimating the burden of H 7 N 9 cases in China. The main drivers of economic loss were identified. Costs were broken down into direct (outpatient and inpatient examination and treatment) and indirect costs (cost of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and losses in the poultry industry), which were estimated based on field surveys and China statistical year book. Setting: Models were applied to estimate the overall burden of H 7 N 9 cases in China. Participants: 131 laboratory-confirmed H 7 N 9 cases by 31 May 2013. Outcome measure: Burden of H 7 N 9 cases including direct and indirect losses. Results: The total direct medical cost was 16 422 535 (US$ 2 627 606). The mean cost for each patient was 10 117 (US$ 1619) for mild patients, 139 323 (US$ 22 292) for severe cases without death and 205 976 (US$ 32 956) for severe cases with death. The total cost of DALYs was 17 356 561 (US $ 2 777 050). The poultry industry losses amounted to 7. 75 billion (US$ 1. 24 billion) in 10 affected provinces and 3. 68 billion (USD$ 0. 59 billion) in eight non-affected adjacent provinces. Conclusions: The huge poultry industry losses followed live poultry markets closing down and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtering</b> in some areas. Though the proportion of direct medical losses and DALYs losses in the estimate of H 7 N 9 burden was small, the medical costs per case were extremely high (particularly for addressing the use of modern medical devices). A cost-effectiveness assessment for the intervention should be conducted in a future study...|$|E
40|$|Rapid avian {{influenza}} virus antigen test kit and rapid H 5 {{avian influenza}} virus antigen test kit {{were used to}} detect avian influenza antigens by examine 1143 samples taken from broilers, layers, house chickens, local poultry markets and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughters</b> houses in period from January to December 2007 in Mosul city. Cloacae feces swab method was used for all samples and results showed that all tested samples were negative for both AIV and H 5 antigens. In conclusion Mosul city was free from avian influenza virus till Dec 2007 and this test is rapid, easy and a reliable field test and can be done frequently...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the profile of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella isolated from the carcasses, livers and hearts of chickens slaughtered in the state of Tocantins, Brazil, as recommended by the Normative Instruction 70 of 2003 of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply and the National Monitoring Program Prevalence and Bacterial Resistance in Chicken. Carcasses, livers and hearts from chicken with or without pericarditis/perihepatitis were studied in 60 lots of <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughtered</b> under the Federal Inspection System in the state of Tocantins, Brazil between August 2010 and June 2011.

50|$|The holiday {{has already}} {{acquired}} its name before the 16th century, during which happened the reformation of churches by Livonian Order's sacred memorial day {{in honor of}} a Roman soldier Martin (Martinus), who sat on the horse, offering his cloak to a poor man suffering from coldness. Then he learned through dreams, that it was Jesus himself. Christian legend tells, that Martin {{did not want to}} become a bishop and hid away in the poultry barn, however, the local church nationals meanwhile walked around and they discovered him because of poultry's noisiness. Therefore, the Latvian Mārtiņi beliefs and predictions are not only associated with horses and clothes, but also with <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> and Children of Mārtiņi march.|$|R
