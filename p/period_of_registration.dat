Voter registration took place between 30 December and 19 January 1963, in which 1,871,170 people registered for the general roll and 814 for the special roll. With so few people registering for the special role, Minister for Transport and Communications Colin Cameron campaigned for the abolition of the special roll, writing to every European resident in the country.

Another brief <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> was allowed between 24 and 29 February for Europeans who had missed out on registering for the special roll.

50|$|The PPV&FR Act, 2001 {{was enacted}} to grant {{intellectual}} property rights to plant breeders, researchers and farmers who have developed any new or extant plant varieties. The Intellectual Property Right granted under PPV&FR Act, 2001 is a dual right - one is for the variety {{and the other is}} for the denomination assigned to it by the breeder. The rights granted under this Act are heritable and assignable and only registration of a plant variety confers the right. Essentially Derived Varieties (EDV) can also be registered under this Act and it may be new or extant. Farmers are entitled to save, use, sow, re-sow, exchange or sell their farm produce including seed of a registered variety in an unbranded manner. Farmers' varieties are eligible for registration and farmers are totally exempted from payment of any fee in any proceedings under this Act. The period of protection for field crops is 15 years and for trees and vines is 18 years and for notified varieties it is 15 years from the date of notification under section 5 of Seeds Act, 1966. Annual fee has to be paid every year for maintaining the registration and renewal fee has to be paid for the extended <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration.</b> Farmers can claim for compensation if the registered variety fails to provide expected performance under given conditions. The rights granted under this Act are exclusive right to produce, sell, market, distribute, import and export the variety. Civil and criminal remedies are provided for enforcement of breeders' rights and provisions relating to benefit sharing and compulsory licence in case registered variety is not made available to the public at reasonable price are provided. Compensation is also provided for village or rural communities if any registered variety has been developed using any variety in whose evolution such village or local community has contributed significantly. The procedural details and modes of implementing this Act are provided in PPV&FR Rules, 2003. In the present article, we are discussing some of the important legal provisions of this Act along with some of the case studies.|$|E

40|$|Cancer {{prevalence}} is {{the proportion}} {{of people in a}} population diagnosed with cancer in the past and still alive. One way to estimate prevalence is via population-based registries, where data on diagnosis and life status of all incidence cases occurring in the covered population are collected. In this paper, a method to estimate the complete prevalence and its variance from population-based registries is presented. In order to obtain unbiased estimates of the complete prevalence, its calculation can be thought as made by three steps. Step 1 counts the incidence cases diagnosed during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> and still alive. Step 2 estimates the expected number of survivors among cases lost to follow-up. Step 3 estimates the complete prevalence by taking into account cases diagnosed before the start of registration. The combination of steps 1 + 2 is defined as the counting method, to estimate the limited duration prevalence; step 3 is the completeness index method, to estimate the complete prevalence. For early established registries, steps 1 + 2 are more important than step 3, because observation time is long enough to include all past diagnosed cases still alive in the prevalence data. For more recently established registries, step 3 {{is by far the most}} critical because a large part of prevalence might have been diagnosed before the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> (Corazziari I, Mariotto A, Capocaccia R.

Data on 88, 465 childhood and 15, 369 adolescent tumours registered during 1978 - 1997 were available. Geographical differences in incidence are caused partly by differences in definition of eligible cases. The observed increase in incidence rates cannot be explained by biases due to the selection of datasets for analyses, and only partially by the registration of non-malignant or multiple primary tumours. Part of the observed differences in survival between the regions may be due to variable completeness of follow-up, but most is probably explained by resource availability and organisation of care. Further standardisation of data and collection of additional variables are required so that this study may continue to yield valuable results with reliable interpretation...|$|E
