40|$|A {{variety of}} human and animal {{postural}} tasks are commonly {{used to describe the}} different strategies used to cope with a perturbation of the base of support. Rodent research on posture is generally limited to tasks which test dexterity and coordination more than posture per se. We designed a novel task in which a conditioning stimulus tone was coupled to a <b>platform</b> <b>drop</b> in order to entrain anticipatory postural behaviour. Rats were conditioned using delay-conditioning, which consisted of a 2 s stimulus tone coupled to the drop of a moveable platform. The platform was fitted with a force plate built with a clear acrylic sheet and 4 load cells. This force plate measured ground reaction forces which were used to calculate center of pressure (CoP), CoP displacement, CoP excursion and CoP variability. Video of the animal behaviour was recorded from underneath the platform and used to calculate the orientation of the animal. It was found that trained rats increased their CoP displacement, CoP excursion and CoP variability in response to the stimulus tone, before the <b>platform</b> <b>drop.</b> Trained animals consistently moved {{toward the back of the}} platform upon hearing the tone, indicating acquisition of the desired conditioned response, and understanding of the parameters of the task. There were no training-related changes to orientation variables, but the animals demonstrated a preference for facing the interior of the platform. This is the first step in describing rat behaviour in an anticipatory behaviour paradigm...|$|E

The platform uses a two-wheel, two-motor design that delivers high mobility with low complexity. DROP extends microspine climbing technology from linear to rotary applications, providing improved transition ability, increased speeds, and simpler body mechanics while maintaining microspines ability to opportunistically grip rough surfaces. Various aspects of prototype design and performance are discussed, including the climbing mechanism, body design, and impact survival...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{demands of}} {{microarray}} expression technologies for quantities of RNA place {{a limit on}} the questions they can address. As a consequence, the RNA requirements have reduced over time as technologies have improved. In this paper we investigate the costs of reducing the starting quantity of RNA for the Illumina BeadArray platform. This we do via a dilution data set generated from two reference RNA sources that have become the standard for investigations into microarray and sequencing technologies. Results We find that the starting quantity of RNA {{has an effect on}} observed intensities {{despite the fact that the}} quantity of cRNA being hybridized remains constant. We see a loss of sensitivity when using lower quantities of RNA, but no great rise in the false positive rate. Even with 10 ng of starting RNA, the positive results are reliable although many differentially expressed genes are missed. We see that there is some scope for combining data from samples that have contributed differing quantities of RNA, but note also that sample sizes should increase to compensate for the loss of signal-to-noise when using low quantities of starting RNA. Conclusions The BeadArray platform maintains a low false discovery rate even when small amounts of starting RNA are used. In contrast, the sensitivity of the <b>platform</b> <b>drops</b> off noticeably over the same range. Thus, those conducting experiments should not opt for low quantities of starting RNA without consideration of the costs of doing so. The implications for experimental design, and the integration of data from different starting quantities, are complex. </p...|$|R
40|$|NASA's X- 38 {{program was}} an {{in-house}} technology demonstration program {{to develop a}} Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) for the International Space Station capable of returning seven crewmembers to Earth when the Space Shuttle was not present at the station. The program, managed out of NASA's Johnson Space Center, was started in 1995 and was cancelled in 2003. Eight flights with a prototype atmospheric vehicle were successfully flown at Edwards Air Force Base, demonstrating the feasibility of a parachute landing system for spacecraft. The intensive testing conducted by the program included testing of large ram-air parafoils. The flight test techniques, instrumentation, and simulation models developed during the parachute test program culminated in the successful demonstration of a guided parafoil system to land a 25, 000 Ib spacecraft. The test program utilized parafoils of sizes ranging from 750 to 7500 p. The guidance, navigation, and control system (GN&C) consisted of winches, laser or radar altimeter, global positioning system (GPS), magnetic compass, barometric altimeter, flight computer, and modems for uplink commands and downlink data. The winches were used to steer the parafoil and to perform the dynamic flare maneuver for a soft landing. The laser or radar altimeter was used to initiate the flare. In {{the event of a}} GPS failure, the software navigated by dead reckoning using the compass and barometric altimeter data. The GN&C test beds included <b>platforms</b> <b>dropped</b> from cargo aircraft, atmospheric vehicles released from a 8 - 52, and a Buckeye powered parachute.
