30|$|<b>Extraction</b> <b>solvent</b> plays a {{prominent}} role in a successful extraction procedure (Rezaee et al. 2010). In general, the <b>extraction</b> <b>solvent</b> must be able to extract the analyte well and has low solubility in aqueous medium. High-density <b>extraction</b> <b>solvents,</b> being mostly halogenated, are generally toxic and have high background emission in ICP-OES, accordingly alcohols with lower densities than aqueous solutions and less volatile were chosen in this test. The solvents that were tested in this work are 1 -octanol and 1 -dodecanol (due to their compatibility with ICP-OES). The results showed that the organic phase after extraction by 1 -octanol had higher overall extraction recovery for the target analyte than 1 -dodecanol. Therefore, 1 -octanol was selected for further studies.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the main}} {{problems}} associated with remediation of chlorinated solvent groundwater contamination {{is the presence of}} NAPLs in the source zone. NAPLs are often better treated through <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction,</b> surfactant washing, or vapor extraction than through bioremediation. Removal of NAPL through <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> would likely leave a substantial residual of both the <b>extraction</b> <b>solvent</b> and the chlorinated solvent. We hypothesized that utilization of the remaining <b>extraction</b> <b>solvent</b> as an electron donor could be exploited to clean up the remaining chlorinated solvent following source zone remediation. The main question is whether a suitable <b>extraction</b> <b>solvent</b> could work as an electron donor to drive reductive dechlorination. Many different compounds have been used as electron donors to stimulate reductive dechlorination, including volatile fatty acids (VFAs), sugars, hydrogen, and polymeric compounds. Generally, it is regarded that fermentation of compounds yields hydrogen, the true electron donor for reductive dechlorination. Compounds with high hydrogen yields generally are thought to be the best electron donors for bioremediation. After looking at several potential candidate solvents that might serve as electron donors for reductive dechlorination, we decided t...|$|R

The general approach for extracting, e. g. water samples, required the use of a 3 : 1 (methylene chloride:isopropanol) <b>extraction</b> <b>solvent.</b> Although the 3 : 1 <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> work-up methods provided excellent results in several Inter-laboratory Comparison Tests, the implementation of these methods for CW on-site analysis exercises was difficult (the methods require cumbersome equipment and are labor intensive). However, due to the time, power, and size restraints set forth by the Chemical Warfare Convention (CWC) for a CW on-site inspection, LLNL developed new sample work-up methods. The approach selected by LLNL incorporated solid phase extraction (SPE) techniques. It is evident from this preliminary study that new or previously used <b>extraction</b> <b>solvents</b> should be re-investigated.

The yield of extractable components varied {{over a wide range}} 4. 87 - 30. 00 % in relation to <b>extraction</b> <b>solvent</b> and techniques. The extracts produced contained considerable amounts of total phenolics (8. 28 - 52. 34 mg GAE/ 100 g DW) and total flavonoids (1. 24 - 7. 88 mg CE/ 100 g DW).
