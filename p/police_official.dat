5|$|When Marseille {{was still}} a young child his parents {{divorced}} and his mother subsequently married a <b>police</b> <b>official</b> named Reuter. Marseille initially assumed {{the name of his}} stepfather at school (a matter he had a difficult time accepting) but he reverted to his father's name of Marseille in adulthood. He acquired the reputation of being a rebel from a lack of discipline, a characteristic that plagued him early on in his Luftwaffe career. Marseille also had a difficult relationship with his natural father whom he refused to visit in Hamburg for some time after the divorce. Eventually he attempted a reconciliation with his father, who subsequently introduced him to the nightlife that was to initially hamper his military career during his early years in the Luftwaffe.

40|$|D. Ed. The {{research}} {{nature of}} this study was primarily explorative, and also descriptive. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore and describe community experiences of aggressive behaviour exhibited by <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> towards them. This research was of a qualitative nature. Four steps of psycho-educational programme development were followed. In the first step a situational analysis was carried out. The sampling component was purposively selected <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> working under the jurisdiction of specific police stations in Gauteng Province and community members as victims of aggression at the hands of <b>police</b> <b>officials.</b> Data gathering methods used in this research were phenomenological individual and focus group interviews and observations. The researcher conducted the observation for this study during interviews and field notes were written during interview process. The researcher conducted interviews with victims of aggressive behaviour by <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> and other participants were <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> and stakeholders who are dealing with inappropriate behaviour of <b>police</b> <b>officials.</b> The participants had to comment on their experiences of aggression exhibited by <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> and other participants who are <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> in the South African Police Service talk about their experiences when they were involved in aggressive action towards the community. These interviews formed the basis of this study to facilitate the attainment of the primary objective, which was to explore and describe the experience of aggression behaviour exhibited by <b>Police</b> <b>officials</b> towards the community. The data from these interviews were analysed using an open coding method. An independent coder did an analysis independent from the researcher. A consensus validation discussion was held with the independent coder on the codification of the data. The detailed discussion of results obtained from the interviews and observations were presented in verbatim quotes, descriptive and reflective notes and the illustration of emergent themes and categories. Rigour and adequacy were ensured by data collected and the results obtained from data analysis indicated convergence and saturation. The integration of trustworthiness, that is, credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability were applied throughout the study. Ethical considerations and consent letters were presented to the participants, including preserving of anonymity, confidentiality, voluntary participation, understood consent and the ethical role of the researcher has adhered to. The research is very important as the experiences of aggression by community members were explored and described. The research results indicated that there is tension among the community and <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> in the South African Police Service. The <b>Police</b> <b>officials</b> under study are demoralised and tend to become negative towards the public because they are of the opinion that enough is not done to support them in performing their difficult duties. It is evident from the results that there is lack of effective communication stakeholders who are dealing with inappropriate behaviour in the South African Police Service with other structures like the Independent Complaints Directorate. In step two the psycho-educational programme was developed. Firstly a conceptual framework was derived from the result of step one. The conceptual framework served as framework of reference for the description of a psycho-educational programme. In step three the programme was implemented and in step four the programme was evaluated. In conclusion, it is evident that aggression really exists in the workplace and officials are affected by such aggression. The recommendations of dealing with aggressive behaviour exhibited by <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> towards the community was done in line with the situational analysis after the conclusion drawn from the findings and were described in a psycho-educational perspective...|$|R

25|$|George W.

South Ossetia's top <b>police</b> <b>official</b> issued this order in response to a police post coming under automatic weapons fire from an ethnic Georgian village.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the phenomenon of attacks and murders on <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> statistically. Furthermore, it was envisaged that the results of this investigation could contribute to a plan to curb this phenomenon. According to Conradie (1998 : 7), if one counts the number of murdered police officers - even after the elections of April 1994 - it seems as if the quest for democratising the sometimes so-called police state of South Africa, had little positive influence on this phenomenon. Although there was an initial decrease of the figures, the murdering of these servants of society was still unacceptably high in the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging region (changed to Gauteng on 1 July 1995 to include the former Northern Transvaal Region), which was served by 123 police station commands. When this area was still known as the WWR-command, it only consisted of 90 station commands. The average number of <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> working in this area for this three year period were 29 116 (Freislich 1995). Of these, 15 079 were Blacks, 9 801 Whites, 805 Coloureds and 431 Asians. From 1990 - 1994, there were 371 murders on <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> (Freislich 1995). This amounts to an average of 74 per annum over this five year period, which is about 6 per month. The significance of this figure was understood against the background of, for example, the fact that during the whole of 1994, there were only two <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> of the London metropolitan police (serving only a part of London) murdered in London. What happened during one week in the Witwatersrand, took one whole year to be equalled in London only. In addition to these murders, there were 938 incidents of attacks on <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> during 1994. Against this backdrop, the statement by Chapman (1976 : 141) that there is an urgent need to implement specific measures to reduce assaults on police, was far overdue. This study was undertaken with the aim of trying to understand this phenomenon better. It was an extension of the study of the attacks on South African <b>Police</b> <b>officials</b> in Gauteng, which was conducted in 1994. The results suggested a further in depth study on attacks on <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> and the murder of <b>police</b> <b>officials.</b> Therefore this study was undertaken...|$|R
