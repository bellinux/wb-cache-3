5|$|Whether an epikleros who {{was married}} {{at the time of}} her father's death was {{required}} to divorce her current spouse and marry the anchisteia is unclear. Most modern historians have come to the conclusion that this was only required if the epikleros had not yet had a son that could inherit the grandfather's estate. The clearest evidence is from the Roman playwright Terence, in his play Adelphoe, which includes a plot element involving a claim that a girl is actually an epikleros. Although the play was written in the 2nd century BCE, Terence adapted most of his plays from earlier Athenian comedies, which makes it slightly more reliable as a source. And common sense argues that if a son had already been born to an epikleros, there was no need to <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> the epikleros to a relative in order to provide a male heir to the grandfather's estate. Although the anchisteia had the right to marry the epikleros, he was not required to do so, and could refuse the match or find another spouse for the heiress. It was also possible for the husband of an epikleros, who was not her anchisteia, to buy off the anchisteia in order to remain married to his wife. Such cases were alleged by the speaker of Isaeus' speech Isaeus 10 as well as a character in Menander's play Aspis.|$|E
25|$|It was at {{this time}} in the Convention that Reverend Manasseh Cutler arrived to lobby for western land sales. He brought acres of land grants to <b>parcel</b> <b>out.</b> Their sales would fund most of the U.S. {{government}} expenditures for its first few decades. There were allocations for the Ohio Company stockholders at the Convention, and for others delegates too. Good to his word, in December 1787, Cutler led a small band of pioneers into the Ohio Valley.|$|E
25|$|Rudolf V (Archduke, Emperor Rudolf II 1576–1612), Maximilian's eldest son, {{moved his}} capital from Vienna to the safer venue of Prague, {{in view of}} the Ottoman threat. He was noted as a great patron of the arts and {{sciences}} but a poor governor. Among his legacies is the Imperial Crown of the Habsburgs. He preferred to <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> his responsibilities among his many brothers (of whom six lived to adulthood), leading to a great heterogeneity of policies across the lands. Among these delegations was making his younger brother Mathias, Governor of Austria in 1593.|$|E

Solemskogen near Maridalsvannet was bought in 1897 and <b>parceled</b> <b>out</b> in 1903, in {{addition}} he <b>parceled</b> <b>out</b> Økern as well. Tschudi was also active in Bærum. In 1912 he bought Vestre Haslum, which soon was split in 360 lots and sold. The area was nicknamed Tschudimarka.|$|R

25|$|The Royalists faced many {{difficulties}} in Military Region 2. Fire Support Base Puncher, the Ban Na outpost of Long Tieng, {{was surrounded by}} PAVN infantry and sappers. On 14 February 1971, an accidental bombing killed 30 civilians. By 15 February, Vang Pao's L'Armee Clandestine was in desperate shape. The PAVN were {{within striking distance of}} the main guerrilla base at Long Tieng. The next two Unity Battalions, BCs 603 and 604, were pulled from the final stages of training and sent to reinforce the Hmong irregulars. To maintain unit integrity, the Thais had to fend off Vang Pao's attempt to <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> platoons of Thai replacements into Hmong guerrilla units. The Thais were trained to fight cohesively as mobile offensive troops, and they intended to retain that capability.|$|E

2500|$|By 1927–28, {{at the end}} of {{the silent}} era, the {{production}} cost of an average feature from Hollywood's major film studios had soared, ranging from $190,000 at Fox to $275,000 at MGM. These averages, again, reflected [...] "specials" [...] and [...] "superspecials" [...] that might cost as much as $1 million and films made quickly for around $50,000. Some studios, like large Paramount and growing Warner Bros., depended on block booking and blind bidding practices, under which [...] "independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of the studio's pictures sight unseen. Those studios could then <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> second-rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical." [...] Studios in the minor leagues of the industry, such as Columbia Pictures and Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), focused on low-budget productions; most of their movies, with relatively short running times, targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs—particularly those in small towns and so-called neighborhood venues, or [...] "nabes," [...] in big cities. Even smaller outfits—the sort typical of Hollywood's so-called Poverty Row—made films whose production costs might run as low as $3,000, seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns.|$|E
