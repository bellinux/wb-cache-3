5000|$|Hanitszche (2007) criticises peace journalism, {{noting that}} media users are often [...] "fragmented and active audiences {{instead of a}} passive mass…leading to a {{selective}} use of supplied products". [...] Likewise Devereux (2003) notes that media audiences [...] "may have different expectations of media genres" [...] and Turnbull (2002) argues that in media research a serious problem is just to limit and define audiences and therefore relevant media practices. [...] Indeed Hall (1997) notes that the meaning of media messages changes [...] "as you move {{from one person to}} another, one group to another, one part of society to another." [...] And Lynch (2008) points out, drawing from Hall (1980) that [...] "the meanings of media messages are made, at least partly, at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception,</b> in a process influenced chiefly by the socio-economic position of the reader or viewer." [...] As such Hall (1980) notes that in a negotiated or oppositional manner, meaning often:"contains a mixture of adaptive and oppositional elements: it acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions to make the grand significations (abstract), while, at a more restricted, situational (situated) level, it makes its own ground rules - it operates with exceptions to the rule. It accords the privileged position to the dominant definitions of events while reserving the right to make a more negotiated application to 'local conditions'". And indeed for many peace journalists it is the visibility of 'local conditions' that allows for oppositional and negotiated meaning. Lynch (2008)argues that [...] "for audiences to produce oppositional or negotiated readings of media messages assumes they have enough directly relevant personal and social experience against which to measure them", [...] This is often not the case with international conflict. Indeed Hall’s(1980) own example of the negotiation of meaning is the case of an industrial factory worker, willing to challenge official justifications in the media for an Industrial Relations Bill limiting his or her right to strike.|$|E

40|$|While most “World Religions” {{curricula}} {{are employed}} in a wider view to liberal arts education, rather as specifically theological or religious-centered, there are several approaches which {{can be made to}} form a more constructive learning working with the existing “textbooks” circulating (treated here in English) in a kind of metaphysical way in diverse cultures whose needs are more concrete. This paper addresses two key ways in which the popular “World religions” curriculum can be, to paraphrase Tomoko Masuzawa, “re-invented” as an integral aspect of learner-based pedagogy. First, by taking the disembodied “text” and analyzing its role, content, and purpose as a learning object by situating it in the world of internet, online education, the context of learning will be seen to require what might be called energetic “points <b>of</b> reception”. Those <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> can, in this second case, be seen as an individual and contextual reworking of the “world religions”, not by denying the content of the textbooks, but by subjecting its view to the actual societies, schools, and nations which employ them. While much scholarship has recently examined “religion”, “world religions”, and their definitions, this paper works on two broad themes (reception and contextualizing knowledge) to imagine avenues of engaging with what Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor calls “social imaginaries” in which students discern their own sociological, philosophical, and political imaginations on global and local religious cultures...|$|R
30|$|In LTE systems, {{the usage}} of {{multiple}} antenna systems has been a special focus. In contrast to previous mobile cellular systems, LTE systems have been rolled out from the beginning {{with at least two}} transmit antennas per cell at the base station. In combination with two receive antennas at the UE, this allows to leverage spatial diversity gains by applying MIMO transmission techniques. MIMO (multiple input multiple output) transmission allows the transmission of either multiple information streams (multiple-layer transmission) or a single transmission stream (transmit diversity) by using several transmit antennas at the transmit point and several receive antennas at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception,</b> see also [11]. The main focus has been the DL (base station transmissions towards the mobile user equipment) in the first step, since many applications are asymmetric and require higher data rates on the DL than on the UL.|$|E

Conditions for synchronization stability and the acquisition behavior are examined by detailed computer study of the phase-plane trajectories for the second and third-order loops with perfect integrator. It is demonstrated that for the phase variation considered the third-order loop has no real advantage over the second-order loop. Finally, it is shown that nonzero initial conditions may result in large steady-state phase error...|$|E

The Image of the Author is interpreted as a paratextual phenomenon which is on the one hand created through review acceptance and medial discurs in the cultural space, {{and on the other hand}} has influence on the way the text is accepted by the reader.

40|$|Conférence plénièreInternational audienceThis paper {{worked against}} the idea that theatre {{translation}} and adaptation create a common space by bringing together different social contexts and creating a sense of shared values or questions. I suggest that, from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>reception,</b> some <b>of</b> the most interesting recent experiments in adaptations of the canon actively work against the constitution of a common space, or even of a “third” space of negotiation between different social and cultural contexts; instead, they create division rather than shared ground, and isolation rather than a sense of community. I view this resistance {{to the notion of}} the audience as community as a political act, that raises questions of ethical responsibility for the spectator. The two main case studies I examine, a South-African and a Brazilian adaptation of Macbeth, are international co-productions intended for global touring, which translate a canonical text into a context that is not shared by their diverse, multicultural audiences. Because their “target” audiences are not united by one context, they render the idea of the theatre as a space of commonality problematic. My comparative approach to recent adaptations of Verdi and Shakespeare’s Macbeth by Ivo van Hove, Brett Bailey and Christiane Jatahy highlights the potential for cross-cultural adaptations to construct the audience as a politically responsible entity, without addressing it as a community...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — OFDM is {{well suited}} for data-transmission over frequency-selective channels. If the cyclic prefix is chosen {{sufficiently}} long, intersymbol interference is avoided. Thus, the linear convolution becomes circular and the channel is rendered into a set of flat-fading channels, which can be easily equalized. But this holds {{no longer in the}} case of large Doppler spread, i. e., when the channel is rapidly changing. Then the subcarriers lose their orthogonality giving rise for so-called intercarrier interference which is detrimental for the overall system performance. Among previous proposals to cope with this problem was the use of multiple receive antennas. These are positioned in the moving direction of the receiver such that the individual antennas are receiving delayed replica of the transmit signal via identical paths. By means of interpolation this enables to fabric a virtual non moving <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> which seemingly experiences no Doppler spread. So far, this technique has been applied in a purely noncoherent setting resorting to differential modulation. We will demonstrate how this approach can be exploited by coherent reception. Our emphasis thereby lies on the use of higherlevel modulation as well as Least-Square (LS) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) channel estimation. I...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{critically}} analyze the languages of billboard advertisements of three banks in Zimbabwe which they use when communicating with their diverse clientele in order to gain competitive advantage. These banks are Standard Chartered (Stanchart), Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe (CBZ) and National Merchant bank (NMB). These banks have specifically been selected because they offer contradictory approaches which mirror struggles of gender, race, class and the spectacle masculinity and they also have different ownership patterns. Stanchart is internationally owned, CBZ is State owned and National Merchant Bank is owned by Independent/lndigenous entrepreneurs. The central argument in this article is that although advertisers are better placed to gontrol the production of meaning, communication between banks and the potential customers is a product of negotiation of meaning at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> of the printed advertisements. This article is also mindful of the fact that audiences have the potential to contradict identities created by the producers of advertisers. The article recommends that advertisements should avoid the use of words and images (languages) that downplay the cultural importance of women, children and old people...|$|E
40|$|Focussing on John Phillip’s The Comedy of Patient and Meek Grissill, {{but using}} the non {{pedagogical}} Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis by Sir David Lyndsay as a control, this essay explores the migratory potential of pedagogical drama; the methodological challenges which this poses {{to an understanding}} of historical spectatorship, and the rewards of viewing the drama of this period {{from the point of view}} of its “consumers. ” In particular, it suggests ways in which a critical response can be developed to cope with plays that have moved between different institutional auspices such as grammar school, choir school, and court, and are extant finally in print form. It argues that, although learning as a process; the importance of ethical gender relations; folly, and dramatic self reflexivity all constitute enduring features of this genre’s content and style, they have varying values dependent on the context of performance. Consequently the critical challenges of migratory drama should first be addressed with respect to the history of single plays rather than genres, since it was the capacity of the play to meet the real or imagined needs of the consumer at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> which determined its suitability.
