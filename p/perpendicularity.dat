25|$|In mathematics, {{orthogonality}} is {{the generalization}} {{of the notion}} of <b>perpendicularity</b> to the linear algebra of bilinear forms. Two elements u and v of a vector space with bilinear form B are orthogonal when B(u,v) = 0. When the bilinear form corresponds to a pseudo-Euclidean space, there are non-perpendicular vectors that are hyperbolic-orthogonal. In the case of function spaces, families of orthogonal functions are used to form a basis.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{magnitude}} of the cross product goes by the sine of the angle between its arguments, the cross product {{can be thought of as}} a measure of <b>perpendicularity</b> in the same way that the dot product is a measure of parallelism. Given two unit vectors, their cross product has a magnitude of 1 if the two are perpendicular and a magnitude of zero if the two are parallel. The dot product of two unit vectors behaves just oppositely: it is zero when the unit vectors are perpendicular and 1 if the unit vectors are parallel.|$|E
40|$|Simplification of {{polygonal}} chains {{by reducing}} the number of vertices becomes challenging when additionally dominant edge expansions of the polygonal chains shall be exposed. Such simplifications are often sought in order to generalize polygonal chains representing borders or medial axes of man-made structures such as buildings or road networks, observed in aerial images. In this paper, we present two methods that reduce the number of vertices in polygonal chains meanwhile featuring additional properties: First, the resulting polygonal chains are irrespective of coordinate axes as pixel-based approaches tend to produce. Second, the simplified chains keep the rough shape of the initial ones and emphasize dominating edge expansions. Optionally, detected <b>perpendicularities</b> may be enforced. Third, polygons with holes are supposed to exhibit parallel segments in interior and exterior polygonal chains. Our methods treat the associated polygonal chains simultaneously by emphasizing common distinctive directions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{assumptions}} and {{information concerning the}} external world properties of horizontal and vertical can aid {{in the analysis of}} images, even at the very lowest levels of processing. First, the author reviews the pervasiveness of the force of gravity, and its influence on most natural image understanding systems. Next, he derives several fundamental mathematical results relating phenomena in both the gradient space and the images space to the external world attributes of horizontal and vertical. He then shows how these results interrelate three imaging phenomena: the surfaces in the image, the external sensor parameters, and the environmental labels. It is detailed how, in general, specific information regarding any two of these phenomena can be used to quantitatively derive the third; occasionally one can do even better. Algorithms for such quantitative derivations are presented, including two based on the Hough transform. The author further shows how certain environmental <b>perpendicularities</b> can be exploited very efficiently, and even elegantly: ordinarily complex math simplifies to the extent that environmental distances can be directly read off the image. The power of such environmental labels is then demonstrated by an analysis of the source of ambiguity in a simple illusion-like image configuration. The paper concludes with an analysis of the class of heuristics that have been invoked throughout. They are seen to be instantiations of the shape-from-texture meta-heuristics that "near implies preferred" and "preferred implies simple. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} cultural {{representations of}} nightlife in the iconic oceanfront New York City neighborhood Coney Island, produced between {{the turn of}} the twentieth century and World War II. By looking at the night in an environment that has historically been ubiquitous with its position on city’s farthest southern periphery, and with the possibilities both valued and feared that such peripherality entails, I aim to develop a critical understanding of the links between modern constructions of urban space and time. My analysis rests on a select group of visual images, and is supplemented throughout by textual representations and other components of cultural discourse. By closely examining a 1912 commercial postcard, I argue that bourgeois imaginings of Coney Island at night constituted the spatio-temporal periphery as mutually a frontier and a margin; as a site upon which owning class interests that structured core spaces and times could be extended, and coessentially a site where seedy prospects lurked which could interrupt those interests if they were not carefully appropriated. Looking, then, at representations from the 1920 s and 1930 s, I question whether interwar Coney Island nightlife might have democratically liberated working class New Yorkers from the constraints of their normally regulated lives. I specifically assess the way bodies and corporealities are depicted in paintings of working class night leisure by American artist Reginald Marsh and in a few other illustrations, to contend that no such reversal occurred. These images reveal a pervasive differentiation between bodies whose material composition signified them to be economically productive, mobile, “fit” participants in a spatio-temporal frontier; and bodies whose material composition signified them to be economically unproductive markers of a seedy, stagnant, spatio-temporal margin. This differentiation – and the complicated spectrum of productivity and humanness I show it contained – fundamentally maintained, entrenched, and reproduced owning class interests despite the veneer of proletariat freedom. Coney Island nightlife during the first half of the twentieth century manifested the profound capacity of hegemonic capitalism to reorient space, time, and bodies toward its ends; and enfold even the most threatening <b>perpendicularities</b> on its edges...|$|R
25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development of the intrados of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up {{the barrel of the}} skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from <b>perpendicularity.</b> Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|E

6000|$|During {{the last}} four days I attentively {{observed}} the general face of the country. This line is a succession of low plains and basins, here quasi-circular, there irregularly oblong, surrounded by rolling hills and cut by Fiumaras which pass through the higher ground. The basins are divided by ridges and flats of basalt and greenstone averaging from one hundred to two hundred feet in height. The general form is a huge prism; sometimes they are table-topped. From Al-Madinah to Al-Suwayrkiyah the low beds of sandy Fiumaras abound. From Al-Suwayrkiyah to Al-Zaribah, their place is taken by “Ghadir,” or hollows in which water stagnates. And beyond Al-Zaribah the traveller enters a region of water-courses tending West and South-West The versant is generally from the East and South-East towards the West and North-West.

Consequently the great skeleton lines of rock outline are always concave; that is to say, all distant ranges of rocky mountain approximate more or less to a series of concave curves, meeting in peaks, like a range of posts with chains hanging between. I do not say that convex forms will not perpetually occur, but that the tendency of the majority will always be to assume the form of sweeping, curved valleys, with angular peaks; not of rounded convex summits, with angular valleys.
