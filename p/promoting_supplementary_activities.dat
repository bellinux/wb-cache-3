40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the incremental cost-effectiveness of <b>supplementary</b> immunization <b>activities</b> to prevent neonatal tetanus in the Loralai district of Pakistan. The supplemental immunization activities were carried out in two phases during 2001 - 03. METHODS: A state-transition model was used {{to estimate the}} effect of routine vaccination with tetanus toxoid as well as vaccination with tetanus toxoid during <b>supplementary</b> immunization <b>activities.</b> The model follows each woman in the target population from birth {{until the end of}} her childbearing years, using age-specific fertility data and vaccination history to determine the number of births at risk for neonatal tetanus. Recently published data on the incidence of neonatal tetanus from Loralai were used to determine the number of cases occurring with and without <b>supplementary</b> immunization <b>activities.</b> Data on the costs of the activities were collected from the UNICEF office in Balochistan and from the Provincial Health Department. FINDINGS: Using base-case assumptions we estimated that the <b>supplementary</b> immunization <b>activities</b> would prevent 280 cases of neonatal tetanus and 224 deaths from neonatal tetanus between 2001 and 2034. Implementation of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>activities</b> was relatively inexpensive. The cost per tetanus toxoid dose delivered was 0. 40 U. S. dollars. In the base-case analysis the cost per death averted was 117. 00 U. S. dollars (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 78 - 205 U. S. dollars) and the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted was 3. 61 U. S. dollars (95 % Cl = 2. 43 - 6. 39 U. S. dollars). CONCLUSION: Compared with similar analyses of other interventions, the cost per DALY averted is a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio. However, if routine diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccination coverage in the Loralai district had been higher (at a coverage rate of about 80 %) the cost-effectiveness of the intervention would have been even more favourable, at 2. 65 U.

40|$|The {{present study}} assesses the {{contribution}} of farm <b>supplementary</b> <b>activities</b> to rural livelihoods in low-income regions that are characterised by economic stagnation. Through analysing the complete household portfolio of economic activities the study identifies specific aspects of individual and household livelihood diversification. The survey {{was carried out in}} villages that are different with respect to endowments of agricultural resources and access to infrastructure. Local non-farm sectors, characterised by excess capacity, provided insufficient technological and institutional development for structurally improving the economic base in the villages. Personal status within the household, i. e. authority and gender, was a major determinant for access to farm <b>supplementary</b> <b>activities.</b> Individual characteristics, related to ability, preference, and property, appeared to be less important as determinants for actual involvement in these activities. Individual livelihoods were more specialised than commonly assumed. Attitudes towards risk had a limited impact on daily livelihoods; people who were less risk-averse selected a more diversified income portfolio. Only in the resource-poor villages, more supplementary revenues led to more efficient cereal production. The use of external inputs for crop production did not differ across farm households with different supplementary revenues. Decomposition of household income along the village income spectrum shows that availability of agricultural resources had a major impact on income level and incidence of poverty. Involvement in <b>supplementary</b> <b>activities,</b> however, had a limited effect on the income distributions within the villages. The general conclusion points to the need to emphasise that livelihood diversification, besides its functionality for mitigating income risks, is also a structural result of poverty. Therefore, income diversification itself is an insufficient device to structurally alleviate poverty, and additional attention should be given to the institutions and technologies of the different livelihood components...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a set of {{activities}} to supplement a unit of work in the ninth grade academic geometry program, and to evaluate the benefits to be derived from it. In order to do this the following four questions were considered: [...] (1) Does the use of a unit involving <b>supplementary</b> <b>activities</b> result in students attaining competence with geometric concepts? [...] (2) Does the use of a unit involving <b>supplementary</b> <b>activities</b> have any effect on student attitudes toward geometry? [...] (3) How effective is each of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>activities</b> in helping students achieve each objective? [...] (4) What are some of the problems encountered using the activity approach to geometry? [...] A unit of work, supplemented with 14 activities, was taught to two intact ninth grade academic classes of 28 students each. The activities were developed by the investigator or were selected from other sources. [...] To determine student achievement on the unit, two tests constructed by the investigator were administered. Both tests were designed to test whether the behavioural objectives for the unit had been achieved. The objectives for the unit were written at three cognitive levels: computation, comprehension, and application. [...] An analysis of the test results showed that many of the students failed to achieve mastery of the geometric concepts at all three cognitive levels. However, the findings did show that the students were more successful at the lower cognitive levels than they were at the application level. [...] A modified form of Aiken's Scale of Attitudes Toward Mathematics was given as a pretest and post-test to determine whether the unit had any effect on student attitudes toward geometry. A dependent t-test for means was performed on the pretest-post-test attitude scores.
