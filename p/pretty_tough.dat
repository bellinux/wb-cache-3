I think that's probably the most personal line on the whole album about her and Jay, because they are very real, and they're very much in love, {{and it must be}} <b>pretty</b> <b>tough</b> to have that love when you're incredibly famous.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on 13 November, Angus Young stated that the band had experienced problems with Rudd {{earlier in the year}} when recording Rock or Bust, and that his situation had taken the band by surprise. Rudd had also missed video and photo shoots, and with reference to Rudd's future in the band, Young added, [...] "So, at this stage, it's a <b>pretty</b> <b>tough</b> call for us." [...] He also said the band would continue: [...] "He's got to sort himself out I think... At this point it's kind of a question mark.

5000|$|Kinnison {{successfully}} {{returns to}} Earth in a captured pirate ship and is {{promoted to the}} exalted rank of Unattached Lensman. Unattached Lensmen (commonly called [...] "Gray Lensmen" [...] because their uniform is made of plain gray leather) are endowed with virtually unlimited power and authority. He immediately sets out to infiltrate what he believes {{to be an important}} pirate base. Unfortunately, Kinnison is in over his head and the telepathically capable [...] "Wheelmen" [...] who man the base discover and almost kill him before he can escape. While in the hospital recovering, Kinnison is assigned the <b>pretty,</b> but <b>tough,</b> nurse Clarissa MacDougall. He behaves badly and is rude and condescending to her, blindly lashing out because he blames himself for his abject failure with the Wheelmen. Kinnison, once recovered, goes to Arisia to learn how better to use his Lens. Kinnison is the first Lensman to be accepted for further training by the Arisians, and leaves weeks later many times stronger and with numerous additional capabilities. He is now a Second Stage Lensman.|$|R
500|$|In a 1975 interview, Dufek noted {{his love}} of both sports: [...] "There are times when I've thought of {{dropping}} one or the other, but heck, I've been doing this since high school {{and it would be}} <b>pretty</b> <b>tough</b> to quit them both now." [...] Dufek added: [...] "Hockey is a more relaxed thing. [...] It's a smaller atmosphere and {{you have to deal with}} only one or two coaches. [...] You can be more individual and flashy. [...] Football has certain assignments and you can't really express yourself." [...] In the end, however, Dufek chose the NFL over the NHL. [...] He explained: [...] "I've decided to pursue professional football because I would probably have an extensive tour in the hockey minor leagues and I don't want that." ...|$|E

500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'.

2500|$|During {{the mid-1990s}} Beccy Cole and Gina Jeffreys were flatmates, while Mick Albeck and Rod McCormack were also flatmates. Cole {{was married to}} Albeck for one-and-a-half years (1998–99), writing songs as Rebecca Diane Albeck. The couple have a son. Not long after he was born their friends, Jeffreys and McCormack, married each other. Cole's second album, Wild at Heart, dealt with her divorce; the track [...] "Lazy Bones" [...] was written about Albeck and their short marriage. According to Albeck [...] "it was tough {{sometimes}} when we were touring together, living together, bringing up the baby together and having to be on stage together at night. I guess I decided I didn't want the relationship anymore. That was <b>pretty</b> <b>tough</b> for Bec at the time".|$|E
2500|$|Brian Shea of Game Informer called Mortal Kombat X [...] "more {{than the}} {{continuation}} of NetherRealm's successful vision for the franchise; it's {{one of the best}} fighting games in years", adding that the core gameplay was complex and varied while he enjoyed the multiplayer options. GameSpot's Peter Brown enjoyed the overall gameplay, saying it had [...] "the best fighting mechanics of any game in the series" [...] but was critical of the downloadable content as [...] "there's so much to love about the new Mortal Kombat that it's a shame to see such blatant monetization practices overlap with your experience". Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar described the story mode as [...] "ceaselessly entertaining", having [...] "great voice-acting and a surprisingly enjoyable script", and [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>tough</b> act to follow", criticizing the other single-player modes outside of the main story, and [...] "sparse" [...] tutorial options.|$|E
2500|$|Orr has a {{bucktoothed}} {{smile and}} frequently puts crabapples or horse chestnuts in {{his cheeks and}} rubber balls in his hands. He constantly teases Yossarian asking him {{if he wants to}} know why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story. But I never knew if it got across or not, since it's <b>pretty</b> <b>tough</b> to make people understand you when you're talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pollard {{was born}} in Trinidad and Tobago, where he was raised, along with two younger sisters, in a poor home by his single mother. Speaking about it, Pollard {{reflects}} [...] "It was <b>pretty</b> <b>tough,</b> it wasn't ideal getting up and your mum say 'We only have X amount of money'." [...] After representing Trinidad and Tobago in the 2005 TCL Group West Indies Under-19 Challenge, he was selected {{as part of the}} West Indies Under-19 cricket team to tour Pakistan. Pollard top-scored for the West Indies in the first youth One Day International (ODI), scoring 53runs off 49balls. Pollard made another half-century in the second match, but didn't manage to make double figures in either of last two games. He was named in the West Indies squad for the 2006 U/19 Cricket World Cup, held in Sri Lanka, where he only managed to make 19–runs in his four innings, though he did manage to take two wickets in a defeat to Australia.|$|E
2500|$|David Sanchez of GameZone {{praised the}} game's {{multiplayer}} aspects. He {{also noted that}} until MotoHeroz was released {{the only reason he}} found [...] "to hook up my console [...] to play Super Smash Bros. Brawl with [...] buddies." [...] He listed the five-hour campaign and lack of online multiplayer as low points to his review, but stated that the game was still well worth its cost. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas gave high marks to several aspects of the game. He noted that the game's load times were extremely fast, the menus were intuitive, and that it had several moments of humor. He also noted that though the Wii cannot produce HDTV resolutions that MotoHeroz still looked impressive in the console's 480p resolution. Darren Nakamura of Destructoid raised a concern with the game's gold medal difficulty. He felt that the challenge ranged [...] "from <b>pretty</b> <b>tough</b> to ludicrously difficult." [...] He noted that many critics initially scoffed its price when compared to Trials HD, but stated that most reviewers later recanted their concerns due to large amounts of replay value.|$|E
2500|$|As Daniel bonded {{with his}} uncle, Paul {{invited him to}} move into his {{penthouse}} apartment. They clashed a little, due to Daniel's different outlook on life. He values relationships over material possessions, which is an odd concept to Paul. Daniel also picked up some shifts in Paul's hotel, but Phillipps pointed {{out that it was}} to keep his uncle happy. Daniel found the job too restricting to stay there forever. Phillipps has said that he enjoyed working with Dennis again, following their previous storyline together in 2007. He thought that it was an interesting piece of writing, saying that if Paul was going to imagine someone, it makes sense that the guy looks like his nephew. When Paul suffered a public meltdown due to his grief over Kate's death, Daniel was there to comfort him while he broke down. However, the situation proved too much for Daniel and he had to call in Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), hoping that his uncle would receive the medical and psychological help he needed. Phillipps later said that helping Paul was [...] "a <b>pretty</b> <b>tough</b> ask" [...] for Daniel and while he thinks of himself as kind of therapist to people, the situation was [...] "pretty extreme". Phillipps added that the storyline presented [...] "an interesting dynamic" [...] for the pair.|$|E
2500|$|James Leach of Your Sinclair {{gave the}} ZX Spectrum game a 92/100 rating, writing that [...] "I'm really into this game. As far as I can see, it's got {{everything}} it should have. It's fast, it's easy in places and dead wicked in others and it's got a {{massive amount of}} variety. What more could you want? ... The graphics are very cartoony, as you'd expect, and there's pots of colour." [...] Leach {{also noted that the}} idea of including minigames in Bart vs. the Space Mutants [...] "is pretty inspired, and makes the game even more fun." [...] A reviewer for Crash also gave the ZX Spectrum version a positive review, with a 91/100 rating. He praised the variety and gameplay of the game, and noted that [...] "while it may sound pretty basic [...] it’s when you start discovering things, making use of objects, finding hidden treasures that it really comes alive. And achieving an objective is satisfying because the route to completion can be <b>pretty</b> <b>tough</b> (especially some of the platform elements)." [...] The reviewer also noted that [...] "if you’re a Simpsons fan the game’s incredibly appealing, the graphics all reflect Matt Groening’s cartoon very well. And how much of a fan you are dictates how much you’re really going to enjoy this [...] Non-fans can still get loads of entertainment, but some parts may be frustrating if you’re not into the characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, the Cataracs {{produced}} [...] "Like a G6" [...] with Far East Movement {{and decided}} to use a verse from Dev's single [...] "Booty Bounce" [...] as the chorus.

[...] "Like a G6", which features Far East Movement and Dev, was released in April 2010, and reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song went on to sell over four million downloads in the US. In August 2010, a music video was made for [...] "Booty Bounce" [...] directed by Ethan Lader, and uploaded it onto YouTube, where it has generated over twenty million views. In October 2010, Dev was signed to Universal Republic and her first official single, [...] "Bass Down Low", was serviced to rhythmic radio stations in November. It was released digitally in select territories on December 6, 2010 and one day later in the United States. The song reached sixty one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number two on the Heatseekers Songs chart. In Canada, the song peaked at number thirty five in its fifth week on the Canadian Hot 100 chart. However, [...] "Bass Down Low" [...] saw massive success in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number ten on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
