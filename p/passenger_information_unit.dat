50|$|The first train entered {{revenue service}} {{for a few}} hours on 30 December 2009 despite the claims that train drivers were still having issues with the train, {{including}} getting the onboard <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> display <b>units</b> to work, the train being taken out of service the next day. On 15 February 2010 rail operator Metro planned to reintroduce the train into service, but drivers refused to drive it citing unresolved safety issues. As a result, Metro took the Rail, Tram and Bus Union to the federal industrial tribunal. On 18 February union representatives and Metro management met for private talks before Fair Work Australia, on 20 February an agreement was reached for the train to enter service that afternoon, an event that became a media circus.|$|R
