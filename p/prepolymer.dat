Novel soluble ester-imide <b>prepolymers</b> {{consisting}} of bisphenol-A bis(trimellitate) dianhydride (ESDA), aromatic diamine, and 3 -ethynylaniline(3 -EA) as the thermosetting groups were synthesized. The <b>prepolymers</b> were quite soluble in DMAc, DMF, m-cresol, NMP, CHCl 3, and THF. The Tg’s {{of the various}} <b>prepolymers</b> were from 200 to 250 ◦C. The properties of the cured resins of the <b>prepolymers</b> were evaluated, and showed a range of cured Tg’s from 262 to 285 ◦C and flexural strengths of 112 – 138 MPa. A low moisture absorption of 0. 45 % and a low dielectric constant of 3. 1 were also observed. Properties of glass-cloth-reinforced composites using the ester-imide <b>prepolymers</b> as the matrix resin were evaluated, and excellent mechanical and thermal properties were observed.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{was written}} {{in the context of the}} development of a biological recycling process of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics. The aim was the examination of the microbial degradation of the epoxy resin educts, i. e. bisphenol A and epoxy resin <b>prepolymers</b> (1750 kDa), by the fungus Trametes versicolor and its enzyme laccase. In the first test, the fungus was incubated in liquid cultures containing bisphenol A (100 mg/L). Measuring the concentrations in the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) identified degradation up to 91 %. The laccase activity and the degradation of bisphenol A are related. A high volume activity causes a greater degradation of bisphenol A than a low volume activity. In the experimental degradation of epoxy resin <b>prepolymers,</b> it was observed that the fungus could use the <b>prepolymers</b> as only carbon source. There was no correlation between the activity of laccase and the fungal growth detected. The analysis in the HPLC showed a degradation product with a retention time of 14. 2 minutes that could not be identified. To determine a relation between the volume activity of laccase, the fungal growth and the degradation of epoxy resin <b>prepolymers,</b> liquid cultures were mixed with epoxy resin <b>prepolymers</b> as well as 1 -hydroxybenzotriazol to induce the production of laccase. The resulting growth was similar to the previous experiment, whereas the laccase activity was less.
