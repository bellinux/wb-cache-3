50|$|<b>Pedestal</b> <b>desks</b> made {{of steel}} sheet metal were {{introduced}} in 1946 and were popular in America until the 1970s. Called tanker desks, they were used in institutions such as schools and business and government offices.|$|R
50|$|A {{partners}} desk, partner's desk or partners' desk (also double desk) is {{an antique}} desk form, {{which is basically}} two <b>pedestal</b> <b>desks</b> constructed from the start as one large desk joined at the front, for two users working while facing each other.|$|R
50|$|Small or home {{offices are}} the usual habitat {{of the modern}} armoire desk.

50|$|The PDS-1 {{consisted}} of a CRT monitor, keyboard, light pen, and control panel on a small desk with most electronic logic in the <b>desk</b> <b>pedestal.</b> The electronics included a simple 16-bit minicomputer, and 8-16 kilobytes of magnetic core memory, and a display processor for driving CRT beam movements.|$|R
5000|$|In homes, {{the term}} [...] "student desk" [...] designates a small <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> or writing table {{constructed}} {{for use by}} a teenager or a pre-teen in their room. It often is a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> with {{only one of the}} two pedestals and about two thirds of the desk surface. Such desks are sometimes called [...] "left-pedestal desks" [...] and [...] "right-pedestal desks", depending on the position of the single pedestal. These desks are not as tall as normal adult desks. In some cases, the desk is connected from the seat to the table.|$|E
50|$|In form, {{a writing}} {{table is a}} <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> without the pedestals, having legs instead to hold it up. This is why such tables are {{sometimes}} called leg desks.|$|E

50|$|The desk {{shape is}} distinctive; its top part resembles an antique school desk while {{the bottom is}} like {{one half of the}} {{supports}} of a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> turned sideways. The addition of the two legs in front completes the odd effect.|$|E
50|$|For instance, a {{campaign}} desk {{version of a}} traditional <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> form would have strong but removable fittings {{making it easy to}} break up the desk in three pieces: two pedestals and one desktop surface. Each piece would have brass or iron handles mounted on it to facilitate handling.|$|E
5000|$|Orbit {{fans are}} fans that use a {{mechanism}} to oscillate at 360 degrees. They are also typically flushed to the ceiling like hugger type fans. They are also very small in size, usually about 16" [...] and have a similar construction to that of many <b>pedestal</b> fans and <b>desk</b> fans, and usually have finger guards. These are once again, popular mostly {{in many developing countries}} as they are a cheap alternative to traditional paddle type ceiling fans. Many American manufacturers, such as [...] "Fanimation" [...] have started producing high quality designer versions of such fans for their retro design, however, unlike the orbit huggers discussed earlier, these usually include downrods, like many early versions of the orbit fan.|$|R
50|$|The PDS-1 {{electronics}} {{were built}} from 7400 series low-density TTL integrated circuits, {{with only a}} dozen logic gates or 4 register bits per DIP chip. Small printed circuit cards held up to 12 chips each. The shallow <b>desk</b> <b>pedestal</b> held three racks or rows of cards, with 25 cards per row, and a wire wrap backplane connecting all cards. There was no uniform backplane bus. Customer documentation included complete schematics down to the gate level, so that customers could design their own interface boards. It was possible to see, touch, and understand every detail of how the whole system worked. Cycle time for the core memory was 2.0 microseconds for the PDS-1, and 1.8 microseconds for PDS-1D. TTL logic ran 10x faster, with 10 timing pulses per core memory cycle.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> appeared, {{especially}} in England, in the 18th century but became {{popular in the}} 19th and the 20th, overtaking the variants of the secretary desk and the writing table in sheer numbers. The French stayed faithful to the writing table or bureau plat ("flat desk"), which might have a matching paper-case (cartonnier) that stood upon it.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> is {{also one}} of the two {{principal}} forms of the big campaign desk, used by the military in the past. It can then be considered a portable desk in a limited way since the writing surface could be easily separated from the pedestals, to facilitate transport. The three separate elements were often fitted with large handles on the sides.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> is {{doubled in}} size to form a nearly square working surface, and drawers are put on both sides to {{accommodate}} two users at the same time, it becomes a partners desk. Thomas Chippendale gives designs for such tables, which were generally used in libraries, as writing tables in The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director (1753-4 and 1762).|$|E
5000|$|Both prototypes require {{considerable}} work to {{be adapted}} to what most managers or professionals consider a [...] "real" [...] desk, that is a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> located in a closed office. They would also require rework and re-think to be adapted to the types of desks which are found in home offices or small business offices, such as the armoire desk.|$|E
50|$|This {{piece of}} {{furniture}} was first conceived in the United Kingdom to accommodate the work of banking partners. These gentlemen were usually senior bank officials who wished to work together while keeping the convenience and the prestige of a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk.</b> It was an adaptation of the earlier and sometimes larger library desk, found in the libraries of the mansions of the gentry and the nobility.|$|E
5000|$|Very few non-specialists {{call this}} form a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk.</b> Most people usually {{refer to it}} as an {{executive}} desk, in contrast with the cubicle desk which is assigned to those who work under the executive. However, the term executive desk has been applied to so many desk forms as to be misleading, so the less-used but more precise [...] "pedestal desk" [...] has been retained here.|$|E
5000|$|From the mid-18th century onwards, the <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> {{has often}} had a top that is inlaid {{with a large}} panel of leather (sometimes with a gold- or blind-stamped border) or baize for a writing surface, within a cross-banded border. If the desk has a wooden top surface, it may have a {{pull-out}} lined writing drawer, or the pull-out may be fitted with a folding horse {{to serve as a}} [...]|$|E
50|$|An Indianapolis, Indiana, {{entrepreneur}} (who {{was later}} {{to become a}} Protestant preacher) called William S. Wooton obtained patents for his design and established a company in 1870. Production continued until about 1884. The Wooton desk is their better known secretary desk; the Wooton desk company also produced a so-called rotary desk, which {{is in fact a}} <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> whose pedestals have segments which turn on themselves to expose more drawers and nooks.|$|E
50|$|The bureau Mazarin is a 17th-century desk form named {{more or less}} {{in memory}} of Cardinal Mazarin, premier {{minister}} of France from 1642 to 1661. It is the earliest predecessor of the <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> and differs from it by having only two tiers of drawers or three tiers of rather small drawers under the desktop surface, followed by eight legs supporting the whole. Also, the bureau Mazarin has cross braces between the legs, forming two Xs or two Hs on each side.|$|E
50|$|There were {{at least}} two {{precursors}} to the pedestal desk: The French Bureau Mazarin (a desk named for Cardinal Mazarin) of the late 17th century and the Chinese Jumu desk or scholar's desk, which Europeans knew almost entirely at second-hand, largely from illustrations on porcelain. However, unlike the <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> these precursors had an incomplete stack of drawers and compartments holding up the two ends. The cases of drawers were raised about 15-30 cm (6-12 inches) from the floor on legs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{drawing board}} (also drawing table, {{drafting}} table or architect's table) is, in its antique form, {{a kind of}} multipurpose desk {{which can be used}} for any kind of drawing, writing or impromptu sketching on a large sheet of paper or for reading a large format book or other oversized document or for drafting precise technical illustrations (such as engineering drawings or architectural drawings). The drawing table used to be a frequent companion to a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> in a gentleman's study or private library, during the pre-industrial and early industrial era.|$|E
5000|$|A {{credenza}} desk (often simply, credenza) is {{a modern}} desk form usually placed next to a wall as a secondary work surface to that of another desk, such as a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> in a typical executive office. When used as an active work surface, the credenza desk is often placed against the wall immediately behind or perpendicular to the main desk, but close enough that the user can reach it from the seated position at the main desk by simply swivelling and wheeling their office chair over to it. When its planned use is to be less frequent, such as holding books or files which are not regularly referenced, or {{to act as an}} extra surface to help facilitate larger meetings, credenza desks are often placed on a wall in some other location of the office, such as adjacent to a conference table if one is present. Many conference rooms which have meeting tables but not desks will also have a credenza desk against one wall. The credenza desk is sometimes flat, like a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> {{but more often than not}} it has a stack of shelves, small drawers and other nooks, above its main working surface. The sum of these overhead amenities is usually called a hutch. Hence, the credenza desk is often called a [...] "credenza with hutch".|$|E
5000|$|Very often {{a drawing}} table could {{look like a}} writing table or even a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> when the working surface was set at the {{horizontal}} and the height adjusted to 29 inches, {{in order to use}} it as a [...] "normal" [...] desk. The only giveaway was usually a lip on one of the sides of the desktop. This lip or edge stopped paper or books from sliding when the surface was given an angle. It was also sometimes used to hold writing implements. When the working surface was extended at its full height, a drawing table could be used as a standing desk.|$|E
