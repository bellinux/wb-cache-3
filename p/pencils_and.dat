5|$|He began {{drawing the}} comic book in early 2005 with {{traditional}} art tools such as Mongol <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> brushes. He took great care while illustrating Elmer because he felt his earlier work, Wasted, was poorly drawn. To devote time to completing {{the comic book}}, he had to quit his job working for US comic companies. As a result, the period between 2006 and 2008 {{was one of the}} most financially difficult times of his life.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, {{he found}} work as a factor's clerk in a {{warehouse}} at Horseley Fields, Wolverhampton, until the early 1880s {{when he left the}} warehouse after failing to repay a loan. He then worked for a lock manufacturer called Osborne in Lord Street, Wolverhampton, until he was dismissed for theft in either 1884 or 1885. For the next few years, his whereabouts are not known for certain, but he appears to have lived an unsettled life in the English Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1887, he was making a living as a hawker, selling small items such as <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> key rings on the streets of Snow Hill, Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E

5|$|They {{are named}} after Franz Reuleaux, a 19th-century German {{engineer}} who pioneered {{the study of}} machines for translating one type of motion into another, and who used Reuleaux triangles in his designs. However, these shapes were known before his time, for instance by the designers of Gothic church windows, by Leonardo da Vinci, who used it for a map projection, and by Leonhard Euler {{in his study of}} constant-width shapes. Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the shape to guitar picks, <b>pencils,</b> <b>and</b> drill bits for drilling square holes, as well as in graphic design in the shapes of some signs and corporate logos.|$|E
5|$|Mary Phagan {{was born}} on June 1, 1899, into an {{established}} Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. That spring, Phagan took {{a job with the}} National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a knurling machine that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of <b>pencils,</b> <b>and</b> worked 55 hours per week. She worked {{on the second floor of}} the factory in the metal room in a section called the tipping department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.|$|E
5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> Hax brand aspirin.|$|E

25|$|After {{drawing the}} first issue of The Savage She-Hulk (Feb. 1980), Buscema {{abandoned}} regular superhero work in order to spearhead art duties on all three Conan titles.

25|$|One of the {{innovations}} for night and all-weather flying {{used by the}} US, UK, Japan and Germany during World War II {{was the use of}} UV interior lighting to illuminate the instrument panel, giving a safer alternative to the radium-painted instrument faces and pointers, and an intensity that could be varied easily and without visible illumination that would give away an aircraft's position.

It is performed at about three months and has godparents of the ceremony. The child is offered implements appropriate to its gender, tools for boys and cloth or thread for girls. If the children grasp them, this is considered a foretelling. All children are offered <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> paper.|$|E

25|$|On July 2, 1812, he had {{produced}} about thirty <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> sold {{them to a}} Benjamin Andrews, a hardware dealer on Union Street in downtown Boston. These were the first wooden-cased graphite lead pencils manufactured in the United States. Andrews was a previous customer of Munroe’s, to whom he had sold cabinetmaker’s squares. He ordered more immediately, which Munroe proceeded to grind out. Munroe showed up at Andrew’s hardware store with over four hundred pencils {{less than two weeks}} later. Andrews then wrote up a contract with Munroe to take for a price all the pencils that he could make in a certain time frame.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, he {{returned}} to DC, re-teaming briefly with penciler Sal Velluto on a story in September 1998's The New Gods Secret Files and Origins, before collabotaring with his fellow Floridian and artistic friend/mentor Dick Giordano on several projects. The two-issue prestige format Elseworlds tale Batman: Dark Knight of the Round Table was co-drawn and co-inked by the both of them, from a script by Layton and debuted a month after their six-issue mini-series The L.A.W. (Living Assault Weapons), which ran from September 1999 to February 2000, with script and inks by Layton, and full pencils by Giordano. The two wrote a second Batman Elseworlds tale, Batman: Hollywood Knight a three-issue mini-series which {{told the story of}} a Serials-actor who became convinced he was The Batman.

25|$|After the Jacobite Risings of {{the eighteenth}} century, Cumberland became a more stable place and, as {{in the rest of}} Northern England, the Industrial Revolution caused a large growth in urban populations. In particular, the west-coast towns of Workington, Millom and Barrow-in-Furness saw large iron and steel mills develop, with Barrow also {{developing}} a significant shipbuilding industry. Kendal, Keswick and Carlisle all became mill towns, with textiles, <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> biscuits among the products manufactured in the region. The early nineteenth century saw the county gain fame as the Lake Poets and other artists of the Romantic movement, such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, lived among, and were inspired by, the lakes and mountains of the region. Later, the children's writer Beatrix Potter also wrote in the region and became a major landowner, granting much of her property to the National Trust on her death. In turn, the large amount of land owned by the National Trust assisted {{in the formation of the}} Lake District National Park in 1951, which remains the largest National Park in England and has come to dominate the identity and economy of the county.|$|E
