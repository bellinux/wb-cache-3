5|$|Communications on {{the island}} failed due to the winds; the entire island was left without power and <b>phone</b> <b>service.</b> The winds greatly damaged 715power poles and 513transformers, leaving about $52million in {{electrical}} damage reported (2002USD, $ USD). The local weather office's communication link was cut off after flooding damaged a telecommunication facility, causing the National Weather Service in Honolulu, Hawaii, to provide backup support by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories. Many anemometers near the northern coastline failed from the winds. The winds collapsed several walls at the Guam Memorial Hospital, resulting in major damage throughout the northern two-thirds of the facility and several units being shut down. Several hotels, churches, and schools received moderate damage, and the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport received damage to navigation equipment. Typhoon Pongsona also left 65% of the island's water wells inoperable, with most of Guam left without water service following the storm.

5|$|Typhoon Maemi left about 1.47million {{electric}} customers {{without power}} around the country, causing ₩12.9billion (KRW, $11.61million USD) in damage to power companies. Widespread damage interrupted mobile and cell <b>phone</b> <b>service.</b> United States {{military bases in}} the country sustained about $4.5million in damage. Nationwide, Maemi destroyed about 5,000houses and damaged 13,000homes and businesses, leaving 25,000people homeless. About 150businesses in Gangwon Province were destroyed by Typhoon Rusa in 2002, only to be destroyed again by Maemi when they were rebuilt. Insured damages from Maemi were estimated at ₩650billion (KRW, $565million), mostly property damage. The insured damage was over four {{times the amount of}} insured damage from Typhoon Rusa the year prior. Overall damage was estimated at ₩5.52trillion (KRW, $4.8billion USD). By comparison, this total was ₩2.52trillion (KRW, $1.9billion USD) less than Rusa; the discrepancy between the insured and overall damage was due to Maemi causing heavier industrial damage, while Rusa caused more damage overall. The storm killed 117people throughout South Korea.|$|E
