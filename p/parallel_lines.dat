5|$|The set of {{one-dimensional}} subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional {{vector space}} V {{is known as}} projective space; it {{may be used to}} formalize the idea of <b>parallel</b> <b>lines</b> intersecting at infinity.

50|$|Curves of {{constant}} width can be rotated between <b>parallel</b> <b>line</b> segments. To see this, simply note {{that one can}} rotate <b>parallel</b> <b>line</b> segments (supporting lines) around curves {{of constant}} width by definition.Consequently, a curve of constant width can be rotated in a square.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are tangential (touching). Their point of tangency is chosen as the center of inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given <b>parallel</b> <b>lines</b> and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given <b>parallel</b> <b>lines</b> and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E
5|$|The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo {{originally}} formed two roughly <b>parallel</b> <b>lines</b> running north-south {{across the}} site. Although some were recovered from ravines, {{they were found}} close to their original placements and had been buried by local erosion. These heads, together {{with a number of}} monumental stone thrones, probably formed a processional route across the site, powerfully displaying its dynastic history. Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been re-carved from older thrones.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the state {{boundaries}} marked by the monument occurred just prior to, and during, the American Civil War, when the United States Congress acted to form governments {{in the area to}} combat the spread of slavery to the region. When the early territories were formed, their boundaries were designated along meridian and <b>parallel</b> <b>lines.</b> Beginning in the 1860s, these lines were surveyed and marked. These early surveys included some errors, but even so, the markers placed became the legal boundaries, superseding the written descriptions of geographical meridians and parallels. This includes the Four Corners Monument, which has been legally established as the corner of the four states.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} new {{algorithms}} for computing maximum perimeter and maximum {{area of the}} convex hull of imprecise inputs based on the <b>parallel</b> <b>line</b> segment model. The running time of our algorithms for maximum perimeter problem is O(n 4) which improve over the previous results of O(n 5) in [12]. For maximum are problem with different size of <b>parallel</b> <b>line</b> segments [12] gives O(n 3) algorithms.

5|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that psychoactive mushrooms have been used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. Murals dated 9000 to 7000BCE found in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria depict horned beings dressed as dancers, clothed in garb decorated with geometrical designs, and holding mushroom-like objects. <b>Parallel</b> <b>lines</b> extend from the mushroom shapes {{to the center of the}} dancers' heads. 6,000-year-old pictographs discovered near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as Psilocybe hispanica, a hallucinogenic species native to the area.|$|E
5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal <b>parallel</b> <b>lines</b> of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of her dress. The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.|$|E
5|$|Despite the World War I, {{significant}} {{extensions of}} rail lines were carried out, {{particularly in the}} wheat growing areas in the north west and west. The new lengthy <b>parallel</b> <b>lines</b> {{were considered to be}} cheaper to operate than the numerous short spurs such as those in the Goulburn Valley. By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely complete, with the best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with a number of lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW. On November 1937 the first run of the Spirit of Progress was made, a streamlined all air conditioned train run between Melbourne and Albury, led by the matching S class steam locomotives.|$|E
