40|$|In this Article, {{we report}} on the {{encapsulation}} of decyl-modified silicon nanoparticles (decyl-SiNPs) into ∼ 80 nm lipid nanocapsules (LNCs). The decyl-SiNPs were produced by thermal hydrosilylation of hydride-terminated SiNPs (H-SiNPs) liberated from porous silicon. Various techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis absorption, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and photoluminescence (PL), were used to characterize their size, shape, colloidal, and optical properties. The results indicate that these nanocapsules feature controllable size, good dispersity, high loading rate of SiNPs, colloidal stability in various media, and bright PL. The PL of decyl-SiNPs loaded LNCs was stable upon heating to 80 C, but was sensitive to basic solutions due to proton-gated emission of the SiNPs arranged at the LNCs interface between the oil phase and the hydrophilic polyethylene glycol moieties of the surfactant. These luminescent nanocapsules are therefore promising candidates as cellular probes for fluorescence imaging. In addition, it was found that TEM imaging of small-sized decyl-SiNPs could be greatly improved by <b>preliminary</b> <b>negative</b> staining of TEM grids with phosphotungstic acid...|$|R

50|$|On April 15, 2005, the Canadian Minister of Trade, Jim Peterson, {{announced}} {{that the federal government}} would provide Canadian softwood lumber associations with $20 million in compensation for their legal expenses stemming from the dispute with the United States. That same year, another NAFTA Chapter 19 panel reviewed a determination made by the USITC that the U.S. lumber industry was under a threat of injury due to Canadian imports. Since the United States ceded jurisdiction to the World Trade Organization, it was necessary for the U.S. government to establish that a domestic industry was suffering injury, or faced a threat of injury, before countervailing duties can be imposed. The NAFTA panel found the USITC's determination invalid. In addition, the panel made the controversial decision to deny the USITC to reopen the administrative record, ordering the USITC to issue a <b>negative</b> <b>determination</b> based on the existing record. Unlike the panel during the Lumber III stage, this panel's decision was unanimous. However, the U.S. government challenged its decision before an extraordinary challenge committee, which, on August 10, 2005, issued a unanimous decision against the United States, finding that the NAFTA panel's determination was not sufficiently invalid to require vacatur or remand, under the standards of NAFTA.|$|R
40|$|The {{estrogen}} receptor protein (estrophilin) {{was determined}} in specimens from 359 primary breast cancers and from metastatic tumors of 214 patients. Ninety-eight patients were eventually treated by {{some form of}} endocrine therapy: 82 patients were treated by ablative therapy, and 16 by hormonal additive treatment. The records of 81 of the 98 patients whose tumors were characterized for estrogen receptor content and who had received some type of endocrine therapy were reviewed by a peer review group that assessed the objective data for these patients regarding objective remission or failure to treatment. A positive estrophilin determination was defined as receptor content greater than 250 fmole per gram of tumor for premenopausal females and greater than 750 fmole per gram of tumor for postmenopausal and previously castrated patients. Estrogen receptor determinations may be made from tumor specimens as small as 200 mg. Sixty-nine patients underwent some form of ablative therapy. Twenty-seven of these patients {{were found to have}} significant receptor determinations. Of those patients in whom a definite determination was made of their post-treatment response, roughly two-thirds experienced objective remissions.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The calcium/calmodulin-activated protein {{phosphatase}} 2 B (PP 2 B, or calcineurin) regulates diverse {{biological processes}} including glucose homeostasis and synaptic plasticity. PP 2 B is targeted to specific substrates, {{such as the}} GluRI subunit of the AMPA receptor, by the scaffolding molecule A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP 79), which also interacts with protein kinase A (PKA). AKAP 79 contains a short linear motif that is the primary site of interaction with PP 2 B. We have identified an auxiliary interaction site for PP 2 B at the N-terminal region of AKAP 79. Using hybrid approaches including single particle EM, chemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry, biophysical techniques, and in vitro protein-protein interaction assays, I show that this additional interaction exclusively binds activated PP 2 B through a conserved LxVP mechanism. I mapped a 16 amino acid region in AKAP 79 that {{is necessary for the}} LxVP interaction and show that the peptide can effectively compete for binding. I use FRET reporters for PP 2 B activity to show that this auxiliary interaction is important for tuning the activity of PP 2 B towards specific substrates. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>negative</b> stain EM studies reveal that AKAP 79 forms multiple simultaneous contacts with PP 2 B in the presence of calcium and calmodulin. This structural model shows that AKAP 79 has a greater role in regulating PP 2 B activity and targeting than previously appreciated. This work describes a dynamic model of PP 2 B anchoring in which the active phosphatase is anchored differently than the inactive form. A bipartite interaction allows control of localization through the PxIxIT motif, while simultaneously allowing fine control of PP 2 B sensitivity to calcium through the dynamic LxVP motif...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to throw}} an {{illuminating}} {{light on the}} as yet neglected concept of nothing in Kant’s system, a concept which is taken into consideration, by Kant, {{in accordance with the}} guiding thread of the categories of the understanding. My main argument is that Kant has a fourfold division of nothing and each has a transcendental function in his system. This function is basically a limiting one; setting up <b>negative</b> <b>determinations</b> without which Kant’s system would have never been constituted as it is now. It is shown in the thesis that the concept of nothing is divided basically into four: first, nothing as ens rationis that limits and thereby protects knowledge, secondly nothing as nihil privativum that defines the boundaries of phenomenal reality, thirdly nothing as ens imaginarium that makes possible the unity of experience and finally, nothing as nihil negativum that draws the lines of logical thinking. All make, in the last resort and by being the concepts of the opposite, experience possible. The thesis consists of four chapters. The first chapter is an exposition of all four divisions of nothing, the second is the display specifically of the concepts of ens rationis and nihil negativum, and the third is of the concepts of ens imaginarium and nihil privativum. The auxiliary argument of the thesis is that while Hegel makes a strong charge of externality against and thereby severely criticizes the Kantian concept of the thing-in-itself, - the concept of which I propose to be contained under the concept of ens rationis- Kant has equally convincing arguments against such a charge. This is the topic of the fourth and final chapter which has an implicit aim of creating the image of a powerful critical Hegel {{but on the other hand}} an equally enduring and war-like Kant. Kant is presented as a philosopher who has powerful responses to institute a balance between himself and his opponent. When Kant’s differing concepts of nothing are taken into account, Hegel’s attack of externality, it is maintained, appears not to have taken into account the full measure of the resources of the Kantian position. Even when it is said that the attack is against one specific concept of the thing-in-itself alone, Kant still seems to have enough resources for toleration and defence indeed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 Radical anions {{have been}} {{generated}} in the gas-phase as potential precursors of diradicals, pyramidalized alkenes, and bent Akynes. The radical anions were studied by gas-phase ion experiments and by density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio calculations. The reaction of cyclopentanone with O·- produced three isomers [...] -the radical anions of cyclopentanone- 2, 5 -diyl (3 ·-), cyclopentanone- 2, 4 -diyl, and 2 -carbenacyclopentanone. The proton affinity (PA) and electron affinity (EA) of 3 ·- were determined by bracketing experiments to be, respectively, 361. 6 +/- 4. 8 kcal/mol and ca. 0. 5 eV. Although the experimental PA of 3 ·- {{is consistent with the}} calculated values, both DFT and ab initio calculations predict an EA that is 1. 0 eV higher than the experimental value. The apparent conflict between the calculated and experimental EA values is resolved by proposing that adiabatic electron transfer leads, not to cyclopentanone- 2, 5 -diyl, but to 1, 4 -pentadien- 3 -one. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>negative</b> ion photoelectron spectroscopy experiments support this hypothesis. The radical anions of 1, 5 -dehydroquadricyclane (6 ·-), norbornyne (16 ·-), and norbornenyne (17 ·-) were generated from the Squires reaction of, respectively, 1, 5 -bis(trimethylsilyl) quadricyclane, 2, 3 -bis(trimethylsilyl) norbomene, and 2, 3 bis(trimethylsilyl) norbornadiene. The PAs and EAs of these ions were measured by bracketing experiments and the experimental values were compared with those predicted by calculations. The PA and EA of 6 ·- were found to be, respectively, 385. 6 +/- 5. 1 kcal/mol and ca. 0. 6 eV, in good agreement with the predicted values, and lead to an experimental heat of hydrogenation (DeltaHH 2) of 91. 0 +/- 5. 1 kcal/mol for 1, 5 -dehydroquadricyclane. The PA and EA of 17 ·- were measured to be, respectively, 377. 5 +/- 3. 0 kcal/mol and 0. 81 +/- 0. 29 eV, again in good agreement with calculated values, leading to DeltaHH 2 = 93. 9 +/- 11. 6 kcal/mol for norbornenyne. The PA and EA of 16 ·- were determined to be, respectively, 372. 9 +/- 3. 0 kcal/mol and 0. 68 +/- 0. 1 eV. The experimental EA of 16 ·- is in good agreement with the predicted values; but the experimental PA is ca. 10 kcal/mol lower than the values predicted by ab initio and DFT calculations. The discrepancy between the measured and predicted PAs is resolved by proposing that adiabatic proton transfer occurs through rearrangement of 16 ·- to cyclopentylacetylide radical anion...|$|R

The dispute resulted in a Panel ruling that conforms with earlier Appellate Body decisions outlawing the use of "weighted average to transaction" zeroing in such reviews.

6000|$|But {{one more}} word must be added. At the {{beginning}} of this <b>preliminary</b> <b>negative</b> sketch I said that our mental ruin has been wrought by wild reason, not by wild imagination. A man does not go mad because he makes a statue a mile high, but he may go mad by thinking it out in square inches. Now, one school of thinkers has seen this and jumped at it as a way of renewing the pagan health of the world. They see that reason destroys; but Will, they say, creates. The ultimate authority, they say, is in will, not in reason. The supreme point is not why a man demands a thing, but the fact that he does demand it. I have no space to trace or expound this philosophy of Will. It came, I suppose, through Nietzsche, who preached something that is called egoism. That, indeed, was simpleminded enough; for Nietzsche denied egoism simply by preaching it. To preach anything is to give it away. First, the egoist calls life a war without mercy, and then he takes the greatest possible trouble to drill his enemies in war. To preach egoism is to practise altruism. But however it began, the view is common enough in current literature. The main defence of these thinkers is that they are not thinkers; they are makers. They say that choice is itself the divine thing. Thus Mr. Bernard Shaw has attacked the old idea that men's acts are to be judged by the standard of the desire of happiness. He says that a man does not act for his happiness, but from his will. He does not say, [...] "Jam will make me happy," [...] but [...] "I want jam." [...] And in all this others follow him with yet greater enthusiasm. Mr. John Davidson, a remarkable poet, is so passionately excited about it that he is obliged to write prose. He publishes a short play with several long prefaces. This is natural enough in Mr. Shaw, for all his plays are prefaces: Mr. Shaw is (I suspect) the only man on earth who has never written any poetry. But that Mr. Davidson (who can write excellent poetry) should write instead laborious metaphysics in defence of this doctrine of will, does show that the doctrine of will has taken hold of men. Even Mr. H.G.Wells has half spoken in its language; saying that one should test acts not like a thinker, but like an artist, saying, [...] "I FEEL this curve is right," [...] or [...] "that line SHALL go thus." [...] They are all excited; and well they may be. For by this doctrine of the divine authority of will, they think they can break out of the doomed fortress of rationalism. They think they can escape.|$|R
