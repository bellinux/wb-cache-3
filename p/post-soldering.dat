40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{phase-out}} of ozone-depleting chemicals (ODC), the military and its contractors are facing the problem of developing alternative materials and processes which currently employ these materials. Electronics are a particularly challenging problem because efficient removal of <b>post-soldering</b> flux residues is critical to the long-term performance of high-reliability electronics. The use of water soluble flux offers an attractive option because all cleaning would be accomplished using only water. Until recently, the military has not allowed this type of flux because of the highly corrosive fluxing action usually associated with these materials. However, a new flux ingredient, citric acid, is gaining favor within the electronics manufacturing industry. Citric acid offers excellent fluxing ability, efficient removal of residues with water, and non-ionic flux formulations. This report examines the chemistry of this material under simulated soldering conditions in an effort to gain an improved understanding of thermal reactions and degradation products which may have an effect on long-term reliability of military electronic hardware.

40|$|Soldering of {{molded case}} {{tantalum}} capacitors {{can result in}} damage to Ta 205 dielectric and first turn-on failures due to thermo-mechanical stresses caused by CTE mismatch between materials used in the capacitors. It is also known that presence of moisture might cause damage to plastic cases due to the pop-corning effect. However, there are only scarce literature data {{on the effect of}} moisture content on the probability of <b>post-soldering</b> electrical failures. In this work, that is based on a case history, different groups of similar types of CWR tantalum capacitors from two lots were prepared for soldering by bake, moisture saturation, and longterm storage at room conditions. Results of the testing showed that both factors: initial quality of the lot, and preconditioning affect the probability of failures. Baking before soldering was shown to be effective to prevent failures even in lots susceptible to pop-corning damage. Mechanism of failures is discussed and recommendations for pre-soldering bake are suggested based on analysis of moisture characteristics of materials used in the capacitors' design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{electrochemical}} {{behaviors of}} eight parent alloys and four <b>post-solder</b> alloys used in dental prostheses were specified in a (pH= 7. 4; [NaCl]= 9 g/L) -aqueous solution at 37 °C. For each alloy, the free potential was followed during two hours, and a cyclic polarization between the cathodic domain and the solvent’s oxidation was performed. The gal-vanic corrosion between each parent alloy and its usual <b>post-solder</b> was also studied. The free potentials {{stay in the}} immu-nity domain of the alloy’s base-elements (precious metals) or in their passivation domain (nickel, chromium). A relatively strong oxidation of the alloys is possible only for high values of applied potential. Corrosion of the noblest alloys is al-most inexistent. It occurs for the nickel-base alloys {{but it is very}} slow. Most of the elements present can be oxidized, but only for high potentials which cannot be really achieved by dissolved oxygen. Galvanic corrosion can occur between the parent alloy and the <b>post-solder</b> alloy in some cases...|$|R
40|$|Of {{fundamental}} {{importance to}} enhance the reliability of flip chip on board (FCOB) packages is to avoid the initiation and propagation of various interfacial failures and, therefore, robust interfacial bonds between the underfill and other components are highly desired. In the present study, the interfacial bond strengths of both conventional and no-flow underfill resins with die passivation, eutectic solder and epoxy solder mask are measured using the button shear test. The surface characteristics of these substrates are analyzed using various techniques, including optical scanning interferometry, scanning electron microscopy and contact angle measurements. It is found that the interfacial bond strength of the underfill with the eutectic solder is far weaker than of other interfaces. The degradation of underfill bond strength with silicon nitride passivation, eutectic solder and polymeric solder mask surfaces is enhanced {{in the presence of}} solder flux, and cleaning the fluxed surface with a saponifier is an efficient means to restore the original interfacial adhesion. The necessity of <b>post-solder</b> reflow cleaning is shown by performing thermal cycle tests on FCOB packages with different extents of flux residue. Distinctive solder failure behaviors are observed for the packages with and without <b>post-solder</b> reflow cleaning from the cross-sectional analysis...|$|R
40|$|Équipe 401 : Nanomatériaux pour la vie et développement durableInternational audienceThe {{metallic}} frameworks strengthening prostheses {{are composed}} of successive alloys joined {{to one another and}} the temperature melting range of which needs to be known to well operate the foundry operation as well as the two types of soldering usually realized. In this work eight parent alloys, four pre-solder alloys and four <b>post-solder</b> alloys were subjected to differential thermal analysis in order to know the real solidus and liquidus temperatures. Some of the alloys obviously solidify in one time (the single –phased alloys and the alloys containing a major phase) and other in two times (the bi-phased alloys with similar fractions for the two constituents). In all cases the temperatures of fusion’s start and end, and the temperatures of solidification’s start and end, were successfully determined. This led to several refractoriness classes (<b>post-solder</b> < pre-solder < parent alloys), an order in good agreement with the conditions of soldering needed all along the prosthesis fabrication. A simple criterion based on the separation of the contents in elements more refractory than the base element and the contents in elements less refractory than the base element, has been established for the prevision of the solidus temperatures and of the liquidus temperatures of the alloys based on gold and containing, with not too far contents, the same elements as the alloys studied in this work...|$|R
40|$|The Surface Mount Technology (SMT) {{industry}} has been faced with several challenges in the past decades. Two {{of the most recent}} ones are RoHS compliant lead-free assembly and the adoption of fine-pitch components assembly processes. Moreover, halogen-free is another new requirement for assembled PCB reliability, environmental and health concerns. All these requirements create fundamental challenges of developing a solder paste to satisfy everything. One of the resolutions for these challenges can be the development of the activator package with the advanced organic chemistry technology. Serial innovative activator system was developed recently for solder paste flux, tacky flux and liquid flux formulation. This paper will discuss three Type 4 lead-free halogen-free no-clean solder pastes (ROL 0) developed based on different innovative activators, which respond to the challenges described above. The printing performance, coalescence, wetting, BGA voiding and head-in-pillow characteristics, are compared and discussed in detail. The testing results show all three pastes with the new activators are fully capable of printing and reflowing 01005 components with different board/device finishes, even in air reflow. They can handle a wide variety of print variables, including print speed, long abandon time and a wide range of temperature and humidity. <b>Post-soldering,</b> the paste offers minimized defects, including head-in-pillow and BGA voiding...|$|E
