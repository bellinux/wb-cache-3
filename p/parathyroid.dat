40|$|Background: With the {{reduction}} in mortality from thyroid surgery, surgeons are now concentrating in decreasing the morbidity by improving the dissection technique. Morbidity is related to injuries to the <b>parathyroids,</b> recurrent laryngeal and external branch of superior laryngeal nerve. Mostly these are due to technical failure and the variations in the surgical anatomy. In this article we analyse the surgical anatomy of the <b>parathyroids</b> during the thyroid surgery {{in a set of}} Indian patients undergoing elective thyroid surgeries. Material and Methods: Retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care centre in South India. Study period was from February 2011 to February 2013. Patients undergoing surgery for benign goitres, T 1 and T 2 thyroid cancers without lymph node involvement were included. Reoperative cases, advanced thyroid cancers were excluded. Data related to 1168 <b>parathyroids</b> which included 584 superior and 584 inferior <b>parathyroids</b> were included in this study. Results: There were 404 thyroid surgeries performed during this period. This included 180 total thyroidectomy and 224 hemithyroidectomy. Among the HT 138 were left HT and 86 right HT. Mean age was 37. 52 +/- 12. 9 yrs; mean duration of goitre was 39. 49 +/- 46. 82 months. Male: Female rati...|$|R
5|$|<b>Parathyroid</b> glands {{are found}} in all adult tetrapods; they vary in their number and position. Mammals {{typically}} have four <b>parathyroid</b> glands, while other types of animals typically have six. The removal of <b>parathyroid</b> glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning with irregular muscle contractions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Parathyroid</b> glands {{are small}} {{endocrine}} glands {{in the neck}} of humans and other tetrapods that produce <b>parathyroid</b> hormone. Humans usually have four <b>parathyroid</b> glands, variably located {{on the back of}} the thyroid gland. <b>Parathyroid</b> hormone and calcitonin (one of the hormones made by the thyroid gland) have key roles in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.|$|E
5|$|Renal {{disease may}} lead to hyperparathyroidism. When too much calcium is lost, there is a {{compensation}} by the <b>parathyroid,</b> and <b>parathyroid</b> hormone is released. The glands hypertrophy to synthesise more <b>parathyroid</b> hormone. This is known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the <b>parathyroid</b> tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release <b>parathyroid</b> hormone. This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism.|$|E

5000|$|The {{middle layer}} {{envelopes}} the strap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, thyrohyoid, and omohyoid muscles). It also surrounds the pharynx, larynx, trachea, esophagus, thyroid, <b>parathyroids,</b> buccinators, and constrictor {{muscles of the}} pharynx.|$|R
5|$|The major {{function}} of the <b>parathyroid</b> glands is to maintain the body's calcium and phosphate levels within a very narrow range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. The <b>parathyroid</b> glands do this by secreting <b>parathyroid</b> hormone.|$|E
5|$|The <b>parathyroid</b> glands are {{two pairs}} of glands usually {{positioned}} behind {{the left and right}} lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide, and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four <b>parathyroid</b> glands. The two <b>parathyroid</b> glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior <b>parathyroid</b> glands, while the lower two are called the inferior <b>parathyroid</b> glands. Healthy <b>parathyroid</b> glands generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women. These glands are not visible or able to be felt during examination of the neck.|$|E
5|$|The <b>parathyroid</b> glands are {{variable}} in number: {{three or more}} small glands, and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more <b>parathyroid</b> glands. Rarely, the <b>parathyroid</b> glands may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the thymus.|$|E
50|$|Endocrine {{pathology}} is the subspecialty {{of surgical}} pathology {{which deals with}} the diagnosis and characterization of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases of organs of the endocrine system, including the thyroid, <b>parathyroids,</b> exocrine pancreas, and adrenal glands.|$|R
40|$|From {{the facts}} stated {{in this paper}} {{it is evident that}} the thymus gland of mammals {{contains}} a substance which is capable of producing tetany when fed to the larvæ of certain species of salamanders (Ambystoma opacum and Ambystoma maculatum). As long as the larvæ have not developed their own thymus glands, they are able, by means of some mechanism, to counterbalance the tetanic action of the thymus substance introduced in their food. When, however, the secretion from their own thymus glands is added to the thymus material introduced with the food, this mechanism of preventing tetany becomes inadequate and tetany ensues. In the larva of a third species of salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum, this mechanism will prevent tetany even when the larvæ are fed on thymus. In mammals the <b>parathyroids</b> are known to prevent tetany and are supposed either to absorb the tetany-producing substance and thus prevent its action or to change it into another non-toxic substance. It is at least probable that in the amphibians the <b>parathyroids</b> play the same rôle. Larvæ of anuran amphibians, which develop their <b>parathyroids</b> soon after hatching, never show tetanic convulsions if they are fed on thymus, but in certain species of salamanders, whose <b>parathyroids</b> develop only during metamorphosis, the larvæ invariably have tetanic convulsions upon thymus feeding, while the metamorphosed animals never show tetany. But in addition to the <b>parathyroids</b> the salamanders must possess still another mechanism which during the larval period inhibits the production of tetany by the animal's own thymus glands. In the larvæ of Ambystoma opacum and Ambystoma maculatum this mechanism is sufficient only to prevent tetany from the animal's own thymus, while in the larvæ of Ambystoma tigrinum it is capable of preventing tetany even when the larvæ are fed with thymus. If the thymus is the organ by whose action tetany is produced, we can understand why tetany in human beings occurs far more frequently in children than in adults, since in the latter the thymus gland is replaced, at least to a great extent, by connective tissue. The relation of thymus to tetany may also possibly explain the occurrence of tetany during pregnancy; while the <b>parathyroids</b> of the mother may be sufficient to prevent tetany from her largely atrophied thymus, they may not be sufficient to prevent tetany from the excess of thymus substance furnished by the fetus to the blood of the mother...|$|R

Materials and Methods Clinical and pathological data of 102 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy were reviewed. We compared postoperative serum calcium levels of 51 patients without accidental removal of the <b>parathyroids</b> (group A) with those of 51 patients with unintentional parathyroidectomy (group B). Furthermore, calcemic levels were stratified in relation to the number of <b>parathyroids</b> accidentally removed. Results Biochemical postoperative hypocalcemia was observed in 40 (39...|$|R
5|$|When present, {{the thyroid}} ima's chief supply is the thyroid gland, though it also {{supplies}} the trachea. The artery may extend and supply the <b>parathyroid</b> glands. An infrequently observed artery, {{it is more}} frequently reported {{in the context of}} enlarged <b>parathyroid</b> glands (<b>parathyroid</b> adenomas). The artery ends by supplying the thyroid gland, or the <b>parathyroid</b> glands, as a single unit or as multiple branches.

5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} <b>parathyroid</b> hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the <b>parathyroid</b> glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; with normal <b>parathyroid</b> hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E

5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica is {{the result}} of {{unchecked}} hyperparathyroidism, or the overactivity of the <b>parathyroid</b> glands, which results in an overproduction of <b>parathyroid</b> hormone (PTH). PTH causes the release of calcium from the bones into the blood, and the reabsorption of calcium in the kidney. Thus, excess PTH in hyperparathyroidism causes elevated blood calcium levels, or hypercalcemia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Parathyroid</b> hormone (PTH, {{known as}} parathormone) {{is a small}} protein that takes part in the control of calcium and {{phosphate}} homeostasis, as well as bone physiology. <b>Parathyroid</b> hormone has effects antagonistic to those of calcitonin.|$|E

50|$|The {{endocrine}} system {{consists of the}} principal endocrine glands: the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, pancreas, <b>parathyroids,</b> and gonads, but nearly all organs and tissues produce specific endocrine hormones as well.
