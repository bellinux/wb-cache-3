5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it. The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. The <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{government}} systems in European politics: in a presidential system, the president {{is the head of}} state and the head of government; in a semi-presidential system, the president and the prime minister share a number of competences; finally, in a parliamentary republic, the president is a ceremonial figurehead who has few political competences. As with the definition of constitutional monarchies, sometimes the <b>president</b> <b>does</b> have non-ceremonial competences, but does not use them by constitutional convention; this is the case in Austria, for instance.|$|E
5000|$|He asserts about Bush {{administration}} {{reports of}} weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, [...] "Powell was not duped or misled by anybody, nor did he lie about Saddam's suspected WMD stockpiles. The <b>President</b> <b>did</b> not lie. The Vice <b>President</b> <b>did</b> not lie... the far less dramatic truth is that we were wrong." ...|$|R
25|$|After 38 {{years of}} rule, <b>President</b> <b>dos</b> Santos will be {{stepping}} {{down from the}} MPLA leadership. The leader of the winning party at the Parliamentary Elections in August 2017 will become {{the next president of}} Angola. The MPLA has selected Defense Minister, General João Lourenço, for their front-runner to take over from <b>President</b> <b>dos</b> Santos if the ruling party wins the August elections.|$|R
50|$|As <b>President,</b> <b>dos</b> Santos {{continued}} {{the task of}} economic and political reconstruction begun by his predecessor.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with {{the division of the}} European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.|$|E
5|$|The Council {{is made up}} of its Chairman (as of 6 November 2012 the Chief Justice of Singapore, Sundaresh Menon), up to ten {{permanent}} members who are appointed for life, and up to ten ordinary members who are appointed for a period of three years and may be re-appointed. Appointments are made by the President on the advice of the Cabinet. If the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not concur with Cabinet's advice, he may veto appointments. However, he is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers ("CPA"), and if the CPA does not concur with his view, Parliament may override his decision with a resolution passed with a two-thirds majority vote. The President has no power to remove current PCMR members.|$|E
25|$|In {{case the}} President is {{temporarily}} absent, {{one of the}} Vice-Presidents designated by him/her stands in for him/her. If the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not designate any of the Vice-Presidents to stand in for him/her, the oldest Vice-President shall stand in for him/her.|$|E
25|$|The law {{requires}} the post-transition president and ministers {{to disclose their}} assets. The <b>president</b> <b>did</b> so following his December inauguration.|$|R

25|$|Vice President Cheney {{advised that}} no one ever told him that Wilson went to Niger because of his wife's CIA status and, in fact, the Vice <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not have any idea to this day why Joseph Wilson was {{selected}} to go to Niger.|$|E
25|$|Non-partisan, no {{more than}} three Commissioners may belong to the same {{political}} party. The President also designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman, the SEC's top executive. However, the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not possess the power to fire the appointed Commissioners, a provision that was made to ensure the independence of the SEC. This issue arose during the 2008 presidential election in connection with the ensuing financial crises.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of President is an honorary one. The <b>President</b> <b>does</b> {{not take a}} salary and is chosen from supporters of the club. Past holders of the seat have included former Prime Minister Sir John Major {{and a number of}} former players, an example of which is the 2011 President and 1960s Surrey slow left-arm bowler Roger Harman, who held the post for a single year, as has been customary in recent years. He was the 48th President.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, <b>President</b> <b>dos</b> Santos {{named his}} eldest son, José Filomeno dos Santos, {{as the head}} of Angola's {{sovereign}} investment fund, in charge of over $5 billion.|$|R

25|$|Additionally, since {{official}} treaties {{are specifically}} created under and by constitutional U.S. law and are entered into by both {{government and the}} people as a whole, {{in his capacity as}} head of state and as the single individual representative of the United States and its citizens, the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> have Coauthority and Constitutional duty to unilaterally withdraw the United States from treaties if he determines the best interests and well being of the U.S. and its citizens are benefited by doing so.|$|E
25|$|According to the Constitution, the President Elect {{must take}} the Oath of Office on December 1, before {{a joint session of}} Congress; the Constitution also states that the presidential term begins on December 1. Members of Congress {{belonging}} to the parties in the Coalition had threatened to disrupt the ceremony, with actions similar to those that prevented Vicente Fox from delivering his State of the Union address on September 1. According to the Constitution, if the elected <b>president</b> <b>does</b> not take the Oath of Office on 1 December before a joint session, the presidency is declared vacant and an interim president must be named and new elections called.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding his {{executive}} power, the President cannot make treaties or appointments without {{the advice and}} consent of the Senate. Likewise, the President's pardon power is limited to offenses against the United States (federal crimes) and does not extend to impeachments or violations of state law. As treaties are by U.S. law official agreements with foreign governments recognized as such only after Senate ratification, the President obviously cannot make treaties unilaterally. However, the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> determine and decide U.S. foreign policy and can enter into non-binding discussions and give conditional approval to agreements reached with foreign governments subject to Senate ratification at a future date.|$|E
60|$|The <b>President</b> <b>did</b> not reply. He was anxiously {{watching}} the Record and scribbling {{notes on a}} paper beside him. His face was pale and his lips tightly compressed.|$|R
50|$|On 10 July 2008 the Slovak media {{reported}} that Kováč probably suffered from Parkinson's disease. The former <b>president</b> <b>did</b> not confirm this information but {{admitted that he}} had some health problems.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{gentlemen of}} the Right, M. le <b>President,</b> <b>do</b> not appear to like my words. But that is not surprising. The {{gentlemen of the}} Right {{notoriously}} {{do not like the}} truth." ...|$|R
25|$|Regardless of the {{inability}} to declare war, the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> {{have the power to}} unilaterally order military action in defense of the United States when he determines that a foreign political entity poses a clear and present danger to the safety and security of the United States. By U.S. law, the only limitation on that power is a requirement to notify specific members of Congress within 48 hours after the beginning of military operations. Once proper legal notification is given to the required members of Congress, military action can continue and remain secret so long as the President judges it necessary to national security.|$|E
25|$|Although the European Council is, {{under the}} terms of the Lisbon treaty, a {{separate}} institution of the EU, it does not have its own administration. The administrative support for both the European Council and its President is provided by the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union. The <b>President</b> <b>does</b> have, however, his own private office (cabinet) of close advisers. Van Rompuy chose as his first chief of staff (chef de cabinet) Baron Frans van Daele, formerly Belgian ambassador to, variously, the USA, the UN, the EU and NATO and chief of staff of several Belgian foreign ministers. Upon his retirement in the autumn of 2012, Didier Seeuws, former Deputy Perm Rep of Belgium to the EU and former Spokesman for Belgian PM Verhofstadt, replaced him. Also in his team were the former UK Labour MEP Richard Corbett and Van Rompuy's long standing press officer Dirk De Backer.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} types of {{republic}}, the Kemalist republic is a representative democracy with a Parliament chosen in general elections, a President as head of state elected by Parliament and serving for a limited term, a Prime Minister appointed by the President, and other Ministers appointed by Parliament. The Kemalist <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not have direct executive powers, but has limited veto powers, {{and the right to}} contest with referendum. The day-to-day operation of government {{is the responsibility of the}} Council of Ministers formed by the Prime Minister and the other Ministers. There is a separation of powers between the executive (President and Council of Ministers), the legislative (Parliament) and the judiciary, in which no one branch of government has authority over another–although parliament is charged with the supervision of the Council of Ministers, which can be compelled to resign by a vote of no-confidence.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the sitting}} <b>{{president}}</b> <b>did</b> {{not attend the}} game, former president and former Texas governor George W. Bush was present, {{along with his wife}} Laura and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.|$|R

500|$|The Presidential Palace ( [...] , also {{referred}} to by the metonym Pantovčak) in Zagreb is the official workplace of the president. The <b>president</b> <b>does</b> not actually live in the building, as it is used as the Office of the President of Croatia {{rather than as a}} residence. The structure covers [...] It had been used as the official residence since then-president Franjo Tuđman moved there following the October 1991 bombing of Banski dvori. In addition to the original building, there is also an [...] annex built in 1993, an ancillary structure housing office security services and a bomb shelter predating the 1990s. The building, formerly known as Villa Zagorje or Tito's Villa, was designed by architects Vjenceslav Richter and Kazimir Ostrogović and completed in 1964 for the former Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
2500|$|Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary at the time, {{spoke for}} President Obama {{on the matter}} by saying the <b>president</b> <b>does</b> not support, but {{actually}} opposes, some {{of the kind of}} words and lyrics that have been written by Common and others. Even though the <b>president</b> <b>does</b> not support the lyrics in question, he believed that some reports were distorting what Mr. Lynn stands for more broadly. Common gave a single line response to the entire controversy: [...] "I guess Sarah Palin and Fox News doesn't like me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{arguments}} that the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not possess soft power stem from a strict interpretation of the Constitution and what are regarded as the traditional roles of the President. First, unless the Constitution states otherwise, the default position is that when exercising his functions the President has to act according to {{the advice of the}} Cabinet. In the context of the Constitution, the word advice does not carry its typical meaning of mere opinion or suggestion. The President is obliged to follow the Cabinet's advice. Thus, the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> not have any liberty to exercise soft power. Furthermore, {{it has been argued that}} since the President is elected to exercise the powers defined in the Constitution, the concept of [...] "political legitimacy" [...] posited by proponents would appear to be undermined by soft power, which has an unspecified and ambiguous scope.|$|E
5000|$|Rafael Marques de Morias, a {{journalist}} and human rights activist, wrote [...] "The Lipstick of the Dictatorship", an article criticizing corruption in the Angolan government and <b>President</b> <b>dos</b> Santos, on July 3.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{well-known}} {{exception to this}} norm is Angolan <b>president</b> José Eduardo <b>dos</b> Santos, who is frequently referred to as <b>President</b> <b>Dos</b> Santos, even among Portuguese-speaking people and in Portuguese-language media (although, in Portugal, the forms [...] "Presidente José Eduardo dos Santos" [...] or [...] "Presidente Eduardo dos Santos" [...] are still more common).|$|R
5000|$|In June 2016, <b>President</b> <b>dos</b> Santos {{appointed}} {{his daughter}} {{as a director}} of the state-owned oil company, Sonangol. The appointment was challenged {{on the grounds that it}} violates Angola's public probity laws. Opposition politicians and critics declared this as dos Santos' attempts at becoming a [...] "king" [...] of Angola. It has been noted that placing his daughter in such a prominent position signals the likelihood on her intent to enter politics when <b>President</b> <b>dos</b> Santos' rule is up. The Angolan Supreme Court accepted the case in October, marking the first time a court has ever heard any case against the <b>president</b> since <b>dos</b> Santos' tenure. Bloomberg noted that Sonangol is planning a substantial restructuring due to external market pressure on oil, and that dos Santos wanted someone he fully trusted responsible for the restructuring to secure his family's interests.|$|R
