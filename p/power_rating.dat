5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a <b>power</b> <b>rating</b> of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E

For example, in panel (a), where DIF {{was introduced in}} the discrimination parameter, the percent of DIF items within an affected group did not exhibit a clear pattern. For example, when discrimination DIF was [...]. 40 and 40 % of groups were impacted by DIF, increasing the percent of DIF items did not necessarily result in higher <b>power</b> <b>rates.</b> For example, with 20 % of DIF items, the estimated <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> was [...]. 70, while further increases in the percent of DIF items per group resulted in <b>power</b> <b>rates</b> of [...]. 65 and [...]. 71, respectively. In conditions with 70 % of groups being impacted by DIF, more expected results were noted. Namely, <b>power</b> <b>rates</b> increased as the number of items with DIF increased, from [...]. 51, [...]. 57, and [...]. 63 for the 20 %, 40 %, and 60 %, respectively. Interestingly, when discrimination DIF was [...]. 80, <b>power</b> <b>rates</b> slightly decreased as the percent of DIF items increased; this was the case for conditions with 40 % and 70 % of groups affected by DIF.

25|$|The {{failure rate}} of {{resistors}} in a properly designed circuit is {{low compared to}} other electronic components such as semiconductors and electrolytic capacitors.

40|$|Inferences on the {{parameter}} {{estimates of}} Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimator in regression model when regressors exhibit multicollinearity {{is a problem}} in that large standard errors of the regression coefficients which cause low t-statistic value often result into the acceptance of the null hypothesis. This paper, therefore, makes efforts to investigate the effect of multicollinearity on the <b>power</b> <b>rates</b> of the OLS estimator. A regression model with constant term (&# 946; 0) and two independent variables (with (&# 946; 1 and (&# 946; 2 as their respective regression coefficients) that exhibit multicollinearity was considered. A Monte Carlo study of 1000 trials was conducted at eight levels of multicollinearity (0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 7, 0. 75, 0. 8, 0. 9 and 0. 99) and sample sizes (10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 150, 250 and 500).

Results show that at each hypothesized value of &# 946; 0 the <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> is the same at all the levels of multicollinearity at a specified sample size and that the error rate decreases asymptotically.

40|$|Abstract Background Discovery of {{biomarkers}} {{that are}} correlated with therapy response and thus with survival {{is an important}} goal of medical research on severe diseases, e. g. cancer. Frequently, microarray studies are performed to identify genes of which the expression levels in pretherapeutic tissue samples are correlated to survival times of patients. Typically, such a study can take several years until the full planned sample size is available. Therefore, interim analyses are desirable, offering the possibility of stopping the study earlier, or of performing additional laboratory experiments to validate {{the role of the}} detected genes. While many methods correcting the multiple testing bias introduced by interim analyses have been proposed for studies of one single feature, there are still open questions about interim analyses of multiple features, particularly of high-dimensional microarray data, where the number of features clearly exceeds the number of samples. Therefore, we examine false discovery <b>rates</b> and <b>power</b> <b>rates</b> in microarray experiments performed during interim analyses of survival studies. In addition, the early stopping based on interim results of such studies is evaluated. As stop criterion we employ the achieved average <b>power</b> <b>rate,</b> i. e. the proportion of detected true positives, for which a new estimator is derived and compared to existing estimators. Results In a simulation study, pre-specified levels of the false discovery rate are maintained in each interim analysis, where reduced levels as used in classical group sequential designs of one single feature are not necessary. Average <b>power</b> <b>rates</b> increase with each interim analysis, and many studies can be stopped prior to their planned end when a certain pre-specified <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> is achieved. The new estimator for the <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> slightly deviates from the true <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> but is comparable to other estimators. Conclusions Interim analyses of microarray experiments can provide evidence for early stopping of long-term survival studies. The developed simulation framework, which we also offer as a new R package 'SurvGenesInterim' available at [URL], can be used for sample size planning of the evaluated study design. </p...|$|R
