500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson {{felt that it}} served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. [...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans <b>pulling</b> <b>for</b> the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, {{on the edge of my}} seat. And the appearance of the caped figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was as dramatic as could be." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really <b>pulling</b> <b>for</b> him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them {{in the palm of his}} hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the series}} progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of Breaking Bad made Walter {{increasingly}} unsympathetic.

2500|$|In 1928, Sharpe {{became the}} {{athletic}} director and head football coach at Washington University in St. Louis. [...] When he was hired at Washington University, sports writer Lawrence Perry wrote: [...] "No athletic director and coach coulc by any possibility have more friends <b>pulling</b> <b>for</b> him than this former Yale backfield star whose character is so outstanding that no young men ever {{came in contact with}} him without being better for it." [...] In four years as head football coach (1928–1931), Sharpe's teams compiled a disappointing record of 11–18–4. [...] In 1932, Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Jimmy Conzelman replaced Sharpe as football coach, but Sharpe stayed on as the university's athletic director.|$|E
2500|$|Tytla did try {{to return}} to Disney. In a letter dated August 27, 1968, Disney {{productions}} vice president W.H. Anderson rejected his offer to do [...] "trial animation", saying, [...] "We really have only enough animation for our present staff." [...] And as late as October 11, 1968, {{less than three months}} before Tytla's death, Disney director Wolfgang Reitherman responded to story material Tytla submitted explaining [...] "...I'm sorry to say that your story ideas don't fit into our present program.. We have not forgotten that you are anxious to animate here at the studio, but...So far, we can just barely keep our present crew of animators busy...rest assured you have many friends here at the studio who are <b>pulling</b> <b>for</b> you." ...|$|E

On April 8, 1630, Winthrop departed from the Isle of Wight, England on the ship Arbella, arriving in Salem in June where he was met by John Endecott, the first governor of the colony. [...] John Winthrop served as governor for twelve of the colony's first twenty years of existence. It was he who decided to base the colony at the Shawmut Peninsula, where he and other colonists founded {{what is now the}} City of Boston.|$|E
2500|$|Gilligan {{has said}} it has been {{difficult}} to write for Walter White because the character is so dark and morally questionable: [...] "I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore." [...] As the series progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of Breaking Bad made Walter more and more unsympathetic. Gilligan said: [...] "He's going from being a protagonist to an antagonist. We want to make people question who they're <b>pulling</b> <b>for,</b> and why." [...] Cranston said by the fourth season: [...] "I think Walt's figured out it's better to be a pursuer than the pursued. He's {{well on his way to}} badass." [...] Regarding White's fate in the series ending, Cranston foresaw it as [...] "ugly [...] redemption", although earlier, Gilligan divulged his plans to [...] "end on a high note, in a way that will satisfy everyone".|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{had told}} Billboard {{that he had}} been {{lobbying}} for the Miracles since his own induction, [...] "making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it." [...] Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, [...] "I don't really even care about that. I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. We were one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy." [...] Claudette Robinson stated, [...] "When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? I was surprised by that. I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's {{a lot of people that}} were really <b>pulling</b> <b>for</b> us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that." [...] However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.|$|E
