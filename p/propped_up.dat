Some leaves are very thin, almost needle-like (S. affine), while others are short, stubby, and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme).

5|$|Following his {{military}} service {{and return to}} Winchester in 1779, White studied jurisprudence under his uncle, Alexander White, {{one of the most}} preeminent lawyers practicing in the Shenandoah Valley. During the course of his four years of law studies, White read the legal treatises of William Blackstone and Edward Coke among others while lying on his back or <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> on a couch recovering from his injuries. White was admitted to practice law at Winchester in December 1782, after which he engaged in the practice of law for eleven years.|$|E
5|$|During the interwar {{period of}} the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist {{historian}} Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed {{that it was a}} subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.|$|E

It is seen again in the ninth chapter where the main family unit of the novel bring in the character of the foundling who is found <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> against it.

25|$|Strauss {{continues}} his captaincy with the limited overs team. He performed less {{well in the}} one-off Twenty20 International, falling for a duck while Pakistan soared to victory with two overs to spare and his luck remained {{the same as the}} One Day series began. After two low scores he scored 50 in the third match though the team would still lose, however his 78 in the fourth match <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> an eight wicket win and a top score of 35 earned England a 2–2 draw in the series. The following month England returned to the sub-continent for the Champions Trophy in India. Strauss scored two half centuries in three matches but the team as a whole played disastrously with only one victory over the West Indies.|$|E

25|$|De Forest {{eventually}} came {{into conflict with}} his company's management. His main complaint was the limited support he got for conducting research, while company officials were upset with de Forest's inability to develop a practical receiver free of patent infringement. (This problem was finally resolved with {{the invention of the}} carborundum crystal detector by another company employee, General H. H. Dunworthy). On November 28, 1906, in exchange for $1000 (half of which was claimed by an attorney) and the rights to some early Audion detector patents, de Forest turned in his stock and resigned from the company that bore his name. American DeForest was then reorganized as the United Wireless Telegraph Company, and would be the dominant U.S. radio communications firm, albeit <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> by massive stock fraud, until its bankruptcy in 1912.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is from the}} south through massive but open teak doors ornately carved with floral designs, scrolls, and Deva Nats. It is a covered approach or saungdan as in most Burmese pagodas with frescoes under the roof. Between the rows of stone-inscription stupas grow mature star flower trees (Mimusops elengi) that emanate a jasmine-like fragrance to the entire complex. Burmese families may be seen having a picnic in the cool shade under these trees, picking the flowers to make star flower chains for the Buddha or to wear in their hair, or the children playing hide and seek among the rows of stupas. On the southwest inner terrace is one very old tree believed to be 250 years old, its low spreading boughs <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> by supports.|$|E
25|$|The {{second and}} more serious problem, {{unacknowledged}} by bank management, the financial regulator and the Irish government, is solvency. The question concerning solvency has arisen due to domestic {{problems in the}} crashing Irish property market. AIB, like most Irish financial institutions, has substantial exposure to property developers in their loan portfolio. These property developers are currently suffering from gross over-supply of property, much still unsold, while demand has evaporated. The massive immigration from Eastern Europe which had <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> demand has now reversed due to rapidly rising unemployment in Ireland. Irish property developers own speculated billions of euros of overvalued land parcels such as urban brownfield and greenfield sites, and also agricultural land at an average value of €23,600 per acre (US$32,000 per acre or €60,000 per hectare) which is several multiples above the value of equivalent land in other European countries.|$|E

25|$|On September 6, Garfield {{was taken}} to the Jersey Shore to escape the Washington heat, in the vain hope that the fresh air and quiet there might aid his recovery. Garfield was <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> in bed before a window {{with a view of the}} beach and ocean. New infections set in, as well as spasms of angina. He died of a {{ruptured}} splenic artery aneurysm, following blood poisoning and bronchial pneumonia, at 10:35pm on Monday, September 19, 1881, in Elberon, New Jersey. Garfield died two months before his 50th birthday; he and John F. Kennedy are the only two Presidents who died before age 50. During the 79 days between his shooting and death, Garfield's only official act was to sign a request for the extradition of a forger who had escaped, and was apprehended after he fled to Canada.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} home {{series against}} India saw Cook continue his fine Test form despite England not winning a Test. He {{was the third}} highest scoring Englishman {{with an average of}} 37. In the first Test, Cook made scores of 36 and 17 as the match ended in a draw. During {{the first day of the}} second Test at Trent Bridge, Cook became the youngest English player to rack up 1,500 Test runs eclipsing the record held by David Gower. In the first innings of the third Test, Cook made his biggest score of the series, 61 and followed this up with 43 in the second innings to help England secure a draw. Cook played in six of the seven ensuing one-day matches, scoring his maiden ODI century in the first match alongside Ian Bell's 126 not out guiding England to a 104 win victory that <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> England's first one-day series victory since 2005. After two ducks, Cook was dropped in the final, decisive match.|$|E
25|$|The sixth test {{match at}} the University of Otago Oval was contested between New Zealand and the West Indies from December 3 to 7 2013. West Indies won the toss and chose to bowl first. A classy batting display from Ross Taylor and Brendon McCullum <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> New Zealand's first innings. Taylor scored his maiden double century and was unbeaten on 217 when New Zealand {{declared}} for 609 for 9. West Indies was bowled {{out in the}} first innings for 213 and was forced to follow on but Darren Bravo scored his maiden double century in reply which led them to a safe score of 507. Chasing a target of 112 on day 5, New Zealand's top order crumbled against West Indian spinner Shane Shillingford and they were reduced to 44 for 4 but was lifted up by Taylor and Corey Anderson to 79 for 4, 33 runs away from victory before rain forced an early draw.|$|E
