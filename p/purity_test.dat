5000|$|The Hacker <b>Purity</b> <b>Test</b> or Hacker Test is [...] "a {{compendium}} {{of fact and}} folklore about computer hackerdom cunningly disguised as a test". It was written by Felix Lee, John Hayes, and Angela Thomas on June 16, 1989. It explains the typical skills and experiences {{of a person who}} considered himself to be a hacker at the time. It {{is considered to be a}} <b>purity</b> <b>test</b> by many.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the best-known}} purity tests is The Unisex <b>Purity</b> <b>Test</b> (or, simply, the <b>Purity</b> <b>Test).</b> First written {{sometime}} before 1980 in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Baker House, the first incarnation had two parallel versions, 100 questions each; one for male, and one for female. The next iteration (247 questions, written at Carnegie Mellon University in the Spring of 1983) heralded the merging of the gendered versions, making it actually unisex. Over the next decade or so, many re-writes and expansions commenced, a 2000-question version being written in the Fall of 1995. In more recent times, versions of the classic Test {{have been developed for}} new platforms, such as a <b>Purity</b> <b>Test</b> for the iPhone and as a Facebook application.|$|E
5000|$|Many popular purity tests {{encourage}} {{participation in}} a social situation (one person reading a <b>purity</b> <b>test</b> aloud while others mark down their [...] "yeses" [...] for later tabulation).

5000|$|Most <b>purity</b> <b>tests</b> have {{possible}} scores {{anywhere from}} 0% to 100%. <b>Purity</b> <b>tests</b> ask numerous personal questions of their users, most commonly {{about the use}} of alcohol and illicit substances; sexual acts with members of the opposite or same sex; other illicit or illegal activities, and the above actions in an odd or [...] "kinky" [...] context. These tests typically have anywhere from 50 to 2000 questions.|$|R

50|$|A <b>purity</b> <b>test</b> is a self-graded {{survey that}} assesses the participants' {{supposed}} degree of innocence in worldly matters (sex, drugs, deceit, {{and other activities}} assumed to be vices), generally on a percentage scale with 100% being the most and 0% being the least pure. Online purity tests were among the earliest of Internet memes, popular on Usenet {{beginning in the early}} 1980s.

Meg goes over to her friends, {{one of whom is}} Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn), and they talk about a popular <b>purity</b> <b>test.</b> Later, Veronica and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) are hanging out, and Wallace's mom, Alicia (Erica Gimpel) {{eventually}} barges in and berates him privately for being friends with Veronica. Veronica finds a website where she can look up the results of anyone's <b>purity</b> <b>test.</b> There is chaos at school the next day after someone makes the results of the test public. Veronica then tells Meg that she will find the person who made the test public. The next day, Veronica meets Mac (Tina Majorino) when she needs help with a computer problem.

Later that day, Veronica meets Meg, who tells her that she is being harassed. It turns out that Meg's sister actually created and published a test specifically for her.|$|E

The Lebensborn program provided a place where pregnant mothers could have their babies out of wedlock in secret.Only the most [...] "pure" [...] of its applicants were chosen to join its programs. Of all the women who applied, only 40 percent passed the racial <b>purity</b> <b>test</b> (they had to show their family tree three generations back) and were granted admission to the Lebensborn program.

She blames another student, Pam (Shanna Collins), for Veronica's cyberbullying. Later, Meg thanks Veronica. Veronica talks to Duncan and says that the email was fake. However, he jokingly responds, indicating a possible new emotional connection between the two. Mrs. Fennel visits Keith and thanks him, also indicating that they will allow their children to still be friends. Veronica visits Abel Koontz.

As of 2015, John Burnet has its own official poem titled Ode to an Elderly Athollite, provided in every room and recited on special occasions.
