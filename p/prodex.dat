Part I of this work described the models of the UVIS channel; in this second part, we present the optical models representing the two IR channels, SO (Solar Occultation) and LNO (Limb, Nadir and Occultation), and use them to determine signal to noise ratios (SNRs) for many expected observational cases. In solar occultation mode, both the SO and LNO channel exhibit very high SNRs > 5000. SNRs of around 100 were found for the LNO channel in nadir mode, depending on the atmospheric conditions, Martian surface properties, and observation geometry.

Additionally, SSSBs are being investigated in the context of impact risks for the Earth, space situational awareness and their possible industrial exploitation (asteroid mining). In all these aspects, the knowledge of the geophysical characteristics of SSSB surface and internal structure are of great importance. Given their size, constitution, and the evidence that many SSSBs are not simple monoliths, these bodies should be studied and modelled as self-gravitating granular systems in general, or as granular systems in micro-gravity environments in particular contexts.

We used asteroseismology to measure a large obliquity for Kepler- 56, a red giant star hosting two transiting coplanar planets. These observations show that spin-orbit misalignments are not confined to hot-Jupiter systems.

For decades it has been postulated that the vestibular organ can prevent a drop in pressure during a position change-supposedly mediated by reflexes to the cardiovascular system. We show-for the first time-a significant correlation between decreased functionality of the vestibular otolith system and a decrease in the mean arterial pressure when a person stands up. Until now, no experiments on Earth could selectively suppress both otolith systems; astronauts returning from space are a unique group of subjects in this regard. Their otolith systems are being temporarily disturbed {{and at the same time}} they often suffer from blood pressure instability. In our study, we observed the functioning of both the otolith and the cardiovascular system of the astronauts before and after spaceflight.

40|$|Delirium is a neurobehavioural {{disturbance}} {{that frequently}} develops {{particularly in the}} intensive care unit (ICU) population. It was first described more than half a century ago, where it was already discovered as a state that might come along with serious complications such as prolonged ICU and hospital stay, reduced quality of life and increased mortality. However, in most cases, there is still lack of proof for causal relationship. Its presence frequently remains unrecognised due to suggested predominance of the hypoactive form. Furthermore, in the general ICU population, it has been shown that the duration of delirium is associated with worse long-term cognitive function. Due to the multifactorial origin of delirium, we have several but no incontestable treatment options. Nonetheless, delirium bears a high burden for patient, family members and the medical care team. The Basel <b>ProDex</b> Study targets improvement of hyperactive and mixed delirium therapy in critically ill patients. We will focus on reducing the duration and severity of delirium by implementing dexmedetomidine into the treatment plan. Dexmedetomidine compared with other sedatives shows fewer side effects representing a better risk profile for delirium treatment in general. This could further contribute to higher patient safety. The aim of the BaProDex Trial is to assess the superiority of dexmedetomidine to propofol for treatment of hyperactive and mixed delirium in the ICU. We hypothesise that dexmedetomidine, compared with propofol administered at night, shortens both the duration and severity of delirium.; The Basel <b>ProDex</b> Study is an investigator-initiated, one-institutional, two-centre randomised controlled clinical trial for the treatment of delirium with dexmedetomidine versus propofol in 316 critically ill patients suffering from hyperactive and mixed delirium. The primary outcome measure is delirium duration in hours. Secondary outcomes include delirium-free days at day 28, death at day 28, delirium severity, amount of ventilator days, amount of rescue sedation with haloperidol, length of ICU and hospital stay, and pharmaceutical economic analysis of the treatments. Sample size was estimated to be able to show the superiority of dexmedetomidine compared with propofol regarding the duration of delirium in hours. The trial will be externally monitored according to good clinical practice (GCP) requirements. There are no interim analyses planned for this trial.; This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization- Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) or Europäische Norm International Organization for Standardization (ISO EN 14155; as far as applicable) as well as all national legal and regulatory requirements.

Additional support was provided by the Leverhulme Trust to E. R. Priest. We explain two puzzling aspects of Petschek's model for fast reconnection. One is its failure to occur in plasma simulations with uniform resistivity. The other is its inability to provide anything more than an upper limit for the reconnection rate. We have found that previously published analytical solutions based on Petschek's model are structurally unstable if the electrical resistivity is uniform. The structural instability is associated with the presence of an essential singularity at the X-line that is unphysical. By requiring that such a singularity does not exist, we obtain a formula that predicts a specific rate of reconnection. For uniform resistivity, reconnection can only occur at the slow, Sweet-Parker rate. For nonuniform resistivity, reconnection can occur at a much faster rate provided that the resistivity profile is not too flat near the X-line. If this condition is satisfied, then the scale length of the nonuniformity determines the reconnection rate. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E

The observed color ratios indicate that the characteristic energy of the assumed initial Maxwellian distribution ranges between 17 and 40 keV. A clear signature of acetylene is observed near the absorption peaks at 1520, 1480 and 1440 { Angstroms}. The C_ 2 H_ 2 column overlying the emission peak varies from 0. 02 to 0. 2 of the methane column. A better fit is obtained for some spectra when ethane absorption is added. The changing mixing ratios relative to methane are attributed to perturbations by heat released by the fast electron thermalization and/or perturbations to the hydrocarbon chemistry resulting from the production of H atoms by the aurora. A spectrum of the Io magnetic footprint and its trailing tail shows ultraviolet color and hydrocarbon absorption charateristics quite similar to some of the main oval spectra. This observation implies that the electrons of the Io flux tube are energized to a few tens of keV, similar to the electron precipitated in the main ovals and polar caps. Echelle spectra between 1216 and 1220 { Angstroms} at 0. 07 { Angstroms} resolution are also compared with the model best fitting the closely spaced in time mid-resolution spectrum. It is found that the effective H_ 2 rovibrational temperature associated with the Echelle spectra is significantly higher than predicted by the model. A steep temperature gradient near the methane homopause due to large heating by auroral precipitation is a plausible explanation for this difference.

Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha- 2 receptor agonist, member of theraputical cathegory: “other hypnotics and sedatives” (ATC: N 05 CM 18). Dexmedetomidine is recommended for the sedation of adult ICU patients who need a sedation level not deeper than arousal in response to verbal stimulation (corresponding to Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale 0 to - 3). After the EMA approval, some European government authorities have elaborated HTA on dexmedetomidine, based on clinical evidence derived from <b>Prodex</b> and Midex trials. Dexmedetomidine resulted to be as effective as propofol and midazolam in maintaining the target depth of sedation in ICU patients. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation with dexmedetomidine was numerically shorter than with propofol and significantly shorter than with midazolam. The resulting favourable economic profile of dexmedetomidine supported the clinical use in ICU. Dexmedetomidine seems to provide clinical benefits due to the reduction of mechanical ventilation and ventilator weaning duration. Within the present review, an economic analysis of costs associated to the use of dexmedetomidine was therefore performed also in the Italian care setting. Thus, four different analyses were carried out based on the quantification {{of the total number of}} days in ICU, the time spent on mechanical ventilation, the weighted average number of days with mechanical ventilation or not and TISS points (Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System). Despite the incremental cost for drug therapy associated with dexmedetomidine, a reduction of the management costs for ICU has been estimated, with savings ranging between € 800 and € 1, 400 per patient.

We present the analysis of 26 nights of V and I time-series observations from 2011 and 2012 of the globular cluster M 30 (NGC 7099). We used our data to search for variable stars in this cluster and refine the periods of known variables; we then used our variable star light curves to derive values for the cluster's parameters. Methods. We used difference image analysis to reduce our data to obtain high-precision light curves of variable stars. We then estimated the cluster parameters by performing a Fourier decomposition of the light curves of RR Lyrae stars for which a good period estimate was possible. We also derive an estimate for the age of the cluster by fitting theoretical isochrones to our colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). Results. Out of 13 stars previously catalogued as variables, we find that only 4 are bona fide variables. We detect two new RR Lyrae variables, and confirm two additional RR Lyrae candidates from the literature. We also detect four other new variables, including an eclipsing blue straggler system, and an SX Phoenicis star. This amounts to a total number of confirmed variable stars in M 30 of 12. We perform Fourier decomposition of the light curves of the RR Lyrae stars to derive cluster parameters using empirical relations. We find a cluster metallicity [Fe/H]ZW = − 2. 01  ±  0. 04, or [Fe/H]UVES = − 2. 11  ±  0. 06, and a distance of 8. 32  ±  0. 20 kpc (using RR 0 variables), 8. 10 kpc (using one RR 1 variable), and 8. 35 ± 0. 42 kpc (using our SX Phoenicis star detection in M 30). Fitting isochrones to the CMD, we estimate an age of 13. 0 ± 1. 0 Gyr for M 30. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Neutral atom imaging of the {{interstellar}} gas {{flow in the}} inner heliosphere provides the most detailed information on physical conditions of the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) and its interaction with the heliosphere. The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) measured neutral H, He, O, and Ne for three years. We compare the He and combined O+Ne flow distributions for two interstellar flow passages in 2009 and 2010 with an analytical calculation, which is simplified because the IBEX orientation provides observations at almost exactly the perihelion of the gas trajectories. This method allows separate determination of the key ISM parameters: inflow speed, longitude, and latitude, as well as temperature. A combined optimization, as in complementary approaches, is thus not necessary. Based on the observed peak position and width in longitude and latitude, inflow speed, latitude, and temperature are found {{as a function of}} inflow longitude. The latter is then constrained by the variation of the observed flow latitude as a function of observer longitude and by the ratio of the widths of the distribution in longitude and latitude. Identical results are found for 2009 and 2010 : an He flow vector somewhat outside previous determinations (λ[subscript ISM∞] = 79 [° over. ] 0 + 3 [° over. ] 0 (– 3 [° over. ] 5), β [subscript ISM∞] = – 4 [° over. ] 9 ± 0 [° over. ] 2, V [subscript ISM∞] = 23. 5 + 3. 0 (– 2. 0) km s[superscript – 1], T [subscript He] = 5000 - 8200 K), suggesting a larger inflow longitude and lower speed. The O+Ne temperature range, T [subscript O+Ne] = 5300 - 9000 K, is found to be close to the upper range for He and consistent with an isothermal medium for all species within current uncertainties.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Dexmedetomidine {{was shown}} in two European {{randomized}} double-blind double-dummy trials (<b>PRODEX</b> and MIDEX) to be non-inferior to propofol and midazolam in maintaining target sedation levels in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Additionally, dexmedetomidine shortened the time to extubation versus both standard sedatives, suggesting that it may reduce ICU resource needs and thus lower ICU costs. Considering resource utilization data from these two trials, we performed a secondary, cost-minimization analysis assessing the economics of dexmedetomidine versus standard care sedation. METHODS The total ICU costs associated with each study sedative were calculated {{on the basis of}} total study sedative consumption and the number of days patients remained intubated, required non-invasive ventilation, or required ICU care without mechanical ventilation. The daily unit costs for these three consecutive ICU periods were set to decline toward discharge, reflecting the observed reduction in mean daily Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) points between the periods. A number of additional sensitivity analyses were performed, including one in which the total ICU costs were based on the cumulative sum of daily TISS points over the ICU period, and two further scenarios, with declining direct variable daily costs only. RESULTS Based on pooled data from both trials, sedation with dexmedetomidine resulted in lower total ICU costs than using the standard sedatives, with a difference of € 2, 656 in the median (interquartile range) total ICU costs-€ 11, 864 (€ 7, 070 to € 23, 457) versus € 14, 520 (€ 7, 871 to € 26, 254) -and € 1, 649 in the mean total ICU costs. The median (mean) total ICU costs with dexmedetomidine compared with those of propofol or midazolam were € 1, 292 (€ 747) and € 3, 573 (€ 2, 536) lower, respectively. The result was robust, indicating lower costs with dexmedetomidine in all sensitivity analyses, including those in which only direct variable ICU costs were considered. The likelihood of dexmedetomidine resulting in lower total ICU costs compared with pooled standard care was 91. 0...|$|E

The radial velocity values provided have been used to assign cluster membership probabilities by means of a single-variable parametric analysis. These membership probabilities are compared to the results of the photometric membership assignment of NGC 3293, based on UBVRI photometry. The agreement of the photometric and kinematic member samples amounts to 65 per cent, and could increase to 70 per cent as suggested by the analysis of the differences between both samples. A number of photometric PMS candidate members of spectral type F are found, which are confirmed by the results from VPHAS photometry and SED fitting for the stars in common with VPHAS and GES data sets. Excesses at mid- and near-infrared wavelengths, and signs of H alpha emission, are investigated for them. Marginal presence of H alpha emission or infilling is detected for the candidate members. Several of them exhibit moderate signs of U excess and weak excesses at mid-IR wavelengths. We suggest that these features originate from accretion discs in their last stages of evolution.

The Hubble observations {{are available from the}} STScI website. The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of teams involved in the Wind spacecraft mission, NASA. The Wind/WAVES data are available through CDAWeb. We present Jovian auroral observations from the 2014 January Hubble Space Telescope (HST) campaign and investigate the auroral signatures of radial transport in the magnetosphere alongside contemporaneous radio and Hisaki EUV data. HST FUV auroral observations on day 011 show, for the first time, a significantly super-rotating polar spot poleward of the main emission on the dawnside. The spot transitions from the polar to main emission region {{in the presence of a}} locally broad, bright dawnside main emission feature and two large equatorward emission features. Such a configuration of the main emission region is also unreported to date. We interpret the signatures as part of a sequence of inward radial transport processes. Hot plasma inflows from tail reconnection are thought to flow planetward and could generate the super-rotating spot. The main emission feature could be the result of flow shears from prior hot inflows. Equatorward emissions are observed. These are evidence of hot plasma injections in the inner magnetosphere. The images are thought to be part of a prolonged period of reconnection. Radio emissions measured by WIND suggest that hectometric (HOM) and non-Io decametric (DAM) signatures are associated with the sequence of auroral signatures, which implies a global magnetospheric disturbance. The reconnection and injection interval can continue for several hours. R. L. G. was supported by a STFC studentship. S. V.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{modeling of}} processes involving moving contact lines, such sessile droplet evapo- ration, nucleate boiling or imbibition in capillary structures, still faces considerable difficulties nowadays. This stems {{not only from}} the well-known viscous singularity induced by contact line motion, but also from other singularities associated with evaporation or condensation processes. Direct numerical simulation at a macroscopic scale generally fails in the vicinity of contact lines, where the rates of viscous dissipation and of heat/mass transfer can become extremely high. It is therefore necessary to build analytical (or semi-analytical) models describing the so-called microstructure of the contact line, i. e. the detailed shape of the liquid/vapor interface in the direct vicinity of the rigid wall. These microstructure models have to incorporate the rele- vant microscale effects, which hopefully enables regularization of the contact line singularities, thereby yielding a finite force exerted on the substrate, as well as a finite rate of phase change. In this presentation, we highlight recent progresses in this direction, focusing on the role of disjoining (Derjaguin) pressure, {{as well as on the}} Kelvin effect (dependence of saturation con- ditions on the curvature of the liquid/vapor interface). No other small-scale regularization mechanism (such as slip, diffuse interfaces,) is considered. Consideration is limited to pure apolar liquids in contact with their pure vapor, on a flat homogeneous substrate. Within the lubrication approximation (small slope of the liquid/vapor interface relative to the substrate), it is first shown that a Cox-Voinov solution is generally valid at scales intermediate between the macroscopic (outer) and the microscopic (inner) scales, provided the rate of phase change decreases sufficiently fast with film thickness (which is generally the case). This well- known relationship expresses the apparent slope of the liquid/vapor interface as a function of the contact line velocity, and can therefore be used as an effective boundary condition in macroscopic codes. Yet, this law contains two parameters that first need to be calculated by proper asymptotic matching with the inner scale region: the apparent contact angle of the motionless microstructure, and a microlength entering the logarithmic (motion-induced) term. This matching is here accomplished in quite a variety of situations [1]: complete or partial wetting, non-volatile or volatile case, with or without kinetic effects, Importantly, depending on the disjoining pressure isotherm characterizing the considered fluid/solid pair, some microstructures are found to be associated with an extended microfilm covering the substrate ahead of the contact line (sometimes called precursor or adsorbed film), while some other kinds of microstructures are truncated, i. e. there is a point beyond which the surface may be considered as bare [2]. In particular, a minimalist model based on the Kelvin effect alone (without disjoining pressure) [3] is also described, and is shown to admit solutions with truncated microfilms while fully escaping both viscous and phase change singularities. This stems from a generic mechanism where the curvature of the liquid/vapor interface in the inner region self-adjusts to contact line motion in such a way that the liquid always has vanish- ing velocity at contact with the substrate (while the interface moves by Kelvin-effect-induced evaporation or condensation). Another important feature emphasized in the present talk is the occurrence of finite evaporation-induced contact angles, even for completely wetting situations and negligible con- tact line velocity. Such non-vanishing angles are due to intense microflows and corresponding stresses induced in the microregion, and are parametrically calculated as a function of the gov- erning dimensionless parameters of the problem (see also the recent book chapter [4]). Finally, some interferometric measurements of the apparent contact angles of sessile droplets of various HFEs evaporating into ambient air are presented, and shown to compare satisfactorily with a disjoining-pressure-based model appropriately modified to account for evaporation into an inert gas such as air.

40|$|Motivations {{for space}} {{activities}} started in 1958 : {{it was then}} a small laboratory of Institute of Astrophysics of Liege (IAL). In 1962, {{under the name of}} IAL-Space, it began real space activities observing the auroras in ultraviolet by sending around twenty sounding rockets, launched mostly from the base of Kiruna (Sweden). IAL-Space was finally recognized in 1975 as a coordinated test installation of the European Space Agency. It moved to Sart Tilman in 1984 to reach more spacious buildings. Subsequently IAL-Space got the status Research Center in 1988, it became a <b>PRODEX</b> Institute and changed its name to CSL in 1992. Lately it has further expanded with the commissioning of a new test facilities like FOCAL 3, FOCAL XXL, enabling to perform tests in the infrared range. Centre spatial de Liège is now a research Centre dedicated to space instrumentation including environmental test facilities and high level laboratories. It works for the European Space Agency (ESA), for the space industry and for regional industries. From the beginning of its more than 50 years long history, CSL develops, assembles, calibrates and/or tests observation instruments and relevant sub-systems capable to operate in a harsh environment, in order to serve the demands of the space science. Space Systems Program focuses its effort to incorporate CSL into the teams dedicated for definition, design, integration and/or ground and in flight calibration of scientific payload missions, mainly under the final authority of the most prestigious Space Agencies (ESA, NASA, JAXA, CNES, BELSPO, …). Today, more than 15 complex pieces of CSL technology have been launched in space, all of them operating nominally. Some of the most significant instruments made by CSL are: S 2 / S 68 telescope on TD 1 /ESRO, Halley Multicolor Camera (HMC/GIOTTO), FOC (HST), EIT solar telescope (SOHO), HI (STEREO), SWAP (PROBA 2), optical monitors with OM (Newton), OMC (INTEGRAL) and various contributions on PACS (Herschel), MIRI (JWST), UVS (JUNO) and COROT. In 2011, this strong heritage allows CSL to be awarded with the Extreme UV Imager (EUI) PIship of Solar Orbiter (ESA M 1 science mission). For the Future, CSL is involved in the L 1 JUICE, L 2 ATHENA, M 1 Solar Orbiter, M 2 EUCLID, M 3 PLATO, S 1 CHEOPS, S 2 SMILE ESA missions as well as the SPP, ICON NASA Missions.

The 43 GHz results have been published in a previous paper, and here we report the measurement of CMB polarization power spectra using the 95 GHz data. This data set comprises 5337 hr of observations recorded by an array of 84 polarized coherent receivers with a total array sensitivity of 87 mu K root s. Four low-foreground fields were observed, covering a total of similar to 1000 deg(2) with an effective angular resolution of 12. ' 8, allowing for constraints on primordial gravitational waves and high signal-to-noise measurements of the E-modes across three acoustic peaks. The data reduction was performed using two independent analysis pipelines, one based on a pseudo-C-l (PCL) cross-correlation approach, and the other on a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach. All data selection criteria and filters were modified until a predefined set of null tests had been satisfied before inspecting any non-null power spectrum. The results derived by the two pipelines are in good agreement. We characterize the EE, EB, and BB power spectra between l = 25 and 975 and find that the EE spectrum is consistent with Lambda CDM, while the BB power spectrum is consistent with zero. Based on these measurements, we constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to r = 1. 1 (- 0. 8) (+ 0. 9) (r < 2. 8 at 95 % C. L.) as derived by the ML pipeline, and r = 1. 2 (- 0. 8) (+ 0. 9) (r < 2. 7 at 95 % C. L.) as derived by the PCL pipeline. In one of the fields, we find a correlation with the dust component of the Planck Sky Model, though the corresponding excess power is small compared to statistical errors. Finally, we derive limits on all known systematic errors, and demonstrate that these correspond to a tensor-to-scalar ratio smaller than r = 0. 01, the lowest level yet reported in the literature.

Work on the sensor model has been carried out extensively {{within the framework of the}} European Metrology Research Program as part of the Metrology for Earth Observation and Climate (MetEOC and MetEOC 2). The focus has been to improve laboratory calibration procedures in order to reduce uncertainties, to establish an uncertainty budget for both laboratory calibration and in-flight cases, and to upgrade the sensor model to compensate for sensor specific biases. In this contribution we present the APEX traceability chain, which comprises various sources of uncertainty. These include the spectral and radiometric equipment of the calibration laboratory but more importantly also sensor model components that deal with artefacts caused by environmental changes and electronic features, namely (a) the impact of ambient air pressure changes on the radiometry in combination with dichroic coatings (Hueni et al., 2014), (b) influences of instrument baffle and optical base plate temperatures on the radiometry, (c) spectral smearing and binning effects of the Visible/Near-infrared detector, and (d) electronic anomalies causing radiometric biases in the four shortwave infrared detector readout blocks. The sensor model and its related uncertainties are the result of laboratory and in-flight experiments carried out over the course of several years. All calibration and characterisation data have been entered into a purpose built calibration information system (Hueni et al., 2013), comprising half a terrabyte of data at this stage. This contribution also includes a brief introduction to this system as it forms the information technology basis for all the work that has led to the end-to-end uncertainty model.
