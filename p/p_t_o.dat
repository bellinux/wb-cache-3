40|$|Hibernation in the Arctic ground Squirrel (AGS) is a regulated, {{adaptive}} {{response to}} arctic environmental conditions. Problem statement: Regional brain Blood Flow (rCBF) {{has been observed}} to increase dramatically during arousal in hibernators. However, the real time dynamic change in <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 during arousal has not been studied, we hypothesized that <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 is Interdependent of Tbrain and a key component in the arousal process. Approach: Simultaneous in vivo measurements of <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 and brain temperature (T brain) in conjunction with oxygen consumption (V 02) were conducted in the striatum of non-sedated, non-anesthetized Arctic ground squirrels during spontaneous arousal from hibernation. Results: A dramatic fluctuation of brain tissue oxygen partial pressure (<b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2) {{is associated with the}} complex phenomena of spontaneous arousal. In this study, we observed that: (1) a <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 elevation precedes changes in T brain and V 02; (2) <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 changes do not correlate with changes in V 02 during arousal and (3), endogenous O 2 shift from O 2 enriched blood to brain in hibernating AGS induces an arousal with the pharmaceutical chemical, efaproxiral (RSR- 13). Conclusion: The four turning points of <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 appearing at different T brain during arousal suggest that changes in <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 are Tbrain interdependent and support the concept that arousal from hibernation is complex process invoking different feedbacks...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} in two parts. The first part {{consists}} of chapters 1 - 4 {{and the second}} part is chapter 5. In the first part we consider the idea of approximating pieces of orbits by a single orbit. There are many examples of such properties (approximation property (A. P.) see chapter one, definitions 1. 2, 1. 4), (Specification property (S. P.),[24]), (pseudo orbit tracing property (<b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.)</b> [25] and definition 4. 1). In chapter one, we show that (A. P.) for a homeomorphism (flow) is equivalent to topological transitivity and density of periodic points and how this property (A. P.) is invariant under topological conjugacy. In theorem 1 we prove that an expansive homeomorphism which is topologically mixing and has <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> also has the S. P. In chapter two, theorem 2, we prove that the <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> for flows is invariant under topological conjugacy with preserved orientation (velocity changes). Also we prove in theorem 3 that the suspension flow [2] for a homeomorphism T:X → X has <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> if and only if <b>T</b> has the <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> In chapter three, we prove that an expansive flow which has the <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> is topologically stable (Theorem 4). In chapter four, the last theorem in this part is that every flow without fixed points on a compact manifold M which is topologically stable has the <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>P.</b> Then some important corollaries are deduced.

40|$|Arctic Ground Squirrels (AGS) are classic hibernators {{known for}} their {{tolerance}} to hypoxia. &# 13; AGS have been studied {{as a model of}} hypoxia with potential as a medical research model. Problem&# 13; statement: Their unique resistance to the stressors of low oxygen led us to hypothesize that AGS&# 13; might also be adaptable to hyperoxia. Approach: This study examined the physiological pattern&# 13; associated with hyperoxia in response to brain tissue oxygen partial pressure (<b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2), brain temperature&# 13; (T brain), global oxygen consumption (V O 2) and respiratory frequency (f R) using non-sedated and nonanesthetized&# 13; Arctic Ground Squirrels (AGS) and rats. Results: We found that 1) 100 % inspired&# 13; oxygen (F i O 2) increased the baseline values of brain <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 significantly in both summer euthermic AGS&# 13; (24. 4 ± 3. 6 - 87. 3 ± 3. 6 mmHg, n= 6) and in rats (18. 2 ± 5. 2 - 73. 3 ± 5. 2 mmHg, n = 3); <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 was&# 13; significantly higher in AGS than in rats during hyperoxic exposure; 2) hyperoxic exposure had no&# 13; effect on brain temperature in either AGS or rats, with the brain temperatures maintaining constancy&# 13; before, during and after 100 % O 2 exposure; 3) systemic metabolic rates increased significantly during&# 13; hyperoxic exposure in both euthermic AGS and rats; moreover, V O 2 were significantly lower in AGS&# 13; than in rats during hyperoxic exposure; 4) the respiratory rates for rats were maintained before, during&# 13; and after 100 % O 2 exposure, while the respiratory responding patterns to hyperoxic exposure changed&# 13; after exposure in AGS. AGS f R was significantly lower after hyperoxic exposure than before the&# 13; exposure. Conclusion: These results suggest that hyperoxic ventilation induced <b>P</b> <b>t</b> <b>O</b> 2 and V O 2 differences&# 13; between AGS and rats and led to altered respiratory patterns between these species.

Socialists took the Encyclical seriously, fearing its effect on English and Irish Catholic workers. They criticised the Pope's wholesale condemnation of Socialism, and his failure to distinguish between it and Communism; they believed that he was confused about the question of private property, and that his ideal picture of the small, peasant proprietor was totally irrelevant in modern industrialised societies like England. They contrasted the true religion of the poor preached by Jesus with the support which modern religion gave to capitalism and the rich.

Assessment was achieved through public opinion polls, BBC audience research, and the government's own Home Intelligence reports. Censorship was less severe on the press and books than on the radio, where every word broadcast was subject to censorship on grounds of both security and opinion. Propaganda was designed to encourage specific actions, to explain government policy, and to consolidate {{support for the war}} effort in general.
