The computed results of the pollutant diffusion around a typical Hong Kong high-rise building model (at a linear scale of 1 : 30), were found to show a similar trend to the outcomes of self-conducted experimental measurements that the pathways of <b>pollutant</b> <b>migration</b> for windward and leeward pollutant emission are different. For the case with windward pollutant emission at the 3 rd floor within a re-entry, the pollutant migrated downwards due to the downwash created by the wind. In contrast, for the case with leeward pollution emission, dispersion is dominated by intense turbulent mixing in the near wake and characterized by the upward migration of the pollutant in the leeward re-entry. The simulated results of haze-fog (HF) studies confirm that the pathway of <b>pollutant</b> <b>migration</b> is dominated by wind-structure interaction and buoyancy effect only plays a minor role in the dispersion process.

40|$|The risk to {{groundwater}} quality {{following a}} sub-surface spillage of immiscible pollutants such as oil, petroleum and other organic chemicals is an increasingly potent threat, through escalating industrial application of such pollutants. This study significantly enhances {{the understanding of}} the flow of immiscible pollutants within soil, through field scale investigations to define the spatial variability and extent of a contaminated area {{and the development of a}} comprehensive framework for the analysis of oil <b>pollutant</b> <b>migration.</b> This study represents a first attempt by researchers to analyse oil <b>pollutant</b> <b>migration</b> on a wide range of scales, from pore- to field-level. The research shows that quantity of pollutant is a critical factor in determining the extent of oil migration. Permeability and porosity of the sample material are also important secondary factors. High permeability assists the migration of oil pollutants. Soils with a high porosity allow the pollutant to migrate vertically under the influence of gravity, whereas soils with low porosity induce lateral oil migration, as the oil spreads from the point of injection. A Jull scale field study using contrasting soil types determines that oil migration is approximately symmetrical about the point of injection. Experimental data is used to establish modelling capabilities for the characterisation of <b>pollutant</b> <b>migration.</b> Modelling is undertaken at two levels.

40|$|AbstractHydrodynamic {{dispersion}} is {{a measure}} for describing the process of solute transport in porous media. Characterizing the dispersion of water flow within gravel {{is essential for the}} prediction of solute transport especially nonpoint source <b>pollutants</b> <b>migration</b> in alpine watersheds where the land surface is typically covered with gravel. In this study, an integrated model and experimental method using an electrolyte tracer is proposed for determination of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient. Two experimental scenarios were designed to measure electrolyte tracer transport processes in both free water flow and gravel layer flow under different slope gradients and transport distances. Subsequently, the measured data were used to simultaneously calculate both the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and flow velocity by fitting the experimental data with the mathematical model. Dispersivity, as a critical feature of hydrodynamic dispersion, was determined as well under the two specified scenarios. Finally, the impact mechanisms of the gravel layer and factors related to the dispersion processes were comprehensively analyzed. The results indicate that the presence of a gravel layer significantly reduces flow velocity and the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient, but increases solute dispersivity. For the flow within gravel layers, with much lower velocity, the positive effect of the gravel layer on dispersivity may be neutralized or even surpassed by the negative effect of flow velocity. The results should be helpful in characterizing the dispersion processes of water flow within gravel layer and hence in predicting solute transport, especially in nonpoint source <b>pollutants</b> <b>migration</b> in alpine watersheds where the land surface is richly covered with gravel...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} concentrations {{and migration}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) in ten mixed-use buildings in southeast Michigan, USA. In an office and work zone in each building, air exchange rates (AERs) were measured using perfluorocarbon tracers, and over 96 VOC species were measured by GC/MS over a 7 -day period. VOCs were then apportioned to sources in offices, work zones, and outdoors using a two-zone mass balance model. AERs averaged 3. 9 [*]h (0. 2 – 14. 2 [*]h) in offices and 1. 9 [*]h (0. 4 – 3. 5 [*]h) in work zones. The dominant VOCs included aromatics, terpenes and alkanes. VOC concentrations were uniform in the smaller spaces, and more variable {{in some of the}} very large spaces. Apportionments depended on the VOC and building, but emissions in industrial zones of buildings often migrated to office areas where they frequently accounted for the bulk of VOC concentrations. Outdoor sources accounted for most benzene and carbon tetrachloride, and a small fraction of aromatic and aliphatic compounds. This study shows that <b>pollutant</b> <b>migration</b> can be a significant and not uncommon problem in mixed-use buildings, and it demonstrates the need for better control of emissions and <b>pollutant</b> <b>migration.</b> Pollutant exposures in industrial, commercial, and institutional buildings arise from indoor and outdoor sources that can be identified, apportioned, and controlled with knowledge of emission sources and building airflows. We show that multi-tracer techniques are an effective and practical means of determining airflows and exchange rates in large buildings. In examining a set of mixed-use buildings, a substantial fraction of VOC exposures in otherwise relatively ‘clean’ offices is due to <b>pollutant</b> <b>migration</b> from ‘dirty’ zones of the building. This indicates the need for corrective actions to minimize exposures of office workers that are unwanted and probably unknown to building managers. These actions should include better control of emissions, isolation or control of air and pollutant flows between building zones, and documentation of the effectiveness of such measures when strong emission sources are present...|$|E

Persistent organic {{pollutants}} such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the pesticide DDT, known to harm wildlife, {{have been shown}} to reach pristine Subarctic and Arctic areas by global atmospheric transport.

40|$|Flow and {{reactive}} transport of fluids in porous media are {{observed in a}} wide variety of fields and applications such as hydrology, contaminated site remediation and petroleum engineering. Concerning the environmental issues, fate and transport of dissolved contaminants in natural porous media is a fundamental aspect to understand <b>pollutants</b> <b>migration</b> in groundwater and to identify the most appropriate technologies to remove these compounds from subsurface (i. e. the vadose zone and the groundwater). The traditional approach used to study the motion of fluids (single or multi-phase) and transport of dissolved substances within porous media is based on a macroscopic representation, founded on the continuum hypothesis (Bear, 1972). At this scale, pore-scale effects are embedded into the model through a set of constitutive equations such as the phenomenological Darcy’s law for flow in saturated porous media (Hubbert, 1956; Bear, 1972), Richard’s equation in variable saturated media (Richards, 1931; Van Genuchten, 1980) and the advection-dispersion equation for solute transport (Bear, 1972). When the continuum description breaks down, the need to investigate a more detailed scale as the pore-scale brings to use the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) and the advection-diffusion (and reaction) equation (ADE), able to capture microscopic-scale gradients in concentration resulting from transport and a non-uniform distribution of reactive material (Steefel et al., 2005; Blunt et al., 2013). Pore-scale modeling has developed rapidly over the last decades, thanks to the development of both direct 3 D imaging of the pore space and faster and more efficiency computing tools. It can be used to predict macroscopic properties of porous media that are difficult to obtain experimentally and provides the opportunity to investigate phenomena impossible to be obtained by laboratory experiments for single and multi-phase fluids. In the framework of pore-scale modeling, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is able to solve the NSE for incompressible fluids and ADE in porous media, which is emerged over the last decades as an alternative approach for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (Chen and Doolen, 1998; Succi, 2001; Aidun and Clausen, 2010). Unlike the conventional CFD schemes based on discretization of macroscopic continuum equations, the LBM is based on microscopic models and mesoscopic kinetic equation. The main features are the relatively ease to code, versatility to model different process, handle complex boundary conditions and its efficiency for parallel platforms (Latt, 2009, Coon et al., 2014). For the above-mentioned reasons, the goal of my research is the study of pore-scale effects on different flow and transport processes, which have a close relationship with contaminant dynamics at a macroscopic scale (i. e. laboratory and field scale). Each of these processes is addressed in the following chapters of the thesis. The thesis consists of a collection of scientific papers, except for the first chapter, submitted to or already published in international journals and is organized as follows. In chapter I, the basics of the LB algorithm are introduced. The numerical schemes for the simulation of fluid flow and transport process of a concentration field are described. In chapter II, the effects of the pore spatial distribution on seepage velocity through numerical simulations of 3 D fluid flow performed by the lattice Boltzmann method are investigated. The goal of this work is to evaluate the sensitivity of the flow, through the seepage velocity, inside a porous medium to the spatial distribution of the pores size and to address the uncertainty associated to the sample size and resolution. To this scope, we generate 3 D porous media using a geostatistical method based on random spatially correlated fields applied at the pore-scale (typically from tens to hundreds μm). The use of 3 D domains allows handling porous media with realistic porosity compared to 2 D structures. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the macroscopic velocity is carried out in relation to two semi-variograms models (or correlation functions) and different spatial resolutions. In Chapter III, the impact of heterogeneity through pore-scale flux and transport LBM simulations are carried out. One of the effects that heterogeneities produce in the framework of contaminated sites remediation is associated with the retention of pollutants in the finest (or less mobile for an effective transport) regions of the porous media, where contaminants are released by diffusion to more mobile zones after the concentration in the latter is significantly reduced because of efficient transport. Despite its microscopic nature, it may have important implications for macroscale pollutants transport. The process of mass transfer from low to high mobility regions at the back end of a contaminant plume has referred to back diffusion (also defined as matrix diffusion). The main question that we address in this study is the extent to which spatial heterogeneities in the structure (porosity and permeability) of the host porous medium influences the rate of migration of dissolved species (e. g. contaminants). Chapter IV is dedicated to {{reactive transport}} at the pore-scale. A lattice Boltzmann model is developed for surface reaction taking place at the interface between solid-fluids and multiphase fluids (Di Palma et al., 2015). The phase-field approach is used to identify the interface and its orientation, the concentration of reactant at the interface is then calculated iteratively to impose the correct reactive flux condition. The main advantages of the model is that interfaces are considered part of the bulk dynamics and the reactive scheme is introduced in the classical LBM algorithm; as a consequence, the model’s implementation and performance is independent of the interface geometry and orientation. Results obtained with the developed model are compared to analytical solution for three different benchmark tests...|$|R

On the basis of the results obtained, the magnitude of variability in <b>pollutant</b> <b>migration</b> and changes in concentration, as well as efficiency of the vertical barrier were assessed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{transport}} relationships for porous media, chemical dispersivity is {{an important}} parameter for estimation of <b>pollutant</b> <b>migration.</b> This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of scale on dispersivity for homogeneous media and fractal media. The approach used to estimate scale was transport distance along the column downstream from the applied chemical. Columns containing homogeneous media and fractal media were evaluated for chemical breakthrough using computed tomography (CT) imaging. The advection-dispersion transport equation appeared to be appropriate for estimating the parameters. Some columns showed that dispersivity was potentially a function of distance from the upstream end of the column. These tests indicated that dispersivity through the fractal media was not consistently dependent upon distance. Estimates were obtained for individual CT image scan pixels or selected groups of pixels. Some values determined from a curve fit method or a mean breakthrough slope method were found to be scale dependent. Results from this experiment suggest dispersivity may be dependent upon the sampling fraction rather than the straight-line length solute travels through media...|$|E
40|$|There {{are major}} {{concerns}} {{on the effect}} of environmental pollution on humankind, other animals, ecosystems, and also on the built environment, where the action of pollutants can affect diverse materials, harming historical elements and modern constructions. Here we review the effects of pollutants on materials used in the built environment, e. g. housing, walls, stones, wood, plastics and coatings. Compositional characteristics that make materials susceptible to pollutants are presented. The role of materials as pollution sources and notions on decay features that affect building materials are shown. Then we review the decay effects of gases, particulate matter and solutions from wet deposition to capillary-rising and including circulation waters such as run-off and seawater. The effect of pollutants on materials is discussed, as well as the role of water in decay processes and the damage caused by neoformation minerals on the surface and pore system of the building materials. The main pollutants discussed are CO 2, CH 4, CO, hydrocarbons, SO 2, NOx, NH 3, NO 2, O 3, F 2, HF and atmospheric particles. Afterwards we discuss the use of tracers, e. g. elements, ions and isotopes, for the study of <b>pollutants</b> sources and <b>migration</b> pathways. Main isotopes include 2 H, 13 C, 15 N, 18 O, 34 S, 3 H, 14 C, 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K. We show the possible use of decay features to study main sources of air pollution, e. g. transport, industrial, domestic, since building materials can fix and interact with pollutants. Proposals regarding the use of some stable and radioactive isotopes for the study of pollutants that have strong potential but have not been tested yet are also presented. At the end of this chapter we discuss the durability assessment of materials, and the use of tracers to assess the origin of damaging compounds.

40|$|Recent studies seem {{to point}} out to the decline of Portuguese populations of sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus (Petromyzontidae) (Cabral, 2005). Especially, during its trophic migration, the gill {{epithelium}} of sea lamprey juveniles undergoes marked changes which could be disturbed by chronic oxidative stress events triggered by chemical factors, like unusual presence of a pollutant in the lamprey habitat which could cause damages in the chloridric cells. Some antioxidant enzymes, such as CAT T and GPx that detoxify H 2 O 2 in water; GST, conjugation enzymes that detoxify organic pollutants or GSH which contributes to preserve the reducing environment of the cell can be frequently used as markers of cell health. Therefore, the main goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the profile of stress and biotransformation markers of macrophthalmia from Minho river basin during salinity acclimation. Sampling occurred at the beginning of the sea lamprey downstream migration in the Minho river basin. The sampled sea lamprey juveniles (i. e. macrophthalmia) were transported live to the laboratory in appropriate life support conditions and separated in three groups: i) macrophthalmia maintained at 0 PSU for 7 days; ii) macrophthalmia maintained at 0 PSU for 30 days and iii) macrophthalmia subjected to NaCl gradient up to 35 PSU, during 30 days in aquarium. Cytosol and microsomes obtained by differential centrifugation of gills homogenates, prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7. 5 buffer, were stored at - 80 °C for subsequent determination of ROS (LeBel, 1990), MDA (Ohkawa, 1979), GSH and GSSG (Hissin, 1976) contents as well as CAT T (Beers, 1952), GPx (Flohé, 1984), mGST (Habig, 1974) and cGST (Habig, 1974) activities by fluorescence and spectrophotometry UV/Vis, respectively. The results show that salinity acclimation caused a significant increase in thiols content and a significant decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio, ROS content and cGST activity (p < 0. 05). The increase in glutathione content of gills seems to compensate a reducing-oxidant transition induced by salinity. However, the decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio and cGST activity allowed inferring an insufficient regeneration of GSH by glutathione cycle. This response also suggests that gills of sea lamprey macrophthalmia from Minho river basin, probably decreases its detoxication ability of organic <b>pollutants</b> during trophic <b>migration.</b> This response may eventually compromise the seawater acclimation success of juvenile sea lampreys that are exposed to certain pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Sampling {{methods used}} for the {{assessment}} of exposure to volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in the workplace or for environmental studies are now limited to an upper integrative sampling time of 24 hours or less. Generally, these methods lack versatility and are difficult to use. A passive sampler that can extend sampling periods was developed as part of this research. This novel sampler relies on capillary tubes to restrict and control ambient air entry into an evacuated sample container. A mathematical model was derived by modifications to the Hagen-Poiseuille and ideal gas laws. This model defines the relationship between container volume and capillary geometry (length/internal diameter) required to provide selected sampling times. Based on theoretical considerations, simulations were performed to study the effects of dimensional parameters. From these results, capillaries having 0. 05 and 0. 10 mm internal diameters were selected according to their ability to reduce sampling flow rates and to increase sampling times. Different capillary lengths were tested on various sampler prototypes. It was found that a constant sampling flow rate was delivered when a maximum discharge rate was established under the influence of a pressure gradient between a vacuum and ambient pressure. Experimental flow rates from 0. 018 to 2. 6 ml/min were obtained and compared with model predictions. From this comparison, empirical relationships between capillary geometry and maximum discharge rate given by the pressure gradient were defined. Essentially, based on these empirical relationships, capillary sampling flow controller specifications can be calculated to offer extended integrated sampling periods. On this basis, sampler prototypes were configured for stationary sampling and personal sampling. Studies, based on theory, have indicated that factors such as temperature, humidity and longitudinal molecular diffusion are not likely to influence the passive sampling process. Subsequent experiments confirmed that temperature changes should not significantly affect flow rates delivered by controllers, and that molecular diffusion does not have any impact on the representativeness of long-term samples. Recovery tests provided acceptable results demonstrating that selected capillaries do not contribute to adsorption that could seriously affect the validity of this sampling approach. Field demonstration studies were performed with both stationary and personal sampler prototypes in the indoor and outdoor environments. The performance of the sampler compared favorably, and in some instances, exceeded that of accepted methodology. These novel samplers were more reliable, had greater versatility and principally, allowed sampling periods extending from hours to a month. These inherent qualities will assist industrial hygienists and environmentalists in the study of emission sources, <b>pollutant</b> concentrations, dispersion, <b>migration</b> and control measures. This novel sampler is presently the only device available for the effective study of episodic events of VOC emission. Selected capillary geometries acting as a restriction to the entry of ambient air into evacuated sample container can provide a simple, versatile and reliable alternative for the collection of VOCs. This approach can contribute {{to a better understanding of}} VOC effects on human health and the environment...|$|R
