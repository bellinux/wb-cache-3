50|$|Small {{pressure}} vessels are normally tested using a water jacket test. The vessel is visually examined for defects and then {{placed in a}} container filled with water, and in which the change in volume of the vessel can be measured, usually by monitoring the water level in a calibrated tube. The vessel is then pressurised for a specified period, usually 30 or more seconds, and if specified, the expansion will be measured by reading off the amount of liquid that has been forced into the measuring tube by the volume increase of the <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessel.</b> The vessel is then depressurised, and the permanent volume increase due to plastic deformation while under pressure is measured by comparing the final volume in the measuring tube with the volume before pressurisation. A leak will give a similar result to permanent set, but will be detectable by holding the volume in the <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessel</b> by closing the inlet valve for a period before depressurising, as the pressure will drop steadily during this period {{if there is a}} leak. In most cases a permanent set that exceeds the specified maximum will indicate failure. A leak may also be a failure criterion, but {{it may be that the}} leak is due to poor sealing of the test equipment. If the vessel fails, it will normally go through a condemning process marking the cylinder as unsafe.|$|E

From {{the circumstances of the}} explosions and from damages observed, it has been possible to reveal that the mechanism of each explosion was either based on physical or chemical phenomena of various types. In studied "physical explosion" the released energy was initially stored in a physical way. It corresponds to the rapid vaporisation of overheated water, or the burst of a <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessel,</b> whereas in studied chemical explosions, the released energy results from a chemical reaction that involves either the explosive decomposition of a thermally unstable product or the explosion of a gaseous explosive atmosphere (ATEX). Each type of explosion is detailed with help of an example. It is pointed out that lack of process control due to the somehow unexpected nature of wastes and equipment failure are common causes of these explosions. They usually induce equipment damages. Finally, the present review illustrates the need for this process to deserves a better attention from designers and end-users in order to better control explosions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the optimal design {{and operation of}} integrated wind-hydrogen-electricity networks using the general mixed integer linear programming energy network model, STeMES (Samsatli and Samsatli, 2015). The network comprises: wind turbines; electrolysers, fuel cells, compressors and expanders; <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessels</b> and underground storage for hydrogen storage; hydrogen pipelines and electricity overhead/underground transmission lines; and fuelling stations and distribution pipelines. The spatial distribution and temporal variability of energy demands and wind availability were considered in detail in the model. The suitable sites for wind turbines were identified using GIS, by applying a total of 10 technical and environmental constraints (buffer distances from urban areas, rivers, roads, airports, woodland and so on), and {{used to determine the}} maximum number of new wind turbines that can be installed in each zone. The objective is the minimisation of the total cost of the network, subject to satisfying all of the demands of the domestic transport sector in Great Britain. The model simultaneously determines the optimal number, size and location of each technology, whether to transmit the energy as electricity or hydrogen, the structure of the transmission network, the hourly operation of each technology and so on. The cost of distribution was estimated from the number of fuelling stations and length of the distribution pipelines, which were determined from the demand density at the 1  km level. Results indicate that all of Britain's domestic transport demand can be met by on-shore wind through appropriately designed and operated hydrogen-electricity networks. Within the set of technologies considered, the optimal solution is: to build a hydrogen pipeline network in the south of England and Wales; to supply the Midlands and Greater London with hydrogen from the pipeline network alone; to use Humbly Grove underground storage for seasonal storage and <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessels</b> at different locations for hourly balancing as well as seasonal storage; for Northern Wales, Northern England and Scotland to be self-sufficient, generating and storing all of the hydrogen locally. These results may change with the inclusion of more technologies, such as electricity storage and electric vehicles...|$|R
40|$|For {{efficient}} {{design of}} pressure components, and cost effective extension of lives of existing components, an analyst should allow for complex behaviour of components {{when they are}} subjected to plasticity and creep deformation. Strictly, {{there are not many}} models that can accurately and pragmatically be used to predict the elastic-plastic-creep lives of components. The existing models are mainly applicable to elastic-creep cases, but even these models are either too complex, not practical or they are not sufficiently accurate. This thesis proposes an accurate paradigm for predicting the lives of such components. The application of the proposed paradigm to an internally pressurized vessel shows that the elastic-plastic-creep life of the component can be predicted with an error of less than 10 %. This thesis concentrates on creep and plasticity damage. Currently, there is no generally accepted expression for the damage functionD=f(D_p,D_cr), and failure models that combine plasticity and creep. The model proposes that the damage induced in the material {{is directly related to the}} internal energy density absorbed at critically loaded regions in the material. As a result, the proposed model takes into account both internal forces (stresses) and deformation (strains) yet it is simple to use in practice owing to its scalar nature. The proposed model assumes that the component is defect free and contains stress concentrators. Numerical analysis has been conducted until the failure point, using the FEA code developed by the author, to include the tertiary creep stage. Both elastic-creep and elastic-plastic-creep analysis has been performed. The stress redistribution has been studied within a component for each case, to assess a suitable safety factor addressing the failure mechanism of concern. Serious consideration is recognized to an appropriate weld strength factor which would be applied to the welded <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessel,</b> in order to improve the design against creep. The proposed model does not require material parameters whose evaluation is cumbersome and uneconomic. It is obvious that any uncertainties in the pertinent material properties, loading and the geometry of the component can substantially increase the error in the predicted lives of the components. To ease this problem, appropriate sensitivity analysis was conducted to cover all of these uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|The {{demands on}} the Australian power {{industry}} to reduce green house gases have generated research into capturing carbon dioxide. Due to the high moisture content of Victorian brown coal more energy is required to dry coal than Black coal or Anthracite. The consequence of the additional energy to dry the coal {{is an increase in}} carbon dioxide emissions. It {{is for this reason that}} fluidised bed has become a focus of interest to the Victorian power generators in the form of gasification through integrated gasification combined cycles (IGCC) or combustors. Fluidised bed technology has diverse industrial applications ranging from the gasification of coal in the power industry to chemical reactions for the plastics and oil and gas industries. Benefits of fluidised beds are the excellent heat transfer and mixing as well as containment of the process within a <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessel.</b> The disadvantages are the complex non-linear behaviour of the gas and solids interactions that occur within the process, which are difficult to measure and predict. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has the capability to model multiphase flows and can assist in understanding gas-solid fluidised beds by modelling their hydrodynamics. The purpose of this thesis is to advance CFD modelling of fluidised beds by accounting for phenomena that are typically neglected in CFD models. In the past multiphase Eulerian-Eulerian, gas-solid models used the kinetic theory of granular flow to describe the motion of solid within a fluidised bed. While this assumption has clearly shown to be a good approximation for dilute particle system, the kinetic theory of granular flow begins to fall short when particles begin to pack together. An addition to the kinetic theory of granular flow has been developed to include a closure term for the quasi-static stress associated with the long term particle contact at high solid concentrations. Simulations of bubble growth and bed porosity through a two-dimensional fluidised bed are validated against previous quasi static stress model and experimental measurements. Experiments were conducted in a rectangular three-dimensional gas-solid fluidised bed to determine the behaviour of the freeboard gas after a single bubble eruption. The experiments used a particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) measurement technique to visualise and measure the gas flow within the freeboard after a single bubble eruption. The PIV method had the ability to not only measure the velocities of the gas, but also allowed the visualisation of gas vortices within the freeboard. The PIV experiments of the single bubble eruption were then used to validate CFD model of the fluidised bed. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional fluidised bed simulations were conducted using the kinetic theory of granular flow approach including the quasi-static model and turbulence model. The gas vortices were predicted by both two-dimensional and three dimensional fluidised bed simulations. Validation of the simulations with PIV results show good agreement was achieved both qualitatively and quantitatively...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{investigation}} of a small-scale stand-alone power system, based on both experimental work and computer simulations. The power system in this study uses solar energy as energy input, lead-acid batteries as short-term energy storage, and hydrogen as long-term energy storage. The main focus is upon operation {{and control of the}} hydrogen subsystem, as a robust controller is needed in order to prevent excessive use of the components in this subsystem. The laboratory power system comprises of: Hydrogen subsystem (PEM electrolyser, metal hydride, and PEM fuel cell), a lead-acid battery, programmable power supply for emulation of PV arrays, wind turbines, and controlled characterisation of the individual system components, and a programmable electronic load. The intention was to build the laboratory power system as simple and energy efficient as possible. The components were connected directly in parallel on a common 48 V DC bus bar, no power electronics were applied between the components. Furthermore, the metal hydride and the fuel cell were air-cooled, avoiding auxiliaries required for water- cooling. The electrolyser, however, needed water-cooling. But with the electrolyser delivering hydrogen at 16 bars to a low pressure metal hydride, no use of compressor was required. On the other hand, metal hydrides needs purified hydrogen gas, > 99. 999 %, in order to maintain its capacity as specified by the manufacturer. The actual work in this thesis is divided in three main parts: 1. Design, construction, and operation of a laboratory hydrogen power system 2. Establishment of a computer model of the laboratory hydrogen power system, which interpolates and extrapolates its outputs based on experimental data collected from the laboratory system 3. Establishment of control algorithms for high-level energy management of the laboratory hydrogen power system based on the developed computer model. It is a goal to make the implementation and maintenance of these control algorithms as simple as possible. Furthermore, the control algorithms must enable efficient usage of the system components and secure energy supply to the end user The results of this thesis are divided in two main parts: The first part of the main results relates to the proposal and development of two types of control algorithms for high-level energy management, which will be denoted as the Control Matrix and the Fuzzy controller in the thesis. These control algorithms are suggested as opposed to the more traditional battery five-step charge controller. Identification of important system parameters and choosing proper settings for control parameters must be implemented into the control algorithms in order to finalise a complete control strategy. It will be shown that the electrolyser annual runtime decreases while the electrolyser annual hydrogen production remains the same by using the proposed control strategies, thus running the electrolyser more efficient. Furthermore, with a reduction in the total number of electrolyser start-ups, a more stable system operation is achieved. The second part of the main results relates to the operational experience of the small-scale laboratory hydrogen power system. Due to the amount of power required by the local control system integrated into the fuel cell and the electrolyser, the energy efficiency of the fuel cell and the electrolyser is lower at partial loads. Thus, with the additional energy needed for hydrogen purification, the round-trip efficiency of the hydrogen subsystem is found to be rather low (< 30 %), when the fuel cell and the electrolyser runs at low partial loads. However, it is encouraging that the hydrogen subsystem can reach 35 – 40 % when the fuel cell and the electrolyser are allowed to run at nominal power levels, in addition to optimal arrangement of the hydrogen purification unit. These energy efficiencies are higher than efficiencies achieved with diesel-fuelled generators. Besides, stand-alone power systems often resides in remote areas where transportation of diesel is costly, thus local production of the fuel by means of electrolyser and excess renewable energy can be profitable. Regarding the difficulty of measuring the true amount of hydrogen present in the metal hydride, and because this system parameter is important in the control strategy, a <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessel</b> is recommended instead of the air-cooled metal hydride. Furthermore, it is recommended to use DC/DC converters in the hydrogen power system in order to ensure power quality within specifications and robust operation. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|Models {{have been}} applied to stages of two phase {{releases}} following the failure of <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessels.</b> The initial expansion stage has been modelled using an experimental apparatus involving the measurement of pressure histories and of Ereon-T l aerosol droplet sizes and velocities.

The analytical description of the critical pressure decrease on {{the opening of the}} vessel is presented. The later evolution stage has been mathematically modelled by assuming that the two phases have separate velocities. The cloud motion characteristics have been shown to depend upon the degree of hydrodynamic interactions between the particles via the gaseous phase. For small particles> fractional volumes, this interaction is small and each particle behaves as a single particle corresponding to a "fi 1 t r a t i on " regime. However, for large concentrations the air between the particles becomes entrained due to the particle motion and the cloud velocity exceeds that of the single particle.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the thermoresponsive {{dispersion}} stability of nanoparticles coated with self-assembled ionic surfactant shells. The {{objective is to}} provide experimental evidence for a loss of colloidal stability at high temperatures and to explore the characteristics of {{and the reason for}} the dispersion breakdown. The influence of the properties of the system, e. g. concentrations or the structure of the surfactant, should be investigated in order to control the temperature of dispersion breakdown. The dispersion stability of hydrophilic boehmite-nanoparticles in aqueous sodium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) solutions was studied at room temperature. On increasing surfactant concentration and decreasing particle concentration, the system changes from stable via moderately stable to unstable and back. Fully redispersed particles are present being stabilised, in first approximation, by a self-assembled surfactant bilayer on the surface. The position of two transitions, namely for complete precipitation and for beginning redispersion, can be fitted accurately by using a simple model based on an H-type adsorption and including the specific surface area of the particle and molar area of the surfactant. In order to assess influence of the surfactant chain length on the dispersion stability, dispersion stability diagrams of hydrophobic boehmite nanoparticles in aqueous n-alkyltrimethylammonium bromide solutions (CnTAB, alkyl chain lengths 10 - 16) were investigated in detail. On increasing surfactant concentration and decreasing particle concentration, the dispersions change from unstable to fully stable. At very high surfactant concentration, an additional instability region caused by depletion flocculation is found. At low particle concentrations, the transition from the intermediate to the stable region, i. e. the disappearance of the precipitate, occurs at a constant surfactant concentration. This concentration is introduced as the “critical dispersion concentration” (cdc). The logarithm of the cdc shows a linear dependence on the surfactant chain length, thus a cmc-analogous behaviour. Turbidity measurements in a <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessel</b> give clear evidence that dispersions of nanoparticles with self-assembled ionic surfactant shells (both hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles) breakdown at elevated temperatures of 100 - 200 °C. For hydrophobic boehmite particles in CnTAB solution at constant particle concentration, the temperature of dispersion breakdown increases strongly up to a maximum with increasing surfactant concentration. The breakdown is triggered by the desorption of the surfactant molecules from the particle surface and subsequent flocculation of the particles by hydrophobic interactions. The adsorption-desorption equilibrium, which is influenced by the surfactant concentration, is the origin of the increase of the dispersion breakdown temperature. For C 10 TAB and C 12 TAB, the dispersion breakdown temperature drops again with increasing surfactant concentration after the maximum, because the mechanism of the dispersion breakdown changes. Since from here on the surfactant micelles are still present when the dispersion breaks down, destabilisation is caused by depletion flocculation. For C 14 TAB and C 16 TAB, the dispersion breakdown temperature deceases only slightly with increasing surfactant concentration after the maximum. Since additionally micelles are dissolved before the dispersions break down, nanoparticles coated with C 14 TAB and C 16 TAB generally are only subject to surfactant desorption. Long surfactant chains are found to give higher dispersion breakdown temperatures than short ones. For a quantitative comparison with respect to the much different surfactant concentrations of C 10 TAB and C 16 TAB, the concentration of not-adsorbed, thus free surfactant molecules in solution, cfree, is normalised to the corresponding cmc. At a normalised concentration of 1, the temperatures of dispersion breakdown show a linear dependence on the surfactant chain-length. The dispersion breakdown temperature depends strongly on the particle concentration gammaboehmite. The decrease of the breakdown temperature with increasing gammaboehmite is in good qualitative agreement with the dependence on surfactant concentration, since cfree decreases, when the total surfactant concentration is kept constant. However, for a quantitative comparison at constant cfree, higher particle concentrations gives lower dispersion breakdown temperatures than low gammaboehmite, which is most likely affect by a different number of the counterions dissociated from the ionic-surfactant shell on the particles. A redispersion of high-temperature flocculated dispersions upon cooling is possible, even though heavily dependent on the surfactant concentration. There is a minimum concentration of around the cmc required for redispersion, and depletion flocculated samples at high concentration cannot be redispersed...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{methods of}} {{combining}} mammalian cells and synthetic polymers for tissue engineering applications are frequently problematic. This {{is due to}} the incompatibility between the sensitive cell component and the harsh polymer processing environments required to form the desired porous scaffold e. g. high temperatures and organic solvents. This results in the necessity for an often inefficient and time consuming two step scaffold seeding process, whereby mammalian cells are added to a pre-fabricated polymer scaffold. High pressure or supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) processing is a method of fabricating porous polymer scaffolds at ambient temperatures and without using organic solvents. When pressurised, CO 2 becomes highly soluble in a variety of amorphous polymers such as poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA) to produce a high viscosity liquid. Subsequent decompression causes the formation of gas bubbles that become permanent as the polymer vitrifies. Based upon technology at the University of Nottingham, we hypothesised that mammalian cells could be incorporated into poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA) scaffolds using a single step scCO 2 process. This would not only make the process more rapid, but it would remove the inefficient scaffold seeding step required in most cell based tissue engineering strategies. Mammalian cells were subject to a range of high pressure CO 2 and N 2 processing conditions and assessed for cell survival. It was discovered that primary hepatocytes, meniscal fibrochondrocytes, myoblastic C 2 C 12 s and 3 T 3 fibroblasts could survive after exposure to both high pressure gases on a time and pressure dependent basis. Cells exposed to scCO 2 for one minute were then assessed for both gene and enzyme function. Using a microarray, it was found that only eight genes (out of 9000) in murine C 2 C 12 cells were significantly down-regulated when compared to untreated cells. Continued cell function was confirmed by measuring BMP- 2 induced alkaline phosphatase activity as a measure of osteogenic differentiation in myoblastic C 2 C 12 cells. Alkaline phosphatise activity was indistinguishable between untreated cells and cells exposed to scCO 2 for one minute. Additional enzyme and receptor function was confirmed by measuring cytochrome P 450 activity in primary hepatocytes after one minute of scCO 2 processing. In {{the second half of the}} study, these short processing times were found to be sufficient to plasticise and foam porous PDLLA scaffolds. Therefore, cells were incorporated into the biodegradable PDLLA foams by pre-mixing the cell suspension with the polymer powder and exposing to scCO 2. Subsequent decompression caused the polymer to foam with the cells trapped within the porous structure. Despite the presence of the plasticised PDLLA, cell survival was confirmed by both an Alamar B 1 ueTM assay and LIVE/DEADTM staining. Osteogenic differentiation on the scaffolds was confirmed by a stain and assay for BMP- 2 induced alkaline phosphatase activity. Finally, a second generation processing piece of processing apparatus was designed that permitted mammalian cells to be passed into a <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessel</b> containing preplasticised PDLLA using a novel high-pressure CO 2 injection system. This was made possible by constant optimisation of the high pressure apparatus and the introduction of a cell delivery valve. When injected at high pressures cell survival was found to be reduced when compared with previous experiments although this was likely to be due to the additional mechanical trauma caused by the injection process. Despite this, the live cell population was shown to retain its osteogenic differentiation capacity when induced with BMP- 2. With further optimisation of the delivery method, cells may survive this process in sufficient numbers to suggest that it could be used as a method of seeding tissue engineering scaffolds in the future. This development could remove the limitations place on polymer processing time by the finite survival period of the cells, permitting tuning of the scaffold structure to suit the application. In summary, this study has demonstrated that mammalian cells can be incorporated into biodegradable PDLLA scaffolds using a rapid, one-step scCO 2 process without the use of toxic solvents or elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the development of the high pressure injection system could allow cells to be incorporated during the fabrication step, removing the restrictions on polymer processing. This technique could be used for the rapid production of tissue cell loaded engineering scaffolds and other associated biotechnological applications where cells and synthetic polymers are combined, such as cell therapy and recombinant protein production.

The aim of the project is to design and verify safety of pressure vessel with half-pipe coil according mentioned standard. Every standard or code provides its own safety requirements. The main safety requirement for <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessels</b> is based on determination of vessels components minimal thicknesses.

The pressure at which LPG becomes liquid, called its vapour pressure, likewise varies depending on composition and temperature; for example, it is approximately [...] for pure butane at , and approximately [...] for pure propane at [...] LPG is heavier than air, unlike natural gas, and thus will flow along floors and tend to settle in low spots, such as basements.

40|$|Why {{preserve}} bamboo? Preserving bamboo extends {{its life}} and maintains its quality. Bamboo culms are a natural material and will decay with time. They are also susceptible to insect and fungal attack. This will limit the useful {{lives of the}} products {{they are used to}} produce and may reduce the quality of the raw material {{to the point that it}} is no longer useable. How are bamboos preserved? There are many methods of preserving bamboos but they can be divided into two general categories; non-pressure methods and pressurised methods. Non-pressure methods allow the preservative to penetrate the bamboo at a natural rate. Soaking the bamboo in preservative and allowing the preservative to penetrate by capillary or wick action are the main non-pressure methods. Pressurised methods force the preservative into the bamboo. These methods are more rapid but require <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessels</b> and facilities that are more expensive to establish and run. What are the uses of preserved bamboos? Almost every bamboo processing unit producing large items (e. g. furniture, fencing, housing) requires preserved bamboos and preservation is preferable if bamboos are used for scaffolding. Preserved bamboos may also be required for smaller items such as household goods and farm implements. What is the role of a village bamboo preservation unit in rural development? A village bamboo preservation unit will provide income generating opportunities for local people. The preserved bamboo produced by the unit will be applicable for a wide range of uses and can be used to supply local rural bamboo processing units that can be established concurrently. The unit will promote the sustainable management of nearby bamboo stands to supply a regular quantity of bamboos for preservation. How do I establish a village bamboo preservation unit? A village bamboo preservation unit can be established with two or three US dollars for a bucket, or up to US $ 5000 for a pressure treatment plant. A “modified Boucherie” processing unit requires US $ 500 and other non-pressure methods are much cheaper to establish. Note that preservation is an intermediary stage in the processing of bamboo into useable end products. Knowledge of market requirements for the preserved bamboo is vital to ensure the unit can remain in business and some market research may be needed before establishment.

40|$|There are vast {{sources of}} {{renewable}} energy in Great Britain but {{only a small fraction}} is being used because of the inability of the existing energy infrastructure to deal with the intermittency of supply. An alternative to storing the excess renewable energy in physical devices (e. g. batteries, pumped hydro) is to use the excess energy to power processes that convert CO 2 to valuable products. As CCS technologies start to be adopted by energy producers and become more widespread, a large quantity of CO 2 will be captured and stored underground. Instead of treating this CO 2 as a waste gas, some of it {{can be used as a}} raw material to produce alternative fuels and valuable chemicals using excess renewable energy generated when the demands for energy are low. There are many different pathways from CO 2 + “excess” renewable energy to valuable products. The aim of this work is to develop a comprehensive MILP model for CO 2 value chains that will include all of the pathways from primary resources to end-products (e. g. fuels and chemicals) considering the different technologies for conversion, storage and transport of resources. In this conference, we will present the results of the modelling work that we conducted for syngas value chains, which are important subsets of the entire CO 2 value chain landscape. Different technologies for the production of syngas (including fossil fuel-based technologies for comparison) and its conversion to different products are considered. The former includes natural gas reforming, biomass gasification and catalytic reverse water gas shift reaction between captured CO 2 and H 2 produced by electrolysis using excess renewable electricity. The latter includes Fischer Tropsch and alcohol syntheses to produce C 2 -C 3 olefins, >C 1 hydrocarbons and >C 1 alcohols, as well as different energy conversion technologies that can utilise syngas to meet different demands for energy services. Different storage technologies (e. g. <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessels,</b> salt caverns) and transport infrastructures (e. g. road transport of biomass, syngas pipelines) are also considered in the model. The model determines how to make best use of primary resources by optimising the combinations of technologies to use, where to locate them, when to invest in them, how to transport and store resources and so on. The model accounts for operational issues at different time scales, e. g. hourly time scales to capture intermittency of renewables and dynamics of energy storage, seasons to capture availability of biomass. Spatial dependencies are also modelled by representing Great Britain into different zones based on the National Grid’s study zones...|$|R

Compressed air energy storage at large scales, with effective management of heat, is recognised to have potential to provide affordable grid-scale energy storage. Where suitable geologies are unavailable, compressed air could be stored in pressurised steel tanks above ground, but this would incur significant storage costs. Liquid air energy storage, on the other hand, does not need a <b>pressurised</b> storage <b>vessel,</b> can be located almost anywhere, and has a relatively large volumetric exergy density at ambient pressure.

This paper analyses a hybrid energy store consisting of a compressed air store at ambient temperature, and a liquid air store at ambient pressure. Thermodynamic analyses are then carried out for the conversions from compressed air to liquid air (forward process) and from liquid air to compressed air (reverse process), with notional heat pump and heat engine systems, respectively. Preliminary results indicate that provided the heat pump/heat engine systems are highly efficient, a roundtrip efficiency of 53 % can be obtained. Immediate future work will involve the detailed analysis of heat pump and heat engine systems, and the economics of the hybrid energy store...|$|R

Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) at large scales, with effective management of heat, is recognised to have potential to provide affordable grid-scale energy storage. Where suitable geologies are unavailable, compressed air could be stored in pressurised steel tanks above ground, but this would incur significant storage costs. Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), on the other hand, does not need a <b>pressurised</b> storage <b>vessel,</b> can be located almost anywhere, has a relatively large volumetric exergy density at ambient pressure, and has relatively low marginal cost of energy storage capacity even at modest scales.

This paper carries out thermodynamic analyses for an energy storage installation comprising a compressed air component supplemented with a liquid air store, and additional machinery to transform between gaseous air at ambient temperature and high pressure, and liquid air at ambient pressure. A roundtrip efficiency of 42 % is obtained for the conversion of compressed air at 50 bar to liquid air, and back. The proposed system is more economical than pure LAES and more economical than a pure CAES installation if the storage duration is sufficiently long and if the high-pressure air store cannot exploit some large-scale geological feature...|$|R
40|$|Glass {{reinforced}} polymer composites (GRPs) {{are increasingly}} {{used in the}} petrochemical industry, {{but there is a}} reluctance to use them in extreme conditions due to unknown long term stability. They are cheaper, lighter and easier to install than traditional steel pipes. However it must be possible to give accurate, non-invasive data on degradation rate during component lifetimes of up to 30 years. This research was focussed on the development and integration of innovative glass fibre sensors into glass reinforced polymer composites for applications in hostile environments. The diffusion and absorption of water into a vinyl ester resin in in simulated seawater, at 120 °C in <b>pressurised</b> steel <b>vessels,</b> was measured using optical fibre sensors. Low cost evanescent field sensors were prepared from a standard multimode fibre and compared to commercially available fibre Bragg gratings. It was found that both sensors were capable of detecting the ingress of water into the resin through different mechanisms. The fibre Bragg gratings showed a 1. 02 ± 0. 24 nm peak shift due to the swelling of the resin after 48 hrs, whilst the evanescent field sensors showed a progressive reduction in transmitted power due to a change in the environment surrounding the sensor starting from the very early stage of the water diffusion through the thickness of the GRP...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focused on high intraluminal pressure {{and its role in}} vascular inflammation. This was done in the context of hypertension and its contribution to the progression of atherosclerosis, the major underlying pathology in coronary artery disease. While a large body of work have explored the role of immune cells in the pathogenesis of hypertension, very few studies have investigated the opposite; whether hypertension plays a role in the aetiology of inflammation. Studies which have previously attempted to investigate the effect of high blood pressure and inflammation have been thwarted by the difficulty of trying to separate the consequences of the various neurohumoral factors associated with hypertension compared to those induced by the increase in pressure itself. This is particularly true of in vivo protocols. To address this, we developed a customised ex vivo vessel chamber that enabled the recording of leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium in real time, in intact vessels under various pressures. Using this technique, vessels exposed to high intraluminal pressure demonstrated greater leukocyte adhesion, adhesion molecule gene expression and endothelial microparticle production. Interestingly, we found this to be independent of the renin-angiotensin system. Several mechanisms involved in this process are {{presented in}} Chapters 4 & 5. In Chapter 4, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), arginase, and the transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NFκB), all known to be implicated in both hypertension and vascular inflammation, were explored as possible mechanisms. High intraluminal pressure was shown to increase ROS production, arginase II expression and activity as well as NFκB expression, while eNOS was unaltered by acute increases in pressure. Furthermore, functional studies indicated a possible role for NADPH oxidase and the mitochondria as the sources of the ROS mediating response. To tease out the mechanical forces responsible for the pressure-induced response, in Chapter 5, we observed the effect of different shear rates on leukocyte adhesion in <b>pressurised</b> <b>vessels.</b> High intraluminal pressure (circumferential stretch) together with low shear stress produced the greatest response, while high stress reduced the effect of high pressure. Caveolae, membrane invaginations that have been shown to mediate many intracellular signalling pathways, were explored as possible mechanosensors involved in pressure-induced inflammatory response. Cav 1 -/- (Caveolin- 1) mice and Cav 1 KD cells had reduced leukocyte adhesion and adhesion molecule gene expression in response to TNFα stimulation. These results suggest caveolae {{play an important role in}} the inflammatory response. Furthermore, when the effect of pressure on caveolae structure was further explored, we showed, for the first time, that high intraluminal pressure reduced caveolae number. We speculate this may be due to the dissociation of the caveolae proteins Cav 1 and cavin- 1. In Chapter 6, we examined the effect of hypertension on atherosclerosis in an in vivo setting. Hypertensive atherosclerotic prone BPHxApoe-/- placed on a high fat diet for 12 weeks demonstrated no change in plaque size. However, detrimental changes in plaque morphology with increased lipid and macrophage content and reduced collagen were observed suggestive of reduced plaque stability. We also demonstrated that blockade of P-selectin, which mediates recruitment of leukocytes to the endothelium, partially improved this stability. In conclusion, the studies described in this thesis provide evidence that high intraluminal pressure induces vascular inflammation. We demonstrated that the mechanical forces exerted by high pressure promote caveolae flattening, NADPH oxidase dependent ROS production, arginase II activation and NFκB translocation, which all contribute to endothelial activation, adhesion molecule expression and enhanced leukocyte adhesion, all hallmarks of inflammation. We also showed in vivo that hypertension may result in atherosclerotic plaque instability, which may be partially improved by blocking leukocyte recruitment. Therefore, this thesis has established fundamental concepts on how high intraluminal pressure can alter cellular biological responses that may lead to new paradigms in the management of the increased risk of cardiovascular complications seen in hypertensive individuals...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of evanescent wave optical sensors (EWOSs) and fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) was embedded in an epoxy vinyl ester and an epoxy vinyl ester based glass reinforced polymer (GRP) composite to measure fluid ingress {{that would result}} in degradation under hostile conditions.

Both sensors were able to detect the early stage of moisture diffusion into the GRP matrix. The evanescent sensors showed a reduction in the transmitted signal intensity between 1500 and 1650 nm with an increasing exposure time due to a change in the optical properties of the polymer, whereas a peak shift was observed for the FBGs due to the swelling of the resin with the absorption of water. Additionally, the glass optical fibre sensors were embedded in a configuration that allowed the extent of diffusion through the thickness of the GRPs to be monitored, with the fibres in the closest position to the exposure face showing a greater signal change than those positioned further awa...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide, {{hypertension}} {{is reported}} to be in approximately a quarter of the population and is the leading biomedical risk factor for mortality worldwide. In the vasculature hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased inflammation leading to atherosclerosis and various disease states such as chronic kidney disease 2, stroke 3 and heart failure 4. An initial step in vascular inflammation leading to atherogenesis is the adhesion cascade which involves the rolling, tethering, adherence and subsequent transmigration of leukocytes through the endothelium. Recruitment and accumulation of leukocytes to the endothelium is mediated by an upregulation of adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1), intracellular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) and E-selectin as well as increases in cytokine and chemokine release and an upregulation of reactive oxygen species 5. In vitro methods such as static adhesion assays help to determine mechanisms involved in cell-to-cell adhesion as well as the analysis of cell adhesion molecules. Methods employed in previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that acute increases in pressure on the endothelium can lead to monocyte adhesion, an upregulation of adhesion molecules and inflammatory markers 6 however, similar to many in vitro assays, these findings have not been performed in real time under physiological flow conditions, nor with whole blood. Therefore, in vivo assays are increasingly utilised in animal models to demonstrate vascular inflammation and plaque development. Intravital microscopy is now widely used to assess leukocyte adhesion, rolling, migration and transmigration 7 - 9. When combining the effects of pressure on leukocyte to endothelial adhesion the in vivo studies are less extensive. One such study examines the real time effects of flow and shear on arterial growth and remodelling but inflammatory markers were only assessed via immunohistochemistry 10. Here we present a model for recording leukocyte adhesion in real time in intact <b>pressurised</b> blood <b>vessels</b> using whole blood perfusion. The methodology is a modification of an ex vivo vessel chamber perfusion model 9 which enables real-time analysis of leukocyte -endothelial adhesive interactions in intact vessels. Our modification enables the manipulation of the intraluminal pressure up to 200 mmHg allowing for study not only under physiological flow conditions but also pressure conditions. While pressure myography systems have been previously demonstrated to observe vessel wall and lumen diameter 11 as well as vessel contraction {{this is the first time}} demonstrating leukocyte-endothelial interactions in real time. Here we demonstrate the technique using carotid arteries harvested from rats and cannulated to a custom-made flow chamber coupled to a fluorescent microscope. The vessel chamber is equipped with a large bottom coverglass allowing a large diameter objective lens with short working distance to image the vessel. Furthermore, selected agonist and/or antagonists can be utilized to further investigate the mechanisms controlling cell adhesion. Advantages of this method over intravital microscopy include no involvement of invasive surgery and therefore a higher throughput can be obtained. This method also enables the use of localised inhibitor treatment to the desired vessel whereas intravital only enables systemic inhibitor treatment...|$|R
