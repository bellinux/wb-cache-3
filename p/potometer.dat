40|$|The {{transpiration}} of cut leaves (bean, tomato, Hyoscyamus) in <b>potometers</b> was {{studied as}} affected by light intensity, leaf temperature and air humidity, with {{special attention to}} stomatal light response. Fick's diffusion law {{could be applied to}} evaporation of water and to transpiration of leaves. Evaporation was found to be proportional to Vα(V = wind velocity),αbeing 0. 76 in turbulent air. Transpiration rate increased rectilinearly with light intensity below 5 x 10 4 erg sec. - 1 cm - 2, mainly through increase in leaf temperature by radiation with incandescent light, containing much infrared radiation; with fluorescent tubes, sodium lamps, or high- pressure mercury vapour lamps, transpiration increase was mainly due to increase in stomatal opening. Stomatal resistance to diffusion could be exactly determined by measurements on transpiration, leaf temperature and air humidity. Transpiration increases at higher light intensities (saturation) were entirely due to increase in leaf temperature. Regulation of transpiration by small changes in stomatal resistance to diffusion was most pronounced at small stomatal apertures. In normal air, the stomatal response to light depended on photosynthesis of the guard cell chloroplasts (use of CO 2) and the response of the guard cells to CO 2 (stomatal feed back, causing fluctuations in the degree of stomatal opening) ...|$|R

The primary objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the responses of the nutritive quality of plant parts of alfalfa and its total herbage to water stress, occurring either throughout a growth cycle or at certain growth stages. In 1983 and 1984, alfalfa, grown in <b>potometers,</b> was subjected to eight irrigation treatments, and was cut at one of five harvest dates during a 7 -week regrowth period. In one set of treatments, plants were irrigated to 112, 100, 88, 77, and 65 % of field capacity; the other three treatments imposed water stress at one of three growth stages: late vegetative, bud, and flower;Water stress applied throughout the growth cycle reduced dry-matter yield by up to 50 %, delayed plant maturity, and increased leaf-to-stem ratio (LSR). Total-herbage in-vitro digestible dry-matter (IVDDM) concentration increased by up to 7 % with increasing water stress as a result of increased stem IVDDM concentration and increased LSR. Crude-protein (CP) concentration in stems increased by up to 10 % while that of leaves decreased by up to 14 % with increasing water stress; as a result, total-herbage CP concentration was unaffected by water stress. Cell-wall concentration (CWC) of both leaves and stems decreased with increasing water stress, causing total-herbage CWC to decrease by up to 11 %. As a fraction of cell wall, lignin was unaffected, cellulose decreased, and hemicellulose increased, with increasing water stress. Effects of water stress on forage quality were generally significant even after accounting for differences in plant maturity. Most of the forage-quality differences could be related to a canopy-temperature based crop-water-stress index (CWSI);Stress at the bud and flower stages resulted in leaf wilting and leaf losses, causing a reduction in LSR by up to 40 % and a deterioration in IVDDM and CP concentration of total herbage. Water stress at the vegetative stage did not significantly affect total-herbage forage quality. Because CWSI was insensitive to leaf losses caused by stress at the bud and flower stages, it did not significantly relate to total herbage forage quality although it did relate to quality of plant parts...|$|R

Thus the following p oints were derived as the principal results. 1. Both values of relative absorption and transpiration, and the sum of these two were largest in the mesophytes, smaller in the halophytes and smallest in the ordinary succulent plant (Sedum) in both media. It was remarkable that the behaviour of the halophytes was very {{different from that of the}} ordinary succulent plant. 2. The ratio of the value for relative absorption to that for relative transpiration is largest in the halophytes and smallest in the ordinary succulent plant (Sedum), when the experiment was made with well-water. 3 But when sea-water was used, this ratio was larger in t h e case of the ordinary succulent, plant (Sedum) than in that of the mesophytes, though the. ratio was again largest in the case of the halophytes. 4.

40|$|One of the {{important}} physiological mechanisms of nitrogen (N) deficiency inhibiting plant shoot growth may be related with its impacts on root hydraulic resistance. Hence, effects of N deficiency on root radial and axial hydraulic resistances of maize were studied in this study with <b>potometer</b> and anatomical methods, respectively. The results indicated that N deficiency increased root radial hydraulic resistance of the apical zone under both high and low transpiration and axial hydraulic resistance more than 6 cm from the root tip. Root radial hydraulic resistance of N deficiency treatment was insensitive to aquaporin inhibitor mercuric chloride (HgCl 2), but radial hydraulic resistance of normal N use treatment was sensitive to HgCl 2 under low photosynthetic photo flux density (PPFD). This suggested that the decrease of water transport across Hg-sensitive transcellular pathway might be an important reason for the increase of radial hydraulic resistance on low N availability roots under a low hydrostatic gradient. The increase of axial hydraulic resistance more than 6 cm from the root tip under N deficiency was closely related with the decreased number and the smaller diameters of mature metaxylems...|$|E

Chickpea was established on calcareous sandy soil mixed with P 4 and subjected to two soil moisture regimes promoting droughted and "well-watered" (control) plant growth. The use of P 4 with high amount of irrigation water reduced the number and dry weight of nodules/plant compared to the control treatment. High soil water content reduced the harvest index {{as a result of}} excessive vegetative growth at the expense of pod formation. The number of pods/m 2 and the number of seeds/pod were reduced as the volume of irrigation water was reduced, and the reductions were significantly greater in No P 4 than P 4.

40|$|Water {{transport}} {{in green}} plants {{is important for}} maintaining plant life and numerical researches taking account of the anatomy of plants have been presented {{in the view of}} agricultural engineering and plant physiology. Recently, in crop science and horticulture the effects of the environment on the transpiration stream have been investigated quantitatively. However, there is not enough of quantitative and reliable data based on simultaneous measurement for the rates of the transpiration and absorption {{because of the lack of}} a simple and accurate method of measurement under natural conditions. Water movement must be investigated more thoroughly in the connection between these data and plant physiology. Modeling and measurement of driving forces and resistances to water movement : To investigate a mechanism of transpiration stream, the suction pressures for water absorption and transfer resistances of three organs, i. e., leaves, stem, roots, were measured by the <b>potometer</b> method. Suction p ressures due to the leaves and roots were determined from the conditions of zero-absorption rate, which was attained by the reduction of the hydrostatic pressure head applied on the roots immersed in the water. Three values of the resistances were estimated by the three kinds of experiments. Based on the experimental results, a simple model for water absorption was developed. Some results predicted by the model were well consistent with measured data. Development of a method of simultaneous measurement for transpiration and absorption rate : In the developed method in the case of plants immersed in the water, two electronic balances were used. A balance weighs water in the bath for measuring the absorption loss, and the other balance weighs the only plant, root of which are to be floated in the water bath, for measuring the absorption minus transpiration loss. Transpiration loss of water is obtained by the sum of two balances. In the case of the roots in the soil, a potted plant in the soil is to be floated in the water bath. In this case the effect of buoyant force on absorption must be considered. Using these method, instantaneous and accurate measurements were attainable. Experiments of plant responses to environment : Step responses of water movement to illumination and atmospheric temperature, and to cutting of roots were examined, using the above-mentioned method. Relation between the transpiration and absorption, aspect of pulsation of water movement were investigated by using the plants in the water and those in the soil. It was noted that the transpiration rate showed the large overshoot from the steady value and in phase lag to the absorption rate. On the other hand, those phase relation by cutting the roots was conducted reversely. 本研究では, 2 台の電子天秤による同時測定により,蒸散および吸水の瞬間流量を計測する簡便な手法を提案し,環境変化に対する蒸散・吸水量の微視的な応答解析に応用した。特に,過渡応答として,光照度のステップ変化に対し吸水量は蒸散量に対し位相が遅れ,蒸散量は定常値をオーバーシュートすること,根を切断した場合や渇水状態において十分な水分を根部に供給するとき吸水量が蒸散量より位相が進むことを明らかにした。定常特性として,植物の成長が盛んなとき吸水量が蒸散量を上回ること,根部が土壌中にある場合は蒸散・吸水流量が脈動しやすいこと,植物のしおれの影響,根部が水中および土壌中にある場合の比較などを実験的に明らかにした。これらの結果は,過渡応答計測や長時間自動計測に有効な吸水・蒸散量の同時計測法の開発によって明確にされたものである。 一方,吸水量をポトメータ法により測定し,根がある植物および根を切断した植物に対し根部の静水圧を減少させ吸水量が零となる静水圧の測定,茎部の流動抵抗の測定,茎部断面の道管直径・道管本数の顕微鏡撮影の結果から,葉部の吸水圧(駆動圧),根部吸水圧および葉・茎・根の各部流動抵抗を実測した。これらのデータは従来,ほとんど公表されていない。以上の計測結果を基に,吸水圧の和が流動抵抗の和と釣り合うとする簡単な吸水モデルを構築した。本実験により,供試植物(ピレア) の葉部:根部の吸水圧比が 9 : 1 であり,植物器官の流動抵抗比は葉:茎:根が 1 : 1 : 1. 5 であることを示した。また,葉および根による吸水圧は葉の枚数に依存せず一定であり,本モデルにより吸水量は葉の枚数(表面積) に比例するのではないことを明らかにした。さらに,根部の吸水圧が大気圧以上になると,過剰な吸水量となるため根は吸水力源でなく内部抵抗源となることを見いだした。研究成果として, 4 回の口頭発表を行った。研究課題/領域番号: 09650181, 研究期間(年度) : 1997 – 1999, 平成 11 (1999) 年度 科学研究費補助金 基盤研究(C) 研究成果報告書の一部(概要) を掲...|$|E
