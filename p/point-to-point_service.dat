Guideways are arranged in a network topology, with all stations located on sidings, and with frequent merge/diverge points. This allows for nonstop, point-to-point travel, bypassing all intermediate stations. The <b>point-to-point</b> <b>service</b> has been compared to a taxi or a horizontal lift (elevator).|$|E
25|$|The Intercity rail is {{operated}} by Malaysia's largest railway operator Keretapi Tanah Melayu. The KTM Intercity railway network {{is part of}} the Trans-Asian Railway where it is linked to Singapore and Thailand. There are two types of KTM intercity train services namely express trains, which provide <b>point-to-point</b> <b>service</b> and mail trains. Almost all intercity trains originate from KL Sentral, whereas some originate from Gemas. Among all services, KL-Singapore route has the highest number of passengers, which was 466,000 in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2005, the airline drastically reduced flights at its Indianapolis hub to only three destinations and centered scheduled flights at Chicago Midway International Airport in order to complement Southwest Airlines codeshare flights. ATA also focused on serving markets that were business oriented {{and did not have}} Southwest service, such as San Francisco, Dallas/Fort Worth, and New York–LaGuardia. Additionally, ATA began offering <b>point-to-point</b> <b>service</b> not connecting to its Midway Hub, as to benefit other Southwest Airlines focus cities, such as Las Vegas, Orlando, and Phoenix, with connections to non-Southwest destinations such as Denver and Hawaii. Southwest CEO, Gary Kelly, said that revenues were up nearly 20% due to the new codesharing agreement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Point-to-point</b> <b>services</b> are {{provisioned}} using {{a unique}} HVID per service. Planning HVIDs wisely enables summarization (as {{shown at the}} leftmost edge device) and reduces the number of forwarding entries to a strict minimum; the network now scales to support millions of <b>point-to-point</b> <b>services</b> with minimum packet overhead (it can be noted that no encapsulation was used, frames were forwarded using HVID only).|$|R

2500|$|The Metro is {{designed}} to provide local, <b>point-to-point</b> <b>service</b> in Paris proper and service into the city from some close suburbs. Stations within Paris are very close together to form a grid structure, ensuring that every point in the city is close to a metro station (less than [...] ), but this makes the service slow , except on Line 14 where the stations are farther apart and the trains travel faster. The low speed virtually precludes feasible service to farther suburbs, which are serviced by the RER.|$|E
2500|$|University Transportation and Parking Services (UTAPS), an {{auxiliary}} of Sacramento State, operates its own buses {{known as the}} Hornet Express shuttle, [...] providing several lines around the campus running approximately 7:30am until 5:00pm in conjunction with Sacramento Regional Transit District.

2500|$|Airtrans was {{operated}} over {{a number}} of fixed routes throughout the airport. Each route could be modified using different stations, guideways and vehicle configurations. Conversion of the system to offer <b>point-to-point</b> <b>service</b> like a true group rapid transit system was considered but not implemented, although all stations contained bypass tracks or vehicles could proceed through lower-demand stations without stopping. The flexibility of the system resulted in routes that changed often to serve different airline and passenger needs. While initially planned for [...] "origin and destination" [...] traffic, the system was modified to move connecting passengers (although never very effectively due to its uni-directional operation). The initial service specifications allowed for a maximum inter-terminal trip of 20 minutes, and 30 minutes to remote parking.|$|E
2500|$|Bryndwr {{was one of}} {{the areas}} the Board had hoped to {{construct}} a new tramline for in the 1920s, but was prevented from doing so by economic conditions. [...] When the Board failed to provide its own service to the suburb, the private operator W. C. Sanders filled the gap with a <b>point-to-point</b> <b>service</b> linking Bryndwr and Harewood from 1924. [...] The Board was desirous of running its own Bryndwr service for which it had ordered Tilling-Stevens buses. In the meantime, it commenced operations using a recently acquired White bus on 12 January 1925. When this bus had to be deployed elsewhere during the [...] "bus wars," [...] the service had to be continued with vehicles from the disparate collection still in the Board's possession until they were able to take delivery of the Tilling-Stevens buses in late 1925.|$|E
2500|$|The {{election}} night broadcast was transmitted on a wavelength of 550 meters (545 kHz). Later publicity stated that KDKA was now broadcasting on 330 meters (909 kHz), {{and in the}} fall of 1921 all the Westinghouse broadcasting stations began using 360 meters (833 kHz). In the United States there were no formal standards defining a broadcasting station until December 1, 1921, when the Department of Commerce issued a regulation specifying that stations making broadcasts intended for the general public now had to hold a Limited Commercial license that authorized operation on 360 or 485 meters (833 or 619 kHz). KDKA was one of a small number of stations that already met this standard {{at the time of its}} adoption, as its second year-long license, issued November 7, 1921, included the notation [...] "360 meters for general broadcasting" [...] in addition to continuing the <b>point-to-point</b> <b>service</b> authorization.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{following}} a dramatic reduction of service by United Airlines and an unsuccessful attempt by USAir to establish <b>point-to-point</b> <b>service,</b> Continental expanded at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and established {{what would become}} its third-largest system hub. On February 12, 1991, Continental unveiled a new blue and gray livery and the [...] "globe" [...] logo. This would continue as Continental's identity until it was dissolved in 2012, and {{was adopted by the}} post-merger United Airlines. In March 1993 the airline cancelled its services to nine U.S. destinations and six non-U.S. destinations, including all 24 weekly services between the United States and Australia and New Zealand in addition to its flights between Guam and Australia, effective October 31 of that year. Under the leadership of former Boeing executive Gordon Bethune, who became President in October 1994, Continental began a successful transformation project. When Bethune took over, the troubled airline had twice faced bankruptcy and was again headed in that direction.|$|E
2500|$|On April 24, 2007, Skybus Airlines {{announced}} their initial set of eight destinations, {{all of which}} originated from their hub at Port Columbus International Airport in Columbus. At first, Skybus operated a strict <b>point-to-point</b> <b>service,</b> not booking flights between destination cities that were not Columbus, but the company later announced it would begin flying direct flights from its Portsmouth, NH, destination to two locations in Florida. In addition, prices of tickets and details on extra fees were announced the same day. [...] Service between Port Columbus and the other eight destinations began on May 22, and the airline also announced its intention to expand rapidly. The expansion plans were not envisioned in the original business plan, and, in some instances, it expanded to cities that management did not choose {{on the basis of}} computer models used with its initial destination cities (Chattanooga, TN, for example). As part of its business model, Skybus favored smaller, cheaper airports near major markets. To serve Boston, for example, Skybus chose Portsmouth (New Hampshire) International Airport. [...] Skybus marketed itself as an ultra-low-cost carrier, selling ten seats on each flight for $10. The low fares came with a reduction of frills. There were charges for virtually everything else (see Skybus business model), including checked baggage charges, which were later implemented by other carriers such as Delta, Northwest and United.|$|E

25|$|A {{communications}} satellite is an artificial satellite stationed in {{space for the}} purposes of telecommunications. Modern {{communications satellite}}s use a variety of orbits. For fixed <b>point-to-point</b> <b>services,</b> communications satellites provide a microwave radio relay technology complementary to that of submarine communication cables. Invented in 1962 by the American aerospace engineer John Robinson Pierce, NASA launched Telstar, the world's first active communications satellite, and the first satellite designed to transmit telephone and high-speed data communications. Its name is still used to this day for a number of television broadcasting satellites.|$|R

25|$|Route rationalising {{was one of}} {{the major}} {{contributors}} to the airline's return to profitability.MAS pared its domestic routes from 114 to 23, and also cancelled virtually all unprofitable international routes. Apart from that, Malaysia Airlines also rescheduled all of its flight timings and changed its operations model from <b>point-to-point</b> <b>services</b> to hub and spoke services. Additionally, the airline started Project Omega and Project Alpha to improve the company's network and revenue management. Emphasis has been placed on six areas: pricing, revenue management, network scheduling, opening storefronts, low season strategy and distribution management. MAS then pushed for new aircraft purchases, using its cash surplus of RM5.3 billion to eventually purchase new narrow-body aircraft and wide-body aircraft.|$|R
