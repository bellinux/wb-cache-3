40|$|Faced with an {{economic}} slowdown, the Austria federal government implemented two economic stimulus packages in 2001 and 2002 respectively. These packages provide for additional public expenditure, {{most of which}} has been advanced by one or two years, particularly with regard to public transportation infrastructure as well as the construction sector. Moreover, various tax incentives aiming to improve the supply-side conditions were introduced or expanded. A survey conducted by WIFO found a remarkably high number of enterprises indicating that they were adequately informed of the most important tax incentives (tax allowance and <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> R&D, <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> apprentices, <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> external and internal training measures, <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> incremental investment).

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent the {{healthcare}} system from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured.

The mandate increased the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs.

40|$|Sex workers {{receive a}} price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> {{unprotected}} sex. Research has inferred {{that the source}} of this premium is a compensating differential for STI risk. I introduce a compensating differential for pregnancy risk as a novel source of this price premium through a simple model that predicts the price for unprotected sex increasing with the probability of pregnancy through decreased unprotected sex. I empirically test this using a rich panel dataset of 19, 041 sexual transactions by 192 sex workers in Busia, Kenya collected during 2005 and 2006. I use the probability of pregnancy as an instrument for unprotected sex and run two-stage least-squares (2 SLS) regression and find that a compensating differential for pregnancy risk is a source of the price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> unprotected sex. The price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> pregnancy risk is as high as USD 122 or about 16 times average price. I also test for a compensating differential for STI risk and clients' disutility for condoms, the other competing theories, and find that a compensating differential for STI risk is also a source of the price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> unprotected sex, however, I do not find evidence for clients' disutility for condoms as a source of the price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> unprotected sex. Identifying and estimating sources of the price <b>premium</b> <b>for</b> unprotected sex will allow policymakers to implement interventions that will reduce both the supply and the demand for unprotected sex. ...|$|R

5|$|The ACA's major {{provisions}} {{came into}} force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured {{share of the}} population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20–24 million additional people covered during 2016. The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and to major changes to individual insurance markets. Both involved new spending, funded {{through a combination of}} new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and Medicare Advantage. Several Congressional Budget Office reports said that overall these provisions reduced the budget deficit, and that repealing the ACA would increase the deficit. The law also enacted a host of delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After the law went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> employer-based insurance plans.|$|E

5|$|On October 7, 1987, Collins {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to close a}} deficit between state contributions to the worker's compensation Special Fund and disbursements. The Special Fund was designated for payments to workers with occupational diseases and workers whose work-related injuries could not be traced to any single employer. A plan proposed by Democratic state senator Ed O'Daniel was expected to {{provide the framework for}} legislation considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the Special Fund would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation <b>premiums</b> <b>for</b> 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses because the majority of the claims paid from the Special Fund were for black lung, a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.|$|E
