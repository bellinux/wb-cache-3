5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in <b>peer</b> <b>groups.</b> H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E

40|$|<b>Peer</b> <b>group</b> {{socialization}} in Swedish schools. This {{study examines}} {{the significance of}} peers {{in the process of}} socialization in Swedish schools, that is to say, the mutual influence that children and young people exert on each other. It analyses how <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization is apprehended and evaluated in curricula for Sweden’s comprehensive schools and in related research. Part One defines the object of study more precisely by relating it to socialization research. In this part of the thesis, research on the socialization of children and young people is reviewed and some central concepts that can serve to characterize <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization are distinguished: friendship, <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> membership and youth socialization. In addition, the school is considered as a potential place of encounter for peers. Part Two consists of a systematic comparison of how different conceptions of <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization have been expressed over time in curricula and in research on schooling. Three different periods with three more or less dominant conceptions of the significance of the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> for socialization are identified: I. The potential of the school to create <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> community is formulated. II. The potential of <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization is neglected. III. The potential of <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization is rediscovered. During the first period, <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization as a means of creating community is prominent in the 1962 comprehensive school curriculum (Lgr 62) and in the official studies and schools research preceding it. In the 1969 curriculum (Lgr 69), perceptions change. Researchers are more ambivalent to the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> and there is somewhat less confidence in its positive potential to foster community. The second period is characterized by a neglect of the <b>peer</b> <b>group’s</b> potential to create community, first in the 1980 curriculum (Lgr 80) and later in that of 1994 (Lpo 94). In research on schools and youth, the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> is represented primarily as a force that seeks to contest the culture of schools. In the third period, a tendency to rediscover <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization can be observed in official studies carried out after Lpo 94. In schools research, attention is drawn to the possible contribution which the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> can make to learning. Some youth researchers express confidence in the <b>peer</b> <b>group’s</b> potential as a positive, community-creating force, {{but at the same time}} there are those who see <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization as risky and a source of problems. There may possibly be a positive community-creating force in <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization that has been overlooked. All things considered, the author ventures to suggest that the community-creating potential of the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> is an inadequately explored perspective in Swedish research on schooling, a perspective that could enable us to see the possibilities in schools, rather than the problems...|$|R

25|$|<b>Peer</b> <b>groups</b> are {{especially}} important during adolescence, {{a period of}} development characterized by {{a dramatic increase in}} time spent with peers and a decrease in adult supervision. Adolescents also associate with friends of the opposite sex much more than in childhood and tend to identify with larger groups of peers based on shared characteristics. It is also common for adolescents to use friends as coping devices in different situations. A three-factor structure of dealing with friends including avoidance, mastery, and nonchalance has shown that adolescents use friends as coping devices with social stresses.|$|E
25|$|Peer-to-peer sexual {{harassment}} is {{three times more likely}} than perpetration by teachers or other school faculty. Sexual harassment between peers may also be a result of students trying to conform to expected gender norms created by society. It can also be used as a tool for gender policing. For example, this could be seen if a male is exhibiting behavior not seen to peers as being masculine, so others may label him with homophobic slurs in order to reinforce gender conformity through a form of nonphysical {{sexual harassment}}. Students may exhibit, accept, or tolerate this conforming behavior as to not cause rifts in <b>peer</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Peer</b> <b>group</b> {{analysis}} {{is a new}} tool for monitoring behavior over time in data mining situations. In particular, the tool detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way distinct from objects to which they had previously been similar. Each object is selected as a target object and is compared with all other objects in the database, using either external comparison criteria or internal criteria summarizing earlier behavior patterns of each object. Based on this comparison, a <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> of objects most similar to the target object is chosen. The behavior of the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> is then summarized at each subsequent time point, and {{the behavior of the}} target object compared with the summary of its <b>peer</b> <b>group.</b> Those target objects exhibiting behavior most different from their <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> summary behavior are flagged as meriting closer investigation. The tool is intended {{to be part of the}} data mining process, involving cycling between the detection of objects that behave in anomalous ways and the detailed examination of those objects. Several aspects of <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> analysis can be tuned to the particular application, including the size of the <b>peer</b> <b>group,</b> the width of the moving behavior window being used, the way the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> is summarized, and the measures of difference between the target object and its <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> summary...|$|R

25|$|As {{children}} reach adolescence, {{the period}} of time between age 13 and 19, the dynamics of the parent-child relationship change as <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> are now the focus of attention. An adolescent with cleft lip or cleft palate will deal with the typical challenges faced by most of their peers including issues related to self-esteem, dating and social acceptance. Adolescents, however, view appearance as the most important characteristic, above intelligence and humor. This being the case, adolescents are susceptible to additional problems because they cannot hide their facial differences from their peers. Adolescent boys typically deal with issues relating to withdrawal, attention, thought, and internalizing problems, and may possibly develop anxiousness-depression and aggressive behaviors. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop problems relating to self-concept and appearance. Individuals with cleft lip or cleft palate often deal with threats to their quality of life for multiple reasons including: unsuccessful social relationships, deviance in social appearance and multiple surgeries.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest in deploying data mining methods for fault detection. For the case where we have potentially large numbers of devices to monitor, we propose to use <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> analysis to identify faults.

We then monitor the behaviour of a device by measuring how well the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> tracks the device. Should the device’s behaviour deviate strongly from its <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> we flag the behaviour as an outlier. An outlier is used to indicate the potential occurrence of a fault. A device exhibiting outlier behaviour from its <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> need not be an outlier to the population of devices. Indeed a device exhibiting behaviour typical for the population of devices might deviate sufficiently far from its <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> to be flagged as an outlier. We demonstrate the usefulness of this property for detecting faults by monitoring the data output from a collection of privately run weather stations across the UK...|$|R

25|$|At a young age, {{children}} can already utilize {{their knowledge of}} different social categories to form stereotypes about what they understand about men and women. Interaction with <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> will often shape people’s behavior to fit normative expectations. Children often group together with other children of the same-gender. Belonging in a group that shares the same gender identity will often endorse more gender appropriate traits. An {{example of this is}} the fact that girls have more expressive traits than boys. Research also show that children often engage in play with same-sex peers, and exclude others who are different from the norm. For example, children who want to join a group will only be allowed to engage in play if they are a same-gender peer who has had prior experience with the activity, or an opposite-gender peer who has not had prior experience. The desire to engage in play can influence a child to behave like to their peers. In later life, as children starts to move away from their parents, the role of friendship becomes much more influential.|$|E
25|$|Grant’s gazelles {{sexually mature}} at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in {{bachelor}} groups. The courting ritual {{begins with a}} buck following a doe, {{waiting for her to}} urinate. When she does, the male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus. If she is, he will continue to follow her. The female will lift her tail, signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days. Births peak in January and February. A doe will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the afterbirth and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in <b>peer</b> <b>groups.</b> A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence.|$|E
2500|$|Communication within <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> allows {{adolescents}} {{to explore their}} feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. <b>Peer</b> <b>groups</b> offer members {{the opportunity to develop}} social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent's own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. <b>Peer</b> <b>groups</b> can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers, where emotional (rather than solution-based) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers. Both physical and relational aggression are linked to a vast number of enduring psychological difficulties, especially depression, as is social rejection. Because of this, bullied adolescents often develop problems that lead to further victimization. Bullied adolescents are more likely to both continue to be bullied and to bully others in the future. However, this relationship is less stable in cases of cyberbullying, a relatively new issue among adolescents.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of academic misconduct is the contextual factor of an environment of peer disapproval of cheating, that is, peer pressure. Psychologists note that all people tend to follow the norms of their peer group, which would include norms about academic dishonesty. [...] Thus, students who believe that their peers disapprove of cheating are less likely to cheat. Indeed, multiple studies show that the most decisive factor in a student's decision to cheat is his perception of his peers' relationship with academic dishonesty. [...] For instance, on average 69% of students cheat at colleges with low community disapproval of academic misconduct, whereas only about 23% of students cheat at colleges with strong community disapproval of academic misconduct. [...] Peer pressure works both ways, as a study found that there is a 41% increase in the probability of a student cheating if he or she has seen someone else cheat. [...] However, even if most students strongly disapprove of cheating, {{there has to be a}} community in order for those norms to be enforced via peer pressure. For instance, larger schools, which usually have much higher cheating rates than small schools, tend to have a weaker community, being more split up into different <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> that exert little social pressure on each other. [...] Another measure of a college community, how many students live on campus, further shows a significant relation with a school's cheating rate. [...] Relatedly, many professors argue that smaller classes reduce cheating behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Egocentrism in {{adolescents}} forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent {{sense of self}} stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of [...] "identity achievement" [...] but also stressed that the identity challenge [...] "is never fully resolved {{once and for all}} at one point in time". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. [...] "Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers." [...] Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers [...] "finding their selves"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. [...] "Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards." [...] This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the late}} 19th {{to the early}} 21st century, the Anglo-Cornish dialect {{declined}} somewhat due {{to the spread of}} long-distance travel, mass education and the mass media, and increased migration into Cornwall of people from, principally, the south-east of England. Universal elementary education had begun in England and Wales in the 1870s. Thirty years later Mark Guy Pearse wrote: [...] "The characteristics of Cornwall and the Cornish are rapidly passing away. More than a hundred years ago its language died. Now its dialect is dying. It is useless to deplore it, for it is inevitable." [...] Although the erosion of dialect is popularly blamed on the mass media, many academics assert the primacy of face-to-face linguistic contact in dialect levelling. It is further asserted by some that <b>peer</b> <b>groups</b> are the primary mechanism. It is unclear whether in the erosion of the Anglo-Cornish dialect, high levels of migration into Cornwall from outside in the 20th century, or deliberate efforts to suppress dialect forms (in an educational context) are the primary causative factor. Anglo-Cornish dialect speakers are more likely than Received Pronunciation speakers in Cornwall to experience social and economic disadvantages and poverty, including spiralling housing costs, in many, particularly coastal areas of Cornwall, and have at times been actively discouraged from using the dialect, particularly in the schools. In the 1910s the headmaster of a school in a Cornish fishing port received this answer when he suggested to the son of the local coastguard (a boy with rough and ready Cornish speech) that it was time he learned to speak properly: [...] "An what d'yer think me mates down to the quay 'ud think o' me if I did?" ...|$|E
