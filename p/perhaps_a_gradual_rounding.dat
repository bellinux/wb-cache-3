40|$|Multiple {{idiopathic}} external root resorption {{is a rare}} {{pathological condition}} usually detected as an incidental radiographic finding. External root resorption of permanent teeth is a multifactorial process related to several local and systemic factors. If an etiological factor cannot be identified for root resorption, the term "idiopathic" is applied. This report presents a case of multiple idiopathic apical root resorption. The condition {{was found in a}} young female patient seeking orthodontic treatment due to malocclusion. This kind of resorption starts apically and progresses coronally, causing <b>a</b> <b>gradual</b> shortening and <b>rounding</b> of the remaining root. Patients with this condition are not the ideal candidates for orthodontic treatment; however, the aim of this report is to describe an unusual case of idiopathic root resorption involving the entire dentition, and to present the orthodontic treatment of this patient. It describes the progress and completion of orthodontic therapy with satisfactory end results...|$|R
40|$|For a {{brief period}} in the mid- 1960 s, conservative, liberal, and radical social {{scientists}} imagined a “postscarcity ” future. Extending the then-current decrease in poverty, expansion of the middle class, and growth in industrial production into the not-very-distant future promised a humanity freed from material need. Daniel Bell’s (1973) vision of a postindustrial society a decade later retreated slightly from this utopian possibility, but nev-ertheless, it suggested a withering away of the conflict between capital and labor {{in favor of a}} less unequal and more meritocratic social order based on educational resources. <b>Perhaps</b> with <b>a</b> <b>gradual</b> waning of optimism, this orthodoxy has been repeated by others too numerous to mention. Robert Reich (1991), in the The Work of Nations, for example, argued that in a global economy, “symbolic workers ” become key to economic well-being such that wealth now follows the educated. The promise of the “information age ” has not been realized. The data are in, and the last quarter century has been characterized by growing inequality. Although educational “resources ” have arguably grown more important, the power of capital has not withered. Many have accounted for this inequality by arguing that in a global system, the advantages o...|$|R
40|$|A long-standing {{debate on}} the {{dynamics}} of population growth in human history has become polarized between a Malthusian stance and a Boserupian one. The former tends to view population growth as limited by carrying capacity, dependent on environment and technology, whereas the latter sees population growth itself as a major inducement to social, economic and technological developments. In this paper the authors experiment with approaching this debate by using recent developments in evolutionary theory. According to these, evolutionary principles, as expounded by Charles Darwin and subsequent evolutionary scientists, apply not only to biological evolution but also to social or cultural evolution. Here, the role of genes is taken over by culture and, since culture is much more pliable than our DNA, evolution speeds up. As the only organisms on Earth whose evolution relies as heavily on culture as on genes, humans have become extremely adaptable. Their hyper-adaptability suggest that humans, through their cultural evolution, have managed increasingly to adapt to their own growing population, thus succeeding in accommodating ever-growing numbers. This hypothesis fits the Boserupian approach to population very well but less so the Malthusian one, <b>perhaps</b> indicating <b>a</b> <b>gradual</b> shift from <b>a</b> Malthusian regime to a Boserupian one in human history. The hypothesis is discussed and examined through four case studies: The beginning of farming around Göbekli Tepe in southeast Turkey, the productive farming systems of Tiwanaku in South America, the population crisis of late medieval and early modern Iceland, and the ‘collapse’ of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) ...|$|R

For example, total area devoted to food production {{was difficult to}} estimate because sources combined the area of fields in production with those lying fallow to give a total for arable lands. The arable land figure has shown <b>a</b> <b>gradual</b> increase since 1961. Estimated then at 29,000 square kilometres (11,325 sq. mls), it rose to almost 32,000 square kilometres (12,500 sq. mls.) in 1984. In 1983 there were about 12,000 square kilometres (4,686 sq. mls.) in food production and in 1984 slightly more than 9,000 square kilometres (3,515 sq. mls). Therefore, <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> third of Chad's farmlands were in production in a given year, with the balance lying fallow.|$|R
