60|$|Mr. Field, of Lambeth, has {{supplied}} me abundantly {{with beautiful}} illustrations of the candle and its materials. I shall therefore now refer to them. And, first, {{there is the}} suet--the fat of the ox--Russian tallow, I believe, employed {{in the manufacture of}} these dips, which Gay Lussac, or some one who entrusted him with his knowledge, converted into that beautiful substance, stearin, which you see lying beside it. A candle, you know, is not now a greasy thing like an ordinary tallow candle, but a clean thing, and you may almost scrape off and pulverise the drops which fall from it without soiling anything. This is the process he adopted[2]:--The fat or tallow is first boiled with quick-lime, and made into a soap, and then the soap is decomposed by sulphuric acid, which takes away the lime, and leaves the fat re-arranged as stearic acid, whilst a quantity of glycerin is produced at the same time. Glycerin--absolutely a sugar, or a substance similar to sugar--comes out of the tallow in this chemical change. The oil is then pressed out of it; and you see here this series of pressed cakes, shewing how beautifully the impurities are carried out by the oily part as the pressure goes on increasing, and at last you have left that substance which is melted, and cast into candles as here represented. The candle I have in my hand is a stearin candle, made of stearin from tallow in the way I have told you. Then here is a sperm candle, which comes from the <b>purified</b> <b>oil</b> of the spermaceti whale. Here also are yellow bees-wax and refined bees-wax, from which candles are made. Here, too, is that curious substance called paraffin, and some paraffin candles made of paraffin obtained from the bogs of Ireland. I have here also a substance brought from Japan, since we have forced an entrance into that out-of-the-way place--a sort of wax which a kind friend has sent me, and which forms a new material for the manufacture of candles.|$|E

5000|$|While oil {{was known}} to exist {{for a long time}} in the Subcarpathian-Galician region, it was more {{commonly}} used as an animal drug and lubricant, but Łukasiewicz was the first person to distill the liquid in Poland and in the world and was able to exploit it for lighting and create a brand new industry. In autumn of 1852 Łukasiewicz, Mikolasch and his colleague John Zeh analyzed the oil, which was provided in a few barrels by traders from the town of Drohobycz. After pharmaceutical methods and processes the <b>purified</b> <b>oil</b> was obtained and sold in the local pharmacies, but the orders were small due to high prices. In early 1854 Łukasiewicz moved to Gorlice, where he continued his work. He set up many companies together with entrepreneurs and landowners. That same year, he opened the world's first oil [...] "mine" [...] at Bóbrka, near Krosno (still operational as of 2006). At the same time Łukasiewicz continued his work on kerosene lamps. Later that year, he set up the first kerosene street lamp in Gorlice's Zawodzie district. In subsequent years he opened several other oil wells, each as a joint venture with local merchants and businessmen. In 1856 in Ulaszowice, near Jasło, he opened an [...] "oil distillery" [...] — the world's first industrial oil refinery. As demand for kerosene was still low, the plant initially produced mostly artificial asphalt, machine oil, and lubricants. The refinery was destroyed in an 1859 fire, but was rebuilt at Polanka, near Krosno, the following year.|$|E

40|$|A {{recombinant}} polypeptide {{containing the}} precursor protein of a sesame storage protein, 2 S albumin, fused to the C-terminus of a sesame oleosin was expressed in transgenic rice seeds {{under the control}} of a rice glutelin promoter. The recombinant polypeptide of 32 kDa, equivalent to the resultant molecular mass of sesame oleosin (15 kDa) and prepro- 2 S albumin (17 kDa), was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum fraction of maturing transgenic rice seeds, but not in the <b>purified</b> <b>oil</b> bodies or the soluble extract of transgenic seeds. However, sesame oleosin presumably fused with a 2 kDa C-terminal appendix originating from the signal sequence of prepro- 2 S albumin, was found in the <b>purified</b> <b>oil</b> bodies, and mature sesame 2 S albumin apparently processed into two subunits (9 and 4 kDa) linked by disulfide bonds was detected in extracts of transgenic seeds. Immunogold labeling revealed that the sesame oleosin and 2 S albumin were separately located in oil bodies and protein bodies of embryo cells of transgenic rice seeds. While sesame 2 S albumin was also detected in protein bodies of endosperm cells of transgenic seeds, the co-expressed sesame oleosin, probably degraded {{due to the lack of}} oil bodies in this tissue, and was not detected.

Although polyoleosin was estimated to only accumulate to < 2 % of the total oil body protein in planta, their presence increased the freezing tolerance of imbibed seeds as well as emulsion stability and structural integrity of <b>purified</b> <b>oil</b> bodies; these increases were greater with increasing oleosin repeat number.

The lube oil separator functions to <b>purify</b> the lube <b>oil</b> to ensure its good working performance.
