25|$|Luxembourgish, a Moselle Franconian {{language}} formerly {{regarded as}} a variety of German, is native to Arelerland, {{the eastern part of}} the Belgian <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> including the city of Arlon (Arel). Here it has largely been replaced by Belgian French in recent decades, contrarily to its flourishing on the other side of the border, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.|$|E

It had a per capita income of $49,000.|$|R
25|$|The {{municipal}} {{system was}} adopted when Luxembourg was annexed into the French département of Forêts in 1795. Despite ownership passing to the Netherlands, this system was maintained {{until it was}} introduced upon independence in 1843. The <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> which now constitutes part of Belgium, was part of Luxembourg prior to 1839 when it possessed a low degree of sovereignty. Due to Luxembourg's incorporation into the main country by its occupying powers, the modern municipal system in Luxembourg is less than two centuries old.|$|E
25|$|When Julius Caesar {{arrived in}} the region, as {{recorded}} in his De Bello Gallico, the inhabitants of Belgium, northwestern France, and the German Rhineland were known as the Belgae (after whom modern Belgium is named), and they {{were considered to be}} the northern part of Gaul. (The region of Luxembourg, including the Belgian <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> was inhabited by the Treveri, who were probably not strictly considered to be Belgae.) The distinction between the Belgae to the North and the Celts to the south, and the Germani across the Rhine, is disputed.|$|E
25|$|The northeastern {{corner of}} this province, {{including}} Tongeren {{and the area}} of the earlier Germani, was united with the militarized Rhine border to form a newer province known as Germania Inferior. Its cities included Ulpia Noviomagus (Nijmegen in the modern Netherlands), Colonia Ulpia Trajana (Xanten in modern Germany) and the capital Colonia Agrippina (Cologne in Germany). Later, Emperor Diocletian restructured the provinces around 300, and split the remaining Belgica into two provinces: Belgica Prima and Belgica Secunda. Belgica Prima was the eastern part and had Trier as its main city, and included the Belgian <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Luxembourg.</b>|$|E

25|$|The same {{happened}} to the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg which lost two-thirds of its territory to the new <b>Province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> in what is termed the 'Third Partition of Luxembourg'. This left a rump Grand Duchy, covering one-third of the original territory and inhabited by one-half of the original population, in personal union with the Netherlands, under King-Grand Duke William I (and subsequently William II and William III). This arrangement was confirmed by the 1867 Treaty of London, known as the 'Second Treaty of London' {{in reference to the}} 1839 treaty, and lasted until the death of King-Grand Duke William III 23 November 1890.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, William I {{became a}} party to the Treaty of London by which the Grand-Duchy lost its western, francophone territories to the Belgian <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Luxembourg.</b> Due to the country's {{population}} having been halved, with the loss of 160,000 inhabitants, the militia lost half its strength. Under the terms of the treaty, Luxembourg and the newly formed Duchy of Limburg, both members of the German Confederation, were together required to provide a federal contingent consisting of a light infantry battalion garrisoned in Echternach, a cavalry squadron in Diekirch, and an artillery detachment in Ettelbruck. In 1846, the cavalry and artillery units were disbanded and the Luxembourg contingent was separated from that of Limburg. The Luxembourg contingent now consisted of two light infantry battalions, one in Echternach and the second in Diekirch; two reserve companies; and a depot company.|$|E

The Catholic <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Namur, <b>Luxembourg</b> and Limburg were already controlled by the Spanish. The Union of Arras opened talks in February with Alexander Farnese, who succeeded his uncle John of Austria as the Royal-appointed Governor-General of the Netherlands, to reconcile [...] with Philip II. In response, a meeting took place in Utrecht shortly thereafter between deputies from the northern <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, Friesland, Gelderland and Ommelanden, which signed an alliance and union on 23 January. In the south, meanwhile, Farnese was planning the capture of Maastricht to use the city with its stone bridge over the Meuse as a base to conquer Brussels and Antwerp in the following campaigns. In November 1578, the Spanish Army left Namur and crossed the Ardennes and Limburg. However, Farnese deemed too risky starting the siege of Maastrich at midwinter and with the John Casimir's numerous cavalry on the countryside.|$|R
