Title of diploma thesis: Pharmacological and {{physiological}} characteristics of organic cation transporters (OCTs) and multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATEs) Abstract: Membrane transporters {{are important and}} life-enabling proteins of the body, which facilitate the absorption, distribution, and elimination of nutrients, metabolic waste products, drugs, and xenobiotics. Multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATEs) and organic cation transporters (OCTs) belong to polyspecific transporters of the solute carrier (SLC) family and form a cooperating system of excretion in the kidney and liver. The transporters are expressed in many tissues throughout the body primarily in the kidneys, liver, heart, brain, small intestine, and placenta and transmit countless molecules from the natural neurotransmitters and hormones to exogenous compounds, such as metformine, cimetidine, 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP), tetraethylammonium (TEA) or acyclovir.

Facial clefts belong to frequent congenital anomalies with incidence of 1 : 500 in lively born children, which is why adequate care has to be provided to these children to honour the founder of Czech plastic surgery <b>Prof.</b> <b>František</b> Burian. Two goals were set in this thesis. The first goal was to elaborate a proposal of a nursing procedure for children with facial cleft. The other goal was to elaborate an educational programme for nurses and {{parents of children with}} facial cleft anomalies. Both the goals have been achieved. Two hypotheses were set in this thesis: Hypothesis No. 1 ?Nurses working at a specialized department are sufficiently informed on the care about children with facial cleft anomalies?. Hypothesis No. 2 ?Nurses working at maternity wards are sufficiently informed on the care about children with facial cleft anomalies?. Two research questions were also set before the research itself: Research question No. 1 : How do nurses provide specific nursing care to children with facial cleft anomalies? Research question No. 2 : What principles do nurses consider important for the care about children with facial cleft anomalies? The questionnaire, interview and observation methods were used for data collection. The questionnaire was based on information obtained from literature and was designed for ward nurses. The interview was prepared upon own experience from observation of nurses in the Královské Vinohrady University Hospital in the Centre for Cleft Anomalies Treatment and upon information from literature. 60 questionnaires were distributed in the České Budějovice Hospital in March 2011. There were 47 completed questionnaires suitable for processing. 11 questionnaires were distributed in the Královské Vinohrady University Hospital in March 2011. 9 completed questionnaires were used for processing. The research sample for the interview consisted of 11 nurses working in the Královské Vinohrady University Hospital, the Centre for Cleft Anomalies Treatment, the Paediatric ICU and the Paediatric ward.

It regulates the material transport between these compartments due to its specialised structure and cellular constitution. The endothelial cells forming the BBB are characterized by the expression of different multidrug resistance proteins which belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. These transmembranous ABC proteins actively transport molecules out of the BBB endothelia into the bloodstream and protect the brain against harmful xenobiotics, toxins and metabolites. On the other hand, ABC export proteins constitute obstacles to the delivery of many therapeutic drugs across the BBB into the CNS, thus the efficacy of CNS pharmacotherapy is limited.

Abstract Despite the fact that phraseology is present-day and appealing theme in linguistic, that many linguists gain from, which is due to fact that our language is made up of many steady and idiomatic structures that foreign students have to learn, this scientific discipline is still an area where the linguists have not yet agreed on the definition of its basic unit and field of research. Besides that, there is evident variance in the number of works within phraseology and phraseography in Czech and Serbian linguistics. The main objective of this dissertation is to analyse the Czech and Serbian phraseological theory, classification of phrasemes and phraseography, including the theoretical background to create a bilingual phraseological dictionary. The analysis was based on field of definition of phrasemes, its formal distribution, equivalents on all combinatorial levels and design of dictionary entry in monolingual and bilingual phraseological dictionaries.

To investigate the role of these transporters in the transplacental pharmacokinetics, the in situ method of dually perfused rat term placenta was employed in open- and closed-circuit arrangements; 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP+) was used as a model substrate of both OCT 3 and MATE 1. We provide evidence that OCT 3 and MATE 1 cause considerable asymmetry between maternal-to-fetal and fetal-to-maternal transport of MPP+ in favor of fetomaternal direction. Using closed- circuit [...] ...|$|R

Iveta Nováková Consultant: <b>Prof.</b> PharmDr. <b>František</b> Štaud, Ph. D. Title of Thesis: Transport of NSAIDS {{across a}} blood-brain barrier in vitro model based on cell line PBMEC/C 1 - 2 The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has a {{prominent}} role in regulation of the transport of substances {{into and out of the}} central nervous system (CNS). Partly, the BBB inhibits the entrance of substances harmful for the brain, it regulates the delivery of needed substances and it takes part in efflux of useless substances as well. The equilibrium of these regulation systems is essential for the correct function of the CNS, without which the homeostasis would be disturbed. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are very well known for their anti- inflammatory effect, for reduction of fever and pain. Due to their bright, everyday usage, some side effects on the brain were observed (sleepiness, giddiness, nausea). This has evoked the question, how NSAIDs can cross the BBB. PBMEC/C 1 - 2 cell monolayer was used as an in vitro model of the BBB. The transport of following NSAIDs was investigated: celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, lornoxicam, meloxicam, piroxicam and tenoxicam. The experiments were carried out [...] ...|$|R

Supervisors' e-mail address: {{he has not}} Abstract If we want {{to study}} {{abilities}} of certain pupils or other people in a given area, we can give them a didactial test, which would consist of items testing the abilities in question. The goal is then to determine the qualities of the people (ability parameter) and the relative difficulty of the questions (parameters of the questions) {{on the basis of}} the answers. Further we estimate how would a pupil, who have passed just one part of the test (assuming we have the item parameters of the whole test), would perform in the rest of the test. This is the research area of the Item Reponse Theory (IRT). In the introductory section the reasons are given for why we should use the IRT rather than the classical test theory for evaluating didactical test results, althought it's not regulary done in our country. The dichotomous Rasch model, which is one of the main IRT models, is described in detail. First the model is derived and then its main features presented. For the case of Rasch models we also demonstrate the most used methods of estimation of the ability and difficulty parameters [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of whether the technical standards have an impact on quality. We understand quality as a degree of compliance of requirements of a set of inherent features. Inherent feature means its own internal character of the object, whose quality is dealt. Quality and standards passed a long development, both from a point of law, as well as history, which began as early as in the old Mesopotamia by reference in Chammurapi Code. Since then, the quality changed its definition for several times, but the meaning of quality remains the same. It is necessary to mention the initiator of the quality who contributed by their work to its development, such as <b>Prof.</b> RNDr. <b>František</b> Egermayer, DrSc., who was the most significant initiator of modern understanding of quality in our country, then it is Dr. Joseph M. Juran, renowned author and "father" of modern quality management, also we must not forget William Edwards Deming, an American statesman and professor who is the most known of his work in Japan, and not least, world-famous personality Agnes Waddell, and other prominent personalities in this field. Today, quality control and normalizing ensure the main government authorities, such as Ministry of Industry and Trade of CR, which also ensures the management of other government bodies (ÚNMZ, ČMI, ČIA, see Chapter 6). The very Ministry of Industry and Trade may encharge a corporate entity to creation assurance and issuing Czech technical standards, their amendments and repeal. This assignment is non-transferable. As long as this assignment is valid, no other corporate entity must be encharged for this activity. There is no legal claim for this assignment. The costs of the creation of the Czech technical standards are covered by a person who requires processing. The costs of the creation of standards, notably the Czech technical standards transposing European standards, prepared pursuant to the request of the ministries or other central government departments and the costs associated with membership in international and European standardization organizations are paid by the State. In creation and issuing the Czech technical standards, their changes and cancellation must be provided the conditions laid down in the decision to assignment, as set out in Chapter 3...|$|R
