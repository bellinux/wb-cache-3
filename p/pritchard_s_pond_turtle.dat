We first obtained an ecogeographical favourability model for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle.</b> We then modelled the presence/absence of the red-eared slider in the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> range and obtained an encroachment favourability model. We also obtained a favourability model for the red-eared slider using the ecogeographical favourability for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> as a predictor. When favourability for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> was high, favourability for the red-eared slider was low, suggesting that in these areas the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> may resist encroachment by the red-eared slider. We also calculated favourability overlap between the two species, which is their simultaneous favourability. Grids with low overlap had higher favourability values for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> and, consequently, were of lesser conservation concern. A few grids had high values for both species, being potentially suitable for coexistence. Grids with intermediate overlap had similar intermediate favourability values for both species and were therefore areas where the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> was more vulnerable to encroachment by the red-eared slider. We mapped the favourability overlap to provide a map of vulnerability of the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> to encroachment by the red-eared slider.

50|$|The Fujian <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> {{described}} as Mauremys iversoni, is a farm-bred hybrid, between yellow <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> (usually females) {{and the golden}} coin turtle or Cuora cyclornata (usually males). Similarly, the turtles {{described as}} Mauremys pritchardi are farm-bred and wild-occurring hybrids between the Chinese <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> and the yellow <b>pond</b> <b>turtle.</b> While {{it is not unusual}} for valid species of geoemydid turtles to arise from hybrids, this is yet to be discussed with M. pritchardi; M. iversoni is probably not, since they only seem to be produced in farms and most males are sterile.|$|R

50|$|The western <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> (Actinemys marmorata or Emys marmorata), or Pacific <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} turtle growing to approximately 20 cm in carapace length.

As of July 2010, 17 juvenile turtles were released from captivity. This process is known as headstarting, where hatchlings are raised in captivity until they are large enough to avoid predators and then released to the wild.|$|R

50|$|One subspecies, Mauremys mutica kami, is {{currently}} {{recognized in the}} Ryukyu Islands. Research has shown unexpected genetic diversity in M. mutica, raising the possibility that additional subspecies might exist. Evidence of widespread hybridization further complicates efforts to understand the genetics of this and related species. Several hybrid Asian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> that were described as new species {{have been found to}} be hybrids. Fujian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> (Mauremys iversoni) are hybrid specimens mainly produced in Chinese turtle farms, usually from matings between female yellow <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> and golden coin turtles (Cuora trifasciata) males. The supposed Mauremys pritchardi turtles are wild and captive-bred hybrids between the present species and the Chinese <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chinemys reevesi).|$|R

Any individuals that are available as pets therefore need to be kept separate from other members of the family to prevent hybridization.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to their aquatic habitat, terrestrial habitat is also extremely important for Western <b>pond</b> <b>turtles.</b> Since many intermittent ponds can dry up during summer and fall months along the west coast, especially during times of drought, <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> can spend upwards of 200 days out of water. Many turtles overwinter outside of the water, during which time they often create their nest for the year.|$|R
