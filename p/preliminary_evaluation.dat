5|$|Plans for a {{realignment}} of the Glaven channel {{meant that}} the Eye would be left unprotected {{to the north of}} the river, and would eventually be destroyed by coastal change. It was decided that the only practical course of action was to investigate the site while it still existed, and a <b>preliminary</b> <b>evaluation</b> was carried out in 2003 as preparation for a full survey in 2004–05. The surveyed area covered 10ha (25acre), significantly more than the 0.4ha (1acre) of the 1998 investigations. 50 trenches were excavated in a herringbone pattern outside the buildings, each 50m long and 1.80m wide (194 by 5.9ft), and six trenches of varying dimensions were created inside the chapel. The latter equated in total area to two of the standard trenches. The geology was investigated with eight boreholes, and geophysics (magnetometry and metal detection) were used to locate subsurface anomalies.|$|E

25|$|Four prototypes were constructed, {{with the}} first YUH-60A flying on 17 October 1974. Prior to {{delivery}} of the prototypes to the US Army, a <b>preliminary</b> <b>evaluation</b> was conducted in November 1975 to ensure the aircraft could be operated safely during all testing. Three of the prototypes were delivered to the Army in March 1976, for evaluation against the rival Boeing-Vertol design, the YUH-61A, and one was kept by Sikorsky for internal research. The Army selected the UH-60 for production in December 1976. Deliveries of the UH-60A to the Army began in October 1978 and the helicopter entered service in June 1979.|$|E

In June 2016, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer made a left turn {{in front of the}} Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The NHTSA's <b>preliminary</b> <b>evaluation</b> was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use {{at the time of the}} crash, which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.|$|E
25|$|As with {{virtually}} all of the test programs conducted during the war years, most of the actual flight test work on the P-59 was conducted by the contractor. Although Army Air Forces (AAF) pilots flew the aircraft from time to time, and flight test engineers from Wright Field reviewed the data, the formal preliminary military test and evaluation program did not commence until the Fall of 1943, a year after the first flight. Designed to validate the contractor's reports, this <b>preliminary</b> <b>evaluation</b> consisted of a very limited number of flights and was essentially completed within a month. Formal operational suitability and accelerated service tests did not get underway until 1944, well after the AAF had decided that the airplane would not be suitable for combat operations and would, instead, be relegated to a training role.|$|E

25|$|The United States Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{performed}} {{indoor air}} quality testing for formaldehyde {{in some of the}} units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency. The CDC's <b>preliminary</b> <b>evaluation</b> of a scientifically established random sample of 519 travel trailers and manufactured homes tested between December 21, 2007, and January 23, 2008 (2+ years after manufacture), showed average levels of formaldehyde in all units of about 0.077 parts per million (ppm). Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR, division of the CDC) Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm. Levels measured ranged from 0.003 ppm to 0.59 ppm.|$|E
