Its fine-grained SPMD programming model {{is suitable for}} many computing intensive applications. In this paper, we present a <b>parallel</b> <b>gate</b> level logic simulation algorithm and study its implementation on an XMT processor. The test results show that hundreds-fold speedup can be achieved...|$|R
