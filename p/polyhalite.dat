50|$|Carnallite {{occurs with}} a {{sequence}} of potassium and magnesium evaporite minerals: sylvite, kainite, picromerite, <b>polyhalite,</b> and kieserite. Carnallite is an uncommon double chloride mineral that only forms under specific environmental conditions in an evaporating sea or sedimentary basin. It is mined for both potassium and magnesium and occurs in the evaporite deposits of Carlsbad, New Mexico; the Paradox Basin in Colorado and Utah; Stassfurt, Germany; the Perm Basin, Russia; and the Williston Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. These deposits date from the Devonian through the Permian Periods. In contrast, both Israel and Jordan produce potash from the Dead Sea by using evaporation pans to further concentrate the brine until carnallite precipitates, dredging the carnallite from the pans, and processing to remove the magnesium chloride from the potassium chloride.|$|E
50|$|El Capitan is the southern-most {{peak of the}} Guadalupe escarpment, {{an ancient}} {{limestone}} reef that forms the present-day Guadalupe Mountains. These mountains are an exposed portion of the Capitan Reef Barrier, a 350-mile long reef constructed primarily from calcareous sponges, encrusting algae, such as stromatolites, and lime-rich mud directly from the ocean. This reef surrounded much of the Delaware Sea, an inland ocean that covered parts of modern southern New Mexico and Trans-Pecos Texas in the Permian Era (approx. 290 million years ago). Near {{the end of the}} upper Permian era, in the Ochoan epoch, the outlet that allowed sea water to enter the inland waters began to silt over, occasionally closing the inland sea from its source. Mineral-rich and cut off from replenishment, the inland sea began to evaporate into layers of alternating gray anhydrite/gypsum, brown calcite, and halite, which formed the Castile Formation. As salt concentrations increased, laminated halite, anhydrite, sylvite, and <b>polyhalite</b> formed the Salado Formation, which eventually covered and grew beyond the lower Castile Formation.|$|E

5000|$|Marine evaporites {{tend to have}} thicker {{deposits}} and are usually the focus of more extensive research. [...] They also have a system of evaporation. When scientists evaporate ocean water in a laboratory, the minerals are deposited in a defined order that was first demonstrated by Usiglio in 1884. The {{first phase of the}} experiment begins when about 50% of the original water depth remains. At this point, minor carbonates begin to form. The next phase in the sequence comes when the experiment is left with about 20% of its original level. At this point, the mineral gypsum begins to form, which is then followed by halite at 10%, excluding carbonate minerals that tend not to be evaporates. The most common minerals that are generally considered to be the most representative of marine evaporates are calcite, gypsum and anhydrite, halite, sylvite, carnallite, langbeinite, <b>polyhalite,</b> and kainite. Kieserite (MgSO4) may also be included, which often will make up less than four percent of the overall content. However, there are approximately 80 different minerals that have been reported found in evaporite deposits (Stewart,1963;Warren,1999), though only about a dozen are common enough to be considered important rock formers.|$|E

Extraction potassium from <b>polyhalite</b> using in-situ leaching technology can help to resolve the problem of potassium shortage. This paper indicates a modeling study of leaching <b>polyhalite</b> in laboratory. Using CaCl 2 as lixiviant, the effect of the concentration of lixiviant, granularity of mineral, the infiltration velocity and the length of infiltration route are studied by analyzing potassium concentration in leaching solution. The experiment results show that the granularity of mineral {{is one of the most}} influencing factors to the recovery of K+. When granularity of mineral is changed from 2 - 3 mm to 5 - 8 mm, the recovery of K+ decreased from 80. 19 % to 42. 17 %. The recovery of K+ increases with the infiltration velocity and the length of infiltration route and the concentration of K+ in lixiviating solution can be heightened to 12. 1 g/L by increasing the length of infiltration route. The lixiviation process matches the metal dissolution kinetic equation. According to the experiential results, the parameters in equation are calculated. When the infiltration velocity is increased from 0. 159 m/h to 0. 318 m/h, the leaching velocity changed from 0. 278 h- 1 to 0. 673 h- 1 and the time of metal fully leaching to solution changed from 2. 333 h to 0. 951 h...|$|E

Sample 22 - 3, 24 - 30 cm from Site 374 contains halite in associa-tion with <b>polyhalite,</b> sulfoborite, sylvite, bischofite, and clay minerals. The bromine content in halite ranges from 114 to 218 ppm. The halite was precipitated with <b>polyhalite</b> from an evapo-rated seawater.

40|$|Quantifying the {{geometries}} of evaporite deposits at a < 1 km {{scale is}} critical {{in our understanding of}} similar ancient depositional systems, but is challenging given evaporite mineral dissolution at surface conditions. Two high-resolution stratigraphic studies in mines provide insight into the geometries, dimensions, and spatial distributions of sedimentary bodies in 3 -D at a < 1 -km scale in evaporites. A field mapping study was conducted in Brightling (Purbeck Group) and Boulby (Zechstein Group) mines, in southeast and northeast England, respectively. This is integrated with XRD, petrography, and δ 13 C and δ 18 O isotope analyses. The evolution and conditions of sedimentation during the Tithonian in the Weald Basin is also evaluated. A newly defined megasequence boundary {{at the base of the}} Purbeck Group is suggested to mark the onset of rifting of the Bay of Biscay and to the north of the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone, which implies an earlier rifting phase than previously proposed. Basal Purbeck lateral facies changes are influenced by the position in the Weald Basin, normal fault systems, and relative sea level changes. In Brightling Mine, the basal Purbeck exhibits carbonate-evaporite shoaling upward cycles, likely controlled by localized high-frequency relative sea level changes and/or sabkha hydrology. The dynamic process of evaporite deposition led to subtle stratigraphic heterogeneities and changes in bed thicknesses, but largely continuous lateral bedding. Boulby Mine offers a unique opportunity to study early deformation structures in ancient <b>polyhalite</b> that formed in playa conditions. The controlling mechanism that formed these syndepositional <b>polyhalite</b> tepees is attributed to soft sediment deformation via <b>polyhalite</b> dewatering coupled with penecontemporaneous precipitation of halite during fluid escape.

40|$|Clay partings in the ore beds in a New Mexico {{evaporite}} section {{include a}} range of mixed-layer clay mineral sequences of the corrensite type. Specimens range from nearly regular alternations to sequences which depart from regularity to moderate degrees. The ore bodies consist of halite, <b>polyhalite,</b> sylvite, magnesite, dolomite, carnallite, and iron oxides. Observed x-ray diffraction effects from representative specimens are compared with synthesized effects for montmorillonite- or vermiculite-chlorite layer sequences. It is concluded that the segregation of the abundant Mg interlayer content into specific, regularly spaced interlayers represents the equilibrium relationship between a mont-morillonite-chlorite or vermiculite-chlorite mixed assemblage and a mildly acid, Mg 2 +-, Na+-, and K+-rich environment. Occurrences of the regularly alternating corrensite (Lippman, 1954; Bradley and Weaver, 1956) type of chloritic clay mineral, and of more or less nearly regularly alternating assemblages are being reported with increasing frequency.

These. measurements provided mean homogenization temperatures of 17 – 18 C, with a range between 10 – 11 C and. 28 – 29 C, which should be close to the SST of the Mediterranean Sea during halite deposition. The occurrence. of major elements such as Cl, Na, Mg, S, Ca, and K within the halite fluid inclusions, together with the. presence of minerals such as pentahydrite, <b>polyhalite,</b> and Ca-, K-, and Mg-sulfates, indicates that these salt. bodies originated from mainly marine water. Taking into account both the present-day annual SST of the.
