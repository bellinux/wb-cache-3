5|$|Unlike <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> such as gold or platinum, gem {{diamonds}} do not {{trade as}} a commodity: {{there is a}} substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.|$|E
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages {{compared to other}} parts of the Spanish Empire such as Mexico or Peru, which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy. It lacked deposits of gold or other <b>precious</b> <b>metals,</b> nor did it have established native civilizations to subject to the encomienda.|$|E
5|$|Osmium {{is usually}} {{sold as a}} minimum 99.9% pure powder. Like other <b>precious</b> <b>metals,</b> it is {{measured}} by troy weight and by grams. Its price in 2012 was about $400 per troy ounce (or about $13,000 per kilogram), depending on the quantity and its supplier.|$|E
5000|$|A {{base metal}} {{is a common}} and {{inexpensive}} metal, {{as opposed to a}} <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> such as gold or silver. A long-time goal of alchemists was the transmutation of a [...] (low grade) <b>metal</b> into a <b>precious</b> <b>metal.</b> In numismatics, coins often derived their value from the <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> content; however, base metals have been also used in coins in the past and today.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> zone at Que River {{is an area}} in the {{northern}} parts of the eastern footwall containing anomalously high amounts of gold and silver relative to base metals {{when compared to the}} sulphide orebodies {{and the rest of the}} stringer system. The results of earlier work on the <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> zone may be found in McGoldrick & Large (1987) and Jenkins (1988). In this report, the results of fluid inclusion thermometric measurements on the <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> zone and parts of PQ lens are presented, and further conclusions are drawn regarding the origins of the <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> zone...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{significant}} item currently up for debate is {{the recognition of}} palladium as a <b>precious</b> <b>metal.</b> Some member nations recognize palladium as a <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> while others do not. (See list of nations below.) ...|$|R
5|$|Palladium is also {{produced}} in nuclear fission reactors {{and can be}} extracted from spent nuclear fuel (see synthesis of <b>precious</b> <b>metals),</b> though this source for palladium is not used. None of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract palladium from the high-level radioactive waste.|$|E
5|$|Silver-containing brazing alloys {{are used}} for brazing {{metallic}} materials, mostly cobalt, nickel, and copper-based alloys, tool steels, and <b>precious</b> <b>metals.</b> The basic components are silver and copper, with other elements selected according to the specific application desired: examples include zinc, tin, cadmium, palladium, manganese, and phosphorus. Silver provides increased workability and corrosion resistance during usage.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known metals—common metals such as iron, copper, and tin, and <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> such as silver, gold, and platinum—are {{heavy metals}}. From 1809 onwards, light metals, such as magnesium, aluminium, and titanium, were discovered, {{as well as}} less well-known heavy metals including gallium, thallium, and hafnium.|$|E
50|$|Clipping is {{the act of}} shaving off a {{small portion}} of a <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> coin for profit. Over time, the <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> {{clippings}} could be saved up and melted into bullion or used to make new coins.|$|R
50|$|Morley {{founded the}} <b>Precious</b> <b>Metal</b> label {{sometime}} in the late 1980s to document, first on cassette and later LP and CD, his own work as Gate. Most of the releases on <b>Precious</b> <b>Metal</b> were limited to very small quantities.|$|R
5000|$|Robin began {{performing}} professionally {{at the age}} of 16 in the mid-80's playing {{guitar in}} the all-female hard rock band <b>Precious</b> <b>Metal.</b> [...] The band performed several local shows at venues such as FM Station, Club Lingerie, Whisky a Go Go and The Roxy gaining a strong LA following. This exposure brought <b>Precious</b> <b>Metal</b> to the attention of influential KROQ radio disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer who played their music on his local radio program. Russ Regan, head of Polygram Records, heard <b>Precious</b> <b>Metal</b> on KROQ and signed the band soon afterwards, releasing their debut record Right Here, Right Now in 1985 on Mercury Records. [...] After leaving Polygram, the band was picked up by Capitol Records subsidiary label Chameleon who released their final two albums That Kind of Girl in 1988 and <b>Precious</b> <b>Metal</b> in 1990. [...] While in <b>Precious</b> <b>Metal,</b> Robin wrote songs with members of Heart, Poison and Cheap Trick.|$|R

5|$|After {{leaving the}} WWF in 1990, Smith {{was married to}} a man named Harvey Zitron. Zitron was sentenced to 81 months in federal prison for 10 counts of filing false tax returns, {{identity}} theft and access device fraud. After divorcing, she moved to Louisiana and opened a telemarketing company that sold industrial chemicals and <b>precious</b> <b>metals.</b> Later, she opened a real estate appraisal business. During this time, Smith had a drinking problem but eventually was able to quit altogether.|$|E

50|$|According to the Armenian Development Agency, Armenia {{has more}} than 670 mines of {{construction}} and aggregate minerals, including 30 base <b>metal</b> and <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> mines. Among these mines, about 400 mines, including 22 base metal, non-ferrous <b>metal</b> and <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> mines are currently being exploited.|$|R
50|$|There are ten assay offices at:Polish Assay Offices {{test and}} mark <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> alloy {{articles}} (gold, silver and platinum group metals). They also supervise compliance with Hallmarking Law at processing plants and <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> alloy sales points. All Assay Offices must {{report to the}} Central Office of Measures.|$|R
5|$|Aurelian's {{attempt to}} reform the {{currency}} had failed; the denarius was dead. Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces. The new system consisted of five coins: the aureus/solidus, a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the argenteus, a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the follis, {{sometimes referred to as}} the laureatus A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck at the rate of thirty-two to the pound; the radiatus, a small copper coin struck at the rate of 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and a coin known today as the laureatus B, a smaller copper coin struck at the rate of 192 to the pound. Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> requisitioned).|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Union Bank of Switzerland {{acquired}} an 80% stake in Argor SA, a Swiss <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> refinery founded in 1951 in the canton of Ticino. In 1973, the bank increased the stake to full 100% ownership, though the ownership was ultimately sold between 1986 and 1999 to Argor-Heraeus SA. UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor-Heraeus which {{is famous for}} the unique kinebar holographic technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is an {{excellent}} alloying agent for certain <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> and {{is used in the}} fire assay as a collector of platinum group elements (PGE). As such, nickel is capable of fully collecting all 6 PGE elements from ores, and of partially collecting gold. High-throughput nickel mines may also engage in PGE recovery (primarily platinum and palladium); examples are Norilsk in Russia and the Sudbury Basin in Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Non-circulating bullion coins {{have been}} {{produced}} each year since 1986. They {{can be found in}} silver, gold and also platinum since 1997. The face value of these coins is legal as tender, but does not actually reflect the value of the <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> contained therein. On May 11, 2011, Utah became the first state to accept these coins as the value of the <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> in common transactions. [...] The Utah State Treasurer assigns a numerical <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> value to these coins each week based on the spot metal prices.|$|R
40|$|A {{quantity}} of reagent grade tin metal or compound, chloride-free, and high-surface-area silica spheres {{are placed in}} deionized water, followed by deaerating the mixture by boiling and adding an oxidizing agent, such as nitric acid. The nitric acid oxidizes the tin to metastannic acid which coats the spheres because the acid is absorbed on the substrate. The metastannic acid becomes tin oxide upon drying and calcining. The tin-oxide coated silica spheres are then placed in water and boiled. A chloride-free <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> compound in aqueous solution is then added to the mixture containing the spheres, and the <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> compound is reduced to a <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> by use of a suitable reducing agent such as formic acid. Very beneficial results were obtained using the <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> compound tetraammine platinum(II) hydroxide...|$|R
40|$|Use {{of biomass}} as {{alternatives}} to petrochemicals {{has attracted a}} broad range of scientific and industrial interests. We propose here a novel environmentally-friendly recycle system for <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> ions such as gold and platinum ions using protein-rich biomass. My keynote lecture is composed of three pieces; (1) selective adsorption of <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> ions onto proteins, (2) the mechanism study of the metal ion adsorption, and (3) demonstration of selective recovery of <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> ions from actual copper refining solution. A biomass was found to have an extremely high loading potential 250 g/kg-biomass for gold ions. This article describes not only scientific investigations but also practicality of the strategy. The recycle system proposed here will enable selective recovery of <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> ions from industrial wastewater without extra emissions of CO 2...|$|R
5|$|The Little Applegate River's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled about 11,000 {{years ago by}} the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede Native American tribes. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the early 19th century. Two boomtowns—Sterlingville and Buncom—were founded in the 1850s and grew rapidly as gold and other <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> were discovered. They slowly declined in population as the supply of gold was exhausted; only three buildings remain in Buncom, while Sterlingville was abandoned and later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|There is archeological {{evidence}} that humans {{have attempted to}} replace missing teeth with root form implants for thousands of years. Remains from ancient China (dating 4000 years ago) have carved bamboo pegs, tapped into the bone, to replace lost teeth, and 2000-year-old remains from ancient Egypt have similarly shaped pegs made of <b>precious</b> <b>metals.</b> Some Egyptian mummies {{were found to have}} transplanted human teeth, and in other instances, teeth made of ivory.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the gold}} coins were {{certainly}} the most valuable issue, followed by the silver one, the exact relationship between the three issues (gold, silver, and bronze) is not known. The supply of gold was closely controlled by the Aksumite state, as noted by Cosmas Indicopleustes, and other <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> were undoubtedly also closely controlled, allowing the Aksumite state to ensure the usage of its currency.|$|E
