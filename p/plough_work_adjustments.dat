Eight healthy bullocks which were yoked in pairs, aged between three to five years, used for <b>ploughing</b> <b>work</b> by the farmers for their routine agricultural work were selected for the present study. The <b>ploughing</b> <b>work</b> was carried out {{for a period of}} four hours during morning hours on each day of observation in the fields of ragi cultivation using simple country made wooden plough with an iron blade attached. The blood samples were collected in to the EDTA vials from each bullock aseptically by jugular venipuncture just before <b>ploughing</b> <b>work</b> at the cattle shed and after <b>ploughing</b> <b>work</b> in the field within ten minutes of completion of work. All the hematological parameters were determined with the help of hematology autoanalyzer. There was significant increase (P< 0. 05) in the level of all the parameters in the individual bullocks at post work compared to pre work which could be due to hemoconcentration because of vapourization of body fluids during work. It was concluded that the determination of hematological parameters could be useful to take up certain animal welfare measures such as the duration of work period, providing sufficient drinking water and shelter after subjecting the bullocks for <b>ploughing</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose The aims of {{this study}} are: (1) to {{describe}} the prevalence of needed and implemented <b>work</b> <b>adjustments</b> in {{a representative sample of}} Dutch employees with a chronic disease; and (2) to assess the effects of needed and implemented <b>work</b> <b>adjustments</b> on sick leave. Methods The prevalence of <b>work</b> <b>adjustments</b> was assessed in employees with a chronic disease, aged between 15 and 65 years (n = 7, 687) from the 2007 Netherlands Working Conditions Survey (NWCS). Of these, N = 2, 631 employees participated in the Netherlands Working Conditions Cohort Study (NWCCS) measurements in 2008 and 2009. The NWCCS data were used to investigate the effects of <b>work</b> <b>adjustments</b> on sick leave. All data were self-reported. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed to analyse differences in sick leave in 2007, 2008 and 2009 between employees with and without a need for <b>work</b> <b>adjustments,</b> for those who reported an implemented <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> and those who did not. Results In 2007, the prevalence of implemented <b>work</b> <b>adjustments</b> among Dutch employees with a chronic disease was 22 %, while 30 % reported the need of a <b>work</b> <b>adjustment.</b> In employees with and without a need for <b>work</b> <b>adjustments</b> in 2007, a <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> in 2008 was significantly associated with a decrease in sick leave from 2007 to 2009. Conclusion The need for <b>work</b> <b>adjustments</b> is higher than the implementation of <b>work</b> <b>adjustments.</b> <b>Work</b> <b>adjustments</b> should be considered more often for employees with chronic diseases, because implementation of a <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> is associated with a decrease in sick leave. ...|$|R

The study presents findings from an organizational-based survey, from which 610 respondents reported managing employees with a chronic illness. These included arthritis, musculoskeletal pain, diabetes, asthma, migraine, heart disease, irritable bowel syndrome and depression. The results indicate that depression had the largest impact in all three work demand categories, while musculoskeletal pain principally affected physical work demands and migraine and diabetes largely affected cognitive work demands. For other chronic illnesses, it was the generic symptoms of the illness (for example, fatigue) that resulted in a work limitation, rather than the specific nature of the illness itself.

With increased prevalance rates of autism, shortage of well-trained special needs teachers specialising in autism, a commitment of the Department of Education to provide teacher professional development and inclusive education for learners with autism, warranted the study to be conducted in order to promote career development of teachers in South Africa. Using an interpretivist paradigm, this qualitative study utilised a purposive sample of 5 teachers who were teachers of learneres of autism in an autism-specific independent school in Joahnesburg. Through individual interviews, collages and a focus group discussion the study sought to find out what the teachers’ career development needs are, their current level of <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> and what would facilitate better <b>work</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The Theory of <b>Work</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (Dawis, England, & Lofquist, A Theory of <b>Work</b> <b>Adjustment,</b> 1964) and Vygotsky’s social constructionist view on disability were used as theories to support the literature review and the study findings due to its relevancy to <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> and learners with autism’s participation in schools and society.

Overseas assignments are more stressful than domestic assignments, and their relatively high failure rates are well documented. We suggest, however, that certain types of stress can positively affect expatriate performance.

We also conceptualize and empirically investigate the moderating influence of expatriates' perceptions of organizational support and supervisor support. Our hypotheses are tested using a sample of 125 Japanese expatriate managers in Germany. We find that role ambiguity is a hindrance stressor and negatively affects job satisfaction and <b>work</b> <b>adjustment,</b> while role novelty acts as a challenge stressor and positively affects job satisfaction, task performance and <b>work</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Our findings also show that perceived organizational support attenuates {{the negative effects of}} role ambiguity on <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> and strengthens the positive effect of role novelty on job satisfaction.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{main purpose}} of this study was to discuss the {{nationality}} differences of foreign nurse aides and the effect of work stressors influencing <b>work</b> <b>adjustment.</b> And of helping them adapt to Taiwanese society, we summarized the difficulties that foreign nurse aides face in Taiwan. Methods The subjects included 80 foreign nurse aides from the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam who worked in long-term care facilities in Tao Yuan County. We recruited volunteers at the participating facilities to complete the anonymous questionnaires. The return rate of the questionnaire was 88. 75 %. The validated instruments of Hershenson's (1981) and Schaefer and Moos (1993) were adopted to measure work stressors and <b>work</b> <b>adjustment,</b> respectively. A forward-backward translation process was used in this study. Results Indonesian foreign nurse aides respect their work, and are better workers than Vietnamese and Filipino nurse aids in many respects, which shows how the nationality of the foreign nurse aides might affect <b>work</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The stress created from patient care tasks influenced the foreign nurse aides' personal relationships at work and also affected their attitude when they performed their tasks. In addition, pressure from their supervisors might have affected their work skills, work habits, personal relationships, self-concepts or work attitudes. Moreover, a heavy workload and improper scheduling might have affected the personal relationships and work attitudes of the foreign nurse aides. It was found that work stressors had a significant correlation with <b>work</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Conclusions The results of the present study indicate that training programs are important factors for <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> among foreign nurse aides. Furthermore, celebration and leisure activities could be provided to release them from work stressors. More effort should be put into improving the working environment, namely providing a more supportive and enriching atmosphere. Based on these findings, we have a better understanding of how to assist foreign nurse aides in the future. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between the facets of cultural intelligence (CQ) (cognitive, meta-cognitive, motivational and behavioural) and the dimensions of cross-cultural adjustment (interaction, general and <b>work</b> <b>adjustment).</b> Design/methodology/approach: Interviews and questionnaire survey were carried out with British expatriates from the architectural, engineering and construction sector. A total of 191 respondents, with experience from 29 different countries, actively participated in this research. Structural equation model was subsequently developed to investigate the relationship between elements of CQ and cross-cultural adjustment. Findings: Results of structural equation modelling revealed that collectively all the four aspects of CQ have significant influence on general, interaction and <b>work</b> <b>adjustment,</b> particularly motivational and cognitive CQ. Cognitive CQ which empowers the expatriates with in-depth knowledge about different cultures was a significant predictor of interaction and <b>work</b> <b>adjustment,</b> whereas, motivational CQ is a significant predictor for general and <b>work</b> <b>adjustment.</b> However, no support was gathered for meta-cognitive and behavioural aspects of CQ. Practical implications: Globally, construction companies and projects are entering an era of increased internationalisation which has prompted the migration/promotion of British construction professionals to different parts of the world for their specialised capabilities and skills. Thus, it is of utmost importance that these professionals adjust to their new world of varied culture and still be productive in their work. Originality/value: An understanding of these essential factors can actually help British construction organisations to select and mentor individuals and to provide necessary training for successful international assignments...|$|R

40|$|To improve {{efficiency}} and reduce costs, many organisations in the United Kingdom and other industrialised countries have embarked on outsourcing practices for {{resources such as}} skills and products. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine whether being in-house or outsourced has a significant effect on an employee's work outcomes i. e. <b>work</b> <b>adjustment,</b> job satisfaction and organisation commitment. And if they do, which of the two employment contracts has a higher effect on which outcome or outcomes. In-house and outsourced employees from two major London-based teaching hospitals and one mid-sized hospital, and three major London-based colleges were studied. In the case of hospitals, agency (outsourced) nurses were compared with their in-house counterparts. For the college employees, supply (outsourced) teachers were compared with their in- house counterparts. In-house business administration staffs of the above hospitals and colleges were compared with their outsourced (agency) counterparts. The above organisations and occupations were selected for the study because they had large numbers of outsourced employees and exhibited a variety of working conditions, management styles and organisational cultures. The employees were compared on five <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> behaviour indicators (below), satisfaction with: career progress made nature of work and overall organisational atmosphere, and affective organisational commitment. The <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> behaviour indicators were: The extent to which an individual pursued the organisation's work values. The extent to which an individual sought to meet job demands. The extent to which an individual sought to adhere to the organisation's norms and traditions. The extent to which an individual sought to adjust to the overall organisational atmosphere. The extent to which an individual sought to maintain the organisation's standards. A survey method was used to collect the data as it was deemed the most appropriate strategy, and questionnaires were sent to the employees of the above organisations. Regression analysis, one-way and two-way analyses of variance, and discriminant analysis were used to test the posited hypotheses. The results were supportive of the main hypothesis that 'an in-house employment contract relates to (or predicts) an individual's <b>work</b> <b>adjustment,</b> job satisfaction and organisational commitment differently from an outsourced employment contract'. The general pattern was that in-house employees were better adjusted, had higher job satisfaction and were more positively affectively committed than their outsourced counterparts. However, there were exceptions, which were discussed and explained. <b>Work</b> <b>adjustment</b> - conceived as a fundamental and primary outcome - was used as an explanatory framework. It was also found that the <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> process differed in different occupations.

40|$|Human {{resource}} {{is an important}} asset in library operation and reengineering. When the individual brings skills to perform library tasks successfully and gets compensation for work performance under preferred conditions, both individual and library reach satisfied status. The satisfaction maintains the qualities of library services. <b>Work</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{is the process of}} achieving and maintaining such satisfaction. It is crucial to reveal the process and factors that have impact on the process. The aims of this study were to reveal the <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> process and important factors influence the process. The author used The Minnesota Theory of <b>Work</b> <b>Adjustment</b> as research framework, took internal and external satisfaction from TWA and Hershenson’s developmental model as tokens to enclose the degree of correspondence, process of reach the correspondence, factors influence the process and the changes occurred to the librarians during the process. Interview and document analysis were employed for data collection. Ten librarians and four middle managers were interviewed. The results show that the correspondence of the requirements of individuals and libraries was achieved, but influenced by the environmental conditions. It was indicated that there were three stages during the <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> process, “early adjustment”, “middle adjustment” and “late adjustment. ” Instead of linear process, <b>work</b> <b>adjustment</b> could be recurrent if the job rotation or reorganization occurred. The process was not only affected by personal factors, such as work experience, career stage and personalities, but also influenced by environmental factors, including personnel policies, supporting system. All the interviewed librarians showed the appreciation of enhancing competencies during the process. When dissatisfaction arose, the librarians would solve the issues by adjusting their expectation, thoughts and how the works were handled. It is also interesting to learn that working experience had both positive and negative impact during the process of <b>work</b> <b>adjustment.</b> 人力資源是圖書館變革的觸媒，當館員具備的能力與圖書館提供的條件，能夠互相滿足彼此需求，達成協調一致之平衡狀態時，圖書館可運作得更為順暢；若無法達成協調一致之平衡狀態，則可能導致館員工作適應的問題，造成圖書館組織運作的困難。為維持圖書館的服務品質與營運挑戰，圖書館應關注於館員工作適應情形與相關議題。 本研究之研究目的為瞭解館員工作適應之情況，並建構館員工作適應歷程，進而分析影響工作適應的因素，探索館員在工作適應歷程中的改變。研究依據明尼蘇達工作適應&# 63972;&# 63809;發展研究架構，以明尼蘇達工作適應&# 63972;&# 63809;與Hershenson工作適應發展模式提出之內在滿意與外在滿意，建構研究面向。研究採質性研究設計，選定四所規模、制度、館藏特色不同之大學圖書館為研究場域，透過深度訪談圖書館館員與其直屬主管，及蒐集受訪單位人事制度等相關文件，建構研究所需之分析資料，研究共訪談十位館員與四位主管。 研究結果發現，館員內在滿意與外在滿意之協調一致狀態，在不同環境條件下，存在差異性。館員工作適應歷程分為「適應初期」、「適應中期」、「適應後期」等階段，呈現重覆、交錯、循環過程，當工作調整或組織變動，館員可能進入另一工作適應歷程。影響館員工作適應歷程之個人因素包括年資與工作經驗、人格特質、家庭等，環境因素則為人際支持、升遷與獎懲制度、完善經驗傳承等。工作適應歷程中，館員除隨工作學習提升其專業知能，亦會試圖透過不同方式強化特定工作能力，同時面對不滿意狀態，會以改變自我期許與想法、調整個性、改變生活&# 27497;調、嘗試不同人際互動方式等扭轉不滿意程度。在工作適應歷程中，無論是館員或主管，對於工作適應歷程中，面對改變的感受，均以正向感受為多。 研究發現館員在工作適應過程中出現工作輪調、組織改變等情況，即可能促使工作適應歷程出現變化；影響館員工作適應歷程之各個因素中，年資與工作經驗，對於工作適應歷程會帶來正面及負面影響。第一章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究背景與動機	 1 第二節 研究目的	 4 第三節 研究問題	 4 第四節 研究方法	 5 第五節 研究範圍與限制	 6 第六節 名詞解釋	 6 第二章 文獻探討	 9 第一節 工作適應相關理論	 9 第二節 工作適應相關研究	 23 第三節 圖書館館員工作適應相關研究	 39 第三章 研究設計與實施	 49 第一節 研究架構	 49 第二節 研究對象	 50 第三節 研究方法	 55 第四節 資料處理與分析	 57 第五節 研究流程	 62 第四章 研究發現與分析	 65 第一節 大學圖書館館員工作適應之情況	 65 第二節 大學圖書館館員工作適應之歷程	 100 第三節 大學圖書館館員工作適應歷程之影響因素	 119 第四節 大學圖書館館員在工作適應歷程中之改變	 137 第五節 綜合討論	 150 第五章 研究結論與建議	 155 第一節 研究結論	 155 第二節 研究建議	 160 參考書目	 163 附錄一　研究邀請函	 172 附錄二　參與研究同意書	 173 附錄三　館員訪談大綱	 174 附錄四　主管訪談大綱	 175 附錄五　訪談日誌	 17...|$|R

The researchers surveyed Japanese expatriates assigned to the United States. Structural equation modeling was utilized to test our hypotheses and model. The results indicated that previous knowledge of the host country, language proficiency, willingness to communicate, and perception of the novelty of the host culture were differentially related to expatriates' adjustment to the host country. General and <b>work</b> <b>adjustments</b> were negatively related to expatriates' intent to return early. In addition, interrelationships among the adjustment dimensions were examined and the results indicated that general <b>adjustment</b> leads to <b>work</b> <b>adjustment,</b> which, in turn, influences interactional adjustment.
