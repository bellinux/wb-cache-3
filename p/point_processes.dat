In other words, complete information {{of a simple}} point process is captured entirely in its void probabilities, and two simple <b>point</b> <b>processes</b> have the same void probabilities if and if {{only if they are}} the same <b>point</b> <b>processes.</b> The case for Poisson process is sometimes known as Rényi's theorem, which is named after Alfréd Rényi who discovered the result for the case of a homogeneous point process in one-dimension.|$|E
25|$|Mathematical {{operations}} can {{be performed}} on <b>point</b> <b>processes</b> in order to new <b>point</b> <b>processes</b> and develop new mathematical models for the locations of certain objects. One example of an operation is known as thinning which entails deleting or removing the points of some point process according to a rule, creating a new process with the remaining points (the deleted points also form a point process).|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the concept}} of {{distance}} is of practical interest for applications, while topological structure is needed for Palm distributions, meaning that <b>point</b> <b>processes</b> are usually defined on mathematical spaces with metrics. Furthermore, a realization of a point process {{can be considered as}} a counting measure, so points processes are types of random measures known as random counting measures. In this context, the Poisson and other <b>point</b> <b>processes</b> has been studied on a locally compact second countable Hausdorff space.|$|E
5000|$|One <b>point</b> <b>process</b> {{that gives}} {{particularly}} convenient results under random <b>point</b> <b>process</b> operations is the Poisson <b>point</b> <b>process,</b> The Poisson <b>point</b> <b>process</b> often exhibits {{a type of}} mathematical closure such that when a <b>point</b> <b>process</b> operation is applied to some Poisson <b>point</b> <b>process,</b> then provided some conditions on the <b>point</b> <b>process</b> operation, the resulting process will be often another Poisson <b>point</b> <b>process</b> operation, hence it is often used as a mathematical model.|$|R
25|$|In general, when an {{operation}} {{is applied to}} a general <b>point</b> <b>process</b> the resulting process is usually not a Poisson <b>point</b> <b>process.</b> For example, if a <b>point</b> <b>process,</b> other than a Poisson, has its points randomly and independently displaced, then the process would not necessarily be a Poisson <b>point</b> <b>process.</b> However, under certain mathematical conditions for both the original <b>point</b> <b>process</b> and the random displacement, {{it has been shown}} via limit theorems that if the points of a <b>point</b> <b>process</b> are repeatedly displaced in a random and independent manner, then the finite-distribution of the <b>point</b> <b>process</b> will converge (weakly) to that of a Poisson <b>point</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{tractability}} of the Poisson {{process means}} that {{sometimes it is}} convenient to approximate a non-Poisson point process with a Poisson one. The overall aim is to approximate the both number of points of some point process {{and the location of}} each point by a Poisson point process. There a number of methods {{that can be used to}} justify, informally or rigorously, approximating the occurrence of random events or phenomena with suitable Poisson <b>point</b> <b>processes.</b> The more rigorous methods involve deriving upper bounds on the probability metrics between the Poisson and non-Poisson <b>point</b> <b>processes,</b> while other methods can be justified by less formal heuristics.|$|E
25|$|The Swede Conny Palm in his 1943 {{dissertation}} {{studied the}} Poisson and other <b>point</b> <b>processes</b> in the one-dimensional setting by examining {{them in terms}} of the statistical or stochastic dependence between the points in time.

25|$|In the {{downlink}} case, the transmitters and {{the receivers}} {{can be considered}} as two separate <b>point</b> <b>processes.</b> In the simplest case, there is one point-to-point channel per receiver (i.e. the user), and for a given receiver, this channel is from the closest transmitter (i.e. the base station) to the receiver. Another option consists in selecting the transmitter with the best signal power to the receiver. In any case, there may be several channels with the same transmitter.|$|E

2500|$|The {{operation}} clustering {{is performed}} when each point [...] of some <b>point</b> <b>process</b> [...] {{is replaced by}} another (possibly different) <b>point</b> <b>process.</b> If the original process [...] is a Poisson <b>point</b> <b>process,</b> then the resulting process [...] is called a Poisson cluster <b>point</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{terminology}} of <b>point</b> <b>process</b> {{theory in}} general {{has been criticized}} for being too varied.

25|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{operations are}} applied to random variables for different purposes. Sometimes these operations are regular expectations that produce the average or variance of a random variable. Others, such as characteristic functions (or Laplace transforms) of a random variable {{can be used to}} uniquely identify or characterize random variables and prove results like the central limit theorem. In the theory of <b>point</b> <b>processes</b> there exist analogous mathematical tools which usually exist in the forms of measures and functionals instead of moments and functions respectively.|$|E
25|$|Although models {{based on}} these and other <b>point</b> <b>processes</b> come closer to {{resembling}} reality in some situations, for example in the configuration of cellular base stations, they often suffer from a loss of tractability while the Poisson process greatly simplifies the mathematics and techniques, explaining its continued use for developing stochastic geometry models of wireless networks.

500|$|Other authors {{consider}} a point {{process as a}} stochastic process, where the process is indexed by sets of the underlying space on which it is defined, such as the real line or [...] -dimensional Euclidean space.

500|$|A point {{process is}} a {{collection}} of points randomly located on some mathematical space such as the real line, -dimensional Euclidean space, or more abstract spaces.

There are different interpretations of a point process, such a random counting measure or a random set. Some authors regard a point process and stochastic process as two different objects such that a point process is a random object that arises from or is associated with a stochastic process, though it has been remarked that the difference between <b>point</b> <b>processes</b> and stochastic processes is not clear.|$|E
