40|$|SummaryNegative bHLH {{transcription}} factor Hes 1 can inhibit neural stem cells (NSCs) from precocious neurogenesis through repressing proneural gene expression; therefore, sustenance of Hes 1 expression {{is crucial for}} NSC <b>pool</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Here we find that Ids, the dominant-negative regulators of proneural proteins, are expressed prior to proneural genes and share an overlapping expression pattern with Hes 1 in the early neural tube of chick embryos. Overexpression of Id 2 in the chick hindbrain upregulates Hes 1 expression and inhibits proneural gene expression and neuronal differentiation. By contrast, Hes 1 expression decreases, proneural gene expression expands, and neurogenesis occurs precociously in Id 1;Id 3 double knockout mice and in Id 1 – 3 RNAi-electroporated chick embryos. Mechanistic studies show that Id proteins interact directly with Hes 1 and release the negative feedback autoregulation of Hes 1 without interfering with its ability to affect other target genes. These results indicate that Id proteins participate in NSC maintenance through sustaining Hes 1 expression in early embryos...|$|R

With growing environmental concern and decreasing public support for new reservoirs, development and use of computer models for analysis of operation of existing system for improvement of its performance rather than designing new projects, is receiving considerable attention. In this background, this paper describes an application of simulation model (HEC- 5 1998) to analyze the performance of the DVC reservoir system on the river Damodar in eastern India in meeting demands as well as controlling flood for synthetically generated scenario (with projected future demand) and to explore an appropriate policy for improvement of its performance in the future scenario.|$|R

Analysis of spatial hydraulic patterns {{and the resulting}} boundary shear stress are required to aid understanding of river system behaviour. In this paper, the hydraulic processes active in a natural pool-riffle sequence are simulated using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Methods employed for the prescription of model boundary conditions are outlined. Model calculations are assessed using comparisons with field observations acquired over a range of flows. Simulations are then used to illustrate flow structures and patterns of boundary shear stress for a near-bankfull and an intermediate flow event. Results are used to assess existing theories that seek to explain the development and maintenance of pool-riffle sequences. Simulated results suggest that near-bed velocities and bed shear stresses decrease on riffles and increase in pools as discharge increases. Model simulations indicate that secondary flow acts to route near-bed flow over the downstream side of riffles and into the pool-head away from the centre of pools.

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that some cancers contain a population of stem-like TICs (tumor-initiating cells) and eliminating TICs may offer a new strategy to develop successful anti-cancer therapies. As molecular mechanisms underlying {{the maintenance of the}} TIC pool are poorly understood, the development of TIC-specific therapeutics remains a major challenge. We first identified and characterized TICs and non-TICs isolated from a mouse breast cancer model. TICs displayed increased tumorigenic potential, self-renewal, heterogeneous differentiation, and bipotency. Gene expression analysis and immunostaining of TICs and non-TICs revealed that FGFR 2 was preferentially expressed in TICs. Loss of FGFR 2 impaired self-renewal of TICs, thus resulting in marked decreases in the TIC population and tumorigenic potential. Restoration of FGFR 2 rescued the defects in TIC <b>pool</b> <b>maintenance,</b> bipotency, and breast tumor growth driven by FGFR 2 knockdown. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of FGFR 2 kinase activity led to a decrease in the TIC population which resulted in suppression of breast tumor growth. Moreover, human breast TICs isolated from patient tumor samples were found enriched in a FGFR 2 + population that was sufficient to initiate tumor growth. Our data suggest that FGFR 2 is essential in sustaining the breast TIC pool through promotion of self-renewal and maintenance of bipotent TICs, and raise th...|$|R

40|$|Suspension {{cultured cells}} of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv VFNT Cherry) adapted to water stress induced with {{polyethylene}} glycol 6000 (PEG), exhibit marked alterations in {{free amino acid}} pools (Handa et al. 1983 Plant Physiol 73 : 834 - 843). Using computer simulation models the in vivo rates of synthesis and utilization and compartmentation of free amino acid pools were determined from 15 N labeling kinetics after substituting [15 N]ammonium and [15 N]nitrate for the 14 N salts in the culture medium of cell lines adapted to 0 % and 25 % PEG. The 300 -fold elevated proline pool in 25 % PEG adapted cells is primarily the consequence of a 10 -fold elevated rate of proline synthesis via the glutamate pathway. Ornithine was insufficiently labeled {{to serve as a}} major precursor for proline. Our calculations suggest that the rate of proline synthesis only slightly exceeds the rate required to sustain both protein synthesis and proline <b>pool</b> <b>maintenance</b> with growth. Mechanisms must operate to restrict proline oxidation in adapted cells. The kinetics of labeling of proline in 25 % PEG adapted cells are consistent with a single, greatly enlarged metabolic pool of proline. The depletion of glutamine in adapted cells appears to be a consequence of a selective depletion of a large, metabolically inactive storage pool present in unadapted cultures. The labeling kinetics of the amino nitrogen groups of glutamine and glutamate are consistent with the operation of the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase cycle in both cell lines. However, we could not conclusively discriminate between the exclusive operation of the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase cycle and a 10 to 20 % contribution of the glutamate dehydrogenase pathway of ammonia assimilation. Adaptation to water stress leads to increased nitrogen flux from glutamate into alanine and γ-aminobutyrate, suggesting increased pyruvate availability and increased rates of glutamate decarboxylation. Both alanine and γ-aminobutyrate are synthesized at rates greatly in excess of those simply required to maintain the free pools with growth, indicating that these amino acids are rapidly turned over. Thus, both synthesis and utilization rates for alanine and γ-aminobutyrate are increased in adapted cells. Adaptation to stress leads to increased rates of synthesis of valine and leucine apparently at the expense of isoleucine. Remarkably low 15 N flux via the aspartate family amino acids was observed in these experiments. The rate of synthesis of threonine appeared too low to account for threonine utilization in protein synthesis, <b>pool</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and isoleucine biosynthesis. It is possible that isoleucine may be deriving carbon skeletons from sources other than threonine. Tentative models of the nitrogen flux of these two contrasting cell lines are discussed in relation to carbon metabolism, osmoregulation, and nitrogenous solute compartmentation...|$|R
