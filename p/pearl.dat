5|$|<b>Pearl</b> {{receives}} an emergency call when another super villain attacks. During the fight, <b>Pearl</b> sees Olivia {{caught in an}} explosion. Believing her friend dead, <b>Pearl</b> attacks the villain directly and suffers serious burns to her hands and face. She faints after she subdues him. She awakens in a hospital and finds herself healed except for her hair.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pearl</b> {{returns to}} her {{penthouse}} apartment. She is visited by Captain Steel, {{who says he has}} been thinking about her recently and regrets their breakup. When he says that he still loves her and {{would like to have a}} relationship with her again, <b>Pearl</b> declines. The next night, she goes to a nightclub with Olivia and Jennifer. They have fun joking about the fortunes, and <b>Pearl</b> admits she is a little sad hers did not come true. <b>Pearl</b> goes to a coffee house and cries when the fortune's deadline passes without anyone talking to her. Friday morning, <b>Pearl</b> is leaving for work when she meets a man who is about to knock on her door. He says he works at the coffee house she visited, and that she left her wallet behind. After a conversation, <b>Pearl</b> and the man arrange a date.|$|E

50|$|Natural and cultured <b>pearls</b> can be {{distinguished}} from imitation <b>pearls</b> using a microscope. Another method of testing for imitations is to rub two <b>pearls</b> against each other. Imitation <b>pearls</b> are completely smooth, but natural and cultured <b>pearls</b> are composed of nacre platelets, making both feel slightly gritty.|$|R
50|$|Necklaces {{can also}} be {{classified}} as uniform, or graduated. In a uniform strand of <b>pearls,</b> all <b>pearls</b> are classified as the same size, but actually fall in a range. A uniform strand of akoya <b>pearls,</b> for example, will measure within 0.5 mm. So a strand will never be 7 mm, but will be 6.5-7 mm. Freshwater <b>pearls,</b> Tahitian <b>pearls,</b> and South Sea <b>pearls</b> all measure to a full millimeter when considered uniform.|$|R
50|$|Baroque <b>pearls</b> are <b>pearls</b> with an {{irregular}} non-spherical shape. Shapes {{can range from}} minor aberrations to distinctly ovoid, curved, pinch, or lumpy shapes. Most cultured freshwater <b>pearls</b> are baroque because freshwater <b>pearls</b> are mantle-tissue nucleated instead of bead nucleated. Cultured saltwater <b>pearls</b> can also be baroque, but {{tend to be more}} teardrop-shaped due to the use of a spherical nucleation bead.|$|R
5|$|Vitalogy is {{the third}} studio album by the American rock band <b>Pearl</b> Jam, {{released}} on November 22, 1994, through Epic Records. <b>Pearl</b> Jam wrote and recorded Vitalogy while touring behind its previous album Vs.

5|$|When <b>Pearl</b> {{is called}} to assist with an attack by a super villain, she is unable to prevent the death of several police officers. Distraught, <b>Pearl</b> seeks solitude, but Jennifer finds her and tries to lift her spirits. Jennifer reminds <b>Pearl</b> about her own fortune, and claims that their two {{fortunes}} are related. Jennifer reveals her romantic feelings for <b>Pearl</b> and kisses her. <b>Pearl</b> is too shocked to respond.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, onions may be bred {{and grown}} to mature at smaller sizes. Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which the onion is used, these may be {{referred}} to as <b>pearl,</b> boiler, or pickler onions, but differ from true <b>pearl</b> onions which are a different species. <b>Pearl</b> and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E
40|$|By {{measuring}} the fluorescence spectra of <b>pearls</b> from various species of mother oysters, a distinction has already become possible {{as to whether}} the <b>pearls</b> are from Pinctada fucata, Pinctada maxima. Pteria penguin or Pinctada margaritifera. In this study, the fluorescence of <b>pearls</b> from freshwater bivalves was measured. The results have made it possible to distinguish freshwater <b>pearls</b> from the other <b>pearls</b> mentioned above...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA knotted {{necklace}} of <b>pearls</b> is a necklace whose string forms a nontrivial knot. We {{assume that all}} <b>pearls</b> are balls of the same size, and any two consecutive <b>pearls</b> in a knotted necklace are tangent to each other. How many <b>pearls</b> are necessary to make a knotted necklace, say a trefoil knot? We show that 15 <b>pearls</b> are sufficient, and that to make a knotted necklace which can {{be put in the}} shallowest-possible show-case (a box with a glass-lid), 16 <b>pearls</b> are necessary and sufficient...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pearls</b> are {{harvested}} manually. Oysters are opened and <b>pearls</b> are squeezed out. In case 9, 500 reuse, the <b>pearls</b> are removed carefully by opening the pearl- sac through the gonad without damaging it. The harvested <b>pearls</b> are washed in distilled water polished in refined salt and again washed in distilled wate...|$|R
5|$|Akagi {{served as}} Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's {{flagship}} {{in the attack}} on <b>Pearl</b> Harbor on 7 December 1941. Nagumo's Kido Butai—composed of the carriers Akagi, Kaga, , , , and , supported by escorts—launched two waves of airstrikes on the American base at <b>Pearl</b> Harbor in a devastating surprise attack. American losses included four battleships and two destroyers sunk and nearly 200 aircraft destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} typical colouration, Djungarian hamsters {{can also be}} {{coloured}} <b>pearl,</b> sapphire, sapphire <b>pearl,</b> and marbled. Other colorations are available, but these are strongly suspected to appear only in hybrid crossings with Campbell's dwarf hamsters. Some of these colorations are mandarin, blue, argente, yellow blue fawn, camel, brown, cream, merle, and umbrous.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{breaches}} in flood defenses around Ise Bay, seawater continued to pour into inundated areas after Vera's passage, slowing down repair efforts. One breach spanning 150km (93mi) across required 5,000personnel, 32,000sandbags, and bulldozers dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to relieve water flow. In Aichi's Ama District, reconstruction efforts for levees, roadways, and infrastructure lasted {{until the end of}} December1959. Due to losses sustained by the <b>pearl</b> industry as {{a result of}} the typhoon, Japanese <b>pearl</b> production in 1959 was expected to decrease by 30% in 1959, with production losses of 40% expected in 1960. Monetary losses to the industry were expected to eclipse US$15million, causing Japanese <b>pearl</b> costs to hike up by 20%. Furthermore, the effects of Vera on the country's <b>pearl</b> industry were expected to persist for two to three years.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, making starch <b>pearls</b> uses a {{different}} process of roasting. To form the <b>pearls,</b> the tapioca grit {{can be cut}} or extruded {{into the shape of}} <b>pearls,</b> either small (3mm) or large (6-8mm). The <b>pearls</b> are subjected to a form of heat-moisture treatment, which can extend shelf life up to 2 years.|$|R
50|$|Keshi <b>pearls</b> {{consist of}} solid nacre, {{and tend to}} have high luster as a result. All nacre colors typical of the mollusc under {{cultivation}} may be represented among keshi <b>pearls</b> harvested from the same, {{but in the case}} of Akoya <b>pearls</b> a larger portion of keshi is usually grey than of bead-nucleated <b>pearls.</b>|$|R

5|$|Inside {{the village}} limits, {{maintenance}} of NY120A shifts {{from the state}} to Westchester County, which inventories the route as CR112.

Here, NY120A turns off Westchester Avenue and onto North <b>Pearl</b> Street, becoming a village-maintained route in the process.

5000|$|Cultured {{freshwater}} <b>pearls</b> are <b>pearls</b> {{that are}} farmed and created using freshwater mussels.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission requires that farmed freshwater <b>pearls</b> {{be referred to as}} [...] "freshwater cultured pearls" [...] in commerce.

5000|$|... === Freezing === Other than drying, {{freezing}} {{could also}} be used to preserve <b>pearls</b> before consumption. After gelatinization, the <b>pearls</b> are soaked in ice water to decrease the viscosity and enhance its chewiness. Afterwards, it should be frozen using a quick freezing device, such as an air-blast freezer, or through an individual quick freezing process to avoid <b>pearls</b> from sticking together. [...] One important note is that retrogradation happens quickest at near 0 °C temperatures, which would lead to tougher <b>pearls,</b> so it is best to minimize the time that the <b>pearls</b> spend in that temperature range and freeze the <b>pearls</b> to lower temperatures quickly.|$|R
