Henceforward, if I ever make botanical quotations, I shall always call parenchyma, By-tis; <b>prosenchyma,</b> To-tis; and diachyma, Through-tis, short for By-tissue, To-tissue, and Through-tissue--then the student will see what all this modern wisdom comes to! ...|$|E

The inner portion of the cambium layer is, therefore, nascent wood, and the outer nascent bark. As the cells of this layer multiply, the greater number lengthen vertically into <b>prosenchyma,</b> or woody tissue, while some are transformed into ducts" [...] (wood vessels?) [...] "and others remaining as parenchyma, continue the medullary rays, or commence new ones." [...] Nothing is said here of {{the part of the}} cambium which becomes bark: but at page 128, the thin walled cells of the bark are said to be those of ordinary 'parenchyma,' and in the next page a very important passage occurs, which must have a paragraph to itself. I close the present one with one more protest against the entirely absurd terms 'par-enchyma,' for common cellular tissue, 'pros-enchyma,' for cellular tissue with longer cells;--'cambium' for an early state of both, and 'diachyma' for a peculiar position of one![46] while the chemistry of all these substances is wholly neglected, and we have no idea given us of any difference in pith, wood, and bark, than that they are made of short or long--young or old--cells! ...|$|E

40|$|Three {{types of}} multihyphal structures, stromata, sporangiomata and chlamydosori, are {{described}} {{for the plant}} pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. Their morphology, morphogenesis and position on the host organ were observed by dissecting, compound and scanning electron microscopy. Stromata were consistently formed one to two weeks after zoospore inoculation of detached leaves and fruits of an assortment of Mediterranean sclerophyll shrubs. Stroma initials appeared subcuticularly or subepidermally and developed as small hyphal aggregates by repeated branching, budding, swelling and interweaving, eventually forming a <b>prosenchyma.</b> They always emerged through the adaxial side of the leaf by rupture of the overlying host tissue. Occasionally sporangia and chlamydosori (packed clusters of chlamydospores) were formed on the stromata. Sporangiomata bore short sporangiophores and clusters of 20 - 100 sporangia and resembled sporodochia of the mitosporic fungi. The biological significance of these multihyphal structures is discussed. Some epidemiological aspects were also studied: several understorey species of the holm oak (Quercus ilex) woodland were susceptible to in vitro infection with three isolates of P. ramorum originally collected from different ornamental hosts. The risk of spread to this ecosystem is evaluated. Â© 2006 The British Mycological Society. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
