5|$|The {{financing}} plan involved {{public and private}} funding. At the time, the city planned to pay $75million for the acquisition {{of the land and}} construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91million after accounting for additional costs associated with the expedited schedule and infrastructure work around the <b>project</b> <b>site.</b> The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group spent $50million on a new, mixed-use and retail development next to the facility. The construction of two apartment buildings with retail space beyond the left field wall is scheduled to be completed in early 2018. North of the site, Embrey Development Corp. built a privately funded apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' lease payment, $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in property taxes from the Sounds development, $675,000 in property taxes from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in tax increment financing. The additional overage was paid with existing Metro capital funds. The city pays $345,000 for annual maintenance of the stadium.|$|E

40|$|A {{multitude}} of organisations with varying material needs are often involved in activities at <b>project</b> <b>sites.</b> This makes {{the use of}} collective project resources, like material handling resources at <b>project</b> <b>sites,</b> demanding. However, to ensure project success {{it is important that}} material flows needed to support activities undertaken at <b>project</b> <b>sites</b> are not disrupted as this can result in unnecessary costs and low customer service. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to analyse how material flows to and from <b>project</b> <b>sites</b> can be coordinated and how project characteristics might impact on how this is done. To do this, empirical data from a primarily qualitative case study undertaken at a Swedish exhibition centre used for multiple fairs has been collected. Findings illustrate how significant improvements can be achieved in the management of material flows to and from <b>project</b> <b>sites</b> if the material handling needs of the project participants are known in advance and the utilization of critical logistical resources is planned accordingly. The coordination of material flows for fairs are, however, impeded by fair characteristics like short project duration, heterogeneous material flows and fair diversity. Further research on coordination of material flows to and from <b>project</b> <b>sites</b> is suggested as the logistical problems observed in the studied case are likely to exist at other <b>project</b> <b>sites</b> with restricted access as well...|$|R

In late 2006, development began on a project to construct a 100-parking space Park & Ride at the interchange of NY135 and NY25. Work on the project began in mid-2015 and was completed in mid-2016.

As of March 2015, the first six elements are in place and production of the remaining five tunnel elements is in progress. Upon completion of construction, traffic in the existing Midtown Tunnel will be converted to one-way eastbound from Portsmouth to Norfolk and the new 2-lane tunnel will carry westbound traffic from Norfolk to Portsmouth.|$|E

In support of this declaration, he created the Office of National Land Settlement Administration which was renamed to Land Settlement Development Corporation (LaSeDeCo). Subsequently, this corporation was reorganized. At that time, the primary objective of LaSeDeCo was basically to oversee and facilitate the distribution of lands to qualified settlers. With the development of this opportunity for rural and agricultural development and with the completion of the Balete Pass Road in the 1920s that runs through the hinterlands of the Caraballo Mountains, hundreds of inhabitants from the Ilocos and Central Luzon regions opted to settle and avail of the program of the government in the Mallig Plains area.|$|E

Koval was charged by his handlers with watching Oak Ridge's polonium supply to transmit information about it through a Soviet contact named [...] "Clyde". His information reached Moscow via coded dispatches, couriers, and the Soviet Embassy.
