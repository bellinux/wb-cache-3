40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present a method and the {{fundamental}} data necessary to construct enthalpy-entropy diagrams and from these diagrams to calculate theoretical performance of rocket motor propellants. The systems investigated using this method are: (1) RFNA-Ammonia (1) (2) Ammonia (1) -Ozone (1) (3) Hydrogen (1) Ozone (1) Enthalpy-entropy diagrams for these fuels were constructed for several different mixture ratios: over oxidized, stoichiometric, and under-oxidized. Performance was calculated assuming chamber pressures of 600 psia and 300 psia and exhaust pressures of 14. 7 psia, 7. 35 psia, and 0. 147 psia. These diagrams facilitate {{the investigation of the}} effect of varying chamber <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>chamber</b> temperature and performance. They also facilitate investigation of varying expansion ratio, varying mixtures ratios, etc. They are especially useful in determining the performance of step rockets where exhaust conditions may vary from sea level to vacuum. The results of the performance calculations indicate that performance found by using enthalpy-entropy diagrams checks closely with those determined by other methods. The performance of the last two systems is such as to indicate that a more thorough study of them should be made...|$|E

Synthetic diamonds are also widely known as HPHT diamonds or CVD diamonds, HPHT and CVD being the production methods, high-pressure high-temperature synthesis and chemical vapor deposition, respectively. Although the concept of producing high quality artificial diamonds is an old one, the reproducible synthesis of diamonds is not.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{assessment}} of stress-strain state of soil mass of dock-type lock chamber. Numerical modeling of the soil mass of dock-type lock chamber with a continuous bottom is performed. The soil model was selected, and calculation of stress-strain state of the lock chamber soil mass was performed applying the PLAXIS 2 D programming and computing suite. In {{the process of the}} structure stress-strain state analysis the assessment of its state in conditions of filling-emptying of the lock chamber was performed. To assess the possibility of reducing the load of the backfill soil and pore <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the lock <b>chamber</b> wall, the article discusses the simulation of excavation of upper part of the lock chamber backfill; also, the possibility of replacing of clay soil filling by sandy soil filling is considered. A numerical modeling results verification with field observations materials obtained during operation of the facility was performed according to the results of calculations of horizontal and vertical shifts of the facility. The study demonstrated a satisfactory convergence of the results of calculations performed in the Plaxis programming and computing suite with the field observations materials.

40|$|Encelia farinosa is well {{adapted for}} drought {{tolerance}} as its leaves transform color based on water availability. We were puzzled by {{a question that}} any desert botanist must consider. How does the photosynthetic efficiency of E. farinosa fluctuate as it transitions from a state of drought {{to a state of}} soil saturation within a 72 hour period? In this experiment we looked at the effects of irrigation on the health and quantum yield of the brittlebush by looking at photosynthetic rates using the portable photosynthesis system LI-COR 6400 when applied to two leaves on a given plant and water potential (ψ) using a Scholander-type <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>on</b> the stems. We attempted to understand how quickly these processes take place from pre-rainfall conditions to post-rainfall conditions up to 72 hours after. We concluded that E. farinosa does not fluctuate significantly in terms of photosynthetic rate, transpiration, and quantum yield with dry as opposed to irrigated soil. However, transpiration and quantum yield significantly increased for the first 24 hours immediately following rainfall, leading us to speculate whether the plant operates at peak efficiency within this window...|$|R
40|$|Diurnal {{changes in}} trunk {{diameter}} depend mostly upon variations in water content. The admitted {{interpretation of this}} process is based on a reverse flux of water from the trunk in response to the transpirational pull from the foliage. A linear relation between water content and water potential is assumed. The aim {{of this study is to}} calculate xylem water potential using trunk diameter changes. Measurements of stem diameter variations (with LVDT sensors) and xylem water potential (with <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>on</b> covered leaves) were made in Tarragona (Spain) on irrigated and non-irrigated walnut trees in an orchard. The relation between these two variables during the day is loop-shaped. A simple model is presented, assuming the existence of a water reservoir (representing elastic tissues) and thus the loop-shaped curve. After calibration for one or few days, the variations of xylem water potential with a fine time scale (few minutes) and for a long period could be monitored from the trunk diameter measurements. Such predicted values, especially predawn and midday xylem water potential, could be very useful for irrigation scheduling. Moreover, this kinetics could improve the understanding of tree water physiology...|$|R
40|$|In this endeavor, the {{transients}} persisting in {{a vacuum}} ejector system (put reference of my old paper) is studied by numerically simulating the flow field, and experimentally validating the simulated results. An inertial effect was discovered in the study due to which the direction of mass flux changes. As a result of this, the recirculation zone moves forward and backward during the transients and the pressure in the secondary chamber rises and falls. The system behaves as a damped oscillatory flow in which the direction of mass flux keeps on changing and finally settles down to a state {{where there is no}} mass flux in either direction. The movement of recirculation zone due to this inertial effect is studied in more detail for various flow and geometric parameters. The results obtained show that the pressure and mass flux through the secondary <b>chamber</b> depend highly <b>on</b> both the thickness of the primary and secondary jet and the chamber volume. The inertial effect reduces with the reduction in thickness of primary and secondary flow. The inertial effect is found to be decreasing with increasing secondary chamber volume. It is also found that, the inertial effect decreases as the primary jet pressure increases, for all other parameters remaining the same. The computationally simulated flow field and the <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the secondary <b>chamber</b> are compared with the experimental data and found to be matching fairly well...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT High voltage {{electron}} microscopy of intact cells {{prepared by the}} critical point drying (CPD) procedure has become an important tool {{in the study of}} three-dimensional relationships between cytoplasmic organelles. It has been claimed that critical point-dried specimens reveal a structure that is not visible in sections of plastic-embedded material; it has also been claimed that this structure, in association with known cytoplasmic filaments, forms a meshwork of tapering threads ("microtrabecular lattice"). Alternatively, this structure might be a surface tension artifact produced during CPD. To test possible sources of artifacts during CPD, model fiber systems of known structure were used. It was found that traces of water or ethanol in the CO 2 caused distortions and fusion of fibers in pure muscle actin, fibrin, collagen, chromatin, and microtubules that produce a structure very similar to the proposed "microtrabecular lattice. " These structures were, however, well preserved if water and ethanol were totally excluded from the CO 2. The same results were obtained with whole mounts of cultured cells. A "microtrabecular lattice " was obtained if some water or ethanol was present in the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, when water or ethanol were totally excluded from the CO 2 during CPD, cytoplasmic filaments were uniform in thickness similar to their appearanc...|$|R

40|$|The {{project was}} to {{describe}} and understand the processes of fuel conversion in pressure combustion chambers with {{the ultimate goal of}} practical application. Laboratory-scale experiments wre required because of the high complexity of the processes. The data will be combined into an overall model in the final stage. The following aspects were discussed in particular: 1. Flow, mixing and temperature characteristics of pressurised coal. The solid charge was varied for cluster formation and for investigating the influence of the clusters on temperature, conversion rate, etc. 2. Measurements of fuel conversion and coke formation for a characterisation of the fuels. Data on reactivity and coke burn-out in different gas atmospheres were analysed, and the basic 'material data' were established. 3. Analysis of pollutant and residue formation. Knowledge of the pyrolysis products at high heating rates is important, especially with a view to the NOx problem. 4.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new noninvasive {{measurement}} method for tracking {{the tendency of}} mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the radial artery. The designed system consists of a tonometer, a microsyringe device, and a model-based fuzzy logic controller. The modified flexible diaphragm tonometer is to detect the continuous blood pressure waveform and vessel volume pulse. A precise mathematical model describing {{the interaction between the}} tonometer and artery is derived. To reach accurate measurement without distortion, a model-based fuzzy logic control system is designed to compensate the change of MAP by applying a counter <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the tonometer <b>chamber</b> through the microsyringe device. The proposed control system consists of a linear predictor, a Kalman filter, and a synthetic fuzzy logic controller (SFLC). The linear predictor is to estimate the MAPs changing tendency based on the identified arterial pressure–volume model and then to beat-to-beat adjust the function of SFLC. The Kalman filter is to reduce the physiologic and measurement disturbance of the vessel volume oscillation amplitude (VOA). The SFLC is composed of three parallel subcontrollers, each of which is a simple fuzzy logic controller, for processing the three changing states of the MAP: ascending, descending, and stabilizing states, respectively. The design of the fuzzy rules in each subcontroller is based on the oscillometric principle saying that the arterial vessel has the maximum compliance when the detected vessel volume pulse reaches its maximum amplitude. Simulation results show that, for the real physiologic MAP with changing rates up to 20 or 20 mm-Hg/minute, the model-based SFLC can beat-to-beat adjust the tonometer’s chamber pressure to follow the tendency of MAP accurately. Index Terms—Blood pressure, compliance, oscillometry, tonometer, vessel volume pulse. I...|$|R
40|$|Suspensions play {{a crucial}} role in vehicle comfort and stability. Different types of {{suspensions}} have been proposed to fulfill the essential characteristics of vehicle suspensions. A semi-active suspension with adjustable damper improves the performance of a suspension in different conditions and it is better than a passive suspension in terms of ride comfort and handling. Furthermore, it is not as expensive and complicated as an active suspension. Semi-active suspensions rely on adjustable damping coefficient. A new type of air suspension with independent ride height and stiffness tuning has been developed recently. By using two air chambers in the suspension system, ride height of vehicle and stiffness of suspension can be adjusted independently and simultaneously. The conventional air suspension systems use compressor to pump the air into a single flexible rubber airbag and by inflating the air, the chassis will be raised from the axle (ride height control). In this type of suspensions, the stiffness of spring is not under control. In the new air suspension system, by controlling the air <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> both <b>chambers,</b> one can tune the suspension stiffness and the ride height of the vehicle at the same time for different driving conditions. The air suspension is also able to maintain the vehicle body at the same height and natural frequency for different load or number of passengers. This thesis discusses about the design analysis of an air suspension with ride height and stiffness tuning. The analytical formulation is developed for the optimum design of the new air suspension system. In this thesis, the interconnection between the pressurized chambers of the new air suspension with ride height and stiffness tuning is studied to further improve the performance. Proper interconnection of air springs can help the suspension system to distribute the load between tires more evenly on rough roads or uneven surfaces. Different configurations in air spring interconnection have different impact on the handling and tire load distribution. To study the effect of air spring interconnection configurations on tires load distribution and vehicle handling, a general mathematical model is developed. This model is used to compare various configurations in detail. Results show that interconnection could improve tire load distributions greatly. It is also shown that improving tire load distribution will deteriorate roll stiffness that in turn deteriorate vehicle handling at higher speeds. Since on rough roads, vehicle’s speed is necessarily low, interconnection will not have adverse effects on vehicle handling when activated...|$|R
