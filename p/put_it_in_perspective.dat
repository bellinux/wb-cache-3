In identification of metastatic foci, FDG-PET/CT is useful as a screening method when localizing symptoms are absent because it provides whole-body coverage. FDG-PET/CT detects early metabolic activity rather than the late anatomical changes as visualized by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. FDG-PET/CT allows more precise localization of infection within a shorter time span between injection and diagnosis as compared to conventional nuclear imaging.

40|$|In 1965, {{a family}} {{planning}} service {{was created in}} Geneva which aimed at spreading information on contraception. This article focuses on {{the attitude of the}} centre vis-à-vis the new contraceptive methods, especially the pill, and <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective</b> with other voices, such as those of feminists. In order to address the question of women's emancipation, it relies on the archives of the family planning centre and of the Women's Liberation Movement of Geneva. The centre's pedagogical discourse about contraception focuses on stable couples and a rational attitude towards reproduction and family planning. It reflects the dominance of medical theories in the field of sexuality in Geneva during this period. The author suggests that the centre's approach to contraception contributed to the diffusion of a new contraceptive norm by combining contraceptive information with messages concerning the proper type of relationship, the state of mind and even the feelings with which contraception should be associated. The sources, however, also suggest a gap between the messages delivered and actual uses made of the centre. While maintaining a conservative and normative discourse, the family planning service nevertheless gave women the possibility to increase their autonomy...|$|R

5000|$|Tattersall {{maintains}} {{that the notion of}} human evolution as a linear trudge from primitivism to perfection is incorrect. Whereas the Darwinian approach to evolution may be viewed as a fine-tuning of characteristics guided by natural selection, Tattersall takes a more generalist view. Tattersall claims that individual organisms are mind-bogglingly complex and integrated mechanisms; they succeed or fail as the sum of their parts, and not because of a particular characteristic. In terms of human evolution, Tattersall believes the process was more a matter of evolutionary experimentation in which a new species entered the environment, competed with other life forms, and either succeeded, failed, or became extinct within that environment: [...] "To <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective,</b> consider the fact that the history of diversity and competition among human species began some five million years ago when there were at least four different human species living on the same landscape. Yet as a result of evolutionary experimentation, only one species has prospered and survived. One human species is now the only twig on what was once a big branching bush of different species." [...] This idea differs from the typical view that homo sapiens is the pinnacle of an evolutionary ladder that humanity's ancestors laboriously climbed.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2013 the 1986 Chernobyl {{disaster}} in the Ukraine was and remains the world's worst nuclear power plant disaster. Estimates of its death toll are controversial and range from 62 to 25,000, with the high projections including deaths {{that have yet to}} happen. Peer reviewed publications have generally supported a projected total figure in the low tens of thousands; for example an estimate of 16,000 excess cancer deaths are predicted to occur due to the Chernobyl accident out to the year 2065, whereas, in the same period, several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes (from International Agency for Research on Cancer published in the International Journal of Cancer in 2006). The IARC also released a press release stating [...] "To <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective,</b> tobacco smoking will cause several thousand times more cancers in the same population", but also, referring to the numbers of different types of cancers, [...] "The exception is thyroid cancer, which, over ten years ago, was already shown to be increased in the most contaminated regions around the site of the accident". The full version of the World Health Organization health effects report adopted by the United Nations, also published in 2006, included the prediction of, in total, no more of 4,000 deaths from cancer. A paper which the Union of concerned scientists took issue with the report, and they have, following the disputed linear no-threshold model (LNT) model of cancer susceptibility, instead estimated, for the broader population, that the legacy of Chernobyl would be a total of 25,000 excess cancer deaths worldwide. That places the total Chernobyl death toll below that of the worst dam failure accident in history, the Banqiao Dam disaster of 1975 in China.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was when}} he was {{brainstorming}} with the founding editors of the magazine (founded by former Pilote friends and co-artists {{in the wake of the}} revolt at the publisher, when they decided to strike out on their own), that Giraud came up with his first major Mœbius work, [...] "Le bandard fou" [...] ("The Horny Goof"). Released directly as album (a first for Mœbius comics) in black & white by the magazine's publisher, [...] the humorous and satirical story dealt with a law-abiding citizen of the planet Souldaï, who awakens one day, only to find himself with a permanent erection. Pursued through space and time by his own puritanical authorities, who frown upon the condition, and other parties, who have their own intentions with the hapless bandard, he eventually finds a safe haven on the asteroid Fleur of Madame Kowalsky, after several hilarious adventures. When discounting the as [...] "Gir" [...] signed [...] "La déviation", it is in this story that Giraud's signature, minute [...] "Mœbius" [...] art style, for which he became famed not that much later, truly comes into its own. Another novelty introduced in the book, is that the narrative is only related on the right-hand pages; the left-hand pages are taken up by one-page panels depicting an entirely unrelated cinematographic sequence of a man transforming after he has snapped his fingers. The story did raise some eyebrows with critics accusing Giraud of pornography at the time, but one reviewer <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective</b> when stating, [...] "Peut-être Porno, mais Graphique!", which loosely translates as [...] "Porn maybe, but Graphic Art for sure!". In the editorial of the 1990 American edition, Giraud has conceded that he was envious of what his former Pilote colleagues had achieved with L'Écho des savanes in regard to creating a free, creative environment for their artists, he had already enjoyed so much back at Hara-Kiri, and that it was an inspiration for the endeavor, Giraud embarked upon next.|$|E
50|$|The {{persistence}} and the complication of wars in Africa are partially due to small arms proliferation. Researchers for the Small Arms Survey estimate that approximately 30 million firearms are being circulated throughout Africa. This number {{is much less}} than the total number of small arms in Europe, estimated to be 84 million. However, the number of small arms isn't as important in comparison to how they are being used. The Small Arms Survey reports that at least 38 different companies are producing small arms in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet indigenous companies are not fulfilling the demands. South Africa is the largest exporter of small arms in the region, but only $6 million in small arms were exported out of the country, while $25 million dollars in small arms were imported into the continent in 2005. Beyond legal trade, the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons also has a great effect on Africa. Many of the illicit trade among small arms in Africa can be attributed to post-conflict removal and movement of weapons. This illegal transfer of weapons from country-to-country has been seen to incite conflict in bordering regions by the same armed groups. An example of this {{can be seen in the}} conflicts ranging from Liberia, moving towards Sierra-Leone, the Ivory Coast, and finally to Guinea. Another illicit trade of small arms is seen in craft production. Reports from arms analysts Matt Schroeder and Guy Lamb suggest that the country Ghana has the potential to yield 200,000 new weapons every year. The consequences of small arms on African people due to international conflicts within Africa, rebel group activities, mercenary groups, and armed gang activities have yet to be fully measured. The International Action Network on Small Arms, Saferworld, and Oxfam International <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>perspective</b> when they reported that armed conflict cost Africa $18 billion each year and about USD$300 billion between 1990-2005.

50|$|The Loops '05 conference, {{hosted by}} many loop quantum gravity theorists, {{included}} several presentations which discussed CDT in great depth, and revealed {{it to be}} a pivotal insight for theorists. It has sparked considerable interest as it appears to have a good semi-classical description. At large scales, it re-creates the familiar 4-dimensional spacetime, but it shows spacetime to be 2-d near the Planck scale, and reveals a fractal structure on slices of constant time. These interesting results agree with the findings of Lauscher and Reuter, who use an approach called Quantum Einstein Gravity, and with other recent theoretical work.
