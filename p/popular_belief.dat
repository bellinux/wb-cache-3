Today, many people still resort to shamanist rituals known as kut in Korean to settle their problems. as family beliefs or village beliefs have {{gradually}} been weakening, but Korean <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs</b> still have their place, in shamanism, in divination, and in geomancy, adapting to changes of the times. In other words, even now <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs</b> are still part of the meaningful world of the Koreans, influencing their judgment and behavior when they are in trouble. From this viewpoint, this book intends to demonstrate the general aspects of Korean <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs</b> and also shed light on their historical changes and present conditions. Korean <b>popular</b> <b>beliefs</b> do not remain separated from Korean lives or other religions such as Buddhism, Confucianism, and Christianity, but related to them.
