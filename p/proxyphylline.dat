5000|$|Applications of his {{theories}} and mathematical models {{have had a}} profound effect in the field. Peppas and his students originated the novel muco- and bioadhesive systems that interact molecularly with the mucus and tissue and have been able to prolong bioavailability of proteins and peptides in the blood. As a result of his work, a number of biomedical polymers and commercial delivery devices have been launched. Peppas was the first to develop novel toxic-free poly(vinyl alcohol) gels by the freezing-thawing technique in 1975. These gels became very successful articular cartilage replacement systems. In 1978, he developed the same systems for in situ replacement of vocal cords. In 1979 his group pioneered the use of hydrogels in drug delivery applications, including epidermal bioadhesive systems and systems for the release of theophylline, <b>proxyphylline,</b> diltiazem, and oxprenolol. Peppas’ lab has developed new technologies of oral delivery systems for insulin and other proteins. These devices release insulin orally, “protecting” the insulin throughout its transport in the stomach, upper small intestine, and, eventually, blood, and bypassing diabetics’ need for several daily injections. The same technology has been used for the transmucosal (oral, buccal) delivery of calcitonin (for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women) and interferon-alpha (for cancer therapy), and is being investigated for interferon-beta release for multiple sclerotic patients. [...] Peppas was one of the pioneers of intelligent biomaterials, and medical devices. Using intelligent polymers as early as 1980, Peppas and his group were the first to use such pH-sensitive and temperature-sensitive systems for modulated release of streptokinase and other fibrinolytic enzymes.|$|E

40|$|Novel ionizable polymer {{networks}} were prepared from oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) multiacrylates and acrylic acid (AA) employing bulk radical photopolymerization techniques. The properties {{of these materials}} exhibited a complex dependence on the network structure and composition, and the materials were therefore used {{in the design of}} controlled release devices with precisely controlled properties. The release kinetics of model solute <b>proxyphylline</b> exhibited a strong compositional dependence, with measured di!usion coe$cients varying over several orders of magnitude, depending on the polymer network structure and the pH of the release medium. Varying the OEG chain length provided a means of coarsely adjusting the <b>proxyphylline</b> release rate, while varying the AA content and the pH o!ered a more precise measure of control. � 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Drug release, from matrix {{controlled}} release devices, may be activated by the ingress of solvent (water). In {{the case of}} matrix {{controlled release}} devices consisted of a hydrophobic polymer, the water uptake is markedly facilitated {{by the presence of}} osmotically-active excipients, leading thus to the acceleration of the drug release. This acceleration is attributed to excess swelling of the polymer and/or the generation of microscopic cracks, which form a pore network. However, even in this case, the release kinetics deviates from the desired constant dose rate. This work aims at contributing to the optimization of such systems through: i) The experimental study of the variations on the osmotic effect that three water soluble excipients, incorporated in the hydrophobic matrix, produce. ii) The experimental study of the release kinetics of a hydrophilic, biologically active drug in the absence and {{in the presence of the}} aforementioned osmotically active excipients. iii) The study of the role of the water uptake on the release kinetics. iv) The achievement of a constant dose rate of the drug, through the use of a multilayer controlled release device. v) The characterization of the depleted matrices in order to gain insight on the release mechanism of both the dug and the excipients. Mixtures (10 : 1) of components A and B of silicone rubber (SR) (poly(dimethylsiloxane),PDMS) type GE- 615, (GE- Silicones) were gauged by means of a mechanical stirrer at 400 rpm. Silicone rubber films were prepared by casting the mixture on a PE coated plate, by the means of a doctor’s knife. The osmotically active excipients (NaCl, CsNO 3 and CsCl) and the model drug, 7 -(β-Hydroxy-propyl) theophylline (<b>proxyphylline)</b> were added in the two components mixture prior to curing. The crosslinking formation mechanism was studied by means of 1 Η-NMR, 13 C-NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy and the probability of chemical interaction between the components A and B and the excipients was eliminated through experiments conducted by means of differential scanning calorimetry (D. S. C.). The particle sizes were estimated both for the salts (ca. 10 μm) and <b>proxyphylline</b> (ca. 1 μm) by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy (S. E. M.). The films dimensioned 2 x 2 cm 2 and of thicknesses 370 - 420 μm, contained: i) NaCl in five different initial concentrations (0. 02 - 0. 23 v/v) ii) CsNO 3 and CsCl in two different initial concentrations (0. 06 and 0. 12 v/v) iii) <b>proxyphylline</b> in three different initial concentrations (0. 05, 0. 11 and 0. 22 v/v) 169 iv) <b>proxyphylline</b> (0. 11 v/v) in the presence of NaCl (0. 04 - 0. 07 v/v) or CsNO 3 and CsCl (0. 07 v/v). The release experiments were conducted in deionised water, kept under constant temperature, while the amount of release was monitored by means of a conductivity bridge, in the case of salts and by means of a U. V. /Vis spectrophotometer, in the case of <b>proxyphylline.</b> At selected times, the concurrent variation of the water content, was also monitored by weighing the films. In the case of matrices containing exclusively salts, the kinetics did not present any linear parts on a square root time scale, due to the extensive water uptake. Water passes through a maximum, while at the end, the matrices retain a substantial amount of water, which exceeds the volume that the salts initially occupied inside the matrices. In general, the water uptake was increased and the release kinetics was accelerated with increasing amounts of salts. However, in the case of matrices containing NaCl 0. 22 v/v, the release acceleration was not accompanied by significant water uptake. This is attributed to the formation of an intra-connected cavity network inside the matrices, due to the significant initial amount of NaCl. In the case of matrices containing <b>proxyphylline,</b> the water uptake is slow and fairly limited. Matrices containing 0. 05 and 0. 11 v/v <b>proxyphylline,</b> presented similar release kinetics, probably due to the fact, that the drug is mainly diffused through the polymer. The kinetics presented linear parts on a square root time scale, therefore declining rates with time. ...|$|E

The method involved the precipitation of proteins present in the milk samples with a 6 % v/v perchloric acid solution containing the internal standard, <b>proxyphylline,</b> followed by centrifugation at 12, 800 Xg for 10 minutes. The clear supernatant was then chromatographed on a C 1 8 reversed-phase analytical column at ambient temperature using a wavelength of 272 nm. Samples were eluted from the column at a constant flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min using a gradient program in which the concentration of methanol in the mobile phase varied from 0 to 16 %.

40|$|Dr. Peppas has {{received}} international recognition in numerous fields, including biomaterials, bionanotechnology, and drug delivery. He {{has made significant}} advances {{in the field of}} drug delivery systems, making it into a mature area of scholarly and applied research. He is responsible for setting theories and equations that explain diffusion in controlled release devices (Peppas equation) and transport through biomaterials (Peppas-Reinhart theory, Brannon-Peppas theory, Huang-Peppas theory, and Sahlin-Peppas equation). The impact of these theories and equations can best be demonstrated by the number of times they are cited throughout the literature, as Dr. Peppas is {{recognized as one of the}} most cited authors in the field. Dr. Peppas and his laboratory are making key advancements in many fields. Their earliest oral delivery systems for theophylline and <b>proxyphylline</b> were developed in the late 1970 s. Recently, they have received attention for their development of an insulin capsule to replace insulin injections for diabetics. These devices allow oral administration of insulin and protection of the protein from the harsh environments of the stomach and small intestine while exhibiting high bioavailability. This technology, one of the first to be effective for the oral delivery of proteins, is now being applied to the delivery of drugs in osteoporosis, cancer, and multiple sclerosis therapies. Other devices the Peppas group has developed include intraocular lenses; materials for cartilage replacement, artificial heart linings, and vocal cord reconstruction; and biogels for release of growth factors to improve wound healing. ...|$|E
