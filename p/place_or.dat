5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting <b>place,</b> <b>or</b> curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{residential}} areas at Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in <b>place</b> <b>or</b> close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E

5|$|The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, {{which include}} reality {{orientation}} and cognitive retraining, is {{the reduction of}} cognitive deficits. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, <b>place</b> <b>or</b> person to ease {{the understanding of the}} person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|The new Serjeants {{would give}} a feast to celebrate, and gave out rings to their close friends and family to mark the occasion.

Serjeant's Inn and the Inns of Court were not big enough for such an occasion, and Ely <b>Place</b> <b>or</b> Lambeth Palace would instead be used. The feasts gradually declined in importance, and by the 17th century they were small enough {{to be held in}} the Inns. The last recorded feast was in 1736 in Middle Temple, when fourteen new Serjeants were raised to the Coif.|$|E
