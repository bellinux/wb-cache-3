40|$|We {{investigate}} how banking relationships that combine lending <b>and</b> <b>underwriting</b> services affect {{the terms of}} lending, through both loan supply- and loan demand-side effects, <b>and</b> the <b>underwriting</b> costs of debt and equity issues. We capture and control for firm characteristics, including differences in the sequences of firm financing decisions (which we argue are likely to capture important cross-sectional heterogeneity, and which previously have been ignored in the literature). We construct a structural model of lending, which separately identifies loan supply and loan demand. Our approach results in significant improvement in the explanatory power of our regressions when compared to prior studies. We find no evidence that universal banks under-price loans to win underwriting business. Instead, we find that universal banks charge premiums for loans <b>and</b> <b>underwriting</b> services to extract value from combined lending <b>and</b> <b>underwriting</b> relationships. We also find that universal banks (as opposed to stand alone investment banks) enjoy cost advantages in both lending <b>and</b> <b>underwriting,</b> irrespective of relationship benefits. Part of the advantage borrowers may enjoy from bundling products may {{be a form of}} liquidity risk insurance, which is manifested in a reduced demand for lines of credit. We also find evidence of a "road show" effect; firms that engage in debt underwritings enjoy loan pricing discounts on the loans that are negotiated at times close to the debt underwritings...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the practice of tying,' which occurs when an underwriter lends to an issuer {{around the time of}} a public securities offering. We examine whether there are efficiencies from tying lending <b>and</b> <b>underwriting</b> which lead to benefits for issuers and underwriters. We find evidence consistent with tying occurring for issues when there are informational economies of scope from combining lending <b>and</b> <b>underwriting.</b> Firms benefit from tying through lower financing costs, as tied issuers receive lower underwriter fees on seasoned equity offerings and discounted loan yield spreads. These financing costs are significantly reduced for non-investment grade issuers, where informational economies of scope from combining lending with underwriting are likely to be large. These results are robust to matching methodology developed by Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1997, 1998). For underwriters, tying helps build relationships that augment an underwriter's expected revenues by increasing the probability of receiving both current and future business. Both commercial banks and investment banks tie lending <b>and</b> <b>underwriting</b> <b>and</b> offer price discounts, albeit in different ways, with commercial banks discounting loan yield spreads and investment banks offering reduced underwriter spreads. ...|$|R

We address several shortcomings in prior studies, which results in significant improvement in the explanatory power of our regressions when compared to prior studies. We find no evidence that universal banks under-price loans to win underwriting business, which also rules out any possibility of illegal “tying. ” We do find evidence that banks price loans <b>and</b> <b>underwriting</b> services in a strategic way to extract value from their relationships.
