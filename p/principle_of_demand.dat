It became, at one period of our sittings, a question of vital importance at what moment the law of demand and supply would come into operation, and what the operation of it would exactly be: the demand, on this occasion, being very urgent indeed; that of several millions of people within a few hours of utter starvation, for any kind of food whatsoever. Nevertheless, it was admitted, in the course of debate, to be probable that the divine <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> and supply might find itself at the eleventh hour, and some minutes over, in want of carts and horses; and we ventured so far to interfere with the divine principle as to provide carts and horses, with haste which proved, happily, in time for the need; but not a moment in advance of it. It was farther recognized by the committee that the divine <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> and supply would commence its operations by charging the poor of Paris twelve-pence for a penny's worth of whatever they wanted; and would end its operations by offering them twelve-pence worth for a penny, of whatever they didn't want. Whereupon it was concluded by the committee that the tiny knot, on this special occasion, was scarcely [...] "dignus vindice," [...] by the divine <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> and supply: and that we would venture, for once, in a profane manner, to provide for the poor of Paris what they wanted, when they wanted it.

40|$|Transport {{modeling}} and cost-benefit analysis are two key tools used in trans- port planning. Both tools have been adapted substantially {{to cope with}} the challenges posed by the goal of sustainable development.

Hardly any {{attention has been paid to}} another key dimension of sustain- able development: social justice. This paper critically analyzes the two tools from this perspective. It concludes that transport modeling is implicitly based on the distributive <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand.</b> Given the importance of mobility in current society, it is suggested to replace current demand-based approaches by transport modeling that is based on the principle of need. Likewise, cost- benefit analysis has a built-in distributive mechanism that structurally favors transport improvements for highly mobile groups. This problem could be solved by replacing travel time savings by so-called accessibility gains as the key benefit taken into account in cost-benefit analysis. If the suggested changes were realized, both transport {{modeling and}} cost-benefit analysis could become key tools for promoting sustainable transport...|$|E

In this paper, {{the benefits of the}} PV energy are considered in a PV cluster (PVC) consisting of a certain number of prosumers and a PVC operator (PVCO). In order to distribute the benefits, a multi-party energy management method for the PVC is proposed, including an internal pricing model and a demand response (DR) model. First, the dynamic internal pricing model for the trading between PVCO and prosumers is formulated according to the economic <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> and supply relation. Moreover, in order to improve the local consumption of PV energy, the DR model is formulated as a non-cooperative game among the prosumers. Meanwhile, the existence and uniqueness of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) are proved, and a distributed solving algorithm is introduced to approach the NE solution. Finally, the PVC including four prosumers is selected as the study object, the results have shown that the internal pricing model and DR model can improve the benefit of both prosumers and PVCO, as well as the local consumption of PV energy...|$|E
40|$|Bank demand {{guarantees}} {{have become}} an established part of international trade. Demand guarantees, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit are all treated as autonomous contracts whose operation will not be interfered with by courts on grounds immaterial to the guarantee or credit itself. The idea in the documentary credit transaction/demand guarantee transaction {{is that if the}} documents (where applicable) presented are in line with the terms of the credit/guarantee the bank has to pay, and if the documents do not correspond to the requirements, the bank must not pay. However, over the years a limited number of exceptions to the autonomy <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> guarantees and letters of credit have come to be acknowledged and accepted in practice. In certain circumstances, the autonomy of demand guarantees and letters of credit may be ignored by the bank and regard may be had to the terms and conditions of the underlying contract. The main exceptions concern fraud and illegality in the underlying contract. In this thesis a great deal of consideration has been given to fraud and illegality as possible grounds on which payment under demand guarantees and letters of credit have been attacked (and sometimes even prevented) in the English, American and South African courts. It will be shown that the prospect of success depends on the law applicable to the demand guarantee and letter of credit, and the approach a court in a specific jurisdiction takes. At present, South Africa has limited literature on demand guarantees, and the case law regarding the grounds upon which payment under a demand guarantee might be prevented is scarce and often non-existent. In South Africa one finds guidance by looking at similar South African case law dealing with commercial and standby letters of credit and applying these similar principles to demand guarantees. The courts, furthermore, find guidance by looking at how other jurisdictions, in particular the English courts, deal with these issues. Therefore, how the South African courts currently deal/should be dealing/probably will be dealing with the unfair and fraudulent calling of demand guarantees/letters of credit is discussed in this thesis.

40|$|Since The Publication of Faust II, {{commentators}} {{interested in}} economic {{aspects of the}} text have focused primarily on three of its five acts. Bernd Mahl, whose work on Goethe’s economic knowledge remains a standard reference, writes that the topics most frequently addressed following its publication are the creation of paper money in act 1, Faust’s renewed activity in act 4, and the commercial ventures of Faust and Mephistopheles in act 5. 1 More recent investigations have generally continued this trend. 2 Given this lengthy history of interpretation, what is one {{to make of the}} second and third acts of Faust II with respect to economic matters? In the “Ökonomische Lesart” (Economic Reading) section of his Faust commentary, Ulrich Gaier offers this assessment: “Angesichts der Tatsache, daß sich der 2. und 3. Akt in Fausts Kopf abspielen, kann es hier nicht um reales Wirtschaften in der geschichtlichen Folge des Wirtschaftsgebarens der Neuzeit gehen” 3 (Given the fact that acts 2 and 3 are acted out in Faust’s head, real economic activity resulting historically from economic behavior in the modern era cannot be at stake here). While Gaier accurately describes the tendency of literary and economic analyses of Faust II—including his own—to focus on the other three acts, his claim deserves closer scrutiny. It clearly hinges upon what he calls “reales Wirtschaften” (real economic activity); yet he does not define it or specify how it relates to the history of modern political economy. Admittedly, the second and third acts do not appear at first glance to contain the traditional economic elements found in the other acts. However, as I shall argue, to discount the two acts encompassing the Helena episode simply because they unfold in Faust’s head severely underestimates the complexity of Goethe’s political-economic thought in this significant portion of Faust II. Goethe does not simply set aside the keen insight into economic matters that he skillfully demonstrates throughout the rest of his self-described “Hauptgeschäft” (main business). 4 Rather, he accentuates in acts 2 and 3 the subjective nature of value, particularly {{as it relates to the}} economic <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>demand.</b> Goethe repeatedly employs and couples Wert (value) and Begehr/en (demand) in scenes leading up to and including the Helena episode. Moreover, he demonstrates in these two acts a significant change in his own approach to value, from an intrinsic to a subjective view of it...|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} it is {{discussed}} how Keynes, though dedicating a chapter to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>demand</b> in his GENERAL THEORY (chap 3), does not define the principle and only twice mentions the wording effective demand. It is further argued {{that most of}} Keynes's analysis of Chapter 3 was carried out {{at a level of}} investigation that concerns the behaviour of a 'monetary production economy', within a given institutional set-up. However, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>demand</b> belongs to a more fundamental level of investigation, towards which Keynes was able to go only partially. Perhaps, he never had the time or the necessary calm or the appropriate analytical tools to go back and face it explicitly. After Keynes, those who tried to re-absorb his analysis into traditional theory have been careful not to mention the principle at all; while those who have endeavoured to carry further Keynes's 'revolution' have been too quick to identify it, thus remaining half-way between his behavioural relations and the deeper level to which the 'principle' <b>of</b> effective <b>demand</b> really belongs. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>demand</b> must be seen on two distinct levels of investigation - one behavioural and the other fundamental, or 'natural', as the early classics called it. These levels of investigations are both essential and complementary, though they are distinct and aimed at different purposes...|$|R
40|$|According to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> {{effective}} <b>demand,</b> {{the equilibrium}} level of aggregate output is {{a multiple of}} the expected autonomous demand for the period under consideration.

However, {{in the long term}} firms are presumed to use capacity at the normal or desired degree. Can the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>demand</b> be extrapolated to conclude that the rate of growth of output will depend on the expected rate of growth <b>of</b> autonomous <b>demand?</b> A positive answer would be a significant step towards a Keynesian long-period theory of output. This paper attempts to make an advance in that direction.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I theorize the roles <b>of</b> {{effective}} <b>demand</b> and Say’s Law in the Marxist theory of exploitation and accumulation. I claim that an exogenous rate of exploitation, or an exogenous functional {{distribution of income}} between profits and wages, implies deploying the strongest version of Say’s law, which leads profit rates not to equalize across sectors. Marx’s own procedure in Capital III of simultaneously supposing an exogenous rate of exploitation and profit rate equalization was therefore logically inconsistent. Once Keynes’ <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>demand</b> is introduced, the rate of exploitation, and hence the distribution of income between wages and profits, becomes endogenous to aggregate demand. Profit rates can then equalize across sectors and prices of production can function as gravitational centers for market prices in a competitive economy.
