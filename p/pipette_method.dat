40|$|Laser-diffraction {{analysis}} (LDA) is a rapid automated method achieving highly resolved fre-quency {{distributions of}} particle sizes. Recently, LDA {{has come into}} use in environmental sciences. However, in the size range of silt and clay deviations from the particle-size analysis with the standard <b>pipette</b> <b>method,</b> which {{is regarded as the}} reference method for soil-texture classification, have been reported. Therefore, this study concentrates (1) on the verification of systematic relations between both methods using a series of soils of Lower Saxony (Germany) and (2) on the general applicability of the laser-diffraction method to soil-texture classification as well as (3) texture-based estimates of air capacity, available field capacity, and permanent wilting point. The comparison of LDA with the <b>pipette</b> <b>method</b> demonstrated highly significant linear correla-tions in each of the particle-size fractions from clay to coarse silt. The slope of regressions ranged from 0. 4 with fine silt to 3. 1 with clay. If the clay content derived from LDA was applied to texture classification, the resulting textural classes differed from the standard textural classes, except for purely sandy samples with a clay content of < 5 %. However, the linear-regression model enabled an approach of the LDA-based clay content to values produced with the standard <b>pipette</b> <b>method.</b> Using this transformation, a texture classification became practicable in many cases, but, despite of a high significance level between LDA and <b>pipette</b> <b>method,</b> still led to wrong textural classes in several cases. A comparison with regression models from other regions in Europe showed both similarities and discrepancies, even for similar substrates. Hence, the laser-diffraction analysis cannot be used for the texture classification of soil samples without verification by the standard <b>pipette</b> <b>method...</b>|$|E

40|$|Particle size {{distribution}} {{is one of}} the most influential factors of most soil physical and even some soil chemical characteristics. As modern measurement techniques are being introduced, the need for comparing new methods with older methodologies arises because comparability means data continuity. Here, three institutes conducted a comparison of particle size measurement among the laser, areometer and pipette techniques. The purpose of the comparison was to a) discover any differences among operators, laboratories, and techniques; b) identify if there were any differences and if they could be linked to soil type (e. g. high clay, loam, or sand content) or particle size range; and c) understand if the laser diffraction method gave results that were significantly larger than the other methods of any size fraction. There was no statistically proven difference between the two operators examined based on the <b>pipette</b> <b>method’s</b> result. The comparison of two of the institutes’ <b>pipette</b> <b>methods</b> showed statistically significant differences for three of the eight samples tested. However, these differences only seemed to appear in the 0. 01 mm to 0. 02 mm particle size range. A technical comparison among all three methods resulted in significant differences in all cases except for one sample that had very high sand content and very low clay content. Finally, the laser diffraction method was analyzed to see if it measured a larger amount of the clay fraction, however, it instead overestimated the silt and the fine sand (0. 01 mm to 0. 02 mm) fraction, not the clay fraction. Therefore, we conclude that different methodologies can provide significant difference in particle-size measurement. Based on the results, we recommend creating a widely accepted patent for sample preparation (disaggregation, the use of peroxide or other agents, using ultrasonic or other methods) and for measuring techniques (a set of refractive and sorption indexes, using ultrasonic during the measurement, pump speed etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|Particle size {{distribution}} (PSD) is essential infor-mation {{for those in}} the fields of engineering and environmental geosciences, sedimentology, and pedol-ogy. The PSD can be determined by conventional sieve, hydrometer, and <b>pipette</b> <b>methods.</b> However, since the 1980 s, the PSD of soils has also been determined via the laser diffraction method, which is more reliable and faster and which can be used repeatedly. With this method there are two optical theories commonly used for the determination of PSD: the Mie and the Fraunhofer theories. The main difference between these theories is that the Mie theory requires the refractive index (RI) and absorption coefficient (AC) values of the particles and the RI value of the suspending medium, whereas the Fraunhofer theory does not. Although the Mie theory is more appropriate for soil samples, especial-ly for the determination of clay-size fraction, there are not yet agreed-upon values of RI and AC for soils samples that can be used by researchers and practitioners. In this study, acceptable values for RI and AC were investigated extensively by analyzing 35 natural soil samples that were mainly of sedimentary origin. Based on the results obtained, the values of 1. 55 and 0. 1 for RI and AC, respectively, are suggested for laser diffraction analysis of naturally occurring sedimentary soil samples with respect to geotechnical practices. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the pitfalls of using the Fraunhofer theory for the analysis of soil samples, especially for clay-size particles, the PSDs and clay-size fractions obtained from the Mie and Fraunhofer theories were also compared by setting different RI and AC values for the Mie theory...|$|R
40|$|Classically, {{the grain}} size {{of soil and}} {{sediment}} samples {{is determined by the}} sieve method for the coarse fractions and by the <b>pipette</b> <b>method,</b> based on the 'Stokes' sedimentation rates, for the fine fractions. Results from the two methods are compared with results from laser diffraction size analysis, which is based on the forward scattering of monochromatic coherent light. From a point of view of laboratory efficiency, the laser sizing technique is far superior. Accuracy and reproducibility are shown by measurements on certified materials. It appears that laser grain size measurements of certified materials correspond very well with the certificated measurements. Tests were also done on a set of randomly selected sediments of fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine origin. Except for the (< 2 μm) clay fraction, there is a coarsening of the mean diameter of one to two size classes (0 - 25 φ), caused by the non-sphericity of the particles. The platy form of the clay particles induces considerable differences (eight size classes) between pipette and laser measurements: the < 2 μm grain size, defined by the <b>pipette</b> <b>method</b> corresponds with a grain size of 8 μm defined by the Laser Particle Sizer for the studied sediments.

The accuracy and precision of the <b>pipette</b> <b>method</b> were confirmed by the mass balance of particles in peptised suspensions of a red-brown earth subsoil and a kaolinite. Percentages indicated by a plummet balance were corrected for the actual densities of fractions measured separately. Residual differences from the pipette values showed that the balance was accurate but lacked the precision needed to deduce densities to 0. 01 mg/mm 3. Values of the density of clay fractions were deduced from the means of published percentages obtained by the two methods where replicate suspensions were used and also from the mean difference based on a comparison using 199 soil samples. For the latter, an underestimate of clay percentages indicated by the balance had first to be allowed for. Clay-deduced densities were in the range 2. 802. 83 mg/mm 3, compared with 2. 84 mg/mm 3 measured on the separated subsoil clay. The values are similar, probably because the clays are derived from mica. The density of the separated subsoil silt was 2. 64 mg/mm 3, less than quartz, {{because of the presence}} of feldspar.

40|$|Abstract. It {{can provide}} {{theoretical}} guidance {{for the prevention}} of soil erosion and planting structure adjustment to study on fractal characteristics of soil particle-size distributions under different landform and land-use types. Soil particle-size distribution (PSD) {{is one of the most}} important physical attributes due to its strong influence on soil properties related to water movement, productivity and soil erosion. The fractal and multifractal measures were useful tools in identifying soil PSD with different taxonomy. Land-use type, as one of important factors to affect soil PSD was paid little attention in the previous research. In this paper, the theory of soil particle-size fractal was applied to characterize PSD in soils with the same taxonomy and different land-use types. Then the effects of land use on the fractal and multifractal parameters were analyzed. The study was conducted on the loess hilly areas of the Loess Plateau in Nanxiaohegou basin of Gansu. Soil was sampled from 18 land use types.

Sand fractions detected by laser diffraction were 107 % of the sieve fraction in marine samples, and 99 % in the fluvial samples. Correlations for fractions smaller than reference size are generally better than those for individual size fractions. Both the 2 µm and the 50 µm boundary cause problems in the comparison. The first because of platy shape of clay minerals, and the second due to both a change in method in the pipette/sieving procedure, and to nonsphericity of particles.

Specific discussion of the compositional nature of the size fractions are considered in the following section for each site. RESULTS Triangular diagrams, {{based on the results of}} grain-size analyses from each site, are given in Figure 1. A complete listing of grain-size results is presented as Tables 1 and 2. Cumulative curves of the 23 detailed analyses are presented as Figure 2...|$|R
40|$|Faculty mentor: Edgar A. ArriagaModeling and {{simulation}} of microfluidic devices to capture single muscle fibers {{has led to}} several design possibilities. Before testing the fabricated devices, however, a procedure for the isolation of single muscle fibers from muscle tissue must be developed. The aim is to optimize a collagenase treatment that can yield consistent fibers of large quantity and dimensions that correspond to device tapering regions. Optimization of collagenase concentration and trituration showed that a 0. 6 % (w/v) solution produced the most fibers and the wide bore <b>pipette</b> tip <b>method</b> of trituration produced the longest fibers. Further analysis of centrifugation reinforced the theory of fiber separation and clean up based upon length. Future work includes testing of a larger sample size of muscle tissue/type, testing fiber functionality, preparing new methods of collagenase preparation and treatment, and seeing fiber response/analysis in the fabricated devices. This {{research was supported by}} the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{fluctuation}} {{method is}} comparable to the traditional pour plate method in terms of sensitivity and accuracy, however, it does have a number of advantages: it needs less test sample, it has a simple colorimetric endpoint, counting the number of positive wells out of possible 96 or 48 wells is much less time consuming than counting individual colonies on an agar plate. Several commercial kits are available. Most kits have consumable components in a ready-to-use state, including lyophilized bacteria, and tests can be performed using multichannel <b>pipettes.</b> The fluctuation <b>method</b> also allows for testing higher volumes of aqueous samples (up to 75% v/v), increasing the sensitivity and extending its application to low-level environmental mutagens.|$|R
