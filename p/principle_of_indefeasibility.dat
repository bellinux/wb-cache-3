40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> {{of title}} {{is one of}} the main {{features}} and attributes of the Torrens System of conveyance. It involves the proposition that once a person is registered as proprietor of a certain estate or interest in land he or she acquires a title that cannot be vitiated except as prescribed in the legislation establishing the system. The indefeasibility principle was designed not only to protect title of the registered proprietor from unregistered interests, but also to save persons dealing with registered land from the trouble and expense of going behind the Register Book in order to investigate the validity of title or possible rival claims to the land. The aim was to simplify and expedite the process of transfer of title to land. Yet, almost thirty years ago one William Kaputin, then a recent law graduate of the University of Papua New Guinea, made a scathing attack against the operation of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> of title in his country. He claimed that the Tolai people of New Britain's Gazelle Peninsula viewed the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> with contempt because it frustrated all their attempts to recover land they lost at the hands of the colonial administration. Kaputin charged that the doctrine of indefeasibility was deliberately introduced in PNG by the Australian colonial administration in order to protect foreigners' land titles, which both the administration and the courts knew were acquired by dubious means. He demanded that in the interest of justice for the indigenous people it was necessary to review the operation of this doctrine in Papua New Guinea...|$|E
40|$|The {{story of}} 2 ̆ 2 {{personal}} equities 2 ̆ 2 in Singapore {{is a fascinating}} one. The first successful claim of a 2 ̆ 2 personal equity 2 ̆ 2 outside the statutory regime in Singapore surfaced some forty years after {{the introduction of the}} Torrens system in 1956. Subsequently, the 2 ̆ 2 personal equities exception 2 ̆ 2 was affirmed by one Court of Appeal and rejected by another. Since then, the Singapore courts have proceeded on the basis that there is a finite list of 2 ̆ 2 personal equities 2 ̆ 2 listed in section 46 (2) of the Land Titles Act. This article proposes to explore these developments and demonstrate that the 2 ̆ 2 personal equities exception 2 ̆ 2 is in truth not an exception to indefeasibility. As a matter of statutory interpretation, such claims are simply not caught in the first place by the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> as conferred by section 46 (1) of the Land Titles Act. As such, potential 2 ̆ 2 personal equities 2 ̆ 2 claims ought not to be limited by section 46 (2) exclusively...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> title - {{should it}} be immediate or {{should it be}} deferred? - has, for many years, but significantly not for the last 15 - been a hotly debated topic among academics of property law in New Zealand. Under the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> deferred <b>indefeasibility</b> a title obtained fraudulently can be defeated until it is "perfected" by a subsequent bona fide transfer for value. In contrast, the immediate indefeasibility theory provides that registration will immediately validate a transfer, {{even if it is}} forged or otherwise void or voidable. This latter theory was confirmed in the landmark decision of Frazer v Walkel 3 in 1967. Many subsequent critical appraisals explored the consequences of the judgment. However, little academic writing on the topic is apparent in any of the New Zealand periodicals from the mid- 1970 s. Does this imply that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> immediate <b>indefeasibility</b> is "set in stone" in this country...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{whether the}} {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> title and its three associated principles – the mirror principle, the curtain principle, {{and the insurance}} principle – are mythical constructs, and not legal facts as they are portrayed in the dominant legal discourse and in traditional legal research sources. It is commonly understood that <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> title {{is the hallmark of}} land titles systems of registration, especially those based on the Torrens model, and Saskatchewan is a jurisdiction which operates such a system. When one examines the genesis of land titles systems and <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> title, Saskatchewan’s land titles statutes and recent court decisions, one discovers that there is a dichotomy between <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> title in practice and how it is portrayed in theory.

The issue of management of interests pertaining to Crown Land has become increasingly relevant due to the complexities associated with balancing public interests including native title with more commercial interests in land generated through carbon sequestration, forestry and mining.

40|$|Neither the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) nor {{the various}} State and Territory real {{property}} Acts adequately address the effect upon native {{title of the}} administrative act of registering an instrument creating or affecting ordinary (non-native title) interests in land under the Torrens system of land registration. The possibility that native title qualifies the concept <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> title in two situations is examined in this paper. The first possible qualification relates {{to whether or not}} registration of a statutory grant of land made pursuant to land rights legislation attracts the <b>indefeasibility</b> provisions <b>of</b> the Torrens statutes vis a vis native title. The second possible qualification stems from the Federal Court decision in Hayes v Northern Territory. It relates to whether or not registration of an invalid 'previous exclusive possession act', which is relied upon to confirm the extinguishment of native title, confers an indefeasible title on the registered proprietor in relation to native title. The practical legal implications of classifying native title as an exception to indefeasibility and as a ground for invoking the deferred indefeasibility theory are considered. Two theoretical rationales underlying a native title exception to indefeasibility are also suggested...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a great deal}} of case law has been {{generated}} in relation to mortgages where the mortgagee has not engaged in adequate identity verification of the mortgagor and the mortgage has subsequently been found to be forged.

This article examines the mortgagee’s position with the benefit <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> and then considers the impact of the careless mortgagee provisions on the rights of a mortgagee under a forged mortgage, concluding that the provisions significantly change the dynamic between a registered mortgagee and registered owner who has not signed the mortgage. These provisions appear to give the mortgagee a conditional indefeasibility, with the intention of reducing the State’s exposure to the payment of compensation in the case of identity fraud. They are however, more successful in the case of forgery by a third party rather than forgery by a co-owner...|$|R
60|$|It {{appears from}} {{what has been}} said, that justice is a name for certain moral requirements, which, {{regarded}} collectively, stand higher in the scale of social utility, and are therefore of more paramount obligation, than any others; though particular cases may occur in which some other social duty is so important, as to overrule {{any one of the}} general maxims of justice. Thus, to save a life, it may not only be allowable, but a duty, to steal, or take by force, the necessary food or medicine, or to kidnap, and compel to officiate, the only qualified medical practitioner. In such cases, as we do not call anything justice which is not a virtue, we usually say, not that justice must give way to some other moral principle, but that what is just in ordinary cases is, by reason <b>of</b> that other <b>principle,</b> not just in the particular case. By this useful accommodation of language, the character <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> attributed to justice is kept up, and we are saved from the necessity of maintaining that there can be laudable injustice.|$|R
40|$|Sustainability’ is {{a policy}} mantra of modern governments {{particularly}} in relation to natural resources. The traditional connection between land ownership and access to natural resources, such as forestry, flora, fauna, minerals, water and energy, {{has given rise to}} an unprecedented number of restrictions and obligations on land owners in their use of the land and resources. The growing numbers of statutory exceptions and restrictions on rights of ownership and use of a fee simple holder presents serious challenges for the utility of the Torrens register, which was originally designed to record private interests in land or affecting title to land. Advocates proposing uniform Torrens legislation should give consideration to an alignment of government policies emphasising sustainability as a core requirement of effective land use and management, and the core Torrens concepts <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> and security <b>of</b> title.
