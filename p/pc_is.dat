The {{first of}} three games in the , it was {{published}} by LucasArts and Nintendo and released for Microsoft Windows and Nintendo 64 in December 1998.

5|$|The Interfraternity Council (IFC) {{comprises}} 13 fraternities. The Panhellenic Council (<b>PC)</b> <b>is</b> {{made up of}} 7 sororities.

The Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) consists of 9 cultural organizations for Latinos, Asians, and South Asians, (5 fraternities and 4 sororities).|$|E
50|$|Single-unit PCs (also {{known as}} {{all-in-one}} <b>PCs)</b> <b>are</b> a subtype of desktop computers that combine the monitor and {{case of the}} computer within a single unit. The monitor often utilizes a touchscreen as an optional method of user input, but separate keyboards and mice are normally still included. The inner components of the <b>PC</b> <b>are</b> often located directly behind the monitor and many of such <b>PCs</b> <b>are</b> built similarly to laptops.|$|R
40|$|Primary cilia (<b>PC)</b> <b>are</b> solitary, sensory organelles {{that are}} {{critical}} for several signaling pathways. <b>PC</b> <b>were</b> detected by immunofluorescence of cultured cells and breast tissues. After growth for 7 days in vitro, <b>PC</b> <b>were</b> detected in ∼ 70 % of breast fibroblasts and in 7 – 19 % of epithelial cells derived from benign breast (184 A 1 and MCF 10 A). In 11 breast cancer cell lines, <b>PC</b> <b>were</b> present at a low frequency in four (from 0. 3 % to 4 % of cells), but were absent in the remainder. The cancer cell lines with <b>PC</b> <b>were</b> all of the basal B subtype, which {{is analogous to the}} clinical triple-negative breast cancer subtype. Furthermore, the frequency of PC decreased with increasing degree of transformation/progression in the MCF 10 and MDA-MB- 435 /LCC 6 isogenic models of cancer progression. In histologically normal breast tissues, <b>PC</b> <b>were</b> frequent in fibroblasts and myoepithelial cells and less common in luminal epithelial cells. Of 26 breast cancers examined, rare <b>PC</b> <b>were</b> identified in cancer epithelial cells of only one cancer, which was of the triple-negative subtype. These data indicate a decrease or loss of PC in breast cancer and an association of PC with the basal B subtype.

5|$|The {{version for}} {{personal}} computers (<b>PC)</b> <b>is</b> an action role-playing game which plays from a top-down perspective. Controlling Nakajima, the player explores the labyrinthine levels of a dungeon populated by enemies. Combat {{plays out in}} real time, with Nakajima fighting demons using both short-range melee attacks and ranged magic attacks. Each section of the dungeon ends in a powerful boss character.|$|E
5|$|Cosades inducts {{the player}} into the Blades on the Emperor's orders, {{and sets the}} player on various quests to uncover the mysterious disappearances and revelations that the {{citizens}} of Vvardenfell have experienced, particularly the Sixth House and the Ashlander prophecies of the Nerevarine. It is later revealed that the induction under Cosades, and the player's release from prison, {{was due to the}} Emperor's suspicion that the player might be the Nerevarine – a reincarnation of the legendary Dunmer hero Indoril Nerevar – or at least someone would make a convincing imposter to use for political gain. The <b>PC</b> <b>is</b> tasked with uncovering the prophecies regarding the Nerevarine, and to fulfil them in order to finally defeat Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House cult.|$|E
5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. <b>PC</b> <b>is</b> a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E

50|$|<b>PC</b> <b>are</b> {{distinguished}} from sub-wavelength structures, such as tunable metamaterials, because the PC derives its properties from its bandgap characteristics. <b>PCs</b> <b>are</b> sized {{to match the}} wavelength of light, versus other metamaterials that expose sub-wavelength structure. Furthermore, PCs function by diffracting light. In contrast, metamaterial does not use diffraction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{properties}} of polycarboxylate superplasticizers (<b>PCs)</b> <b>are</b> {{related to their}} structures. For better understanding the different properties between PCs, their structures should be examined. In this paper, three kinds of <b>PCs</b> <b>are</b> synthesized by radical copolymerization method. The structure and property of <b>PCs</b> <b>are</b> studied by means of high performance liquid chromatography, zeta potential, water reducing rate and fluidity of cement paste. The {{results show that the}} conversion rate of reaction monomers is over 97 %, and the reaction monomers are fully in the polymerization. The ester-type PCs has a higher water reduction capacity than the ether-type. At the same dosage, the adsorption and dispersion ability of ester-type <b>PCs</b> <b>are</b> stronger than that of ether-type PCs, yet the ether-type PCs has better slump retention performance in the cement pastes. 1...|$|R
