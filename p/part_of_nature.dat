25|$|The {{origin of}} surfing {{was most likely}} started in New Guinea. It was a sport full of culture, fun, and adventure. Surfing was used to explore the oceans and to have fun {{becoming}} a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> It spread from New Guinea to Hawaii. It is mostly known to be practiced in Hawaii and the surrounding islands, but it has spread {{to the rest of}} the continents. It was not widely accepted by Europeans because it took time away from working and labor, although they enjoyed the excitement of seeing the action of surfing.|$|E
25|$|Science and {{religion}} {{are based on}} different aspects of human experience. In science, explanations {{must be based on}} evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science {{and religion}} are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.|$|E
500|$|Human {{beings are}} thus an {{integral}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Spinoza explains seemingly irregular human behaviour as really [...] "natural" [...] and rational and motivated by this {{principle of the}} conatus.

500|$|Nature, in the {{broadest}} sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. [...] "Nature" [...] can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is {{a large part of}} science. Although humans are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.|$|E
500|$|Cleanth Brooks {{writes that}} [...] "Strange fits" [...] {{presents}} [...] "Kind Nature's gentlest boon", [...] "Three years" [...] its duality, and [...] "A slumber" [...] {{the clutter of}} natural object. Other scholars see [...] "She dwelt", along with [...] "I travelled", as representing nature's [...] "rustication and disappearance". Mahoney views [...] "Three years" [...] as describing a masculine, benevolent nature similar to a creator deity. Although nature shapes Lucy over time and she is seen as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> herself, the poem shifts abruptly when she dies. Lucy appears to be eternal, like nature itself. Regardless, she {{becomes part of the}} surrounding landscape in life, and her death only verifies this connection.|$|E
500|$|Within {{the various}} {{uses of the}} word today, [...] "nature" [...] often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, {{and in some cases}} to the {{processes}} associated with inanimate objects–the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the [...] "natural environment" [...] or wilderness–wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> unless qualified as, for example, [...] "human nature" [...] or [...] "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term [...] "natural" [...] might also be distinguished from the [...] or the supernatural.|$|E

40|$|Environmental ethicists often criticize liberalism. For, many liberals embrace anthropocentric {{theories}} on which only humans have non-instrumental value. Environmental ethicists {{argue that such}} liberals fail to account for many things that matter or provide an ethic sufficient for addressing climate change. These critics suggest that many <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> [...] non-human individuals, other species, ecosystems and the biosphere {{have a kind of}} value beyond what they contribute to human freedom (or other things of value). This article suggests, however, that if environmental ethics are inclusive and also entail that concern for some <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> does not always trump concern for others, they have a different problem. For, when there are many things of value, figuring out what to do can be extremely difficult. Even though climate change is likely to cause problems for many <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> it will probably be good for some other parts. Inclusive environmental ethicists need a theory taking all of the things they care about into account to provide definitive reason even to address climate change. Without this theory, anthropocentric liberals might argue that we should not accept an inclusive environmental ethic. Although there may be something wrong with this line of thought, it at least raises a puzzle for those inclined to accept these ethics...|$|R
5000|$|Powys {{filled his}} [...] "Romance of the Dark Ages", {{with a sense}} of elementalism far surpassing that of other novels.

500|$|There are {{two major}} {{instances}} of allusions to environmental issues within the movie. The first is seen when Chihiro {{is dealing with the}} [...] "stink spirit." [...] The stink spirit was actually a river spirit, but it was so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go. The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of human's need for development, they destroyed a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but don't think about how it can affect other living things.|$|E
500|$|Han is {{probably}} {{best known for her}} stone sculptures with organic forms; she sees her sculpture has having [...] "a force or inner life inside struggling to get out". Having a preference for granite and marble, she has said: [...] "Stone is one of my favourite materials. In the erosion of rock by wind and water are found original, vital qualities which express the significance of life." [...] Han often purchases stone using her own resources from quarries in China, Italy, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. The cost of just the material for solo exhibition pieces can be up to S$20,000. Nonetheless, she is motivated by the encouragement, recognition and acknowledgement her art she receives from others. Examples of Han's sculptures of this genre include Growth (1985), a set of five pear-shaped forms in white marble; Spirit of Nature (1988), three black granite ovoid and spheroid forms; Object C (1992), a pale grey granite object resembling a canoe; and Seeds (2006), large kernels carved from sandstone excavated from Fort Canning Hill during the National Museum's redevelopment. Art historian and critic T.K. Sabapathy has commented that Han is concerned with the uneasy relation between men and nature in the modern era, and has expressed a desire for people to realize that [...] " [...] are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> and not apart from nature". In addition, he has said: ...|$|E
