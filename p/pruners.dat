5000|$|The world's first anvil <b>pruners</b> were {{developed}} and produced in 1923 by Walther Schröder in Kiel, Germany. The <b>pruners</b> {{were given the}} product name [...] "Original LÖWE" [...] and were distributed internationally {{as far back as}} 1925. Other companies are producing anvil <b>pruners,</b> include Bahco, Edma, Felco, Fiskars Gardena and Wolf Garten.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} blade designs for pruning shears: anvil, bypass and parrot-beak. Anvil <b>pruners</b> {{have only one}} blade, which closes onto a flat surface; unlike bypass blades it can be sharpened from both sides and remains reliable when slightly blunt. Anvil <b>pruners</b> are useful for cutting thick branches; one can bite into the stem from one direction, swing the handle around and bite further through narrowed wood from another direction. The anvil is made of a material softer than the blade, so that the blade is not damaged when it meets the anvil. Suitable materials for the anvil are plastic, aluminum, zinc, brass, or bronze alloys. The blades are made from hardened carbon or chromium steels. The hardness of the blades is generally between 54 and 58 HRC. On an anvil pruner, proper cutting is assured even if the blade swerves slightly {{to the left or}} right during cutting. As long as the blade meets the anvil {{at the end of the}} cut and fits tightly against it, the material is separated. For this reason, the blades of anvil <b>pruners</b> can be ground thinner than those on bypass <b>pruners.</b> The LÖWE principle - a drawing cut made against a fixed support - combines a drawing cut with a pushing cut. This is possible because the blade lever and base lever are connected by an eccentric bearing. When the <b>pruners</b> are open, the blade is longer than the anvil thanks to the eccentric bearing. When the <b>pruners</b> close, the blade draws back slightly while it pushes through the material. This reduces the cutting force needed to make a cut still further.|$|E

After completing his MA, <b>Pruner</b> moved to Ellinwood, KS, where he rented a small studio that he shared with another artist. When his studio-mate destroyed the studio (and eight years of <b>Pruner's</b> work), <b>Pruner</b> moved to rural Stafford County, where his mother owned 40 acres of land. On this remote property, <b>Pruner</b> moved a 1950s-era bus, which he converted into his studio and living space. He painted continuously, while also cultivating a small-scale farm and building a living space for himself. <b>Pruner</b> also produced a series of prints at The Lawrence Lithography Workshop, in Lawrence, Kansas, with Michael Sims.|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>pruner</b> serves for pruning new hopvine shoots in spring. The later yield {{depends on}} the right timing and quality of pruning. That is why hop pruning {{is one of the}} most important agrotechnical procedures. A double-disc mechanical <b>pruner</b> used on high trellises cannot be used on low trellises due to its large size. Abroad, for pruning hops on low trellises a specially adapted sprinkler is used (chemical pruning). With regard to the effort to minimize the chemical environmental burden, we opted for the design of the mechanical <b>pruner.</b> Firstly, the low trellis, mechanical <b>pruner,</b> and also elements used in the design of hydraulic circuit are described. Next part of the paper is devoted to the input requirements for both the hydraulic circuit and the mechanical <b>pruner</b> designs. Then a description of an adapted inter-axle carrier used for the experimental model of the hop mechanical <b>pruner</b> and of the effected field measurement follows, along with interpretation of the measured data. These data are depicted in clearly arranged graphs showing the dependency of pressure and hydraulic oil flow on the cutting disc rotational frequency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Large {{databases}} {{of genetic}} data are often biased in their representation. Thus, selection of genetic data with desired properties, such as evolutionary representation or shared genotypes, is problematic. Selection {{on the basis}} of epidemiological variables may not achieve the desired properties. Available automated approaches to the selection of influenza genetic data make a tradeoff between speed and simplicity {{on the one hand and}} control over quality and contents of the dataset on the other hand. A poorly chosen dataset may be detrimental to subsequent analyses. Results We developed a tool, Tree <b>Pruner,</b> for obtaining a dataset with desired evolutionary properties from a large, biased genetic database. Tree <b>Pruner</b> provides the user with an interactive phylogenetic tree as a means of editing the initial dataset from which the tree was inferred. The tree visualization changes dynamically, using colors and shading, reflecting Tree <b>Pruner</b> actions. At the end of a Tree <b>Pruner</b> session, the editing actions are implemented in the dataset. Currently, Tree <b>Pruner</b> is implemented on the Influenza Research Database (IRD). The data management capabilities of the IRD allow the user to store a pruned dataset for additional pruning or for subsequent analysis. Tree <b>Pruner</b> can be easily adapted for use with other organisms. Conclusions Tree <b>Pruner</b> is an efficient, manual tool for selecting a high-quality dataset with desired evolutionary properties from a biased database of genetic sequences. It offers an important alternative to automated approaches to the same goal, by providing the user with a dynamic, visual guide to the ongoing selection process and ultimate control over the contents (and therefore quality) of the dataset. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Tip protectors are {{metal or}} plastic devices that fit {{over the bar}} tip and are usually fitted to small, domestic-class saws.

They find a useful application in pole <b>pruners</b> and one-handed battery-powered saws that are used for trimming, hedge laying etc. The hooked nose of the tip protector can be used to [...] "grab" [...] branches for cutting, and presents no great drawback since these very small saw units are not used for cuts where the bar tip is buried.|$|E
5000|$|Secateurs have short {{handles and}} are {{operated}} with one hand. [...] A spring between the handles causes the jaws to open again after closing. When not in use, the jaws may be held closed by a safety catch or by a loop holding the handles together. Some types {{are designed for}} right-handed or left-handed use only, and some incorporate a rotating handle to reduce friction and minimize hand stress during repetitive use. There are also longer versions called telescopic <b>pruners,</b> which are adjustable for long-reach and operate {{by means of a}} rod system inside of a telescoping pole between the handles and the blades. An early version of these was known as an averruncator.|$|E
50|$|Arborists, orchardists, and gardeners use various {{garden tools}} and tree cutting tools {{designed}} for the purpose, such as hand <b>pruners,</b> loppers, or chainsaws. Additionally in forestry bush saws are commonly used and these are often attached to poles that reach up to 5-6m, {{this is a more}} efficient way of pruning than with ladders. These bush saws on polls have also been motorized as chainsaws which is even more efficient. Older technology used Billhooks, Kaiser blades and pruning knives. Although still used in some coppicing they are not used so much in commercial forestry due to the difficulty of cutting flush with the stem. Flush cuts lead to good wood, non-flush or bark damaging cuts (which are more likely with a swung blade than a sawed one) put the tree at risk of entry cords from forest pathogens.|$|E
