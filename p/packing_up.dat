5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980. Part {{of the difficulty}} in estimating the city's population {{is that part of}} it is nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then <b>packing</b> <b>up</b> when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated to be close to one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E

Claire is <b>packing</b> <b>up</b> her father's files, when her boyfriend West Rosen arrives to try and stop her from revealing his secret. Angered, she gives him his file and breaks up with him. Noah returns home and tells Claire not to expose The Company, informing her that he has made a deal. He will work for them and in exchange his family will be left alone to lead normal lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} Archer discovers Robinson <b>packing</b> <b>up</b> the {{contents}} of his locker. He concedes that it is primarily an intermix problem, but that the engine could still work. Archer and Robinson then steal the NX Beta, with Tucker in flight control, but it starts to suffer the same issues as the Alpha. As Starfleet security detains Tucker, Archer and Robinson manage to coax the engines towards their goal of warp 2.5. Afterwards, Archer and Robinson are reprimanded by Starfleet, and the Vulcans ground the program for a year, but they eventually confirm that his father's design was sound. Back in the future, Archer launches the charges into the cloud, and T'Pol suggests that it be named after Archer's close friend, Robinson.|$|E

The musical program for the screenings were decided and played by the individual accompanists. At times, musical accompaniments were shared in trade journals and the musical accompaniment for Adrift was provided by an unnamed writer from Oklahoma in The Moving Picture World. The suggestion was {{to begin with a}} waltz until the friend pats the artist on the shoulder, when All I Get is Sympathy is played. The suggestion for I Don't Know Where I'm Going completes the scene and Life's A Funny Proposition follows the artist <b>packing</b> <b>up</b> until the artist pulls out the gun. A soft hurry follows as the girl confronts her father, leading to a crescendo at the climax.|$|E

500|$|Before {{starting}} the march across the [...] "dreadful terrain," [...] {{the three men}} spent {{a week in a}} tent at the crash site, <b>packing</b> <b>up</b> and making decisions about what and how much to bring and where to go. The far-off North Pole was not mentioned as an option; the choice lay between two depots of food and ammunition laid down for their safety, one at Cape Flora in Franz Josef Land and one at Sjuøyane (Seven Islands) in Svalbard (see map). Inferring from their faulty maps that the distances to each were about equal, they decided to try for the bigger depot at Cape Flora. Strindberg took more pictures during this week than he would at any later point, including 12 frames that make up a 360-degree panorama of the crash site.|$|E

500|$|The {{death of}} Admiral Horatio D'Ascoyne was {{inspired}} by the collision between HMS Victoria and HMS Camperdown off Tripoli in 1893 because of an order given by Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon. He chose to go down with his ship, saying [...] "It was all my fault"; Victoria was sunk, losing over 350 men. While filming the scene Hamer asked Guinness if he could hold his pose—a salute, facing the camera while the water rose around him—so that the water went over his head; Hamer wanted to show the admiral's cap floating on the surface. Guinness agreed, telling Hamer that as he practiced yoga, he could hold his breath for four minutes. Guinness was attached to the deck by wires to keep him steady and the shot was taken; when Hamer called [...] "cut", the crew began <b>packing</b> <b>up</b> and forgot to release Guinness until four minutes after the scene ended.|$|E
500|$|Metropolis Records {{announced}} in mid-2006 it would reissue KMFDM's entire Wax Trax!-era studio album back catalog, {{which had been}} out of print since the early 2000s. The albums were released in chronological order in groups of two or three from September 2006 to May 2007. Konietzko said the remastering was done over concerns about losing the rights to the back catalog after TVT defaulted on a loan, explaining, [...] "The original agreement was that the catalog would have reverted back to me in 2008, anyway, but TVT and Rykodisc were thinking of just making a KMFDM compilation, which would have eliminated my catalog, and I didn't want that." [...] Konietzko commented in 2006 that the current line-up was the best he had worked with, and said in a separate interview that his former bandmates were [...] "looking at me for handouts". Konietzko {{announced in}} October 2007 that he was <b>packing</b> <b>up</b> and moving back to Germany in the next three months.|$|E

500|$|As the wet {{season ended}} in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in <b>packing</b> <b>up</b> {{to move to}} Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that [...] "God bless the best yaller woman he ever made" [...] and asked the {{listeners}} to join with him in rejoicing that [...] "she's so many shades removed from being entirely black". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "if we could bleach her by any means we would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be". Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E

[...] Covered on both flanks, Sully with three companies and artillery advanced into the encampment without serious opposition. [...] Two chiefs, Little Head and Big Head, and about 150 of their followers surrendered. [...] Because of the close quarters and chaotic nature of the battlefield, Sully was unable to use his artillery.|$|E
