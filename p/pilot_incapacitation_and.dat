However, there were no evidence indicating a bird strike, <b>pilot</b> <b>incapacitation,</b> sabotage <b>and</b> an in-flight structural failure. All of them were ruled out.

40|$|Existing manned cockpit {{operations}} {{consider the}} reduction of the team of pilots to one pilot to save costs, improve crew scheduling and aircraft availability. However, safety concerns have so far prevented the introduction of single-pilot flights in commercial aviation. This study seeks to address these concerns by offering an alternative tripartite concept for commercial single-pilot operations including a remote-copilot center. The main focus is on the ground station. Different kinds of remote-copilots and ground-operators support the single-pilot: a departure remote-copilot, an arrival remote-copilot; and different cruise remote-copilots/ground operators, who serve as specialist in their field of operation. A socio-technical system is defined which has the potential to deal with several issues arising in commercial single-pilot operations (SPO). <b>Pilot</b> <b>incapacitation,</b> flight length, <b>and</b> training are discussed. On the basis of the proposed tripartite function allocation on a higher level, a first step towards SPO in commercial aviation is made...|$|R

40|$|In-flight {{impairment}} <b>and</b> <b>incapacitation</b> {{are defined}} as states wherein the pilot’s ability to effectively control the aircraft is adversely affected. They are of special concern in general aviation given {{there may be no}} second pilot to take over the controls. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine the characteristics of fatal general aviation accidents associated with impairment <b>and</b> <b>incapacitation.</b> A comprehensive review of 2, 696 fatal general aviation accidents from 1990 - 1998 using database records maintained by the NTSB and FAA yielded 216 accidents (8. 01 %) that had some form of impairment/incapacitation or physiological causes mentioned in the accident report. Impairment due to drugs (n = 88, 40. 7 %) and alcohol (n = 68, 31. 5 %) were the most common causes. Cardiovascular causes were cited in 12. 03 % (n = 26) of the cases. Significant relationships were observed between age and impairment/incapacitation due to alcohol, drugs, and cardiovascular causes. Some disparities were observed between the prevalence of alcohol in toxicology samples and alcohol impairment being cited in the accident report as a contributory factor. The analysis provides some insight into the possible causes of <b>pilot</b> impairment <b>and</b> <b>incapacitation</b> in general aviation.

40|$|Pilot spatial {{disorientation}} {{is a leading}} factor contributing to many fatal flying accidents. Spatial orientation {{is the product of}} integrative inputs from the proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual systems. Vestibular neuritis (VN) can lead to sudden <b>pilot</b> <b>incapacitation</b> in flight. VN is commonly diagnosed by demonstration of unilateral vestibular failure, as unilateral loss of caloric response. As this test reflects the function of the superior part of the vestibular nerve only, cases of pure inferior nerve neuritis will be lost. This paper describes a fighter pilot with symptoms suggestive of VN but with normal caloric test results. Further test showed unilateral loss of vestibular evoked myogenic potential.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the conceptual {{design of a}} Virtual Pilot Assistant (VPA) based on {{an analysis of the}} requirements for single-pilot operations of commercial transport aircraft.

The VPA performs a real-time assessment of the single-pilot‟s cognitive states as well as making predictions on the performance levels of the single pilot, thereby providing complementary and timely support to the single pilot as required. In case of <b>pilot</b> <b>incapacitation,</b> the VPA enables the single-pilot aircraft to be operated as an RPAS, allowing ground operators to take over as necessary and make an emergency landing at a suitable location...|$|R

40|$|History {{has shown}} that a larger flight crew does not per se imply that {{aircraft}} operations will be safer. The goal of this thesis {{is to determine the}} technical hurdles to Single Pilot Commercial Operations (SPCO). Continued technological developments, the upsurge of commercial Unmanned Aerial Systems, the non-negligible cost of air crews, and yet, stagnation in commercial crew reductions since 1980 are reasons to clarify the current technical hurdles to SPCO. The research was initiated with a broad literature survey. It was found that advances in technology and human factors understanding have made each historical crew reduction possible, through a redistribution of tasks across (fewer) humans, automation, supporting infrastructure and accompanying procedures. An exhaustive list was then formulated of all issues that could potentially affect a reduction to SPCO. Consequently, in-depth research of each issue determined the most predominant challenges to SPCO are; a. providing the single pilot with the correct situational awareness at a manageable workload; b. ensuring adequate monitoring of pilot performance without an on-board human co-pilot; and c. ensuring redundancy in case of <b>incapacitation.</b> Finally, Single <b>Pilot</b> <b>Incapacitation</b> Redundancy (SPIR) solutions were explored by means of a scenario analysis and functional analysis. The greatest challenge to SPIR {{turns out to be the}} setting of the incapacitation detection sensitivity threshold; avoiding excessive false warnings (alarm problem) yet retaining immediacy for timely recovery of stable flight; both <b>incapacitation</b> detection <b>and</b> seem-less control take-over are tasks more suited to the adaptability of humans.

40|$|Background: The {{cognitive}} {{factor of}} Anxiety Sensitivity (AS; {{the fear of}} anxiety and related bodily sensations) is theorized {{to play a role}} in cannabis use and its disorders. Lower-order facets of AS (physical concerns, mental <b>incapacitation</b> concerns, <b>and</b> social concerns) may be differentially related to cannabis use behavior. However, little is known about the impact of AS facets on the immediate antecedents of cannabis use. Methods: This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to prospectively examine the relations between specific facets of AS, cannabis craving, state anxiety, and cannabis use in the natural environment using real-world data about ad lib cannabis use episodes. Participants were 49 current cannabis users (38. 8 % female). Results: AS-mental incapacitation fears were related to significantly greater severity of cannabis-related problems at baseline. During the EMA period, AS-mental <b>incapacitation</b> <b>and</b> AS-social concerns significantly interacted with cannabis craving to prospectively predict subsequent cannabis use. Specifically, individuals with higher craving and either higher AS-mental incapacitation or AS-social concerns were the most likely to subsequently use cannabis. In contrast to prediction, no AS facet significantly moderated the relationship between state anxiety and cannabis use. Conclusions: These findings suggest facets of AS (mental <b>incapacitation</b> <b>and</b> social fears) interact with cannabis craving to predict cannabis use. Findings also suggest differential relations between facets of AS and cannabis-related behaviors...|$|R
