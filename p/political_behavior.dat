5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media.

While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to define and}} identify mutual relations between the notion of <b>political</b> <b>behaviors</b> and electoral behaviors. The reference point for their operationalization is the particular time of broadly understood political activity, namely the time of an election campaign (or even a permanent campaign). <b>Political</b> <b>behaviors</b> are approached as any form of individual or group involvement in a political process or in any activity producing political outcomes. In terms of individuals – humans, <b>political</b> <b>behaviors</b> are constituted by a reaction of individuals or social groups to the stimuli rooted in political phenomena and processes. It {{is important to note}} that like all conscious human <b>behaviors,</b> also <b>political</b> <b>behaviors</b> result from a particular state of consciousness. A slightly narrower category, provided by what we could call a classical approach, are voters’ electoral behaviors. These concern the relationship between voters and political parties, and they are expressed, for example, by means of the voting act. Understood in this way, <b>political</b> <b>behaviors</b> facilitate gaining knowledge of the electorate and their evolution. This knowledge allows political parties to adopt optimal strategies at the time of elections and in their parliamentary activity. This paper is an attempt at demonstrating that the electorate’s behaviors at the time of a permanent campaign are identical with <b>political</b> <b>behaviors.</b> It is assumed that when the entire political activity boils down to continuous striving for the support of citizens, and the state apparatus – including the decision-making center – is transformed into a tool designed to maintain the popularity of the authorities, all activities in the realm of politics resemble the behaviors that are strictly related to the electoral act...|$|R

25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{there was}} a dramatic, {{fundamental}} shift in American society generally, which profoundly affected public <b>political</b> <b>behavior.</b> Elected officials were compelled to confront new constituents with new attitudes. In particular, for the Central Intelligence Agency, the societal change altered notions of what was considered 'politically acceptable conduct'. In the early cold war period, the Agency had been somewhat exempt from normal standards of accountability, {{so that it could}} employ its special espionage and covert capacities against what was understood as an amoral communist enemy. At times during this period, the CIA operated under a cloak of secrecy, where it met the ideological foe in a gray-and-black world. In that era, normal Congressional oversight was informally modified to block unwanted public scrutiny, which might be useful to the enemy.|$|E
25|$|Easton {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the “first generation of behavioral revolutionaries” in the discipline of political science. Like other early behavioralists, Easton initially sought to gain control over the masses of data being generated by social science research in the early 1950s, which they thought was overwhelming social scientists with quantitative and qualitative data {{in the absence of an}} organizing theoretical framework. Easton argued for development of a proper science of political studies that would produce reliable, universal knowledge about social phenomena, and that the purpose of scientific rules of procedure was to make possible the discovery of a highly generalized theory of politics. Easton’s vision was one of a “general theory” of political science that would consist of a deductive system of thought so that a limited number of postulates, as assumptions and axioms, a whole body of empirically valid generalizations might be deduced in descending order of specificity and provide predictive causal explanations of <b>political</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
40|$|For {{the greater}} part of human history, <b>political</b> <b>behaviors,</b> values, preferences, and {{institutions}} have been viewed as socially determined. Discoveries during the 1970 s that identified genetic influences on political orientations remained unaddressed. However, over the past decade, an unprecedented amount of scholarship utilizing genetic models to expand the understanding of political traits has emerged. Here, we review the ‘genetics of politics’, focusing on the topics that have received the most attention: attitudes, ideologies, and pro-social political traits, including voting behavior and participation. The emergence of this research has sparked a broad paradigm shift in the study of <b>political</b> <b>behaviors</b> toward the inclusion of biological influences and recognition of the mutual co-dependence betwee...|$|R

40|$|Motivated {{by earlier}} work {{studying}} the genetic basis of political attitudes (Martin, Eaves, Heath, Jardine, Feingold & Eysenck 1986, Alford, Funk & Hibbing 2005), {{researchers found that}} <b>political</b> <b>behaviors</b> such as voter turnout (Fowler, Baker & Dawes 2008), broader participation (Fowler, Baker & Dawes 2008), and partisan attachment (Settle, Dawes & Fowler 2009, Hatemi, Hibbing, Alford, Martin & Eaves 2009) also have a significant heritable component. These findings prompted {{a great deal of}} discussion and debate and helped spawn the nascent field of "genopolitics". However, in order to push this area of research forward scholars must identify causal mechanisms linking genes to <b>political</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The goal of this dissertation, which is made up of three distinct chapters, is to explore potential causal pathways my testing potential mediators such as personality traits and cognitive ability as well as identifying new genetic variants that may be associated with <b>political</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The first chapter presents a twin study testing whether the psychological traits cognitive ability, personal control, and extraversion mediate the relationship between genes and political predisposition and acts of participation. The second chapter is a candidate gene association study that tests the hypothesis that extraversion mediates a relationship between a variant of the COMT gene and partisan attachment. The third chapter presents the results from a genome-wide association study of validated voter turnout in the 2010 election. To complete this work I have utilized four novel genetically informative data sets. Two of these data sets were constructed here at UCSD, one at the University of Minnesota, and another with a research team from Sweden. All three studies shed new light on the relationship between genes and these <b>political</b> <b>behaviors.</b> However, the mediation results from Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 suggest only a modest amount of the relationship between genes and <b>political</b> <b>behaviors</b> are mediated by personality traits and cognitive ability. In addition, the investigation of over 500, 000 genetic variants presented in Chapter 3 did not turn up many new significant associations. However, all three chapters provide a template for how future work in this area should be done as well as highlight the pitfalls in this burgeoning area of researc...|$|R
25|$|The {{writings}} of Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse were drawn upon. Gramsci wrote on power, cultural and ideological conflicts {{in society and}} institutions—real-time class struggles playing out in rapidly developing industrial nation states through interlinked areas of <b>political</b> <b>behavior,</b> Marcuse on coercion and hegemony in that cultural indoctrination and ideological manipulation through the means of communication ("repressive tolerance") dispensed {{with the need for}} complete brute force in modern 'liberal democracies'. His One-Dimensional Man was addressed to the restive students of the sixties. Marcuse argued that only marginal groups of students and poor alienated workers could effectively resist the system. Both Gramsci and Marcuse {{came to the conclusion that}} the ideological underpinnings and the 'superstructure' of society was vitally important in the understanding of class control (and acquiescence). This could perhaps be seen as an extension of Marx's work as he did not cover this area in detail. Das Kapital, his mainly economic work, was meant to be one of a series of books which would have included one on society and one on the state, but his death prevented fulfilment of this.|$|E

In Batman: Shadow of the Bat Annual #2, an Elseworlds story entitled [...] "The Tyrant", Grant made dictatorship and the corrupting influence of power the primary theme. Batman (under the influence of Jonathan Crane) uses his resources to usurp power {{in the city of}} Gotham and institute a police state in which he exercises hegemonic control over the city's population. [...] Anarky becomes a resistance leader, undermining the centers of Batman's power and ultimately overthrowing Bruce Wayne's tyranny.

[...] During {{the early years of the}} character's development, virtually no writers other than Grant used Anarky in DC publications. In the singular portrayal by an author other than Grant during this period, writer Kevin Dooley used Anarky in an issue of Green Arrow, producing an explicitly anti-firearm themed story. Throughout the narrative, dialogue between Anarky and Green Arrow conveys the need for direct action, as Anarky attempts to persuade Oliver Queen to sympathize with militant, economic sabotage in pursuit of social justice.|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{scholars}} have examined how political and informational uses of social media contribute to on- and offline political participation, but {{little is known}} about how non-political social media practices and social media network contexts shape <b>political</b> <b>behaviors</b> on such sites in everyday social media use. Drawing on a theoretical framework that views “the political” as an extended terrain of “the personal,” this dissertation examines the relationships between passive (i. e., consuming content) and active (i. e., producing content) forms of non-political and political social media use, and investigates {{the extent to which these}} associations are stratified by political interest, education, and age, using two separate adult samples of Facebook and Twitter users. With the same focus on everyday social media use, a survey experiment is conducted to investigate the impact of network prime—when users are primed with Facebook network size, diversity (i. e., the degree to which network members are evenly divided across classifications of social groups), and perceived political similarity to groups of connections on Facebook—on users’ willingness to react to political mobilization messages in various ways. The findings presented in this dissertation show that forms of non-political social media use differentially associate with <b>political</b> <b>behaviors</b> on the sites, and that these relationships are not always contingent on political interests, education, and age. In addition to social media practices, social media network contexts also shape <b>political</b> <b>behaviors,</b> such that network prime suppresses users’ willingness to actively engage with certain political mobilization requests. These results broadly support the conceptualization of “the political” as deeply embedded in “the personal,” raise both concerns and hopes for the future of political inequality, and highlight the importance of social contexts in shaping <b>political</b> <b>behaviors</b> on social media sites. Future research should continue to explore how different non-political social media practices and contexts influence behavioral and attitudinal political outcomes on and beyond social media sites...|$|R

30|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{comparative}} scholarship in the U.S. and beyond explains political interest and engagement using the standard socioeconomic model – education, income and occupation. Since interest and attitudes are the property of individual preferences and psychological orientations, {{much of the literature}} concentrates on the predictive capacity of different socioeconomic characteristics. However, other studies convincingly show how individual political orientations are also affected by information sharing, recruitment, and mobilization occurring through inter-personal social connections among acquaintances, friends and relatives, and institutional features of the political system that both constrain and encourage interest and engagement (Holzner, 2007; Rosenstone & Hansen, 1993). In this article, we analyze how interested citizens are in politics, how important politics is in their daily lives, {{and the degree to which}} they believe in the efficacy of Mexican elections. While we cannot evaluate every measurable facet of political engagement in this study, for example, <b>political</b> <b>behaviors,</b> we suspect, following the seminal research of Rosenstone and Hansen (1993) and Verba et al.

Thus employees may find it hard to work with such leaders and, subsequently, recognize the relevance of exercising social influence in order to facilitate their supervisory relationships. Accordingly this chapter examines the effects of a leader’s degree of Machiavellianism on employees’ use of upward influence tactics, and further examines how the moderating roles of the gender of the employee and their perceived leader similarity come into play. In so doing, this chapter addresses the dearth of research examining the effects of Machiavellian leaders on employees’ performance of <b>political</b> <b>behaviors.</b> More specifically, it develops {{a better understanding of how}} Machiavellians may influence employees’ choices of upward influence tactics, and identifies some relevant conditions that may impact the exercise of social influence...|$|R
