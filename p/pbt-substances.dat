30|$|With this editorial, Environmental Sciences Europe is {{starting}} a collection “five years REACH” edited by Christoph Schulte. We already asked for contributions {{focusing on the}} first experiences of certain stakeholders (Authorities, CEFIC, NGOs, Members of ECHAs Committees), and specific issues like nanomaterials, <b>pbt-substances,</b> or endocrine disruptors. Additional manuscripts on related topics are welcome. When REACH is celebrating the sixths birthday in June 2013, the series will be finalised.|$|E
30|$|According to this Article the {{following}} properties are characteristic for substances {{of very high}} concern: carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR substances) – all of them due to category 1 A or 1 B in accordance with section 3.5 - 3.7 of Annex I to CLP-Regulation [5]. With regard to the environment, substances of very high concern are characterized by persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic properties (<b>PBT-substances),</b> or very persistent and very bioaccumulative properties (vPvB-substances). The criteria for PBT and vPvB are set out in Annex XIII of REACH.|$|E
30|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that PFOA and APFO are <b>PBT-substances</b> and promising SVHC candidates according to REACH. Hence, PFOA and APFO {{need to be}} added to the REACH Candidate List. This step alone does not minimize exposure effectively and does not address the concerns of PFOA appropriately. A restriction for production, placing on the market and/or use of PFOA and APFO in certain articles and mixtures is, therefore, necessary as a follow-up. For the future a regulatory process beyond the European level is required to achieve a global protection of humans and the environment from PFOA exposure. Since there are numerous different PFCs manufactured and used worldwide, the intrinsic properties of other PFCs need to be evaluated in future, too. Especially, their fate and behavior in the environment has to be monitored to find out if further regulatory measures are needed.|$|E
30|$|N- 1 -naphthylaniline is {{identified}} as a potential <b>PBT-substance</b> by the screening procedure of the Federal Environment Agency and prioritised for further assessment due to the wide dispersive use. Unfortunately the information submitted with the registration dossier does not allow a conclusion whether the PBT-criteria are fulfilled or not.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{criteria}} of Annex XIII were adapted to the scientific progress with regard to PBT and vPvB properties in March 2011 [14], no decision concerning a PBT or vPvB substance was made in 2011 and 2012. No proposal for a <b>PBT-substance</b> was submitted between August 2009 and July 2012.|$|R
30|$|An {{option to}} {{regulate}} manufacturing, placing {{on the market}} or use of a substance on its own, in a mixture or in an article is the inclusion into Annex XVII of the REACH regulation (Restriction, Art. 67). A restriction might also include residue limits for PFOA and its precursors in articles. For PFOA and APFO as <b>PBT-substances</b> this seems to be appropriate to reduce the environmental PFOA concentrations effectively, because especially the residues in articles need to be controlled successfully. As also precursor compounds contribute to the environmental exposure with PFOA, these compounds need {{to be included in the}} restriction as well. To decide how an effective restriction needs to be designed more information about the residues of PFOA in articles and mixtures are necessary. Furthermore, relevant precursors need to be identified and included in the restriction. When suggesting a restriction, information about possible substitutes is essential: Some substitutes are already known but not much is known about their properties and their long-term effects. A restriction of PFOA, its salts, and its precursors under REACH is envisaged by Germany and Norway and will be initiated in 2013.|$|E
40|$|Chemicals are {{released}} to the environment on a daily basis. Potentially, these chemicals can cause a negative e ect on the environment. In this project investigation of the e ect of four fragrances Citral, Geraniol, Limonene, and Linalool on the freshwater environment are carried out. These four fragrances are present in many care products, and {{are present in the}} major part of the company Urtegaarden Aps' care products, which are marketed as eco-friendly and as having the most stringent enviormental criteria of the Nordic countries. In this report the relationship between the e ect of the four fragrance's on the freshwater environment are adressed and the markedting by Urtegaarden Aps' is elaborated and addressed. This is done by analyzing the fate and e ect of the four frangrance's when discharged to the freshwater environment, and it is examined whether the fragrances pose a risk when discharged. The risk will be estimated from the substances' risk quotient (RQ), half-life, persistence (P), potential of bioaccumulation (B) and toxicity (T). Data on fate and e ects are obtained from the litterature and databases. Elaboration of Urtegaarden Aps' marketing is obtained through interview with the owner and CEO, Gitte Busck. When assessing RQ and PBT-potential of the four fragrances it is found that Limonene and Geraniol have RQ > 1, why further tests should be performed. Based on the criteria set out in REACH none of the fragrances are classi ed as <b>PBT-substances.</b> When Limonene's potential of bioaccumulation is assessed using the Nordic Swan Limonene is classi ed as being bioaccumulative. Urtegaarden Aps is not focused on whether their products contain fragrances. In terms of frangrances Urtegaarden Aps does not have the most stringent criteria of the Nordic countries when compared to the Nordic Swan and the EU Ecolabel. Focusing on fragrance content it is concluded that Urtegaarden Aps' care products cannot be marketed as being eco-friendly because they cannot be said to be among the best-performing products on the market. Instead Urtegaarden Aps focuses on Organic products and consumer information for which they have stringent rules...|$|E
3000|$|Long-term {{strategies}} of the EU are on the development and adaptation of legislative instruments and policy action that enable hazard identification, risk assessment and risk management of EDCs. Specifically, current initiatives such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and Environment and Health Strategy (SCALE) shall serve as legislative frameworks {{in support of the}} regulation of EDCs. Relevant recent developments were the adoption of regulation 1907 / 2006 (REACH), formally adopted on 18 December 2006, the proposal for a directive setting environmental quality standards for priority substances under the water framework directive (2006) or the new pesticide regulation 1107 / 2009 EEC [14, 15] (to be applied in the European Union from 14 June 2011). Specifically, REACH requires an authorization (and/or replacement by suitable alternative substances or technologies) for substances with endocrine disrupting properties, for which there is scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the environment which give rise to an equivalent level of concern as CMR-substances (carcinogens, mutagens, toxic for reproduction - the two highest categories each), <b>PBT-substances</b> (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) and vPvB substances (very persistent and very bioaccumulative). For pesticides with similar properties as these so-called REACH-SVCHs (substances of very high concern according to REACH article 57) no authorization shall be granted according to the new Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009. Regarding wildlife, the new [...] "endocrine cut-off criterion" [...] states: [...] "An active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved if, {{on the basis of the}} assessment of Community or internationally agreed test guidelines, it is not considered to have endocrine disrupting properties that may cause adverse effects on non-target organisms unless the exposure of non-target organisms to that active substance in a plant protection product under realistic proposed conditions of use is negligible" [...] (EC 1107 / 2009, Annex II, 3.8. 2). Thus, a paradigm shift in regulatory decision making was introduced for pesticides with endocrine properties: Instead of the established risk-based approach, a hazard-based approach is now required (i.e. only the proven presence or assumed absence of endocrine disrupting properties shall be decisive for a [non]authorization). However, specific scientific criteria to support regulatory decision making on substances with endocrine disrupting properties both under REACH and the new pesticide regulation are lacking today and thus have to be developed and agreed upon (at least in the EU) within the near future.|$|E
