40|$|Academic {{behaviors}} can {{be enhanced}} through the manipulation of either consequent or antecedent stimuli. In this study, we evaluated the effects of manipulating two antecedent stimulus events with respect to oral reading errors and self-corrections of four mentally retarded children. Using an alternating treatments design, the effects of <b>previewing</b> the target text and <b>previewing</b> an unrelated test were evaluated against no- <b>previewing.</b> In the first <b>previewing</b> condition, the teacher discussed the target text with the children before {{they were required to}} read it orally. The same procedure was used in the other <b>previewing</b> condition but with the provision that an unrelated text was <b>previewed.</b> Oral reading errors decreased and self-corrections increased when the children <b>previewed</b> the target text with their teacher before reading it orally. No changes were observed as a result of implementing the other two procedures, <b>previewing</b> an unrelated text and no- <b>previewing.</b> The results, which were consistent across all four children, showed that reading proficiency can be increased by manipulating antecedent stimulus events prior to oral reading...|$|R
5|$|Before {{its release}} on 10 June 2005, one <b>preview</b> {{wondered}} how the film would fare at the box office. Citing comparisons with the 1953 version, the <b>preview</b> suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film-making, the probable inability of debutant actress, Balan to portray Lalita's character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporary actors and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments to a successful adaptation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- A {{teacher may}} engage {{students}} in learning through <b>previewing.</b> This is easily said than done. Typically, <b>previewing</b> is lack of enforcement and prompt feedback for students. Though much literature on <b>previewing</b> does exist for traditional classroom teaching, <b>previewing</b> design in e-learning environment has been largely neglected in the literature. To bridge this knowledge gap, we report our preliminary findings of a design experiment involving alternative instructional methods and designs applicable in the e-learning context. The effects of <b>previewing</b> on engaging and then improving student learning are mixed but encouraged. Implications for future studies and the decisions of incorporating these designs into instructional methods in blended e-learning are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|As a {{video game}} company with {{different}} production teams, Square had wished for its employees to efficiently share their know-how and technology even before the merger with its competitor Enix. The desire for a common development infrastructure and engine {{dates back to the}} 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy Tactics, which was created in the transitional period from 2D to 3D game production. Back then, the artists working on the game asked programmer Taku Murata for a fast way to check how their work would look in the final game. As the development was carried out on personal computers, the graphics were displayed on computer monitors. This looked very different from the PlayStation console's actual graphics displayed on a television screen. Initially, a faithful <b>preview</b> of the game's visuals was too time-consuming because all data had to be transferred from PC to console first. To evade this step, Murata created an instant <b>preview</b> tool. With this, he soon witnessed a boost in the artists' productivity and in the quality of their work. For 2000's Vagrant Story, the developers opted to reuse this instant <b>preview</b> tool rather than programming a new one from scratch. Murata and his colleagues added new functions to create a unified <b>preview</b> and cutscene tool tailored to the game's fully polygonal 3D graphics. With 2001's PlayOnline service, the company then made its first foray into introducing a common software for all its divisions.|$|E

In the first <b>preview</b> match, Team TNA's The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) were pitted against Team Japan's Speed Muscle (Masato Yoshino and Naruki Doi) in a tag team match lasting 6 minutes. The Motor City Machine Guns won when Sabin pinned Doi, after Shelley and Sabin performed a double kick to the face. The second was between Team International's Alex Koslov and Team TNA's Curry Man, which lasted 4 minutes. Koslov won the match by pinfall after a splash from the top rope. TNA held another <b>preview</b> match on the June19 episode of Impact!.

Because the announcement came suddenly {{and close to the}} release date, video game journalists such as Christopher Grant of Engadget and Jamin Smith of VideoGamer were not intrigued. Grant was unimpressed by the game's announcement, criticizing the concept and its character designs and noted a misspelling in the <b>preview.</b> The game was originally planned to feature a multiplayer mode, though this was cut later on in development.|$|E
