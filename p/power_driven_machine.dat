The results attracted such wide attention that other surgeons soon consulted with Dr. Albee {{to duplicate the}} results. In 1911, Dr. Albee discovered a method for using bone instead of metal to perform a spinal fusion for infected vertebrae. He perfected his techniques including the classification of bone types, and in 1912, invented the [...] "Albee Bone Mill", a <b>power</b> <b>driven</b> <b>machine</b> that reduced the time needed for a bone graft to as little as ten minutes. As a result, {{he was able to}} restore mobility to children in England who had been crippled by tuberculosis and other bone illnesses.|$|E

The benefits are reduced weight and reduced maintenance which {{will result in}} better fuel economy and lower flight cost per mile. One of the important technologies is fault tolerant yet <b>power</b> dense electrical <b>drive</b> systems which have very high reliability to meet safety-critical aircraft applications. The particular subject of this thesis is fault detection in permanent magnet synchronous machines.

40|$|AbstractA common {{method to}} improve process {{stability}} in machining operations with geometrically defined cutting edges is the variation of dead time behavior of tooth engagement, {{which is the}} most responsible influence on regenerative force amplification. In this paper a simulation model in time domain is presented, considering the effect of active and passive spindle speed variation (SSV) with regard to the calculation of process stability. The simulation approaches have been validated by experimental cutting tests on a longitudinal turning process in C 45 N. Beside the improvement of simulation technique, this paper points out the potential of process stabilization by high rates of SSV, even though variation frequencies and amplitudes nowadays are still limited by the <b>drive</b> <b>power</b> of <b>machine</b> tool systems. Additionally, a theoretical approach is presented describing the influence of process and SSV parameterization on the chip thickness modulation as well as the achievable improvement of process stability...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. One {{of basic}} {{elements}} of band bucket elevators is their drive. For determination of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> {{it is necessary to}} conduct calculations on standard by methods, in what it is needed to expend enough time. One of project parameters is productivity of elevator. It is necessary to build parametric dependence of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> of elevator on its design capacity that takes into account a type and descriptions of load, lifting height, standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Methodology. Using the method of hauling calculation of band buckets elevators, the parametric dependences of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> of high-speed elevators are built with deep and shallow buckets from their productivity at fixed type of load and height of getting up. Findings. It is set {{on the basis of the}} built parametric dependences that the change function of a size of elevator power from design capacity (at fixed to the lifting height, load type, rate of tape movement) is piecewise and droningly increasing. The intervals of project values of productivity, which provide the permanent size of elevator <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> are certain in a general view. As the example of application of the recived results the construction process of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> dependence from design capacity of elevator of shotblasting room, which is intended for transporting of the metallic shot using for consolidating of carriage springs, is considered. For concrete type of load and lifting height of such elevator graphic dependence of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> on productivity was built. Originality. Parametric dependences of elevator <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> on its design capacity were first built, which take into account a type and physical and mechanical descriptions of load, lifting height, standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Practical value. The use of the built dependences enables in relation to rapid determination of approximate value of <b>power</b> <b>drive</b> of vertical high-speed elevators with deep and shallow buckets on the stage of planning and to execute the high-quality selection of its basic elements at concrete project descriptions: type of load, productivity, lifting height...|$|R
