40|$|The {{pressure}} sensors tested {{consisted of a}} perforated sphere static, a twin venturi pitot arrangement, designed to permit the derivation of dynamic pressure in both forward and backward flight, and a Mk. 8 T <b>pitot-static</b> <b>head.</b> It was found that only the Mk. 8 T <b>pitot-static</b> <b>head</b> gave satisfactory results over the range of sideslip angles likely to be met in flight. This <b>pitot-static</b> <b>head</b> was then calibrated over a range of incidence and sideslip angles and error contours ware plotted to facilitate the correction of the indicated static and dynamic pressures recorded in flight. The wind vanes measuring sideslip and incidence were also calibrated over the same range and error contours plotted for the correction of their indications. Finally the dynamic response of the wind vanes was investigated to determine their natural frequency and damping and hence their amplitude ratio and phase lag when recording aircraft oscillations...|$|E
40|$|Flights {{have been}} made with an {{airplane}} in icing conditions {{in order to test}} the effect of exhaust heat applied to the wings as a means of preventing ice formations. Other ice-prevention equipment, including an exhaust gas-heated <b>pitot-static</b> <b>head,</b> hot-air-heated windshield, and an inflatable de-icer of recent design, were also tested. Prepared at the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, Moffett Field, California. Originally issued as NACA as an Advance Confidential Report (April 1941). NACA Wartime Report A- 53.

40|$|A {{new type}} of air speed meter is {{described}} which was designed by the technical staff of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The instrument consists essentially of a tight metal diaphragm of high natural period which is acted upon by the pressure difference of a <b>pitot-static</b> <b>head.</b> The resulting deflection of this diaphragm is recorded optically on a moving film...|$|E
50|$|The L-410 UVP-E is an {{unpressurized}} all-metal high-wing commuter aircraft, with Avia V 510 five-blade propellers. It {{is equipped}} with a retractable undercarriage. The aircraft uses two hydraulic circuits: main and emergency. The main electrical system operates with 28V DC. The de-icing system is leading edge pneumatic deicers and electrical heating of propellers, cockpit windshields and <b>pitot-static</b> system <b>heads.</b> Maximum take-off weight of the L-410 UVP-E is 6400 kg with the possibility of an increase to 6600 kg for the E9 and E20 variants, seating capacity 17 to 19. Cruise speed is 170 KIAS, maximum range about 770 nmi km. The airplane is certified for IFR operation, CAT I ILS approach, and flights in icing conditions.|$|R
40|$|Various {{methods of}} {{measuring}} the air speed of airplanes are described. Particular {{emphasis is placed}} on the procedure required to obtain precise measurements of speed by the use of the suspended <b>Pitot-static</b> <b>head</b> or the suspended static head. Typical calibration curves for service installations of Pitot-static heads are shown and the relation between errors in air speed and corresponding errors in observed altitude for such installations is discussed. There is included a brief discussion of various speed-course methods of measuring speed...|$|E
40|$|Several {{possible}} {{effects of}} heavy {{rain on the}} aerodynamic performance of an airplane and of heavy rain and associated atmospheric phenomena on the indications of flight instruments are briefly considered. It is concluded {{that the effects of}} heavy rain on the performance of an airplane are not so great as to force the airplane down from moderate altitudes. Serious malfunctioning of the air-speed indicator may occur, however, as a result of flooding of the <b>pitot-static</b> <b>head</b> and subsequent accumulation of water in the air-speed pressure line. In strong convective situations, like thunderstorms, the rate-of-climb indicator may also be seriously in error owing to rapid variations of atmospheric pressure when entering and emerging from the convection currents...|$|E
40|$|The BAC: 221 {{aircraft}} 1 s fltted with {{a special}} <b>pitot-static</b> <b>head,</b> insensitive to incidence, and aerodynamically compensated on similar principles to the head fitted to the Concorde, to minimise aircraft pressure field effects. Tests have been made on the head covering the Mach number range 0 ' 2 to 1. 4 in two wind tunnels and at three altitudes in flight. The compensation significantly reduces the static pressure errors at high subsonic and transonic speeds but small errors remain at low subsonic and supersonic speeds. The sensitivity to incidence and sideslip, of the pitot and static pressures sensed, is satisfactorily low. The manufacturer's prediction of the head performance agrees reasonably well with tunnel results but poorly with flight results. It appears that the prediction of the aircraft pressure field is inaccurate...|$|E
