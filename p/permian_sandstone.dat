5000|$|Professor Don G Wyckoff. an {{archaeologist}} at the University of Oklahoma, examined the Shawnee stone {{and noted that}} it is a soft red <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone,</b> writing that [...] "the inscription is... remarkably fresh and certainly not as worn or weathered as the stone's natural surface. The Survey staff has viewed other exposures of this <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone</b> which have carved dates as late as 1957 that are more worn and weathered..." [...] Both the Shawnee and Pawnee runestones are products of the modern period. The inscription reads either mldok or midok in standard Elder Futhark lettering.|$|E
50|$|The great {{majority}} of Denver Basin oil and gas fields produce from Cretaceous <b>sandstones,</b> although the <b>Permian</b> Lyons <b>Sandstone</b> is also a producer. Oil has also been produced from <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstones</b> and dolomites and Pennsylvanian limestones in the Nebraska part of the basin.|$|R
50|$|Grouting is seen predominately {{along the}} western seaboard of the UK, {{particularly}} in Pembrokeshire in South West Wales {{and to a lesser}} extent the Isle of Anglesey, Cornwall and Devon. It has also been used, primarily as a sealant, on porous stone slates such as the <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstones</b> of Dumfriesshire.|$|R
50|$|The {{valleys of}} the area cut into Devonian {{quartzite}} and phyllites while the plateau consists of <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstones.</b> Rhyolite and granite also outcrop in the area. Carboniferous granite intruded into the Upper Devonian sediments and the gold deposits {{are a result of}} replacement and impregnation by siliceous solutions bearing gold and sulphides. Silver, copper, tin, lead, arsenic and zinc ores have also been found in the area.|$|R

50|$|Amethyst is {{a natural}} gas field in the Southern North Sea, about 30 mi east of the Yorkshire coast. Gas lies in a <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone</b> {{reservoir}} around 2700 m below the seabed. The gasfield is operated by BP.|$|E
5000|$|Penrith {{has been}} noted {{for the number of}} wells in and around the town, and well-dressing ceremonies were commonplace on certain days in the month of May. Three miles {{south-east}} of the town, on the River Eamont are the [...] "Giants' caves", where the well was dedicated to St. Ninian. The caves are enlarged out of Lower <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstones</b> and their associated breccias and purple shales.|$|R
30|$|The Grès d’Annweiler and the Permien ante-Annweiler {{are both}} Upper Permian units but {{are known as}} the Buntsandstein Inférieur. The GR {{signature}} of these units is characteristically more radioactive {{than that of the}} Grès Vosgien because they are more clayey, and the lithologic transition features a distinctive colour change. In many respects, (GR signature and fine-grained <b>sandstone</b> lithology), these <b>Permian</b> units are quite similar to the Grès à Voltzia unit. Indeed these <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstones</b> are relatively dark, from dark red to reddish brown.|$|R
5|$|The Old Red Sandstone Continent {{became a}} part of the supercontinent Pangaea in the Permian (299–252 Ma), during which proto-Britain {{continued}} to drift northwards. Scotland's climate was arid at this time and some fossils of reptiles have been recovered. However, <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstones</b> are found in only a few places - principally in the south west, on the island of Arran, and on the Moray coast. Stone quarried from Hopeman in Moray has been used in the National Museum and Scottish Parliament buildings in Edinburgh.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mountain}} {{was mostly}} formed during the Paleozoic Era {{and consists of}} <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone.</b> The erosion of sandstone created the natural sites of the hill: the Babás Szerkövek (literally, [...] "man-like stones in a row") and Zsongorkő (Zsongor's stone).|$|E
5000|$|The most {{extensive}} platform of the plateau is the Esplanade, {{which is called}} [...] "Sand Rocks" [...] by local cowboys. This area was formed as a result from weathering of the Hermit shale, which left a hard layer of <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone</b> exposed. This red sandstone {{is one of the}} outstanding features of the plateau.|$|E
50|$|Natural Bridges National Monument is a U.S. National Monument {{located about}} 50 mi {{northwest}} of the Four Corners boundary of southeast Utah, in the western United States, at the junction of White Canyon and Armstrong Canyon, part of the Colorado River drainage. It features the thirteenth largest natural bridge in the world, carved from the white <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone</b> of the Cedar Mesa Formation that gives White Canyon its name.|$|E
40|$|Floristic {{lists are}} vital tools for {{conservation}} planning, research, and wildflower appreciation. The diverse physical geography of Comanche County contributes to {{high degree of}} plant diversity and habitats. The county is probably {{best known for the}} WichitaMountains, which are composed of Cambrian gabbro and granites. To the north of the Wichita Mountains is the Slick Hill, an extensive outcropping of limestone. The surface geology of most of the county is composed of <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstones.</b> Land use in the county includes row crop agriculture and pastureland...|$|R
50|$|The {{cliff face}} is an exposed {{face of a}} greatly {{disturbed}} Devonian sequence, overlain in places by <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstones</b> and breccias. The succession is composed of Givetian limestones, which are separated by a thrust from a Frasnian - Famennian sequence of slates and limestones on top of dolerite and tuffs. These beds are adjacent to interbedded thin bands of shales, fine greenish tuffs, red crinoidal limestones, contorted coarse tuffs and red shales and shale limestone. Inshore, an intrusive albite dolerite sill rests on the tuffs.|$|R

50|$|The oldest sediments {{exposed in}} the {{southern}} sea cliffs of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island consists of a layer of rocky, yellowish to greenish colored sediment. This layer is a thick Paleogene weathering crust (paleosol) that has developed within <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone.</b> This paleosol has been largely modified by periglacial processes and development of ice wedges periodically during the Pleistocene These deeply weathered sediments are unfossiliferous and characterized {{by the presence of}} weathering products like kaolinite and montmorillonite. Saalian sediments uncomfortably overlie this paleosol.|$|E
50|$|Beecroft Peninsula is {{the best}} example of a Permian cliffed coast in New South Wales. The {{peninsula}} is a remnant of a <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone</b> and siltstone plateau, overlain with a patchy veneer of Tertiary and Quaternary sand and gravel deposits. The eastern coast consists of almost continuous cliffs, rising up to 91 m at Point Perpendicular and erosion processes have created caves, blowholes, small peninsulas, clefts, arches, and stacks such as the Drum and Drumsticks. The western coast dips gently into the bay with several low cliffs and sandy beaches. The peninsula is connected to the mainland at its northern end by the Carama Isthmus, a sand swamp, which is 211m wide, at its narrowest width, at low-water mark.|$|E
50|$|Climont is a mound bearing {{witness to}} {{sandstone}} of the Triassic, a vestige resulting from effective erosion pushed onto the pedestale of <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone.</b> This latter formation basically {{corresponds to the}} post-Hercynian peneplain characteristic of the Primary era. In the Saales col, whose flat horizons appear as a peneplain to the eye, there is similarity between the mounds of Climont, Voyemont, Houssot or the hills which continue from Ormont, all {{to a greater or}} lesser extent released by erosion. Note that the final and most recent erosion has arisen from the enclosing faults, which emerged transverse to the Alsatian rift and stretch out towards the Saint-Dié area. They have also induced the collapse of Ormont and are active today, creating the sharp relief of the sandstone massif.|$|E

50|$|The Rock 1 of Bedolina, the {{so-called}} Bedolina Map, is a famous engraved prehistoric rock {{which is part}} of the Camonica valley (Alps, Italian side, Lombardy region) petroglyph complex. It is known as being one of the most ancient topographic maps, interpreted as the depiction of cultivated plots, mountain paths and villages. The locality of Bedolina pertains to the Capo di Ponte municipality (BS-I), near the hamlet of Pescarzo. The area is included in the Seradina-Bedolina Archaeologic park, lying on a prominent terrace on the right slope of the Camonica valley, at an altitude of 530 m above the sea level. The rock, a flat surface of <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone</b> (Verrucano of Lombardy) polished by the Pleistocene glacier, is 9 m long and 4 m wide.|$|E
50|$|The Culmitzsch deposit {{is about}} 15 km south of Ronneburg. It also belonged to Object 90 in Gera. However, {{it had a}} totally {{different}} geology than the Ronneburg ore field. Culmitzsch is a sedimentary deposit in <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone,</b> siltstone and limestone. There are two ore horizons containing disseminated pitchblende and coffinite. An interesting feature is pseudomorphosis of uranium minerals after wood. Specimens still show the cell structure of the wood but are made of pitchblende. The deposit was mined from 1950 to 1967 in three open pits named Culmitzsch, Trünzig and Sorge-Katzendorf. The average ore grade was 0.06% and total production from the three pits was about 11,000 tonnes of uranium. The deposit extends further north from the mined area. This part of the deposit, called Gera-Süd, was explored underground, but difficult geotechnical conditions prevented the mining of this resource. The Culmitzsch and Trünzig open pits were used as tailings management facilities after they were mined out by the Seelingstädt mill, which was established in 1961 near the deposit.|$|E
5000|$|The Kanangra-Boyd Wilderness {{is among}} {{the largest and most}} rugged {{wilderness}} areas in New South Wales. Situated to the south of [...] in the Blue Mountains and the Kanangra-Boyd National Parks, this folded belt or [...] "Rim Rock" [...] area is markedly different from the Permo-Triassic sandstone dominated landforms which comprise the rest of the Blue Mountains. There are isolated residual cappings of <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone</b> in a few places but here the Palaeozoic basement rocks, which are elsewhere buried well below the Permo-Triassic Measures, are on the surface as high land. Rock types include quartzite, diorite, Devonian rhyolites, rhyo-dacites, Silurian phyllites, slates, siltstones and tuff limestones. The Boyd Plateau comprises a dome of Devonian granite intruded into Devonian quartzites and sedimentaries. There are also intrusive igneous rocks from the Carboniferous period. Kanangra Tops at the south-eastern end of the Plateau is one of the Permian outliers. Its fringing fault scarp - Kanangra Walls - comprises Permian sedimentaries of the Capertee Group which rests unconformably on a Devonian Lambie Group Basement. Nearby Kanangra Gorge is cut 600 - 900 m deep in rocks of the Lambie Group, and is one of Australia's deepest gorges. Cloudmaker and Guouogang are eroded remnants of Ordovician quartzite. Further east, in the Coxs River area, is the large Kanimbla granite batholith, implaced during the Carboniferous period. Colong Caves is another outstanding feature of the area. The main Upper Silurian limestone belt, in the Jenolan River valley to the north-west, is 300 m thick, 8 km long and located in a valley 460 m deep. This karst topography, created by the Jenolan and its tributaries, is one of the least understood in Australia.|$|E
30|$|At Saint Pierre Bois (76  km south of Soultz-sous-Forêts), the {{crystalline}} basement {{consists of a}} coarse-grained, biotite–muscovite-bearing granite. This {{crystalline basement}} is overlain, in turn, by a granitic sandstone up to 1  m in thickness, a 30  cm thick layer of silty clay, and light grey to purple-coloured, fine to coarse-grained <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstones</b> (Fig.  2 c). We note that the textural similarity between the granitic sandstone and the granite basement makes these two units difficult to distinguish from each other. Large-scale fracture networks crosscut the granite and terminate at the granite–sandstone interface (Fig.  2 d). Locally, sandstone and silty clay layers are interbedded on the decimetre-scale (Fig.  2 e).|$|R
40|$|Strata of Lower <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstones</b> and volcanics are {{widespread}} throughout Central Europe, forming deeply buried (on average, 4000 -m) aquifers in the North German Basin with formation {{temperatures of}} up to 150 °C. Stimulation methods to increase their permeability by enhancing or creating secondary porosity and flow paths are investigated by deep drilling. The goal is to map {{the potential for the}} generation of geothermal electricity from such deep sedimentaryreservoirs using a doublet of boreholes—one to produce deep natural hot water and the other to re-inject the water after use. For these purposes, an in situ downhole laboratory was established in Gross Schönebeck, north of Berlin, Germany (Fig. 1) ...|$|R

To the extreme east is the Red Rock fault, and the older rocks from the Upper Carboniferous period surface. An outcrop of Coal Measures extends southwards through Tameside and into Hazel Grove. To the east, the sandstones and shales of Millstone Grit are present as outcrops on the upland moors of Dark Peak and South Pennines, and, to the south, are the limestones of the White Peak.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{geothermal}} {{potential of the}} Main Karoo Basin has not been addressed in the past. A first assessment of <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone</b> formations in the Eastern Cape Province, including down-hole temperature data from deep boreholes, and evaluation of groundwater temperature and heat flow values from literature leads to 3130 TWh (11. 3 EJ) of power generation potential within the central and southern parts of the basin. The low permeability lithotypes may be operated as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), depending on the fracture porosity in the deeper subsurface. In some areas auto-convective thermal water circulation might be expected and direct heat use becomes reasonable...|$|E
40|$|A {{recently}} discovered natural mould of a complete, almost undistorted, skull and lower jaw of a dicynodont (c. 237 mmoverall length), in {{a block of}} Upper <b>Permian</b> <b>sandstone</b> (= Dicynodon Assemblage Zone: Hopeman Sandstone Formation) from Clashach Quarry, Hopeman, Morayshire, is described using novel techniques, including Computed Tomography scanning (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and rapid-prototype modelling. It is assigned to the taxon Dicynodon traquairi (Newton, 1893). When compared with Dicynodon lacerticeps Owen, 1845, it is distinguished principally by having the pineal opening sunk deeply between the diverging parietals, subparallel pterygoid rami narrowly separated, with no transverse flanges, and in addition, a deeply grooved lower jaw symphysis. The southern African fauna lived on river flats in a higher (southern) palaeolatitude than the possibly desert-dwelling Scottish species.
