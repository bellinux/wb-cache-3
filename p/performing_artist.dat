40|$|While large {{performance}} spaces fulfill important cultural, civic, architectural {{and artistic}} needs, few <b>performing</b> <b>artists</b> begin their careers playing in large halls. As in professional sports, the “minor leagues” {{play a critical}} role for professional <b>performing</b> <b>artists</b> by allowing them to both reach out to new audiences and hone their performance skills. Niche and emerging <b>performing</b> <b>artists,</b> therefore, rely on small performance spaces as their principal means exercising their craft. In addition to size, one important difference between large and small performance spaces is the criticality of the social experience. Small performance spaces are often informal, with entertainment being secondary to social functions - {{as in the case of}} the neighborhood coffee house, bar or restaurant that offers periodic performances in addition to their standard fare. The hybridization of social and performance functions offers a “ready-made” audience for niche and emerging <b>performing</b> <b>artists,</b> engendering the new and random audience-performer connections that are so critical to nurturing <b>performing</b> <b>artists</b> and the <b>performing</b> arts in general. The disparate social and attentive programmatic functions of these hybrid spaces offer a challenge to architects and designers. Providing a hybrid social/performance space that is optimized for niche and emerging <b>performing</b> <b>artists</b> is the central design problem that this thesis seeks to address...|$|R

40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence that self-defeating behaviors appear regularly among populations considered psychologically stable. While {{there has been}} abundant research on self-esteem, self-efficacy, personality traits, and fear of success as independent constructs, little is known regarding the combined effect of these constructs on the self-defeating behaviors of <b>performing</b> <b>artists.</b> Examining self-defeating behaviors among <b>performing</b> <b>artists</b> is significant because this population is susceptible to self-sabotaging behaviors, underscoring the need to understand their behaviors. The purpose of this quantitative correlational {{study was to examine}} whether self-esteem, self-efficacy, personality, and fear of success predicted self-defeating behaviors among <b>performing</b> <b>artists.</b> Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s self-efficacy theory and the Baumeister self-esteem theory were used as the theoretical foundations for the study. A cross-sectional self-administered survey was used to collect data about how self-esteem, self-efficacy, personality, and fear of success affected the self-defeating behavior of <b>performing</b> <b>artists</b> from a convenience sample of 100 <b>performing</b> <b>artists</b> in New York City. The following assessment tools were used: Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale, Big Five Inventory, Fear of Success Scale, and the Lay Procrastination Scale. Results indicated a significant relationship between the self-efficacy, self-esteem, personality, and fear of success on self-defeating behavior in performance artists. The implications for positive social change include the potential to help current and future <b>performing</b> <b>artists</b> recognize and manage their self-defeating behaviors, thus preventing disengagement at work, depression, and frustration...|$|R

40|$|Performing Arts Medicine has {{developed}} into a highly specialised field {{over the past three}} decades. The Performing Arts Medical Association (PAMA) has been the leading proponent of this unique and innovative field with ground-breaking research studies, symposia, conferences and journals dedicated specifically to the medical problems of <b>performing</b> <b>artists.</b> Similar to sports medicine, performing arts medicine caters specifically for the medical problems of <b>performing</b> <b>artists</b> including musicians and dancers.

Accordingly {{the purpose of this paper}} is to present an overview of the field of performing arts medicine, highlight some of the significant findings from recent research studies and present a model for conducting research into the field of performing arts medicine.

In his youth, concert artists relied primarily on recitals to establish themselves and attract critical attention and acclaim; by the time of Szigeti’s writings, the recital had been eclipsed in importance by the competition.

I'm a <b>performing</b> <b>artist</b> - recording is secondary to me. My performances are what drive me. It's like my therapy.

500|$|Dylan biographer Howard Sounes {{described}} [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] as a [...] "grim masterpiece." [...] The only accompaniment is Dylan's guitar, playing folk-blues riffs and up {{and down}} chord progressions. Author Sean Wilentz has noted that the song's chord structure is similar to that used by the Everly Brothers' in their hit recording of [...] "Wake Up Little Susie". The lyrics of [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] express Dylan's anger at what he sees as the hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, and war mentality inherent in contemporary American culture, but unlike those in his earlier protest songs, do not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions. In his book Bob Dylan, <b>Performing</b> <b>Artist,</b> author Paul Williams has suggested that the song addresses [...] "the possibility that the most important (and least articulated) political issue of our times is that we are all being fed a false picture of reality, and it's coming at us from every direction." [...] Williams {{goes on to say that}} the song successfully paints a portrait of an [...] "alienated individual identifying the characteristics of the world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its 'rules'." [...] As such, a major target in the song is the old, established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted.|$|E
