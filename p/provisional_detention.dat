25|$|Inzunza Inzunza, {{also known}} by his aliases of El Macho Prieto, El MP, El Once, Gonzalo Inzunza Araujo, and/or Bernabé León Andrade, {{was placed on}} the most-wanted drug traffickers list under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act by the U.S. {{government}} on 1 June 2011, along with Manuel Torres Félix, another high-ranking lieutenant of the Sinaloa Cartel. This act prohibited U.S. citizens from doing any kind of business deal with the drug lord and froze its assets. The Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) offered up to $3 million Mexican pesos ($USD 230,000) for information leading to their arrests. Inzunza Inzunza was among Mexico's 122 most-wanted criminals, according to the list provided by the PGR database. He had three arrests warrants in Mexico and a <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> request with extradition purposes from the U.S. government for pending drug trafficking charges.|$|E

40|$|Part I of {{this article}} will {{describe}} the historical evolution of U. S. extradition law as a field parallel to, but separate from, domestic criminal procedure. Part II {{of this article}} describes the Parretti case and the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding that the federal extradition statutory scheme of Title 18, United States Code, Section 3184, violates the Fourth Amendment {{to the extent that it}} authorizes the issuance of a provisional arrest warrant by a court without a prior evidentiary showing of probable cause to believe that the fugitive committed the crime charged abroad. Part III explores some of the implications and effects of Parretti and the other recent cases questioning the constitutionality of <b>provisional</b> arrests and <b>detentions,</b> including the ways in which these decisions have already made the extradition process more difficult for the government. Finally, Part IV of the article shows that those courts that have questioned the constitutionality of provisional arrest warrants and the presumption against bail have relied on several critical assumptions in arriving at their decisions...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the widely ignored but important issue regarding the <b>provisional</b> arrest and <b>detention</b> of persons suspected of having committed international crimes by international or internationalized courts. The paper examines the pioneer case law and practice of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, {{as well as the}} emerging practice of the permanent International Criminal Court, to evaluate how these courts have generally addressed the rights of these individuals to due process and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention before prosecutors seek formal charges against them. The authors argue that while the early international jurisprudence established apparently strong legal standards to preserve the rights of suspects, using doctrines such as abuse of process, these courts have generally failed to offer the meaningful remedies required to resolve manifest violations of such fundamental human rights by the detaining authorities. The article offers preliminary recommendations on how, going forward, the rights guaranteed to suspects allegedly involved in the worst crimes known to law in international(ized) courts may be better protected...|$|R
5000|$|Remand or pre-trial {{detention}} or <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> {{is the process}} of keeping a person who has been arrested in custody before conviction. Those charged with serious crimes may be held in a remand prison until trial or sentencing. Varying terminology is used, but [...] "remand" [...] is generally used in common law jurisdictions. Continued detention after conviction is referred to as imprisonment.|$|E
50|$|On 31 July 2007, Duch was {{formally}} charged with war crimes and {{crimes against humanity}} and detained by Cambodia's United Nations-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. Duch, represented by Cambodian lawyer Kar Savuth and French lawyer François Roux, appealed against his <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia based on the more than eight years he spent without trial in Cambodian military detention. The appeal was unsuccessful and on 14 August 2008, the tribunal issued its indictment after completing their investigation of Duch.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 February 2017, Vienna Regional Court {{dismissed}} the Vienna prosecutor's application to impose <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> pending surrender regarding the US-extradition case. The question where Firtash {{has to be}} extradited - to Spain or the United States - is in {{the jurisdiction of the}} Minister of Justice of Austria Wolfgang Brandstetter. In accordance with § 34 of the Agreement on Extradition between Austria and the US, in the absence of objections from the court, the last word is for the Minister of Justice. [...] "The minister shall take into account the interests and international obligations of the Republic of Austria".|$|E
50|$|In November 1994, when he {{appeared}} to give a press conference at the University of Aix-en-Provence on the Vasarely affair, the police arrived and attempted to challenge Debbasch's attempt to avail himself of a Letter rogatory. Alleging {{that the police had}} attempted to enter his vehicle by force without a permit, he ensconced himself in his faculty office under the guard of a group of students devoted to his cause. The judge La Gallo granted a summons on 27 November 1994. He was arrested on 28 November 1994 and detained at Baumettes Prison, where he continued to be imprisoned in <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> until 15 February.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, Soria's widow deposed a {{complaint}} to the Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón. On 4 May 2001, Garzón ordered the <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> of former Chilean Minister of Defence Hernán Julio Brady Roche (1975-1978) {{on charges of}} genocide, terrorism and torture in relation to Soria's assassination, and requested his extradition. Brady subsequently denied any knowledge concerning Soria's murder. However, the Audiencia Nacional (high court) archived the case on 31 May 2001, arguing that the Spanish justice was not entitled to pursue the Soria case, despite the universal jurisdiction principle, as it had refused a short time before to pursue Arnaldo Otegi (leader of Batasuna) for an alleged act of [...] "apology of terrorism" [...] committed in France.|$|E
50|$|For the {{tribunal}} {{to sit with}} one judge only, à juge unique, the possible penalty must be {{less than five years}} imprisonment and the matter must concern délits specified by the Code de procédure pénale as traffic offenses (driving while intoxicated for example), or violence resulting in more than eight days of inability to work (incapacité Totale de travail (I.T.T.)) with only one aggravating circumstance. These cases are provided by Article 398-1 of the Code de procédure pénale. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same article outline some exceptions having to do with <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> and procedure for immediate appearance. In cases of the wrong judge (? -t) article 398-2 provides for a return to the collegial formation because the jurisdictional rules are d'ordre public. Usually, it is the président de la formation collégiale who rules à juge unique.|$|E

5000|$|Emgann clams that it {{does not}} approve of the violent actions of the ARB, but it doesn't {{disapprove}} either, treating them instead as [...] "a logical consequence of the colonialist French state and the desperation of young Bretons." [...] However, several members of Emgann were arrested and convicted by French courts as accomplices in the theft of several tonnes of explosives from a Breton company in Plévin (Côtes-d'Armor) in 1999. This theft was followed by a series of bombings attributed to the ARB, including a fatal explosion at a McDonald's in Quévert (Côtes-d'Armor). Ultimately, a former spokesman for Emgann was cleared of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts for the bombings in Quévert and elsewhere. However, since many of the accused were held in <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> for several years before their trials, many were released, having been imprisoned for longer than the time they were sentenced to before their trials even started. One has appealed his conviction to the European Court of Human Rights. These lengthy delays and other claimed irregularities in the trial have led to their condemnation by Emgann as a [...] "travesty".|$|E
40|$|International Criminal Courts and Tribunals (ICTs) {{are often}} portrayed as welcome enforcers of {{international}} human rights law: bringing individuals most responsible for gross human rights violations to account for their crimes. At the same time, however, ICTs must be recognized as potential violators of such norms. In their exercise of public power, ICTs exercise coercive powers over individuals, thereby potentially infringing upon their human rights. One {{of the most prominent}} examples in this regard is the right to liberty. Persons standing trial before the ICTs are often detained from arrest until the final judgement is rendered; while the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights requires that ‘it shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody’. This contribution will address the approach of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> and release. First, the law and practice of the Tribunals with regard to provisional release will be set out. Subsequently, their approach will be evaluated from the perspective of {{international human rights}} law. As will be seen, these tribunals still by and large operate with a presumption of <b>provisional</b> <b>detention,</b> which raises the question whether their approach to this issue is in line with international human rights law...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{compatibility}} of UAE law on arrest and <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> with Article 14 ArCHR. Given {{the lack of}} any report by the UAE on the measures which they have taken to give effect to the rights recognised in the ArCHR and the absence of effective institutions under the ArCHR to provide authoritative interpretation of the Charter’s Articles, this thesis advances an interpretation of Article 14, drawing on the interpretation of Article 9 ICCPR under the HRC and Article 5 ECHR under ECtHR. In the case of the ICCPR, this is because the wording is similar and it is a universal instrument to which some parties to the Arab Charter are also parties. In the case of the ECHR, it is because the words are similar and the Strasbourg Court has considered aspects of the interpretation and application of those provisions in a number of contexts. This considered interpretation will be of assistance to decision makers in the UAE and other parties to the ArCHR. This thesis’ key finding is that, while UAE law on arrest and <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> is compliant with Article 14 ArCHR or, arguably, so in many respects, there are other incompatible aspects. In particular, the Public Prosecutor, rather than a court deciding some key matters means that UAE law fails to comply with the right to be brought promptly before a judge or other judicial officer and the right to have the lawfulness of the arrest or detention decided quickly by a court. Accordingly, it recommends that the UAE achieves compliance by requiring that the above-mentioned procedures are best undertaken by a court. This is guided by the UK system because {{of the ways in which}} it complies with the requirements of the ECHR provides lessons for the UAE’s implementation of Article 14 ArCHR.

40|$|Council Framework Decision on the application, between Member States of the European Union, of the {{principle}} of mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures as an alternative to <b>provisional</b> <b>detention</b> improves police and judicial cooperation in the European Union. This legal instrument introduce a possibility of transferring a non-custodial supervision measure from the Member State where the non resident is suspected of having committed an offence to the Member State where this person has his residence. The European Supervision Order (ESO) allows the suspect to be a subject of a supervision measure in his regularly environment until the trial takes place in the foreign Member State. ESO has many positive consequences for suspect and Member States, such as: maintaining family and job ties, preserving psychological and physical integrity of person, attendance at trial is guaranteed, reducing costs of pre-trial detention for Member States, solving the problems of prison over-crowding and bad conditions of detention...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{steps in}} the {{procedure}} before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) is the filing of a closing order in relation to one or several suspects. In case 002, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary, Ieng Thirith and Khieu Samphan all filed motions of appeal against several aspects of the closing order delivered on 16 September 2010, by which the Co-Investigating Judges ordered their indictment. This commentary attempts to {{shed some light on}} three decisions issued by the Pre-Trial Chamber on these appeals. Two procedural matters discussed in the decisions are first outlined, namely the right to appeal against a closing order and the latter’s impact on the regime of <b>provisional</b> <b>detention.</b> The analysis then turns to the core substantive contribution of the decisions, that is, the adjudication of the various jurisdictional challenges {{on the basis of the}} nullum crimen principle. In the end, it is submitted that, on the whole, the judges showed strict adherence to the principle of legality, thereby strengthening the ECCC’s legitimacy in the realm of global criminal justice.

40|$|Depriving {{a person}} of his/her freedom for trial {{purposes}} {{for a longer period}} of time represents an issue that, in all legislations, is considered very carefully, the provisions issued reflecting to a large extent the position of the law regarding the real and effective guarantee of the individual freedom. The absolute character of the initial duration of 30 days for the preventive arrest can only be cancelled by the use of a procedure, which is recognised by the Consittution, to continue depriving {{a person of}} his/her freedom. Considering that the constituent lawmaker regulates differently the duration of the preventive arrest for the two phases of the criminal trial, the same dual modality of regulation also applies in the case of the juridical tools based on which one maintains the temporary deprivation of freedom. Through this article, I propose an analysis of the juridical tools used, during the trial, in order to extend the <b>provisional</b> <b>detention.</b> This implies both the approach of the trial moments of maintaining the preventive arrest and the analysis of how the national legislation complies with the guarantees established at European level in order to avoid the arbitrary in terms of deprivation of freedo...|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} the author {{discusses}} {{the scope of}} the right to defence before the International Criminal Court, the first permanent criminal court with an international and universal jurisdiction, created to prosecute the most grevious crimes, including crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. When defining terms such as suspect and defendant, the author points to the differences in understanding their positions in trial. He lists and discusses the rights vested in the defendant in the course of proceedings and also presents {{the ways in which the}} ICC has developed the principles of a fair trial. Then, he reflects on the right to an attorney, the right to the assistance of a translator, principles of using <b>provisional</b> <b>detention,</b> rules of conduct when approving charges in preparatory proceedings, the defendant’s rights in judicial proceedings. He also discusses the right to free expression, the right to remain silent, the right to appeal against the sentence or other decisions taken in court. Having analysed the range of the defendant’s rights, the author arrives at the conclusion that they meet requirements of a fair trial in criminal proceedings. At the same time, he emphasises that such model of conduct is a combination of two different systems of law: common law and civil law. The practical exercise of the right to defence depends to a great extent on the way in which the Tribunal interprets and implements those institutions in its judicial decisions. This, on the one hand, gives a chance for better realisation of fair trial postulates, on the other hand however, it may pose a threat to such a trial...|$|E
