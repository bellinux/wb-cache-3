Carey {{tells how}} little naked boys, free Americans, work for Mr. Borden, the New York millionaire, <b>packing</b> <b>cloth</b> into {{bleaching}} vats, in a bath of chemicals that bleaches their little bodies like {{the bodies of}} lepers....|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} coal mining, there were 8,000 sheep and 800 black cattle on the hills, and plans were afoot for the {{spinning}} and weaving of wool. These plans resulted in two woollen mills which flourished {{for a time}} in the following century. The two mills employed about 30 people between them. The yarn from the largest was disposed of wholly to the Kilmarnock carpet manufacturers until the proprietor of the mill added a carpet manufactory with eight looms constantly at work. The yarn spun in the second mill was also manufactured on the spot, into blankets, into plaid, <b>packing</b> <b>cloth,</b> etc.|$|E
25|$|In North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity {{is often}} <b>packed,</b> perhaps with <b>cloth,</b> {{in an attempt}} to protect the healing wound. However, {{evidence}} from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, bring more rapid healing, or lead to fewer physician visits.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in relation to the stranding of a Hanseatic ship at Skagen on 31 March 1387. The first day 861 pieces of cloth were salvaged and brought to the nearest church. The next day the priest, Mr. Bernhard, brought another seven packages of cloth to the Sand-Covered Church. Queen Margaret I of Denmark received 400 pieces of cloth, and in 1394 ended up paying 320 nobles in restitution even though the merchants valued the cloth at 2,750 nobles. The priest kept the seven <b>packs</b> of <b>cloth</b> but swore “by his dignity as a priest to report to the king and queen how many lengths they contained”.|$|R

50|$|The {{need for}} food {{preservation}} {{in the new}} colony was pressing. Building up herds of livestock took a long time, but with game in abundance in South Africa, traditional methods were called upon to preserve the meat of large African animals such as the eland in a warm climate. Iceboxes and refrigerators had not been invented yet. Biltong {{as it is today}} evolved from the dried meat carried by the wagon-travelling Voortrekkers, who needed stocks of durable food as they migrated from the Cape Colony north and north-eastward (away from British rule) into the interior of Southern Africa during the Great Trek. The meat was preserved and hung to be dried for a fortnight during the colder winter, with the cold temperatures aiding to further inhibit bacterial and fungal growth. After suitably dried, the biltong was ready for <b>packing</b> in <b>cloth</b> bags, which allow air circulation to prevent mould.|$|R
50|$|Lighvan (لیقوان) is a brined curd cheese {{traditionally}} made in Iran. Having a sour flavor, and a shape {{covered by}} holes, the cheese is produced from sheep’s milk. The {{name comes from}} Liqvan, a village in East Azerbaijan, where it has traditionally been made. The milk is coagulated with rennet tablets, then the curd is <b>packed</b> into triangular <b>cloth</b> bags and is allowed to drain thoroughly. The triangular blocks of cheese, which are about 20 cm thick, are removed from the bag and put in an earthenware pot. Then they are covered with salt, and are left for two days. The cheese is usually served for breakfast or dinner with fresh bread.|$|R
40|$|Moist/wet {{materials}} stored after autoclaving {{are considered}} contaminated and {{not recommended for}} use. This study evaluates the maintenance of sterility in moist/wet material after being submitted to steam sterilization and stored {{for a period of}} 30 days. Aiming to support decision-making in emergency situations, 40 surgical boxes <b>packed</b> in nonwoven <b>cloth</b> covering Spunbound, Metblouwn, Spunbound (SMS) : half (the experimental group) were placed in an autoclave but the drying phase was interrupted, yielding moist/wet materials and the other half (the negative control group) underwent the complete cycle. The external parts of each surgical box were deliberately contaminated with Serratia marcescens and subsequently stored for 30 days. After this period, the boxes&# 39; contents were submitted to sterility tests and no growth was observed. The presence of moisture inside the surgical boxes did not interfere with maintaining their sterility...|$|R
2500|$|After 15 {{years of}} {{appearing}} in films, Williams was threatened with contract suspension from MGM after refusing {{the lead role}} in The Opposite Sex (eventually released in 1956), a musical remake of 1939's The Women. The role of Mary would have been rewritten to be an aquacade star (and was eventually filled by June Allyson as [...] "Kay", a nightclub singer). Williams redecorated her dressing room to accommodate returning star Grace Kelly, <b>packed</b> her terry <b>cloth</b> robes and swimsuits and drove off the studio lot. As a result of leaving her contract, Williams lost almost $3 million in deferred contract payments, which {{had been taken from}} her paychecks over the previous 14 years and put aside as both a nest egg and a tax deferral. She was, however, still able to collect on the $50,000 signing bonus from when she first signed her contract.|$|R
6000|$|... "We smelt it, of course. We {{break the}} lumps of ore into smallish bits and spread them on charcoal, layer and layer about, in a hollow in the ground. This is covered {{over with a}} {{top-dressing}} of stone and clay. Then we set it on fire and keep the blast going with wooden bellows, till the metal is melted and runs in a mass {{to the bottom of}} the hole. This we break into smaller pieces, purify them with more fire, and run them into bars convenient for use. Our bellows," [...] continued the guide, [...] "are not like yours, with two boards and leather between. The rats would soon make short work with these. They are two cylinders formed from the trunk of a tree, with a piston in each, <b>packed</b> with coarse <b>cloth,</b> and having valves. An old musket-barrel carries the air to the furnace, and, by pumping them time about, the blow is kept going continuously." ...|$|R
5000|$|Melec {{was judged}} as the chief rebel to be punished in a {{rebellion}} instigated {{by one of the}} emperor's sons, Mulay Muhammad. In particular, according to Busnot, the empress was incensed that Melec had personally beheaded one of her cousins, Ali Bouchasra. In September/October 1705, Mulay Ismail sent for his chief carpenter, and asked if his saws were capable of sawing a man in two. The carpenter answered [...] "Sure enough". He was then given the grisly task, and before he left, he asked him whether Melec should be sawn across or along the length. The emperor said the sawing should proceed lengthwise, from the head downwards. He told, however, Boachasra's sons, they should follow the carpenter and decide for themselves how best to take revenge upon the murderer (i.e., Melec) of their father. Taking with him 8 of the public executioner's assistants, the master carpenter went to the prison where Melec was held, two of his brand new saws <b>packed</b> in <b>cloth,</b> in order to keep from Melec information of the intended manner of execution. Melec was now placed on a mule, bound with an iron chain, and led to the public square, where some 4000 of his relatives and members of his tribe were assembled. These made a [...] "terrifying" [...] spectacle through screaming, and clawing their faces in a public display of grief. Melec, on the other hand, seemed unperturbed, calmly smoking from his tobacco pipe. When taken down from the mule, Melec's clothes were removed, damning letters [...] "proving" [...] his treason was cast in the fire.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the efficacy of cotton fabric, made of serge bonding 2 x 1, as microbial barrier, when new and after multiple laundering and steam sterilization procedures. The power of the microbial barrier was correlated with physical characteristics of the fabric, using standard test methods for evaluation of weight, traction, stretching tearing resistance and microbiological characteristics. The microbiological results evidenced that the microbial barrier was effective when the wrapping material was new or went through a maximum of new 65 reprocessing procedures. As for the alterations in the physical characteristics of the reprocessed material, the decrease in weight seemed to be the event responsible for microbial barrier breaking. The timing of detected alterations in bursting, traction and stretching in the wrap and the reprocessed fabrics did not coincide with the moment of bacterial barrier breaking. The present investigation corroborates that the use double cotton fabric, for wrapping medical and hospital items for steam sterilization, is safe. Re-use number must be controlled, not exceeding 65 times. Key words: microbiological barrier, <b>cloth</b> <b>packing,</b> reprocessing, reusable medical article...|$|R
