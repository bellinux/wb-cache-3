5|$|Forensic {{examination}} of any trace evidence {{is based upon}} Locard's exchange principle. This states that every contact leaves a trace. In practice, even though a transfer of material has taken <b>place,</b> <b>it</b> may be impossible to detect, because the amount transferred is very small.|$|E
5|$|In {{its opening}} week in Australia, the film grossed $3.155 million in Australian dollars, topping {{the box office}} and pushing Guardians of the Galaxy into second <b>place.</b> <b>It</b> fell to second place in its second week, with Guardians of the Galaxy {{returning}} to top spot.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Borneo shark are uncertain. Jack Garrick, in his 1982 morphological study, did not <b>place</b> <b>it</b> close {{to any other}} member of the genus. Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped it with the smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), hardnose shark (C. macloti), and Pondicherry shark (C. hemiodon). The Borneo shark resembles the sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon) in certain traits, for example the enlarged pores by its mouth. Nevertheless, other aspects of its morphology firmly <b>place</b> <b>it</b> within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{location}} of the battle is disputed, and depends on which group of sources is preferred: it is only Icelandic sources that <b>place</b> <b>it</b> near a place called Svolder, while Adam of Bremen places it in Øresund.|$|E

50|$|In some classifications, the {{subfamily}} Macroramphosinae {{is raised}} {{to the level of}} family, Macroramphosidae. The placement of the genus Centriscops is unclear: ITIS <b>places</b> <b>it</b> in Macroramphosinae but FishBase <b>places</b> <b>it</b> in Centriscinae.|$|R
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{date for}} the feast of St Cynfarwy varies between antiquarian sources, although all <b>place</b> <b>it</b> in November. Some manuscripts say that it falls on the 10th, some on the 11th, whilst according to Angharad Llwyd and others the festival is marked on the 7th.|$|E
5|$|There is a Georgia {{historical}} marker in Kingston, Georgia, in Bartow County at {{the intersection}} of West Main Street and Church Street to denote where this surrender took <b>place.</b> <b>It</b> further explains that the Confederate soldiers were given rations after their release.|$|E
5|$|A further terrace to {{the south}} of the Masonic Hall is split from the hall by St George's <b>Place.</b> <b>It</b> is formed of numbers 21 to 23 The Crescent, and number 42 Upper High Street. The terrace forms two listed {{building}} designations, both Grade II. Numbers 21 and 22 The Crescent are two-storey roughcast houses, each spanning three windows. The doorways are round-headed, and are flanked by ground floor bay windows. Number 23 forms the back of 42 Upper High Street, and is a two-storey red brick building.|$|E
50|$|Holtz {{classified}} Bagaraatan as a basal tyrannosauroid, Coria identified it as a troodontid, and Rauhut <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> in Maniraptora. Mark Loewen et al. <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> in basal tyrannosauroidea, {{agreeing with}} the placement by Holtz.|$|R
5|$|Several {{publications}} rated Rounds {{as one of}} {{the best}} albums of the decade, with Pitchfork <b>placing</b> <b>it</b> at number 123 on their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s.

5000|$|Prewrath is also {{distinguished}} from other premillennial rapture positions as to when, {{in relation to}} Daniel’s 70th Week, the Second Coming and rapture take place. Pretrib places the rapture before the 70th Week. Midtrib <b>places</b> <b>it</b> at middle of the 70th Week. Posttrib <b>places</b> <b>it</b> {{at the end of}} the 70th Week. Prewrath <b>places</b> <b>it</b> at an unspecified time after the midpoint of the 70th Week, but before the end.|$|R
5|$|A prohibiting order {{operates}} {{to prevent}} illegal action {{by a public}} authority from occurring in the first <b>place.</b> <b>It</b> may be granted by the High Court {{in cases where the}} applicant is aware that the authority is about to take an unlawful course of action, or to prevent the authority from repeating an unlawful act. Like a quashing order, a prohibiting order is used to help maintain good standards of public administration.|$|E
5|$|A. tendagurensis {{was named}} in 1925 by Werner Janensch for a partial shin (MB.R.3620) {{found in the}} Kimmeridgian-age Tendaguru Formation in Mtwara, Tanzania. Although {{tabulated}} as a tentatively valid species of Allosaurus in the second edition of the Dinosauria, subsequent studies <b>place</b> <b>it</b> as indeterminate beyond Tetanurae, either a carcharodontosaurian or megalosaurid. Although obscure, {{it was a large}} theropod, possibly around 10meters long (33ft) and 2.5metric tons (2.8short tons) in weight.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae are confused. Several cladistic {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly <b>place</b> <b>it</b> in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E

5|$|Before his death, Henry {{instructed}} the coachman to gather his remaining body parts in a cloth tied with blue string, <b>place</b> <b>it</b> in a cart drawn by a stallion. When the stallion broke, {{he was to}} replace it with an ox, and when the ox stopped, he was to build a church. This is where Henrik’s remains were to be buried.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as pests, and there are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes <b>place.</b> <b>It</b> is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} sporangia of Hsua robusta <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> in {{the traditional}} family Cooksoniaceae (order Rhyniales). Kenrick and Crane, based on a cladistic analysis, <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> in its own family, Hsuaceae, in the order Sawdoniales, based on spore characteristics.|$|R
5|$|Dru Drury, who {{described}} the moth in 1773, <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> in the genus Papilio, considering it a butterfly. Jacob Hübner <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> in the moth genus Chrysiridia in 1823. Later redescriptions led to junior synonyms such as Chrysiridia madagascariensis (Lesson, 1831).|$|R

5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would <b>place</b> <b>it</b> among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|General Bell {{had been}} the manager {{of one of the}} coal mines in Cripple Creek where the strike was taking <b>place.</b> <b>It</b> wasn't any {{surprise}} to Haywood that soldiers seemed to be working {{in the interests of the}} employers; he had seen that situation before. But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} John Coles {{from the}} University of Cambridge began {{a research project}} {{that resulted in the}} publication of an important series of papers on many aspects of the Levels. A range of archaeological projects, such as the exploration of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia BC and the establishment of their economic and geographic significance, was funded by various donors including English Heritage. Possibly the project's most significant excavation was of the Sweet Track in 1970, during which a Jadeite axe was discovered. Eight radiocarbon determinations of the date of the axe <b>place</b> <b>it</b> at around 3200 BC.|$|E
