Based on this, it is necessary to use a reasonable transportation method to effectively guide the logistics transport vehicles. In the information age, the transportation of <b>port</b> <b>area</b> mostly uses automatic transport vehicles as the main transport vehicles. Therefore, this study takes the automatic transport vehicles as an example to conduct transport route guidance research.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, empty {{container}} {{movements in}} the Los Angeles and Long Beach (LA/LB) <b>port</b> <b>area</b> are studied {{in an effort to}} reduce congestion by optimizing the empty container reuse. The dynamic empty container reuse is modeled analytically, and techniques are developed to optimize empty container operations. Several case studies based on current and projected demand in the LA/LB <b>port</b> <b>area</b> are used to evaluate the proposed techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that significant cost and congestion reductions can be achieved in the area, through reuse of empty containers.
