Precise {{cable drive}} has been {{developed}} as an alternative transmission element to gearbox, belt and <b>pulleys,</b> <b>chains</b> and sprocket in Electro-Optical Tracking system. Precise cable drive has several significant advantages including backlash free, high stiffness, high efficiency, no lubrication etc. This paper develops analytical methods to predict the transverse oscillation frequency of precise cable drive to enable designers to better assess dynamic performance in the design study phase. Theoretical formulation of transverse oscillation equation for precise cable drive is carried out based on Hamilton’s principle taking into account flexural rigidity of cable. Furthermore, the transverse oscillation frequency is obtained from the transverse oscillation equation assuming small and linear vibration. Parametric studies are conducted to evaluate {{the relationship between the}} oscillation properties and cable drive parameters...|$|R

The dynamics of the contact between a rocker pin and a pulley lead to a mechanical system with topology variations due to stick slip phenomena and contact changes. Therefore, the dynamic equations of the system also have a variant structure. This leads to a description of the dynamics with complementary inequality conditions.

50|$|The {{transmission}} ratio of an iCVT {{has to be}} changed one increment within less than one full rotation of its variator pulley. This means that the transmission diameter of the variator pulley, made generally from rubber, has to be changed from a diameter that has a circumferential length that is equal to an integer number of teeth to another diameter that has a circumferential length that is equal to an integer number of teeth; such as changing the transmission diameter of the variator pulley from a diameter that has a circumferential length of 7 teeth to a diameter that has a circumferential length of 8 teeth for example. This is because if the transmission diameter of the variator pulley {{does not have a}} circumferential length that is equal to an integer number of teeth, such as a circumferential length of 7½ teeth for example, improper engagement between the teeth of the variator <b>pulley</b> and its <b>chain</b> will occur. For example, imagine having a bicycle pulley with 7½ teeth; here improper engagement between the bicycle <b>pulley</b> and its <b>chain</b> will occur when the tooth behind the ½ tooth space is about to engage with its chain, since it is positioned a distance of ½ tooth too late relative to its chain.|$|R

A curving conical <b>pulley</b> with a <b>chain</b> wrapped around it attached to the mainspring barrel, it changed the leverage as the spring unwound, equalizing the drive force. Fusees became standard in all watches, and were used until the early 19th century.

The other side lowers in response. If a pulley is shaking and a bubble is attached, the resulting heavier side will lower. This requires added strategy to prevent one side moving too far and therefore losing the game. One possible strategy is to form a bubble cluster between two pulleys to prevent them from lowering or rising at all. Then the player can triangulate until acquiring the necessary bubbles to clear both anchor bubbles, while still keeping both ends of the pulley clustered together.|$|R

The effect of height of fall (HF), DI, and number of diffuser sieves on the RD of the sand sample is studied for both the PTP and MTP pluviation setups. A model tank is used to verify the uniformity of the sand samples with the help of miniature cone-penetrations tests.

50|$|Steel {{reinforced}} v-belts {{are sufficient}} for low-mass low-torque applications like utility vehicles and snowmobiles but higher mass and torque {{applications such as}} automobiles require a chain. Each element of the chain must have conical sides that fit the pulley when the belt is running on the outermost radius. As the chain moves into the pulleys the contact area gets smaller. As the contact area {{is proportional to the}} number of elements, chain belts require lots of very small elements. The shape of the elements is governed by the static of a column. The pulley-radial thickness of the belt is a compromise between maximum gear ratio and torque. For the same reason the axis between the pulleys is as thin as possible. In a chain-based CVT a film of lubricant is applied to the pulleys. It needs to be thick enough so that the <b>pulley</b> and the <b>chain</b> never touch and it must be thin in order not to waste power when each element dives into the lubrication film. Additionally, the chain elements stabilize about 12 steel bands. Each band is thin enough so that it bends easily. If bending, it has a perfect conical surface on its side. In the stack of bands each band corresponds to a slightly different gear ratio, and thus they slide over each other and need oil between them. Also the outer bands slide through the stabilizing chain, while the center band can be used as the chain linkage.|$|R
50|$|Regarding the {{previous}} paragraph, {{the chain of}} an iCVT forms an open loop on its variator pulley that partially covers its variator pulley such that an open section, which is {{not covered by the}} chain, exist. This is similar to a sprocket of a bicycle where there is a section of the sprocket that is covered by its chain, and a section of the sprocket that is not covered by its chain. During one complete rotation, the toothed section of the variator pulley of an iCVT passes by the open section and re-engages with the chain. Here if the transmission diameter of the variator pulley does not represent an integer number of teeth, improper re-engagement between the teeth of the variator <b>pulley</b> and its <b>chain</b> will occur. Also, the transmission diameter of the variator pulley cannot be changed while the toothed section of the variator pulley is covering the entire open section of its chain loop. Since this is similar to where a plate is glued across the open section of a chain loop, which does not allow expansion or contraction of the chain loop as required for transmission diameter change of the variator pulley. Therefore, the transmission diameter of the variator pulley has to be changed one increment during an interval where the variator pulley rotates from an initial position where a portion of the toothed section of the variator pulley is positioned at the open section of the chain loop but not covering the entire open section, to the final position where the toothed section of the variator pulley passes by the open section of the chain loop and is about to re-engage with the chain. Since it takes less than one full rotation to rotate the variator pulley from its initial position to its final position mentioned in {{the previous}} sentence, the transmission diameter of the variator pulley has to be changed one increment within less than one full rotation.|$|R
50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle cut side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on <b>chain</b> <b>pulleys</b> are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|R
40|$|Recording & {{projecting}} architecture A {{project for}} the city of Rome The research empirically explores the semantic value of images and the potential of image-based communication in respect to new-media culture, computation and to the ongoing process of dematerialization, focusing on how these processes affect current interpretation of the City and imagining possible architectural propositions. Dematerialization is seen here as the current stage of what Martin Heidegger defines in his assay “The Age of the World Picture”, as the modern ambition to measure, quantify and digitalise the world, translating it into its image. The practise of imagining the world is intimately related to the invention of the notion of space as we know it, this word coming from the Greek “stadion”, which generally means “standard measure” and particularly indicates a metrical unit equivalent to 200 meters. The relevance of investigating processes of digitisation and dematerialization in relation to our understandings of the City lays on the one hand in the prominence and proliferation of images which together constitute the multeplical aesthetics of contemporary built environment and, on the other, in the related phenomena of codification, displacement and concealing the driving dynamics and fundamental processes affecting the physical space of the City, which appears unreadable. In the presentation I will consider the polysemous nature of the notion of image, extending its relevance beyond the domain of visuality and considering its similarities with the related notions of imprint, numerical image, record and projection. From a realist perspective, which implies believing the wold as being subsistent autonomously from human interpretation, an image can be defined more generally as any recordings of reality which implies a process of translation of a certain subject or data into its virtual version and corresponds to a degree of detachment from what is recorded. This distance from the subject allows images to be interpreted as an autonomous systems of signs. In the case of Rome`s periphery the interpretative potentials of translation processes and the distance between the City and its image is embodied in Pier Paolo Pasolini`s critical readings over the rhetorical ambition of social progress which guided post-war reconstruction program, expressed through his poetic representation of misery and disillusion in Roman suburbs. Pasolini`s movie trilogy on Rome contributes to construct the shared image of Rome`s periphery and ultimately its actual conditions, and it can be read in turn as part of the cultural context of the City. In that case, the virtual and potential evil and the moral corruption represented in the movies seams to have prevented its realisation. Beside Pasolini`s authorial position, this example shows the interpretative potential of translation processes between different languages, media, dimensions, domains and their effectiveness in manipulating (reverting when necessary) the meaning of the ontological, moral and social reference system underlying a given work. From these considerations, this research investigates the moment of translation between the physical space of Roman peripheries and the virtual space of its image, by means of three photographic devices used for recordings on field as well as conceptual and design instruments. They explore three modalities of imprinting photographic images while addressing different cultural aspects as well as historical stages, which are found to be present in contemporary culture and therefore relevant for interpreting urban conditions. Furthermore the recorders query the distinction between interpretation and automation in the production of contemporary images. The First device is a four pin-holes camera obscura imprinting one multiple image on five projection planes. The pin holes measure 0. 55 mm and the focal lenght is 150 mm on the central plane. It outputs one singular set of images, picturing space from four slightly diverging points of view. The optical alchemy of the camera obscura has been understood and noted by Aristotle in the IV century before Christ, and thousand years later it has been used by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti to establishing the mathematical rules of one point perspective. The Second device is a slow-rate dolly camera which shots a split picture pour 7. 5 meters. It expresses the logic of mechanical production of images, repetition and linear sequencing picturing urban space in four strips of images by means of two oblique mirrors. The Third device is the simulation of a cinematic walk-through an iconic apartment building in the Tuscolano_II peripheral district. The third recorder addresses the notion of non-linear editing and it is based on a combinatorial matrix that links representation techniques and degrees of privacy in the building. It is meant to be composed by 16 perspective scenographies representing space at different scales and by four webcams. It outputs a four-windows cinematic image which corresponds to as many navigation paths through the building, showing multiple footage of various interior spaces at the same time. It is inspired to certain works of combinatorial literature such as Cent Mille Milliards de Poèmes by Raymond Queneau or The Garden of forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges. Because of their specific modalities of imprinting the recorders challenge the structural correspondence between recording and recorded object allowing the interpretation of photographic imprint as autonomous flat spaces. The resulting images are seen as Imprint bearers collecting superimposed traces of various photographic imprint. This quality of the recordings {{has been used as a}} base for further speculations which aim to represent an inverse process of translation_that from the flat space of the image into architectural space, as being a third dimension in-between image and physical space. This drawing is obtained by extracting the different layers of traces collected on the recordings in a quasi-spatial dimension that shares its qualities with both bi-dimensional and tri-dimensional space. The drawing has been sampled and recombined to explore its formal characteristics which depend by different densities of intersecting, oblique paths composing an intricate field of lines. To summarise: This last phase of the research investigates the re-translation from image to physical space by envisioning a third dimension of becoming between the first two, which is represented through speculative drawing. The notion of imprint bearer has been further interpreted and translated into the architectural idea of a library which collects and expresses in space the image of written culture: a self-writing machine which records the translation of physical books into virtual and numerical images. The conditions of the ongoing process of dematerialization of physical culture lead to a profound redefinition of the programmatic aspects, the urban role and the spatial characteristics of a contemporary library. Specifically, the conventional organisation of a public library, with books repository and reading hall is ineffective in a scenario where immaterial information can be displaced and hosted somewhere else, still remaining individually accessible from every point of the network. This architecture project envisions the limit of the process of dematerialization of physical culture in the case of a blinds library: an set of apparata whose agency is that of evoking in blind readers the mental image of an infinite reading space. The blinds library of Rome is a soft structure which opens to multiple interpretations, absorbing and reflecting definitions. It is indeed a library for blinds, but it is even a maze-like sensuous garden or an architectural game-field for viewers, and it is globally recognised as an architectural attraction comparable to the London Eye. The blinds library is situated in Parco di Villa Borghese, next to Valle Giulia faculty of architecture and well connected to Piazza del Popolo and the Central Library of Rome. The park has been interpreted as a Campo (field) of intensities and programmatic islands, between which the library forms an open-air pavilion similar to a dense architectural garden, which blinds reach following a path of lavender and other aromatic plants unfolding in the wood. Other buildings in the parc house cinema, art and leisure related programs between which are The Globe Theatre and The Caffe dell`Arte. Blinds readers navigate the library by means of their innate sense of number, their enhanced kinesthetic cognition, touch and hearing. The architecture of the library borrows from Braille language its peculiar relations between number, sign and significant. The unstable field of knowledge constituting the library is organised and indexed in an hypertextual network of relations linking different topics and establishing their relations of proximity, contiguity and interconnection in space. Topics are expressed in keywords associated to three numbers: the first two indicates rows and columns scanning the ground floor, while the third number correspond to a singular cable in the field. Cables are numbered from 1 to 2013 and their trajectories are numerically controlled. The numbering of the cables and the directions of the galleries are crossed in such a way that the reader will encounter numbered cables arranged in non-consecutive couples (as they were pages of a book browsed randomly or non-linearly). This numerical displacement evokes in the blind reader the mental image of a space whose architecture remains mysterious, enigmatic, unintelligible and infinite. In the library, the sense of infinite and the experience of the hypertext which are normally grasped only through vision, are translated into spatial experience and conveyed through the association of spatial elements with displaced and non-consecutive numbers. Beside the universal sense of number, the library engages blind sensing through the instability of its architecture. Due to its peculiar distribution of forces and delicate balancing of weight, every intersection and branch of the mobile network slightly vibrate and swing at same for the atmospheric flows and for the movement of human bodies in space. Instability creates peculiar connections between readers introducing another form of sociality which looks beyond the rethorics of the Public Building and which is based upon mutual awareness and shared intents in the community of the library, translating in architectural space some virtual potential of network theories. Blind readers access information in lecterns disseminated within the field. Each of these lectern can host and display one or more interrelated topics by means of a reading-&-writing Braille desk and it is connected or clustered with other lecterns hosting related topics. These platform are individual reading spaces reinterpreting some of spatial characteristics of libraries before Gutenberg`s invention of typography and the establishment of Free Public Library as building type and programmatic institution. The evolution of the idea of public library can be described as a slow movement of emancipation of a bookshelf (armarium), normally grouped with a desk and a chair, into a institutionalised space programmed to host books and readers and which has become crucial for sharing, producing and preserving knowledge. Lecterns are quasi-hermetic spaces in between a piece of furniture and an intimate study-room which are structurally more stable then the mobile galleries and the staircases, finished in pine wood, black rubber and textiles. Furthermore, the reading-&-writing Braille desk allow blinds readers to interpret and contribute to the heritage of the library by proposing compilings, editings and original interrelations between texts belonging to different times, languages and subjects. The hypertextual association proposed by any reader is evaluated by the community of the library and, when accepted, it is translated in a new gallery connecting two sectors of the library and crossing many others along the path. The community of the library challenges the structural relation between author, librarian and readers by introducing the role of the plural librarian, a multeplical reader echoing the nature of the Urbe, that of embodying the general idea and the conceptual origin of urbanity while being a specific place, at same. Proposing their interpretation, blinds perpetrate the movement of self-writing and the becoming of architecture, shifting the urban role of the library from a dimension of contemplation, collection and preservation of physical books to that of interpreting and indexing the global text. The kinetics of the library is based on the incalculable possibilities of assembling two different kind of spatial elements: the lectern and the mobile unit which are shifted in the field by a system of <b>pulleys</b> and <b>chains.</b> Together they constitute the topography of the library and weave the pattern of cables with their movement. The mobile unite is a narrow tactile environment capable of assuming various forms. Blinds walk on metal meshes beating the rhythmic sound of their walk while holding on the handrail rope with their hand. Each of these unit displays two consecutive numbers engraved in Braille scripts and hosts sensor activators connected to the numerical system of the library.
