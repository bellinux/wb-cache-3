40|$|Abstract Background Spontaneous (non-evoked) pain {{is a major}} {{clinical}} symptom of neuropathic syndromes, one that is understudied in basic pain research for practical reasons and {{because of a lack}} of consensus over precisely which behaviors reflect spontaneous pain in laboratory animals. It is commonly asserted that rodents experiencing pain in a hind limb exhibit hypolocomotion and decreased rearing, engage in both reflexive and organized limb directed behaviors, and avoid supporting their body weight on the affected side. Furthermore, it is assumed that the extent of these positive or negative behaviors can be used as a dependent measure of spontaneous chronic pain severity in such animals. In the present study, we tested these assumptions via blinded, systematic observation of digital video of mice with nerve injuries (chronic constriction or spared nerve injury), and automated assessment of locomotor behavior using <b>photocell</b> <b>detection</b> and dynamic weight bearing (i. e., gait) using the CatWalk Â® system. Results We found no deficits in locomotor activity or rearing associated with neuropathic injury. The frequency of asymmetric (ipsilaterally directed) behaviors were too rare to be seriously considered as representing spontaneous pain, and in any case did not statistically exceed what was blindly observed on the contralateral hind paw and in control (sham operated and unoperated) mice. Changes in dynamic weight bearing, on the other hand, were robust and ipsilateral after spared nerve injury (but not chronic constriction injury). However, we observed timing, pharmacological, and genetic dissociation of mechanical allodynia and gait alterations. Conclusions We conclude that spontaneous neuropathic pain in mice cannot be assessed using any of these measures, and thus caution is warranted in making such assertions. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out, on a pilot plant scale, into the factors affecting the hydrodynamic behaviour, mass transfer efficiency, liquid and gas residence times distribution functions {{and the extent of}} fluid mixing in a two sieve plate air-water distillation column simulator. The hydrodynamic behaviour was investigated {{as a function of the}} column operating conditions and wherever possible the results have been reported as correlation equation suitable for design purposes. The air-aqueous glycerol-oxygen system was chosen for the mass transfer study because the low solubility of oxygen in glycerol solutions means that the mass transfer may be regarded as being controlled by the liquid film. An accurate continuous sample and analysis technique was employed and the efficiency of both the tray alone and the tray plus downcomer was measured. The liquid phase residence time distribution functions were measured using an improved dye injection and <b>photocell</b> <b>detection</b> technique. The degree of mixing was determined using the variance of the residence time distribution function and the eddy diffusion model. The residence time and degree of liquid mixing were investigated as functions of the column operating conditions. The gas phase residence time distribution functions were measured using an ethane tracer with a double sample infra-red detection. The degree of mixing was interpreted using an eddy diffusion model and the Peclet number was successfully correlated with the liquid momentum. The mass transfer efficiency has been successfully related to the hydrodynamic behaviour, the liquid residence time and the extent of liquid mixing on the tray. The liquid momentum has been shown to be the major variable affecting the degree of mixing in both the gas and liquid phases...|$|E
