40|$|Safety related-systems {{are subject}} to {{periodic}} <b>proof</b> <b>testing,</b> and it is often assumed that the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> is perfect. In recent years, partial <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> has been introduced {{in order to improve}} the system s reliability, and partial <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> is often referred as imperfect <b>proof</b> <b>testing.</b> In this master s thesis we show that partial <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> is different from imperfect <b>proof</b> <b>testing,</b> and, a mathematical model for modelling the effect of both partial and imperfect <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> is proposed. In addition to imperfect and partial <b>proof</b> <b>tests,</b> the system can also be subject to <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> with short test intervals (intervals in the order of two or three weeks). In theory, a system that is subject to short test intervals is highly reliable, however, there are some factors like (i) human errors that are introduced during <b>proof</b> <b>testing,</b> and (ii) wear, that impact the system's reliability. We present and discuss the major contributors to the unreliability of a system, which is often known as the system's unavailability. In this master's thesis we study four reliability assessment methods for estimating the probability of failure on Demand, PFD_avg of safety-related systems that {{are subject to}} partial and imperfect <b>proof</b> <b>testing.</b> In addition, the effects of short test intervals are also studied. Additional factors that contribute to high reliability of a system during the system's life cycle are discussed and highlighted.

In addition to partial and imperfect <b>proof</b> <b>testing,</b> this type of system is also subject to <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> with short test intervals.

40|$|The FAA and NASA have {{recently}} completed independent technical {{evaluations of the}} concept of pressure <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> the fuselage of commercial transport airplanes. The results of these evaluations are summarized. The objectives of the evaluations were to establish the potential benefit of the pressure <b>proof</b> <b>test,</b> to quantify the most desirable <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> pressure, and to quantify the required <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> interval. The focus of the evaluations was on multiple-site cracks extending from adjacent rivet holes of a typical fuselage longitudinal lap splice joint. The FAA and NASA do not support pressure <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> the fuselage of aging commercial transport aircraft. The argument against <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> is as follows: (1) a single <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> does not insure an indefinite life; therefore, the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> must be repeated at regular intervals; (2) for a proof factor of 1. 33, the required <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> interval must be below 300 flights to account for uncertainties in the evaluation; (3) conducting the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> at a <b>proof</b> factor of 1. 5 would considerably exceed the fuselage design limit load; therefore, it is not consistent with accepted safe practices; and (4) better safety can be assured by implementing enhanced nondestructive inspection requirements, and adequate reliability can be achieved by an inspection interval several times longer than the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> interval...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of <b>proof</b> (or acceptance) <b>test</b> data during the {{reliability}} based design optimization of structural components. It is assumed that every component will be <b>proof</b> <b>tested</b> and that the component will only enter into service if it passes the <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> The goal {{is to reduce the}} component weight, while maintaining high reliability, by exploiting the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> results during the design process. The proposed procedure results in the simultaneous design of the structural component and the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> itself and provides the designer with direct control over the probability of failing the <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> The procedure is illustrated using two analytical example problems and the results indicate that significant weight savings are possible when exploiting the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> results during the design process...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} failure of optical fibers must be avoided to ensure reliability of fiber-based systems. The first stress event in a fiber’s lifetime is the <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> will alter the fiber’s strength distribution for all subsequent processing and applications. Thus {{it is critical}} to know the fiber strength distribution after <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> (post-proof strength distribution). It is generally assumed that the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> truncates the strength distribution at the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> stress level. But, many users are concerned because they know that theoretically {{it has been shown that}} after <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> the strength of fiber may be much less than the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> stress level, and that the minimum post-proof strength is determined only by the unloading rate during the <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> But this theoretical result is not consistent with historical field data. Historically no one has documented failures stresses below the proof stress level. This dissertation resolves this apparent contradiction by reviewing the theory and conducting a probabilistic assessment. As optical fibers are used more and more in computer and switching gear backplanes, a new potential mechanical reliability problem arises due to the necessar...|$|R

Significant reliability enhancement by these <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> methods has been experimentally demonstrated for composite strength and composite life in tension. This basic <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> methodology is relevant to the certification and acceptance of critical composite structures.

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{study for the}} optimization of periodic <b>proof</b> <b>tests</b> for fatigue-critical structures is presented. The optimal proof load level and the optimal number of periodic <b>proof</b> <b>tests</b> are determined by minimizing the total expected (statistical average) cost, while the constraint on the allowable level of structural reliability is satisfied. The total expected cost consists of the expected cost of <b>proof</b> <b>tests,</b> the expected cost of structures destroyed by <b>proof</b> <b>tests,</b> and the expected cost of structural failure in service. It is demonstrated by numerical examples that significant cost saving and reliability improvement for fatigue-critical structures {{can be achieved by}} the application of the optimal periodic <b>proof</b> <b>test.</b> The present study is relevant to the establishment of optimal maintenance procedures for fatigue-critical structures...|$|R
40|$|<b>Proof</b> pile load <b>tests</b> are an {{important}} means to cope with uncertainties {{in the design and}} construction of pile foundations. In this paper, a systematic method to incorporate the results of <b>proof</b> load <b>tests</b> not conducted to failure into the design of pile foundations is developed. In addition, illustrative acceptance criteria for driven piles based on <b>proof</b> load <b>tests</b> are proposed for use in a reliability-based design. Finally, modifications to conventional <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> procedures are studied so that the value derived from <b>proof</b> <b>tests</b> can be maximized. Whether or not a <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> is conducted to failure, its results can be used to update the probability distribution of the pile capacity using the method proposed in this paper. Hence, contributions of the <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> can be included in foundation design in a logical manner by considering several load test parameters such as the number of tests, the test load, the factor of safety, and test results. This adds value to <b>proof</b> load <b>tests</b> and warrants improvements in the procedures for acceptance of pile foundations using <b>proof</b> load <b>tests.</b> A larger <b>test</b> load for <b>proof</b> <b>tests,</b> say 1. 5 times the predicted pile capacity, is recommended since it will yield more information about the capacity statistics and thus allow for more economical designs...|$|R

40|$|These {{guidelines}} integrate state-of-the-art elastic-plastic {{fracture mechanics}} (EPFM) and <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> implementation issues into a comprehensive <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> analysis procedure {{in the form}} of a road map which identifies the types of data, fracture mechanics based parameters, and calculations needed to perform flaw screening and minimum proof load analyses of fracture critical components. Worked examples are presented to illustrate the application of the road map to <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> analysis. The state-of-the art fracture technology employed in these guidelines is based on the EPFM parameter, J, and a pictorial representation of a J fracture analysis, called the failure assessment diagram (FAD) approach. The recommended fracture technology is validated using finite element J results, and laboratory and hardware fracture test results on the nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718, the aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3511, and ferritic pressure vessel steels. In all cases the laboratory specimens and hardware failed by ductile mechanisms. Advanced <b>proof</b> <b>test</b> analyses involving probability analysis and multiple-cycle <b>proof</b> <b>testing</b> (MCPT) are addressed.
