5|$|Cantonese <b>people,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Hakka, {{were well}} known {{throughout}} Southeast Asia as mineworkers. Their migration in the 19th century was largely {{directed toward the}} tin mines of Bangka, off {{the east coast of}} Sumatra. Notable traditionally as skilled artisans, the Cantonese benefited from close contact with Europeans in Guangdong and Hong Kong by learning about machinery and industrial success. They migrated to Java {{about the same time as}} the Hakka, but for different reasons. In Indonesia's cities they became artisans, machine workers, and owners of small businesses such as restaurants and hotel-keeping services. The Cantonese are evenly dispersed throughout the archipelago, and number far less than the Hokkien or the Hakka. Consequently, their roles are of secondary importance in the Chinese communities.|$|E
5|$|Similar effects {{should be}} found for other {{attributes}} connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more. In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career between 1803 and 1804, {{in the office}} of Augustine Gascón, officiating as labour counselor for Indians. As a result, he confronted powerful <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> mayors of Cochabamba and Chayanta. He left the city after being threatened, and returned to Buenos Aires in 1805 with his wife Maria Guadalupe Cuenca and their newborn son. Once in the city, he became a reporter of the hearings of the Royal Audiencia, a local appeal court. The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the local council, hired him as an advisor as well. He defended Melchor Fernández, aggrieved by Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, in one of his first cases. In another of his early disputes he backed the Cabildo in denying the appointment as an ensign of the young Bernardino Rivadavia.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{disaster}} {{had previously}} occurred little over 22 years earlier on July 21, 1907. The coastal steamer Columbia {{collided with the}} steam schooner San Pedro and sank at an astounding speed, killing 88 <b>people.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> San Juan, the Columbia was an iron hulled steamship constructed in Chester, Pennsylvania during the early 1880s. The Columbia's sinking, {{like that of the}} San Juan, was also thought to have occurred due to structural weaknesses within the Columbia's wrought iron hull.|$|E
25|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{had always}} been defined very closely to the {{language}}, now this language gradually changed, and although some <b>people</b> (<b>like</b> <b>the</b> famous scribe known as the Tremulous Hand of Worcester) could read Old English in the thirteenth century. Soon afterwards, it became impossible for people to read Old English, and the texts became useless. The precious Exeter Book, for example, {{seems to have been}} used to press gold leaf and at one point had a pot of fish-based glue sitting on top of it. For Michael Drout this symbolises the end of the Anglo-Saxons.|$|E

25|$|Significant dog bites affect tens of {{millions}} of people globally each year. It is estimated that 1.5 - 2 percent of the US population, from 4.5–4.7 million people, are bitten by dogs yearly. Pit bulls bit and killed 21 people during the 1980s. Most bites occur in children. In the 1980s and 1990s the US averaged 17 fatalities per year, while in the 2000s this has increased to 26. 77% of dog bites are from the pet of family or friends, and 50% of attacks occur on the dog owner's property. Animal bites, most of which are from dogs, are the reason for 1% of visits to an emergency department in the United States. Young children are sustain bites by familiar or family dogs during normal activities. Some <b>people,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> very young or the very old are more susceptible to being bitten by a dog.|$|E
500|$|The {{colorization}} controversy was {{a factor}} in the passage of the National Film Preservation Act in 1988 which created the National Film Registry the following year.

500|$|The {{political}} union in 1800 of the predominantly Catholic Kingdom of Ireland with Great Britain, {{coupled with the}} outbreak of peace with France in the early 19th century, challenged the previous century's concept of militant Protestant Britishness. The new, expanded United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland meant that the state had to re-evaluate its position on {{the civil rights of}} Catholics, and extend its definition of Britishness to the Irish <b>people.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> terms that had been invented {{at the time of the}} Acts of Union 1707, [...] "West Briton" [...] was introduced for the Irish after 1800.

500|$|The books {{became more}} respectful {{of law and}} authority. Even villains no longer smoked or drank, and scenes {{involving}} guns and shoot-outs were compressed or eliminated, in favor of criminals simply giving themselves up. The boys, too, become more respectful of rules and of the law; for example, they no longer drive faster than the speed limit even {{in pursuit of a}} villain. The Hardys also became more and more wealthy, prompting the criticism that the [...] "major problem in [...] is that the Hardy Boys have risen above any ability to identify with <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> typical boys who read their books.

500|$|Sandi Mann concludes {{from her}} {{research}} that the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] culture will prevail, becoming used by more companies and countries. In the service industry, for example, {{she explains that}} products have become more uniform {{over the past few}} decades. Thus, the sole way for companies to distinguish themselves is to have better customer service. She notes that there are positive and negative effects. A positive effect is that it is beneficial for business and for people who enjoy fake displays. A negative effect is that emotions incompatible with the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] culture are repressed, leading to what Mann terms the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] syndrome. [...] In an interview for the Wall Street Journal, an employee of a telemarketing company, was called a son of a bitch. Clenching his teeth, he responded [...] "Thank you very much, you have a nice day." [...] The stress of suppressing their feelings and faking cheerfulness caused <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> telemarketer to feel insincere and phony. Individuals affected by the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] syndrome must carry out emotional labor, which could lead to diminished self-esteem, depression, and cynicism.|$|E
