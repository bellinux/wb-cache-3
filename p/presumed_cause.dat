30|$|If initial {{treatment}} with an IM nail {{results in a}} nonunion, the nail can be removed and a larger diameter nail can be placed after overreaming. The <b>presumed</b> <b>causes</b> of healing after exchange nailing are both biological and mechanical [5]. The biological effects believed to be that reaming increases periosteal blood flow, whereas it decreases endosteal vascularization. The periosteum reacts to increased blood flow with new bone formation. Products of the reaming itself contain osteoblasts and possibly multipotent stem cells as well as growth factors that {{play a role in}} bone healing.|$|R

50|$|Angina is not {{classified}} as a disease in itself, it refers to a person having chest pain with coronary heart disease, {{due to the lack}} of oxygen their myocardium as the <b>presumed</b> <b>cause.</b> A high mortality rate is associated with coronary heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 26.6% of all death in 2005. Another study in the United States estimates that coronary heart disease has the greatest prevalence amongst people aged 65 years or over (19.8% in 2010), followed by people who are aged between 45-64 (with a prevalence of 7.1%). The United Kingdom also has a high mortality rate with 16% of all male deaths and 10% of all female deaths being attributable to coronary heart disease. However, it is worth noting that the mortality rate of coronary heart disease has been in steady decline since its peak in the 1960s, in contrast to the morbidity trend which has increased with increasing rates of revascularisation.|$|E
5000|$|She {{outlines}} {{the power of}} men as: 1) a metaphysical assertion of self; 2) physical strength; 3) the capacity to terrorize; 4) the power of naming; 5) the power owning, 6) the power of money; and 7) the power of sex. The [...] "metaphysical assertion of self" [...] {{is described as a}} subject position. Dworkin suggests that men occupy a powerful subject position that is protected by laws and customs, art and literature, documented in history, and upheld in the distribution of wealth. Men have this self (an “unselfconscious parasitism”) and women must, by definition, lack it. The first sign of his parasitism is in his relationship to his mother. He then transfers this to other women in his life and uses women to enlarge himself. Men also have the power of physical Strength. This {{is not the same as}} being muscular or strong, but it is the right to physical strength. The capacity to terrorize is the metaphysical assertion of self plus strength which creates fear in a whole class of people (men over women). This happens through rape, battery sexual abuse, and the use of prostitutes. This behavior is idolized in movies about heroism, war, and glory. In TV, literature, books, drama this story plays out. Men’s acts are huge and awesome even when villainous and women become the prize. The power of naming means that men have the ability to define experiences and this is upheld by force. As an example, men name women as “weak” and then further weaken them with preferences and standards of beauty that leave women mutilated and stunted. The power of owning refers to husbands' ownership of wives and fathers' ownership of daughters. This ownership is natural as he is the “one who takes.” Once he has had, it is his. Men also have the power of money. In the hands of women, money buys things, it stays literal. Money in the hands of a woman is sometimes evidence of something foul: unwomanly ambition and greed. For men, money buys women, sex, status, dignity, esteem, loyalty, and all manner of possibility; it brings qualities, achievements, and respect. Money in the hands of a man signifies worth and accomplishment. Wealth of any kind is an expression of male sexual power. Lastly, Dworkin suggests that men have the power of sex although they assert the opposite. The carnality of women is said to be the defining characteristic of women. Women have sexual power because the erection is involuntary and a woman is always the <b>presumed</b> <b>cause,</b> therefore the man is helpless and the woman powerful. The male reacts to a stimulus for which he is not responsible. Whatever he does, he does out of a provocation from a female - she is the temptress. According to Dworkin, men force women to become that thing that causes erection and then holds himself helpless when he is aroused by her. His fury when she is not that thing is intense and powerful.|$|E
30|$|Pulmonary hematoma {{is defined}} as the {{presence}} of blood within the alveolar and interstitial spaces [1]. In general, the pulmonary hematoma is caused by chest trauma. However, rare cases without a previous history of trauma have been reported, when the condition is referred to as spontaneous or idiopathic pulmonary hematoma. Anticoagulant therapy, thrombocytopenia, and rare diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are some of the <b>presumed</b> <b>causes</b> of spontaneous or idiopathic pulmonary hematoma [1 – 7]. In our case, there was no history of trauma and no history of anticoagulant therapy, and his coagulation profile was normal. In addition, the pathogenesis remained unclear. Therefore, we diagnosed the case as a rare case of spontaneous pulmonary hematoma.|$|R
40|$|Psychiatry?s generic {{concept of}} {{disorder}} has long served an important legitimizing function for the {{broad array of}} conditions for which individuals seek mental health treatment, regardless of their <b>presumed</b> <b>causes.</b> Wakefield?s proposal to restrict the mental disorder concept to only a subset of these conditions {{has given rise to}} concerns about the uncertain consequences of classifying others as non-disorders. In Bergner?s recent counterproposal, this concern is masked {{in the form of a}} conspicuously overinclusive definition of mental disorder. Bergner?s resistance to Wakefield?s classification objective underscores an important, unmet, and often unacknowledged need within the clinical treatment community. The challenge ahead lies in finding ways to address this need without compromising the integrity of efforts to develop a more coherent concept of mental disorder...|$|R

Genetic diversity level within population {{can be obtained by}} population genetic study using molecular marker such as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Here we amplified RAPD marker using ten arbitrary primers to assess genetic diversity of P. erosa population in the Segara Anakan Cilacap to provide genetic data for its sustainable use. The results proved that the use of RAPD marker has high polymorphisms. The mud clam population also showed a high level of heterozygosity and genetic diversity.

40|$|Background—International {{guidelines}} recommend {{differentiation between}} cardiac and noncardiac causes of cardiac arrest. The {{aim of this}} study was to find the rate of agreement between primarily postulated and definitive causes of cardiac arrest. Methods and Results—We retrospectively analyzed the primarily <b>presumed</b> <b>cause</b> of cardiac arrest as determined by the emergency room physician on admission in all patients admitted to the emergency department of one urban tertiary care hospital. This was compared with the definitive cause as established by clinical evidence or autopsy. Within 4 years, the initially <b>presumed</b> <b>cause</b> was unclear in 24 (4 %) of 593 patients. In the remaining 569 patients, the <b>presumed</b> <b>cause</b> was correct in 509 (89 %) and wrong in 60 (11 %) cases. Cardiac origin was presumed in 421 (71 %) and the definitive cause in 408 (69 %) cases. Noncardiac origin was presumed in 148 (25 %) and the definitive cause in 185 (31 %) patients. Presumed cardiac cause was sensitive (96 %) but less specific (77 %). Noncardiac causes such as pulmonary embolism, cerebral disorders, or exsanguination were those most frequently overlooked. Asystole occurred significantly more often in patients in whom <b>presumed</b> <b>cause</b> remained undetermined or differed from the definitive cause. Conclusions—Cause of cardiac arrest is not as easily recognized as anticipated, especially when the initial rhythm is different from ventricular fibrillation. This might affect comparability of study results, therapeutic strategies, prognosis, and outcome. Patients in whom the <b>presumed</b> <b>cause</b> was confirmed as being correct had significantly better survival an...|$|E
