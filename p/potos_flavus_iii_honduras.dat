40|$|We {{examined}} 96 museum specimens {{belonging to}} 14 species of Carnivora from the Mexican State of Puebla. In addition, four species were documented based on literature records and by indirect evidence. The carnivorous mammals of Puebla belong to 5 families, 18 genera, 18 species and 23 subspecies. Eight of these 23 taxa are reported herein {{for the first}} time from the state of Puebla. Of the 18 species, Herpailurus yagouaroundi, Lontra longicaudis, Taxidea taxus, and Galictis vittata are considered by Norma Oficial Mexicana as threatened species, Leopardus wiedii and Eira barbara in danger of extinction, and <b>Potos</b> <b>flavus</b> is under special protection. We found Lynx rufus, Canis latrans, Taxidea taxus, and Bassariscus astutus were found only in the Nearctic region of the State, whereas Herpailurus yagouaroundi, Leopardus wiedii, Lontra longicaudis, Galictis vittata, Eira barbara, <b>Potos</b> <b>flavus,</b> and Nasua narica were found only in the Neotropical region of the State. The remaining seven species (Puma concolor, Urocyon cinereoargenteus, Mustela frenata, Mephitis macroura, Spilogale putorius, Conepatus leuconotus, and Procyon lotor) have been taken in both the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. Localities in the Sierra Norte de Puebla had the greatest species richness and abundance of individuals. The carnivores confront serious conservation problems in the state because they are hunted indiscriminately as trophies and by the local residents as harmful species. Moreover they are hunted for economic benefit by the sale of theirs skins or as living pets.

50|$|The canopy is {{the primary}} layer of the forest forming a roof over the two {{remaining}} layers. It contains {{the majority of the}} largest trees, typically 30-45 m in height. Tall, broad-leaved evergreen trees are the dominant plants. The densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest canopy, as it often supports a rich flora of epiphytes, including orchids, bromeliads, mosses and lichens. These epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. It is suggested that the total arthropod species richness of the tropical canopy might be as high as 20 million. Other species habituating this layer include many avian species such as the yellow-casqued wattled hornbill (Ceratogymna elata), collared sunbird (Anthreptes collaris), African gray parrot (Psitacus erithacus), keel-billed toucan (Ramphastos sulfuratus), scarlet macaw (Ara macao) as well as other animals like the spider monkey (Ateles sp.), African giant swallowtail (Papilio antimachus), three-toed sloth (Bradypus tridactylus), kinkajou (<b>Potos</b> <b>flavus),</b> and tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cozumel Island in the Mexican Caribbean is {{inhabited}} by four carnivores, of which two, the Cozumel coati Nasua nelsoni and pygmy raccoon Procyon pygmaeus, are endemic species. The taxonomic {{status of a}} third carnivore, a dwarf gray fox Urocyon cinereoargenteus, is undetermined, but may deserve subspecific or species-level recognition. The fourth species, the kinkajou (<b>Potos</b> <b>flavus),</b> may be a recent introduction. We review the status of these carnivores, report our field observations and results of line transect and trapping efforts, discuss current threats to these taxa, and make recommendations for 2 their conservation. A population density of 0. 43 6 0. 27 coatis /km, and a total island population size of 150 6 95 individuals, was estimated from 386 km of line transects in 1994 – 1995. Intensive trapping efforts (1479 trap-nights) in 2001 at multiple localities were unsuccessful. Pygmy raccoons were observed in the mangrove and coastal wetland areas of the island and in 2001 we captured 11 individuals with the same sampling efforts as for coatis (8. 8 raccoons / 1000 trap-nights). The gray fox is also apparently very rare on the island. While a few observations of the animals have been made (1984, 1994 and 2001), no animals were seen along transects and none were trapped.

40|$|Although {{leishmaniasis}} {{is regarded}} as a significant health problem in Ecuador by the Ministry of Health, and the incidence has increased over the last years, an official map on the geographic distribution of disease and sand fly vectors or a control strategy do not exist yet. This article reviews the current situation based on published informa-tion to improve our knowledge and understand the epidemiological situation of leishmaniasis in Ecuador in order to help future research and to develop a national control strategy. The disease is endemic in most provinces throughout Pacific coastal region, Amazonian lowlands, and some inter-Andean valleys with a total 21, 805 cases reported during 1990 - 2003. Whereas cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is found throughout Ecuador, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) appears to be restricted to the Amazon region; one, parasitologically unconfirmed case of visceral form was reported in 1949. Most human infections are caused by Leishmania (Viannia) spp., which is distributed in the subtropical and tropical lowlands; infections due to L. (Leishmania) spp. are found in the Andean highlands and in the Pacific lowlands as well. The proven vectors are Lutzomyia trapidoi and Lu. ayacuchensis. Canis familiaris, Sciurus vulgaris, <b>Potos</b> <b>flavus,</b> and Tamandua tetradactyla have been found infected with Leishmania spp. It is estimated that around 3000 - 4500 people may be infected every year, and that 3. 1 to 4. 5 millions people are estimated to be at risk of contracting leishmaniasis.

40|$|Exclusive frugivory is rare. As a food resource, {{fruit is}} {{temporally}} and spatially patchy, low in protein, and variable {{in terms of}} energy yield from different carbohydrate types. Here, we evaluate the digestive physiology of two frugivorous Carnivora species (<b>Potos</b> <b>flavus,</b> Arctictis binturong) that converge with primates in a diversity of ecological and anatomical traits related to fruit consumption. We conducted feeding trials to determine mean digestive retention times (MRT) on captive animals at the Carnivore Preservation Trust (now Carolina Tiger Rescue), Pittsboro, NC. Fecal samples were collected on study subjects for in vitro analysis to determine methane, pH, and short chain fatty acid profiles; fiber was assayed using standard neutral detergent (NDF) and acid detergent (ADF) fiber methods. Results indicate that both carnivoran species have rapid digestive passage for mammals that consume a predominantly plant-based diet: A. binturong MRT =  6. 5 hrs (0. 3); P. flavus MRT =  2. 5 hrs (1. 6). In vitro experiments revealed no fermentation of structural polysaccharides [...] methane levels did not shift from 0 h to either 24 or 48 hours and no short chain fatty acids were detected. In both species, however, pH declined from one incubation period to another suggesting acidification and bacterial activity of microbes using soluble carbohydrates.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the medium and large mammalian species richness, using transect census, camera trapping, and specimen bone collection. Nine transects were established and 21 camera trap stations were placed along 16 km 2 in three localities of PNCA, from August 2012 to April 2013. Total sampling effort was 215 km of transects and 4077 camera-days. We documented 22 species; including 17 with camera trapping, 11 with transect census, and 10 with specimen collection.  Camera traps were the most effective method, and four species (Dasyprocta punctata, Cuniculus paca, Leopardus wiedii and Puma concolor) were documented only with this method.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between {{a community of}} nine nocturnal frugivorous mammal species and the plants on which they feed were studied during 14 consecutive months in a secondary forest near Cayenne, French Guiana. Two major trophic groups can be defined : 1. - The seed eaters, which open unripe fruits to eat their seeds. All are rodents : Coendou prehensilis (average adult weight 4 000 g), Echimys armatus (400 g) and Oryzomys concolor (35 g). 2. - The pulp eaters, which specialize in ripe fruits. They eat the pulp and swallow most of the seeds which are disseminated with their feces. Five of them are marsupials : Didelphis marsupialis (1 000 g), Philander opossum (400 g), Caluromys philander (300 g), Marmosa cinerea (80 g) and Marmosa murina (45 g). The sixth species is a Procyonid Carnivore : <b>Potos</b> <b>flavus</b> (3 000 g). These differing types of feeding strategies are discussed {{in relation to the}} morphology of the teeth and digestive tract of the species. Species with a similar diet and comparable body size generally live in different forest layers. The population density and biomass of these nocturnal frugivorous mammals were estimated on the basis of direct counts along forest trails at night, trapping results and radio-tracking. Out of the 127 plant species listed, 26 play a major role as a food source for the mammals studied. The trunk diameter (DBH) of the 13 most common species was measured, and the distribution of these trees mapped in the 8. 5 ha study area. These 13 tree species account for approximately half of the total basal area, which is considered here as an index of standing crop biomass. The same 13 species account for 25 % {{of the total number of}} individual trees. Fruit production was measured during 13 months by weighing all fallen fruits along 1 200 m of trails. Fruit production and consumption of the same species were also estimated by the use of fruit collectors located under fruiting trees. Special attention was given to the phenological cycles of trees. Three types of fruiting cycles could thus be related to three different foraging strategies of the sympatric frugivorous mammals : 1. - Species with a low fruit production spread over an extended time period. Only a few fruit ripen at the same time, but fruiting takes place almost all year long. Such trees are early - or late - pionneer species; their fruits have tiny seeds which are mainly eaten by small vertebrates which scatter them more or less homogeneously. 2. - Species with synchronous, but irregular cycles of fruit production. Such trees have rather large seeds which are very attractive to seed-eating rodents. These animals even destroy part of the fruit crop before ripening. The massive, irregular, and unpredictable fruiting cycles of these species may reduce seed predation by rodents. The few trees belonging to this category which do not bear fruit synchronously with their conspecifics may have their crop totally destroyed by rodents. 3. - Species with synchronous and regular cycles of fruit production. Such trees have rather large seeds, which are ingested by large frugivorous vertebrates and spread through their feces. Chemical or physical deterrents are generally present in such fruits before ripening. The tree species belonging to this category have successive and partly overlapping periods of fruit production. In this way, food is made available for pulp-eaters during most of the year. This pattern of fructification is presumably the end-result of a long lasting mutual interaction between plants and seed-scattering vertebrales. Frugivorous mammals apparently need two different kinds of fruit in their diet, sorne rich in sugar and others rich in fat. Trees producing these two categories of fruit produce their crop successively, so that the necess ary nutrients are made available throughout the year. A definite decrease in fruit production takes place in our study are ajust before the beginning of the dry season. The marsupial pulp-eaters have adapted to this temporary food shortage by storing fat during the season of plenty. However, their production of young is strongly affected by this seasonal food shortage, as shawn by an increased mortality rate of pouch young...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of new pathogens and the increasing drug-resistance of recognized ones pose a difficult challenge. One way that this challenge is being addressed is through the discovery of new cost-effective drug resources {{in the form of}} bioactive compounds. Algae represent a promising source of bioactive compounds in this regard. In the present research, we used molecular and phylogenetic analysis to isolate and identify two microalgal strains. We found that one strain belonged to the phylum chrysophyta and the other to the cyanobacteria. We also investigated the antimicrobial activity of some of the lipophilic extracts of the two microalgal strains. Several fractions showed high individual antimicrobial bioactivity against multidrug-resistant Salmonella sp., Citrobacter sp., Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus <b>flavus.</b> Fraction <b>III</b> from Poterioochromonas malhamensis showed the highest level of activity against two multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.

One lipophilic fraction from Aphanizomenon showed antifungal bioactivity against Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus, where the inhibition zone diameter was 1. 1 cm and 1. 0 cm, respectively.

The present Ethics in Action published version contains both a number of important edits and several substantive additions (notably to section <b>III</b> on <b>Honduras)</b> subsequent to the Osgoode CLPE Research Paper. The paper begins, in Section II, with general comments on a notion of “interactive diversity of knowledge” and how that connects up to a view about the nature of truth. Sections III and IV then present salient aspects of events in both Honduras and Sri Lanka over the last two years, with the coup d’ état of 28 June 2009, in Honduras and the bloody end to the civil war in Sri Lanka in spring 2009 as fulcrums of the narrative. In each case, emphasis is also placed on the establishment of truth-related commissions or panels in relation to each country. The paper ends with a discussion of three interconnected quandaries - the inside/outside quandary, the consistency and fairness quandary, and the timing quandary. The discussion of the timing (or staging) quandary offers some provisional thinking on the sequencing of processes related to truth, justice and reconciliation, offering some reasons not to fuse truth-seeking processes with either criminal justice or reconciliation processes - with special reference to the Sri Lanka context...|$|R
