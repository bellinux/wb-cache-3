The paper investigates the route computation load imposed by the PNNI routing scheme, and shows that this load is unevenly distributed among the network nodes. More specifically, the routing computation load associated with the set up of a single VC grows exponentially with the hierarchy level. As a result, some of the network nodes [...] mainly those that function as border nodes of high levels [...] may be overloaded with route computation, while other nodes are rarely involved in this process. The paper also proposes a possible scheme for spreading the route computation burden more evenly.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two mobile {{location management}} algorithms for ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks {{based on the}} PNNI (<b>private</b> <b>network-to-network</b> <b>interface)</b> standard. The first solution is called the mobile PNNI scheme because it builds on the PNNI routing protocol. It uses limitedscope (characterized by a parameter S) reachability updates, forwarding pointers, and a route optimization procedure. The second solution is called the LR (location registers) scheme because it introduces location registers (such as the cellular home and visitor location registers) into the PNNI standards-based hierarchical networks. This scheme uses a hierarchical arrangement of location registers with the hierarchy limited to a certain level S. Analytical models are set up to compare the average move, search, and total costs per move of these two schemes for different values of the CMR (call-to-mobility ratio), and to provide guidelines for selecting parameters of the algorithms. Results show that at low CMR's (CMR ! 0. 025), the LR scheme performs better than the mobile PNNI scheme. We also observe that the two schemes show a contrasting behavior {{in terms of the}} value to be used for the parameter S to achieve the least average total cost. At low CMR's, the parameter S should be high for the mobile PNNI scheme, but low for the LR scheme, and vice versa for high CMR's. Index Terms [...] -Mobility management, PNNI, wireless ATM. I...|$|E

50|$|While the {{underlying}} protocols and technologies are different, both MPLS and ATM provide a connection-oriented service for transporting data across computer networks. In both technologies, connections are signaled between endpoints, connection state is maintained at each node in the path, and encapsulation techniques {{are used to}} carry data across the connection.

40|$|The <b>Private</b> <b>Network-to-Network</b> <b>Interface</b> (PNNI) is a {{scalable}} hierarchical protocol {{that allows}} ATM switches to be aggregated into clusters called peer groups. To provide good accuracy in choosing optimal paths in a PNNI network, the PNNI standard {{provides a way}} to represent a peer group with a structure called the complex node representation. It allows the cost of traversing the peer group between any ingress and egress to be advertised in a compact form. Complex node representations using {{a small number of}} links result in a correspondingly short path computation time and therefore in good performance. It is, accordingly, desirable that the complex node representation contains as few links as possible. In earlier work, a method was presented for constructing the set of the optimal complex node representations in the restrictive and symmetric cost case, under the assumption of a restricted set of optimal paths and a corresponding minimal path computation time. Here this method is extended to constructing the set of the optimal complex node representations appropriate for deployment in a heterogeneous environment where no uniform policy is used to derive them. These representations are not confined by a reduced optimal path constraint, and consequently use the absolute minimum possible number of links, resulting in a minimum path computation time. q 2003 Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{algorithm}} for optimizing {{the route of}} a connection that becomes suboptimal due to operations such as handoffs and location-based reroutes, for mobile ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks based on the PNNI (<b>private</b> <b>network-to-network</b> <b>interface)</b> standard. This algorithm uses hierarchical route information of the connection and summarized topology and loading information of the network to determine a "crossover node" such that adjusting the connection from that crossover node results in an optimally routed connection. We then apply this algorithm to the mobile location management problem. Location management schemes have been proposed in which an incoming call to a mobile is first routed to its home switch (based on summarized reachability data) and then rerouted to the mobile's current location. If we consider such rerouting a "first phase" of mobile connection setup, a "second phase" is required to optimize the paths of such rerouted connections. Such an approach is considered a two-phase mobile location/connection setup scheme. Alternatively, an incoming call to a mobile can be first routed to its home switch based on summarized reachability data, and then "cranked back" to an optimal crossover node before rerouting the connection to the mobile's current location. Such a scheme is a one-phase mobile location/connection setup scheme since it directly results in an optimal path. A comparative performance analysis of the oneand two-phase connection setup schemes is presented. Measures of comparison are call setup delay {{and the amount of}} network resources allocated to a connection. The maximum call setup delay (worst case call setup delay) is lower in the two-phase scheme, but the average call setup delay is lower in the one-phase scheme. T [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract and Executive Summary <b>Network-to-Network</b> <b>Interface</b> (NNI) defines how two {{networks}} interconnect {{and exchange}} information. QoS over NNI interconnect {{is important for}} optimal network utilizations and for delivering high quality services economically. Traditionally, carriers have {{addressed the issue of}} QoS by over-provisioning of their networks. That could possibly be managed for networks carrying VoIP traffic only. However, with the increasing volume of TDM traffic being migrated to IP based networks, and with the increasing uptake of IP based multimedia services; it will not be possible to dimension networks to meet all peak bursty traffic requirements effectively. Hence, QoS over NNI is an important topic of study in major Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and an issue that must be addressed prior to widescale NGN deployment.
