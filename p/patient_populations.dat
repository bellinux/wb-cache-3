5|$|Over 50% of MS {{patients}} may use complementary and alternative medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine used. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} 75% of the MS <b>patient</b> <b>populations</b> use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E

50|$|ISAT was criticised on {{a number}} of factors, many related to the {{randomization}} of the <b>patient</b> <b>population.</b> The <b>patient</b> <b>population</b> was on average younger, and the majority had aneurysms under 10 mm and in anterior circulation. The randomized <b>patient</b> <b>population</b> in the ISAT was younger on average than the population of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients in the U.S. and Japan. In response to these criticisms a facility that participated in ISAT compared the clinical outcomes of their patients that were not selected for the study to those that were. They reported finding outcomes similar to the ISAT.|$|R
25|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} {{pharmacogenomics}} as {{the study of}} DNA sequence variation {{as it relates to}} differential drug response in individuals, i.e., the use of genomics to determine an individual’s response. Pharmacogenomics refers to the use of DNA-based genotyping in order to target pharmaceutical agents to specific <b>patient</b> <b>populations</b> in the design of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Herpes viruses {{establish}} lifelong infections, and {{the virus}} cannot yet be eradicated from the body. Treatment usually involves general-purpose antiviral drugs {{that interfere with}} viral replication, reduce the physical severity of outbreak-associated lesions, and lower the chance of transmission to others. Studies of vulnerable <b>patient</b> <b>populations</b> have indicated that daily use of antivirals such as aciclovir and valaciclovir can reduce reactivation rates.|$|E

Red cells, plasma and platelets can also be donated individually via a more complex process called apheresis.|$|E

Doctoral programs in nursing prepare the student for work in nursing education, health care administration, clinical research, or advanced clinical practice.

25|$|At Baylor College of Medicine {{residents}} and fellows learn {{from one of}} the most diverse <b>patient</b> <b>populations</b> anywhere in the country. This is partially due to the diversity found within the city of Houston, which has no single majority ethnic group. The hospitals of the Texas Medical Center and Houston's status as a hub for international industry also draw patients from every corner of the globe. Adding to this diversity are the many and varied settings in which {{residents and}} fellows have the opportunity to train, including Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center and Baylor's many affiliated hospitals.|$|E
25|$|Copper alloy {{surfaces}} have intrinsic {{properties to}} destroy {{a wide range of}} microorganisms. In the interest of protecting public health, especially in healthcare environments with their susceptible <b>patient</b> <b>populations,</b> an abundance of peer-reviewed antimicrobial efficacy studies have been conducted in the past 10 years regarding copper's efficacy to destroy E. coli O157:H7, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus, Clostridium difficile, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and fungi. Stainless steel was also investigated because it is an important surface material in today's healthcare environments. The studies cited here, plus others directed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, resulted in the 2008 registration of 274 different copper alloys as certified antimicrobial materials that have public health benefits.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, {{as part of}} the society's {{discussions about}} the role of {{publications}} and the society's official journal, accompanied by the advent of open access publishing, the ISCB announced a partnership with the Public Library of Science and launched a new open access journal, PLoS Computational Biology. The journal is intended to emphasize computational methods applied to living systems at all scales, from molecular biology to <b>patient</b> <b>populations</b> and ecosystems, and which offer insight for experimentalists. Past president and past publications committee chair Phil Bourne served as the new publication's editor-in-chief and he remains in that role. The first issue of the new journal coincided with the opening day of ISMB 2005, held in Detroit, Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Simulated {{patients}} are often {{recruited from the}} local amateur and professional acting community, through advertisements in local newspapers, or by word of mouth. Actual patients who take an active and self-taught role in their own healthcare may also be recruited. Graduate students in nearby universities may also agree to take up these roles. Patients and medical students working as a SP can be paid upwards of $100/hour for their services. SPs need to draw on their own personal experiences with physicians, conversations with healthcare professionals, talking to specific <b>patient</b> <b>populations</b> etc. They {{also need to be}} trained to accurately and reliably simulate particular clinical scenarios. Frequent quality assessment may be needed to ensure consistency in the portrayal of the patient role; especially since SPs may absorb a significant amount of clinical knowledge from their interactions with healthcare professionals.|$|E
25|$|Some {{advantages}} of the graft include less trauma to the leg that has undergone the ACL revision. Patients regain their range of motion and leg strength on the newly repaired ACL leg much quicker. The graft also allows for a bone-to-bone fixation which allows for more aggressive rehabilitation. The patient also eliminates the chance of any potential complications such as disease transmission that would be present if an allograph was chosen. The dis{{advantages of}} the graft include infection at this site, anterior knee pain, quadriceps muscle weakness, loss of motion, patella fracture, patellofemoral crepitus, patellar tendonitis, and patellofemoral joint pain. Also, {{it is not uncommon}} in certain <b>patient</b> <b>populations</b> to rupture the contralateral ACL following return to their sport. By harvesting the patellar tendon from the opposite knee, the orthopedic surgeon no longer has the option of using that patellar tendon for the reconstruction. It has been noted that a low percentage of patients have suffered a patellar tendon rupture in the first few weeks after surgery due to the increased stress to the area. In addition to a longer operating time the patient will have two scars instead of one.|$|E
