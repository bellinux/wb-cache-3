40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{analysis of the}} polarization properties of twisted single-mode fibers is presented. It is shown that whereas a conventionally twisted fiber possesses considerable optical rotation, a fiber which has a <b>permanent</b> <b>twist</b> imparted by spinning the preform during fiber drawing exhibits almost no polarization anisotropy. It is thus possible to virtually eliminate the commonly observed fiber linear birefringence. As a consequence, fibers made in this way are ideally suited {{for use in the}} Faraday-effect current transducer. It is further shown that a <b>permanent</b> <b>twist</b> of a few turns/meter effectively eliminates polarization mode-dispersion. The technique therefore appears attractive for enhancing the bandwidth of very long unrepeatered telecommunication links...|$|E

40|$|Solid-core {{photonic}} crystal fiber (PCF) with a <b>permanent</b> helical <b>twist</b> exhibits dips in its transmission spectrum at certain wavelengths. These {{are associated with}} the formation of orbital angular momentum states in the cladding. Here we investigate the tuning of these states with mechanical torque and axial tension. The dip wavelengths are found to scale linearly with both axial strain and mechanical twist rate. Analysis shows that the tension-induced shift in resonance wavelength is determined both by the photoelastic effect and by the change in twist rate, while the torsion-induced wavelength shift depends only on the change in twist rate. Twisted PCF can act as an effective optically monitored torque-tension transducer, twist sensor, or strain gauge. (C) 2013 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R

In every situation, from individuals to large populations of people, uncovering the lie and the myths of scarcity has been the first and most powerful step in the transformation from helplessness and resignation to possibility and self-reliance." ...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} such as load-deflection {{relationship and}} {{modulus of rigidity}} on the twisting of yarn in stationary state have been studied by many researchers. But on the twisting of yarn in rnnning state there are few fundamental studies, experimental or theoretical, except Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory. Tobisch derived his theory {{on the assumption that}} the number of twists of yarn per unit length, or twist density, was uniform everywhere in the twisting field, but this is true only when the delivery velocity is very small or the internal friction of yarn is negligible. The author has made theoretical and experimental studies on the twisting of yarn in running state, considering it as a visco-elastic body made of homogeneous and uniform materials. The studies may be briefly summerized in the following outline. 　(1) A yarn of total length L is fixed at both ends. This yarn is divided into two parts, the length l of it being twisted and the other length L-l free from twisting. If a point fixed between these two parts is suddenly released, twisting will be transmitted to the untwisted part. The theory of this transient transmission of twisting has been treated by solving the following partial differential equation :　p(∂^ 2 θ/∂t^ 2) = G(∂^ 2 θ/∂x^ 2) + η(∂^ 3 θ/∂t∂x^ 2) 　where p = the density of yarn　θ = angle of torsion at x along the yarn　t = time G = modulus of rigidity of yarn. 　η = tangential coefficient of viscosity at the cross section of yarn. 　In the case under consideration, let the angles of torsion along the yarn and at the end of the lenght l be Θ and θ_ 0 respectively. Then the following relation holds : θ=Θ-θ_(0 x) /L. The solution of the above differential equation by the use of this relation and initial and boundary conditions in this case has shown that the twist density of yarn transmitted to the untwisted part is exponentially increased with time and approaches to θ_ 0 /L. 　(2) A high speed camera by which 64 pictures could be taken per second was used in order to confirm the above theory. The results measured coincided satisfactorily with the theory. 　(3) When the yarn was fixed at one end and free at the other and the twisting moment was applied at the free end, the above differential equation was solved under the initial and boundary conditions in this case. The twist density of yarn in this transient case also approaches exponentially to θ_ 0 /L with time. 　(4) In the running yarn, the following transformation of coordinates was used : x=ξ+vt, where v is the velocity of the running yarn, x is a fixed coordinate in yarn and ξ is in space. By solving this transformed equation, it has been shown that the twist density of running yarn with only internal friction is in steady state exponentially decreased from the twisting element, say the aperture of flyer, to the nip point of delivery roller. 　(5) Also by the solution of the above transformed equation, Ball 2 ̆ 7 s distribution diagram of twist in the twisting fields of the ring frame and mule has proved to be the distributed one in a case when the yarn is considered as a visco-elastic body with solid friction. 　(6) In the yarn with plasticity, the twisting field is divied into two Zones : an elastic zone ξ= 0 -ξ_ 1. and a plastic zone ξ=ξ_ 1 -L. The equations of twist density in elastic and plastic zones have been derived under considerations of the boundary conditions. An experiment of twisting rayon yarn with the flyer frame showed that these twe zones occurred and could be explained by substituting appropriate numerical values into the above derived equations. 　(7) When the internal friction of yarn is negligible or the delivery velocity of yarn is very small, Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory is applicable. So, in such a state, the double twisting principle of tyre cord has been analyzed by this theory. 　(8) The re-distribution of twists in the twisting field by the invasion of twisted yarn into the untwisted field or by its regression from the twisting field with the introduction of untwisted yarn is occasionally important in spinning operation, especially in false twisting of worsted spinning and rotating funnel of high draft system in cotton spinning. The state of this re-distribution was experimentally studied by photographing the twisting operation in one twisting field, and the results measured could be qualitatively explained by the above described theorics. 　(9) The <b>permanent</b> deformations of <b>twisted</b> yarn set by steam or initially applied tension were studied by measuring the free rotating angle about the axis of the yarn loaded axially. According to these experiments, the permanent sets are 0 - 28...|$|R
