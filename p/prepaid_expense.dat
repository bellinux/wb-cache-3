50|$|Adjusting {{entries for}} {{prepayments}} {{are necessary to}} account for cash that has been received prior to delivery of goods or completion of services. When this cash is paid, it is first recorded in a <b>prepaid</b> <b>expense</b> asset account; the account is to be expensed either {{with the passage of}} time (e.g. rent, insurance) or through use and consumption (e.g. supplies).|$|E

50|$|Prepaid expenses, such as {{employee}} wages or subcontractor fees paid out or promised, are not recognized as expenses; {{they are considered}} assets because they will provide probable future benefits. As a <b>prepaid</b> <b>expense</b> is used, an adjusting entry is made to update {{the value of the}} asset. In the case of prepaid rent, for instance, the cost of rent for the period would be deducted from the Prepaid Rent account.|$|E
50|$|An advance payment, {{or simply}} an advance, {{is the part}} of a contractually due sum that is paid or {{received}} in advance for goods or services, while the balance included in the invoice will only follow the delivery. It is called a <b>prepaid</b> <b>expense</b> in accrual accounting for the entity issuing the advance. Advanced payments are recorded as assets on the balance sheet. As these assets are used they are expended and recorded on the income statement for the period in which they are incurred. Insurance is a common prepaid asset, which will only be a prepaid asset because it is a proactive measure to protect business from unforeseen events.|$|E
5000|$|Accrued revenue (or accrued assets) is {{an asset}} such as {{proceeds}} from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned {{and the related}} revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later accounting period, when its amount is deducted from accrued revenues. It shares characteristics with deferred expense (or <b>prepaid</b> <b>expense,</b> or prepayment) with the difference that an asset to be covered later is cash paid out to a counterpart for goods or services to be received in a later period when the obligation to pay is actually incurred, the related expense item is recognized, and the same amount is deducted from prepayments ...|$|E

50|$|Asset {{accounts}} are economic resources which benefit the business/entity {{and will continue}} to do so.Cash, bank, accounts receivable, inventory, land, buildings/plant, machinery, furniture, equipment, supplies, vehicles, trademarks and patents, goodwill, <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> <b>prepaid</b> insurance, debtors (people who owe us money, due within one year), VAT input etc.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Prepaid</b> <b>{{expenses}}</b> - {{these are}} expenses paid {{in cash and}} recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (common examples are insurance or office supplies). See also adjusting entries.|$|R
50|$|A Deferred expense or prepayment, <b>prepaid</b> <b>expense,</b> plural often prepaids, is {{an asset}} {{representing}} cash paid {{out to a}} counterpart for goods or services to be received in a later accounting period. For example, if a service contract is paid quarterly in advance, {{at the end of}} the first month of the period two months remain as a deferred expense. In the deferred expense the early payment is accompanied by a related recognized expense in the subsequent accounting period, and the same amount is deducted from the prepayment. The deferred expense shares characteristics with accrued revenue (or accrued assets) with the difference that an asset to be covered later are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned and the related revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from accrued revenues.|$|E
5000|$|To {{determine}} liquidity, {{the current}} ratio is not as helpful as the quick ratio, because it includes all those assets {{that may not be}} easily liquidated, like <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> and inventory.|$|R
5000|$|Asset {{accounts}} [...] {{the different}} types of economic resources owned or controlled by an entity. Common examples of asset accounts are cash on hand, cash in bank, real estate, inventory, <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> goodwill, and accounts receivable.|$|R
50|$|During {{the years}} 1974 through 1979, taxpayers <b>prepaid</b> certain {{business}} <b>expenses</b> each December {{that were not}} due until February and March of the following year. Taxpayers used the Cash Method of accounting for Federal income tax purposes. Under that method, taxpayers deducted the <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> paid in December when they were paid, rather than in February or March when they would otherwise be due.|$|R
50|$|In accounting, {{a current}} asset is any asset which can {{reasonably}} {{be expected to}} be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year or operating cycle (whichever period is longer). Typical current assets include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments (marketable securities), accounts receivable, stock inventory, supplies, and the portion of prepaid liabilities, sometimes referred to as <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> which will be paid within a year.|$|R
5000|$|Deferred expense: cash {{has left}} the company, but the event has not {{actually}} occurred yet. <b>Prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> {{are the most common}} type. For instance, a company may purchase a year of insurance. After six months, only half of the insurance will have been 'used' with another six months of the insurance still owed to the company. Thus, the company records half of the payment as an outflow (an expense) and the other half as a receivable from the insurance company (an asset).|$|R
5000|$|Nonrefundable {{security}} deposits: Deferred by the lessor as unearned revenue; Capitalized by the lessee as a <b>prepaid</b> rent <b>expense</b> {{until the}} lessor considers the deposit earned.|$|R
50|$|If no cause-and-effect {{relationship}} exists (e.g., a sale is impossible), {{costs are}} recognized as expenses in the accounting period they expired: i.e., when have been used up or consumed (e.g., of spoiled, dated, or substandard goods, or not demanded services). <b>Prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> are not recognized as expenses, but as assets until one of the qualifying conditions is met resulting in a recognition as expenses. Lastly, if no connection with revenues can be established, costs are recognized immediately as expenses (e.g., general administrative and research and development costs).|$|R
50|$|For example, {{when the}} {{accounting}} periods are monthly, an 11/12 portion of an annually paid insurance cost {{is added to}} <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> which are decreased by 1/12 of the cost in each subsequent period when the same fraction is recognized as an expense, rather than all in the month in which such cost is billed. The not-yet-recognized portion of such costs remains as prepayments (assets) to prevent such cost from turning into a fictitious loss in the monthly period it is billed, and into a fictitious profit in any other monthly period.|$|R

50|$|Deferred charge (or deferral) is {{cost that}} is accounted-for in latter {{accounting}} period for its anticipated future benefit, or {{to comply with}} the requirement of matching costs with revenues. Deferred charges include costs of starting up, obtaining long-term debt, advertising campaigns, etc., and are carried as a non-current asset on the balance sheet pending amortization. Deferred charges often extend over five years or more and occur infrequently unlike <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> e.g. insurance, interest, rent. Financial ratios are based on the total assets excluding deferred charges since they have no physical substance (cash realization) and cannot be used in reducing total liabilities.|$|R

50|$|Deferred <b>expenses</b> (or <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> or prepayment) is an asset, such as cash {{paid out}} TO a {{counterpart}} for {{goods or services}} to be received in a latter accounting period when fulfilling the promise to pay is actually acknowledged, the related expense item is recognized, and the same amount is deducted from prepayments. It shares characteristics with accrued revenue (or accrued assets) with the difference that an asset to be covered latter are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned and the related revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from accrued revenues.|$|R
50|$|The {{going concern}} {{principle}} allows {{the company to}} defer some of its <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses</b> until future accounting periods. The going concern assumption is a fundamental assumption {{in the preparation of}} financial statements. Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, unless the going concern assumption is inappropriate in the circumstances of the entity, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets, discharge its liabilities, and obtain refinancing (if necessary) in the normal course of business.|$|R
50|$|The subledger, or {{subsidiary}} ledger, provides details behind {{entries in}} the general ledger used in accounting. The subledger shows detail {{for part of the}} accounting records such as property and equipment, <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> etc. The detail would include such items as date the item was purchased or expense incurred, a description of the item, the original balance, and the net book value. The total of the subledger would match the line item amount on the general ledger. This corresponding line item in the general ledger {{is referred to as the}} controlling account. The subsidiary ledger balance is compared with its controlling account balance as part of the process of preparing a trial balance.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} links between {{accounting}} values in Chinese listed companies’ balance sheets and the exposure of their fraudulent activities. Every balance sheet account is proposed to be a potential vehicle to manipulate financial statements. Other receivables, inventories, <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> employee benefits payables and long-term payables are important indicators of fraudulent financial statements. These results confirm that asset account manipulation is frequently carried out and cast doubt on earlier conclusions by researchers that inflation of liabilities {{is the most common}} source of financial statement manipulation. Prior practices of solely scaling balance sheet values by assets are revealed to produce spurious relationships, while scaling by both assets and sales effectively detects fraudulent financial statements and provides a useful fraud prediction tool for Chinese auditors, regulators and investors...|$|R

50|$|Taxpayers in the United States often seek to {{maximize}} their income and decrease their tax liability by prepaying deductible expenses and taking a deduction earlier {{rather than in a}} later tax year.

50|$|This {{presentation}} of net income is prohibited by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, arbiters of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) in the United States. In GAAP, marketing expenses may be accrued {{in some situations}} as <b>prepaid</b> <b>expenses,</b> but only amortized in special cases. Deferred acquisition costs are typically only allowed for amortizing the acquisition costs of customers in businesses like insurance, where the amortization occurs over the well-defined duration of a contract. ACSOI can be a useful internal metric for businesses to determine financial performance and to make strategic management decisions, if they believe their subscriber acquisition costs are an up-front cash outlay that truly builds long-term customer assets commensurate with that outlay. A main argument for not using this metric in GAAP accounting {{is that there is}} a key difference between subscribers and customers: customers make purchases and generate revenue for the business; it may be faulty to assume that all subscriber acquisition costs can be amortized as assets if only an unknown portion of the acquired subscribers will actually convert to customers.|$|R
