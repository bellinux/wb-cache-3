40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to improve the {{diagnostic}} applicability of genus- and serovar- (S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium) specific PCR systems in screening faecal and caecal samples of poultry, poultry feed and <b>poultrymeat</b> for Salmonella, by keeping the opportunity to obtain Salmonella cultures from positive samples. Peptone broth pre-enrichment cultures of the samples were tested by PCR. In faecal and caecal samples from broiler chicks a strong inhibitory action was frequently observed. This could be reduced markedly by the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) acting as amplification facilitator. The results of testing pre-enrichment cultures from artificially contaminated faecal, poultry feed and <b>poultrymeat</b> samples (using S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium and S. Hadar as contaminants) suggest that the sensitivity of the above systems is 101 - 102 CFU g- 1 sample. The testing of 95 caecal samples from slaughtered chicks resulted in 49...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} tasks, {{activities and}} achievements in 2014 of the Board of Experts in monitoring water content in <b>poultrymeat</b> following Commission Regulation (EC) No 543 / 2008, {{in particular the}} launch of a survey on methods of homogenisation of poultry carcases and parts used by the National Reference Laboratories, the revision of Commission Regulation (EC) No 543 / 2008 and the Special Expert Group Meeting in Uppsala, Sweden. As every year, the National Reference Laboratories are obliged to provide control data from each slaughterhouse. Similar to previous years, the control data received for 2013 are rather heterogeneous. This time a more detailed evaluation of all submitted data took place with focus on plausibility of the data. Where possible reported numbers were recalculated. Furthermore, the data were sorted and evaluated according to the applied chilling methods, types of poultry cuts {{as well as on}} over-the-limit cases and on imports from non-EU countries. JRC.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{identifying}} proteins important for host interaction and virulence, we have screened an expression library of NCTC 11168 Campylobacter jejuni genes for highly immunogenic proteins. A commercial C. jejuni open reading frame (ORF) library consisting of more than 1, 600 genes was transformed into the Escherichia coli expression strain BL 21 (DE 3), resulting in 2, 304 clones. This library was subsequently screened for immunogenic proteins using antibodies raised in rabbit against a clini-cal isolate of C. jejuni; this resulted in 52 highly reactive clones representing 25 different genes after sequencing. Selected candi-date genes were inactivated in C. jejuniNCTC 11168, and the virulence was examined using INT 407 epithelial cell line and mo-tility, biofilm, autoagglutination, and serum resistance assays. These investigations revealed C. jejuni antigen 0034 c (Cj 0034 c) to be a novel virulence factor and support {{the usefulness of the}} method. Further, several antigens were tested as vaccine candidates in twomouse models, in which Cj 0034 c, Cj 0404, and Cj 0525 c resulted in a reduction of invasion in spleen and liver after challenge. The food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic, spiral-shaped, and motile bacte-rium. It is {{the most common cause of}} food- and waterborne gas-troenteritis worldwide, causing approximately 500 million human infections every year (10, 28). Infection is often associated with consumption and handling of undercooked <b>poultrymeat,</b> but wa...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The present {{systems for}} cleaning the plastic crates (drawers) used to transport live poultry to the processing plant {{are known to}} be inadequate for removing microbial contamination. 2. To investigate possible improvements, a mobile experimental rig was constructed and operated in the lairage of a poultry processing plant. The cleaning rig could simulate the conditions of commercial cleaning systems and utilise freshly emptied crates from the processing plant. 3. The aim {{of the study was to}} improve cleaning by enhancing the removal of adherent organic material on the crates and by reducing microbial contamination by at least 4 log 10 units. 4. Trials showed that the most effective treatments against Campylobacter was either (a) the combination of soaking at 55 oC, brushing for 90 s, washing for 15 s at 60 oC, followed by the application of disinfectant (Virkon S in this study) or (b) the use of ultrasound (4 kW) at 65 oC for 3 â€“ 6 min, with or without mechanical brushing of crates. 5. Both of these treatments also achieved a 4 -log 10 reduction or more in the counts of Enterobacteriaceae but were less effective in reducing aerobic plate counts. 6. It was noted that here was little correlation between the visual assessment of crate cleanliness and microbiological counts. 7. It was concluded that the demonstrated enhanced cleaning could contribute significantly to overall hygiene control in <b>poultrymeat</b> production...|$|E
40|$|The Dutch {{poultry meat}} sector is {{competitive}} within Europe thanks to lower production costs at farm {{level and the}} efficient chain organisation. The production of poultry meat from broilers in the Netherlands has been increasing steadily over recent years. The majority of the supply from Dutch slaughterhouses originates from Dutch broiler farms, but the proportion supplied from farms outside the Netherlands is increasing and amounted to 16 % in 2011. More than half of Dutch <b>poultrymeat</b> is exported, with Germany, the United Kingdom and France forming the most important destinations. In these countries, the costs of keeping broilers for primary producers were {{higher than in the}} Netherlands in 2011. The production costs after slaughter in the Netherlands in 2011 were comparable to those in Germany, lower than those in France, the United Kingdom and Denmark, but higher than in Poland. Over the coming years, increasing competition is therefore expected from Poland. The Dutch product will have to distinguish itself within the market on the basis of more sustainable production with a higher level of animal welfare and food safety. In all European countries, primarily conventionally-reared broilers are kept on specialised farms. The production costs for the Netherlands are comparable with the neighbouring countries. Strengths for the Dutch poultry chain include the lower feed price and the good results within the primary sector and the efficient chain organisation of the slaughterhouses. Unfavourable aspects are the manure disposal costs and the high energy costs (energy taxes) ...|$|E
