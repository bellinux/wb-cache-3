5|$|In 1909, the City of Bridgeport {{created a}} special {{commission}} {{to oversee the}} construction of a bridge at Congress Street. A local engineer, Raymond F. Stoddard was hired as design consultant and obtained the license to use the Scherzer design. A Scherzer rolling-lift bridge with a double-leaf bascule was chosen for construction. The design is a Deck-type <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> bridge; using two plate girders to support the deck. The Scherzer bascule was a popular design because it avoided the expense of high-stress pivot bearings; though it requires stronger foundations to support the weight of the bridge's operation. The engineering firm, J. R. Worcester and Company designed and constructed the concrete-arch approach and Fort Pitt Bridge Works fabricated the movable bridge. The cost of construction was $300,000, which was offset through funding from the Connecticut Company. A contemporary account from the Hartford Courant gave stated the contract was for $305,000 to Snare, Tristo and Company. The bridge was opened to the public July 16, 1910.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{investigation}} of aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> subjected to shear force {{has been presented}} in this paper. The aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> were fabricated by welding three plates to form an I-section. A total of 118 numerical data are presented. A non-linear finite element model is developed and verified against experimental results. Geometric and material non-linearities {{were included in the}} finite element model. The welding of the aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> and the influence of the heat affected zone (HAZ) are also considered and carefully modeled. A sensitivity analysis on geometric imperfections of the aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> was performed. It was shown that the finite element model closely predicted the ultimate loads, web deformations and failure modes of aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> Hence, the model was used for an extensive parametric study of cross-section geometries, and the web slenderness value ranged from 49 to 393. The test results and the shear resistances predicted by the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths obtained using the European Code and American Specification for aluminum structures. Based on the experimental and numerical results, a design method for shear resistance of aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> is proposed in this study. The proposed design method is modified from the design rules in the EC 9 Code. It is shown that the proposed design strengths are generally conservative and reliable. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The overpasses along the road consisted of steel girder bridges and through <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> bridges. Unlike the other segments, the concrete arch bridge was not used for overpasses, although {{it was used to}} carry the turnpike over other roads. On August 7, 1950, the roadway opened between the Irwin and Pittsburgh interchanges. Ohio Governor Frank Lausche led a dedication ceremony on November 26, 1951. The extension opened to the Gateway toll plaza near the Ohio border on December 26, 1951. At the time, the highway ended in a cornfield. Traffic followed a temporary ramp onto local rural roads until the connecting Ohio Turnpike could be built. On December 1, 1954, the Ohio Turnpike opened.|$|E
5|$|Sprotbrough Bridge is {{actually}} two bridges that carry Mill Lane, the southern one crossing the weir stream {{and the northern}} one crossing the lock cut. Replacing a ferry crossing of the river, the first bridge and associated toll house were built in 1849 for Sir Joseph William Copley of Sprotbrough Hall. The designers of the southern bridge were Benjamin Brundell and William Arnold, and the present structure has three segmental arches on each side, which originally formed the approaches to a central arch. The arch was replaced by an above-deck truss in 1897. The ironwork was manufactured by Newton Chambers & Co. Ltd., who were based at Thorncliffe Ironworks in Sheffield, as recorded by plates attached to the bridge. The northern bridge was a single-arched masonry structure, which {{has been replaced by}} a <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> bridge resting on the original piers. The toll house, consisting of a single storey with a half basement, made of dressed sandstone with an asphalt roof, still survives on the northern bank of the lock cut. Tolls collected here for passage over Sprotbrough Bridge were said to have been given by the Copley family to the Doncaster Dispensary.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the prestressing technique to steel structures {{makes it possible to}} increase the load-carrying capacity as well as to extend the elastic region of existing steel bridge systems. The aim of this particular research is not only to develop a method of nonlinear analysis of prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> based on the incremental deformation method, but also to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the prestressing technique to the strengthening of existing steel bridges. The accuracy of the proposed analysis was verified by comparisons with test results on full scale prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> with various levels of prestressing, eccentricity of draped tendons, and differing tendon material properties. Using this method it was possible to predict the ultimate response and failure modes of the various prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> The performance of different types of prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> under static loading was analytically evaluated for the strengthening of existing steel bridge systems. Furthermore, a method of performance evaluation related to the load-carrying capacity and deflection control of the prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> with external tendons is proposed, based on consideration of the analytical results, with some optimum geometric and material parameters. Finally, the design concept of prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> with external tendons is discussed in relation to the construction of new bridges, and in the strengthening of existing bridges...|$|R
40|$|Steel <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> of {{bridges and}} {{industrial}} structures are usually subjected to dynamic fatigue loading. Their thin-slender webs under dynamic fatigue loading are laterally buckling and vibrating. The consequence of {{that can be}} arising and successive development of fatigue cracks along the welded connections of the thin webs with flanges and stiffeners. Therefore, the fatigue strength and life/time of thin-walled <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> depend beside of usual material-technological and structural influences also on stability aspects. Basic knowledge about fatigue failure mechanisms of thin-walled hybrid <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> is presented with the regard for their local stability, obtained and by theoretical an experimental analyses. The outcome of obtained results is that the fatigue consequences of thin webs vibration can be effectively reduced by appropriate reduction of their slenderness. Therefore, the empirical formula for the limitation of web slenderness has been proposed and recommended for <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> subjected to dynamic fatigue loading...|$|R
40|$|Tapered <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> often {{form part}} of {{large-scale}} structures such as long continuous bridges or industrial buildings where due to considerable loads the higher resistance is required. There are several important reasons choosing non-prismatic girders. First of all, their tapered shape with gradually changing inertia allows for more effective stress distribution inside the web-panel and contributes to steel reduction and thereby to decrease the overall cost of the structure. Trapezoidal shape of such panels also may be desirable in structures with non-standard shape for example where pre-formed service openings are needed. Although rectangular <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> were studied in many occasions in last few decades, the latest investigations {{have shown that the}} structural behaviour of tapered panels is more complex and different distribution of the internal forces takes place. Due to a lack of design rules for assessment of ultimate shear resistance of tapered plate structures with considerable angle of a slope (> 10 degrees), this research is focused on searching for a solution of the problem. The main body of the thesis is composed of four independent publications where each of them summarizes different phase of the research. The most relevant issues related to tapered panels discussed in the papers were: the critical shear load in tapered simple-supported plates, the influence of geometrical and structural imperfections, the optimal position of the longitudinal stiffener, the Resal effect, and finally the ultimate shear resistance of stiffened and unstiffened tapered <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> Nevertheless, the main objective of this work was the development of a reliable design tool to assess of the ultimate shear resistance of non-prismatic <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> The methodology applied in the research consists of the following stages: study of the bibliography and initial theoretical research, development of a numerical model, execution of two experimental programs, development of a wide parametric study, analysis of the experimental and numerical results, comparing them with those obtained according to EN 1993 - 1 - 5, and finally - development of a new design proposal for the assessment of the ultimate shear resistance for tapered steel <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> The PhD research was supported by two experimental programs focused on the structural behaviour of tapered <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> In the first program, transversally stiffened members subjected to shear and shear-bending interaction were tested. The second experimental program was focused on longitudinally stiffened tapered <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> under shear. Results obtained from the experimental tests were used for the verification of the numerical model. <b>Plate</b> <b>girders</b> reveal tendency to possess a significant post-buckling resistance. This phenomenon can be observed as a diagonal tension field developing within the web-panel. In both experimental tests and numerical analyses, this characteristic behaviour was observed. Using verified the numerical model, a wide parametric study for a large number of tapered <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> was carried out. All numerical results presented in this research were compared with those obtained according to EN 1993 - 1 - 5 and discussed. Finally, a new design method for the assessment of the ultimate shear resistance of tapered steel <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> was presented. The new design proposal is based on the currently valid - Rotated Stress Field Method. The procedure maintains its simplicity and improves considerably results obtained for non-prismatic panels.
