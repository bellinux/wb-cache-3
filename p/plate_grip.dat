40|$|BACKGROUND: Older {{adults with}} type 2 Diabetes Mellitus are at {{increased}} risk of falling. The current study aims to identify risk factors that mediate the relationship between diabetes and falls. METHODS: 199 older adults (104 with diabetes and 95 healthy controls) underwent a medical screening. Gait (GAITRite®), balance (AccuGait® force <b>plate),</b> <b>grip</b> strength (Jamar®), and cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination and Clock Drawing Test) were assessed. Falls were prospectively recorded during a 12 -month follow-up period using monthly calendars. RESULTS: Compared to controls, diabetes participants scored worse on all physical and cognitive measures. Sixty-four participants (42 diabetes vs. 22 controls) reported at least one injurious fall or two non-injurious falls ("fallers"). Univariate logistic regression identified diabetes as a risk factor for future falls (Odds Ratio 2. 25, 95 %CI 1. 21 - 4. 15, p =  0. 010). Stepwise multiple regressions defined diabetes and poor balance as independent risk factors for falling. Taking more medications, slower walking speed, shorter stride length and poor cognitive performance were mediators that reduced the Odds Ratio of the relationship between diabetes and faller status relationship the most followed by reduced grip strength and increased stride length variability. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is a major risk factor for falling, even after controlling for poor balance. Taking more medications, poorer walking performance and reduced cognitive functioning were mediators of the relationship between diabetes and falls. Tailored preventive programs including systematic medication reviews, specific balance exercises and cognitive training might be beneficial in reducing fall risk in older adults suffering from diabetes...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIn modern automated manufacturing systems, {{there is a need}} for work-holding devices that provide for precision, accuracy, reliability, flexibility and remoteness of control. One of such devices is the diaphragm chuck which utilizes the strain energy of its varying thickness diaphragm <b>plate</b> for <b>gripping</b> action. The jaw-carrying diaphragm plate is deflected by a thrust load, and the jaws are bored or ground to the nominal diameter of the workpiece. Gripping action occurs when the workpiece is inserted into the jaws and the thrust is relieved. Designers and manufacturers of diaphragm chucks have in the past been limited to the use of empirical data for diaphragm chuck design. This design limitation has been caused by complex problems due to factors such as the varying thickness encastre diaphragm <b>plate,</b> the <b>gripping</b> couples and the stiffening effects of the jaw slides. This work involved the establishment, by theory and experimental verification, of the design and performance parameters of a diaphragm chuck, and the provision of diaphragm chuck design methodology. The designer is therefore able to achieve the a priori design of the diaphragm chuck. In addition, the user is able to adapt existing diaphragm plates to achieve required gripping forces within existing constraints. The scope of this research is the static gripping action for any number of symmetric jaws. The design method is for diaphragm plates with small thickness taper, and carry detachable jaw slides. The concept of the equivalent constant thickness is applied to the diaphragm <b>plate.</b> <b>Gripping</b> action is divided into two major phases - the separate deflections of the diaphragm plate by a thrust load and symmetric couples. These deflections are equated to obtain the gripping force. This research concludes that the gripping force of a diaphragm chuck is closely predicted by the equivalent constant thickness method. Design data and methodology are provided for diaphragm chuck design. Thus, a designer can now design a diaphragm chuck based on a desired and pre-specified gripping force requirement...|$|R

When the hot plate test was conducted, borneol (in higher dose) produced an inhibition (P< 0. 05) of the nociceptive behavior. Such results were unlikely to be provoked by motor abnormality. Additionally, borneol-treated mice reduced the carrageenan-induced leukocytes migration to the peritoneal cavity. Together, our results suggest that borneol possess significant central and peripheral antinociceptive activity; it has also anti-inflammatory activity.

6000|$|If the Achaeans had {{thoroughly}} excellent bronze, and had iron {{as bad as}} that of the Celts {{a thousand}} years later, their preference for bronze over iron for weapons is explained. In Homer the fighters do not very often come to sword strokes; they fight mainly with the spear, except in pursuit, now and then. But when they do strike, they cleave heads and cut off arms. They could not do this with bronze rapiers, such as those with which men give point over the rim of the shield on two Mycenaean gems. But Mr. Myres writes, [...] "From the shaft graves (of Mycenae) onwards {{there are two types of}} swords in the Mycenaean world--one an exaggerated dagger riveted into the front end of the hilt, the other with a flat flanged tang running the whole length of the hilt, and covered on either face by ornamental <b>grip</b> <b>plates</b> riveted on. This sword, though still of bronze, can deal a very effective cut; and, as the Mycenaeans had no armour for body or head," [...] (?) [...] "the danger of breaking or bending the sword on a cuirass or helmet did not arise." [...] [Footnote: Classical Review, xvi. 72.] The danger did exist in Homer's time, as we have seen. But a bronze sword, published by Tsountas and Manatt (Mycenaean Age, p. 199, fig. 88), is emphatically meant to give both point and edge, having a solid handle--a continuation of the blade--and a very broad blade, coming to a very fine point. Even in Grave V. at Mycenae, we have a sword blade so massive at the top that it was certainly capable of a swashing blow. [Footnote: Schuchardt, Schliemann's Excavations, p. 265, fig. 269.] The sword of the charioteer on the stêlê of Grave V. is equally good for cut and thrust. A pleasanter cut and thrust bronze sword than the one found at Ialysus no gentleman could wish to handle. [Footnote: Furtwängler und Loeschke, Myk. Va. Taf. D.] Homer, in any case, says that his heroes used bronze swords, well adapted to strike. If his age had really good bronze, and iron as bad {{as that of the}} Celts of Polybius, a thousand years later, their preference of bronze over iron for weapons needs no explanation. If their iron was not so bad as that of the Celts, their military conservatism might retain bronze for weapons, while in civil life they often used iron for implements.|$|R

A szerzők áttekintik és értékelik az íjmarkolat részeként meghatározott tárgytípust, illetve Kárpát-medencei párhuzamait, bemutatva annak kelet-európai kapcsolatrendszerét is. 			 | 				Within the {{framework}} of the project of the Archaeological Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Genetics of the Szeged Biology Centre, titled “Archaeogenetics in the research on the ethnogenesis of the Hungarians”, a number of tenth-century cemeteries, incompletely investigated in the 20 th century, have been re-investigated. In September 2002, a new excavation was carried out by Péter Langó and Attila Türk at the site of “Derékegyházi oldal, Berényi B. 129. tanya földje” southeast of Szentes, in the Great Hungarian Plain, originally investigated by Gábor Csallány in 1940 (Fig. 1. 1 – 2). During the successful identification of the site four new 10 th-century graves were found, which complete the cemetery (Fig. 2. 1). The graves of eight buried individuals were oriented to west-northwest and were placed roughly in a row. Based on the grave-goods, the burials can be dated to the mid-third or second half of the 10 th century AD, which was confirmed by radiocarbon dating as well. In Grave 6 of the re-excavated cemetery of Szentes-Derekegyházi oldal, D- 3, a small, carved antler plate of unknown function was found (Fig. 11. 1 – 2). Due to the disturbance of the burial (Fig. 2. 2 – 3; Fig. 3. 1 – 3), the function of the object could not be established. Through the review and analysis of the analogies of the object in the Carpathian Basin (Table 1; Fig 10. 1; Fig. 12. 1 – 5), however, we can ascertain its role and function. Accordingly, small antler plates with trapezoid cross-section and grooving on three sides found in 10 th-century graves in the Carpathian Basin were placed on the grip of bows, between the two antler <b>plates</b> covering the <b>grip</b> (Fig. 11. 3 − 4). The small number of finds from the Carpathian Basin suggests that they did not {{play a significant role in}} the structure of the bow-grip. It is conceivable, however, that such plates were employed only on a special bow type, or that the antler plate was replaced by wooden ones on most bows. In the second half of the study the authors review the possible Avar Period antecedents in the Carpathian Basin, and the contemporary (9 th– 11 th century) and earlier (5 th– 8 th century) eastern formal analogies of the bow-grip plate of Szentes-Derekegyházi oldal. Since no direct connection can be assumed between the 10 th-century exemplars and the numerous Avar Period bow-grip plates of the Carpathian Basin due to fundamental differences, the origin of the 10 th– 11 th-century bow-grip plates of the Carpathian Basin must be sought in the archaeological material of Eastern Europe. These were used not only in the period covered by the exemplars of the Carpathian Basin (9 th– 11 th centuries), but in earlier centuries as well (Fig. 13). The best analogues can be found in the Sokolovskaya balka horizon of the Saltovo cultural-historical complex. We have to note that there is a significant difference between the quantity of these items in the Carpathian Basin and in Eastern Europe. One explanation might be that the bow manufacturers of the Carpathian Basin, who brought/inherited their skills from the East, left behind or used rarely this small element of bow manufacture. ...|$|R
