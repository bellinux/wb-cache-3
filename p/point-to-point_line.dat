40|$|Multi-ring {{architectures}} {{are widely}} used as the design approach for survivable optical core networks, particularly when the rings that can be constructed are not constrained by geographical distances between nodes in the network. This is because tra#c flows can be rapidly restored using ring protection mechanisms, and costs can be minimised using Add-Drop Multiplexers (ADMs) at the nodes for inserting and extracting optical signals from a ring. There are, however, situations where a network architecture based solely on rings is not cost-e#ective or even possible. Multi-ring architectures are not possible where geographical distances are too large for rings to be formed, so the design of such a network must resort to using <b>point-to-point</b> <b>line</b> systems. Also, these architectures may not be cost-e#ective in the situation where routing tra#c demands using shortest paths in the network results in asymmetric link loads within the network. In this paper we investigate the introduction of line systems into a network architecture to absorb tra#c load in particularly heavily-loaded corridors within the network. By using ADMs at intermediate nodes along the line system, {{we are able to}} extend the concept of <b>point-to-point</b> <b>line</b> systems to multi-hop line systems, in which optical signals can be added or dropped at these intermediate nodes. We present a tool for designing hybrid architectures, and demonstrate the reduction in cost that can be achieved by the use of hybrid network architectures...|$|E
40|$|It is {{cost-effective}} {{to construct}} a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) grid via interconnecting existing HVDCs. The grid protection and the interconnection between HVDCs are studied in the thesis. The future HVDC grid will be protected via the hybrid HVDC circuit breakers due to their high interrupting speed and low conduction losses. The hybrid DC circuit breakers have to be installed at each line end to fulfil the requirement of the grid protection. The overall cost of the breakers used in a HVDC grid will be extremely high as each breaker contains {{a large number of}} semiconductor switches. The research question in this part is how to reduce the cost of the hybrid DC circuit breakers. The novel interlink hybrid HVDC circuit breakers based on the concept of sharing main breaker branch will be proposed {{to reduce the size of}} the main breaker branch. An alternative method through coordination of converters and hybrid HVDC circuits breakers will be proposed to reduce the current rating of the breaker. Most of the commissioned HVDC projects are <b>point-to-point</b> <b>Line</b> Commutated Converter (LCC) HVDCs. The interconnection of LCC-HVDCs will achieve the benefits of the grid operation, such as highly efficient and flexible power transportation, and high security of power transportation. However, benefits of the interconnection are hindered by the disadvantages of the LCC-HVDC. The first one is that a LCC-HVDC has to reverse its voltage polarity in order to reverse its power. The second one is that a LCC-HVDC is at risk of the commutation failure, which will cause a DC fault when a commutation failure occurs. The research question in this part is how to achieve the interconnection of LCC-HVDCs with the benefits of the grid operation. Interconnection of LCC-HVDCs with the capability of power reversal and commutation failure mitigation will be studied, and the corresponding controls for the interconnection system will be proposes...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years EHF (Extremely High Frequency / 30 - 300 GHz) band is {{acquiring}} more and more interest in different fields, such as telecommunications, radar applications and Earth observation, due to advantageous characteristics. Actually, the higher operating frequency with respect to traditional ranges (Ka and lower) allows the achievement of some advantages: no crowding in frequency and hence reduced interference, large bandwidth availability, reduced antenna and electronic components size, and more security in point-to-point links due to smaller beamwidth. Moreover, the increase of frequencies allows the realization of, with respect to lower bands, high resolution applications, as radar images and Earth Observation sensors. However, although W band is an attractive range, it is yet an experimental frontier since no telecommunication mission {{has been carried out}} and the technology development at this frequency is still poor, costly and relatively not ready. However, some specific applications, such as radar and radio-astronomy, and just for some frequencies (typically around 94 - 96 GHz), make an exception. Considering this context, a very significant and preliminary step to useful W band exploitation for terrestrial and satellite telecommunications is represented by the analysis and the validation of a terrestrial link operating at these frequencies with the capability of carrying out transmission/reception experiments. In this frame, the University of Rome, "Tor Vergata" in collaboration with the company Rheinmetall Italy is carrying out an experiment based on the establishment of a W band point-to-point terrestrial link over a distance of some kilometers between the University of Rome "Tor Vergata" (Rome) and Villa Mondragone (Frascati, near Rome). The work aims at showing an overview of the preliminary design of the experimental W band terrestrial air link. It will be very useful mainly for two reasons: firstly, in order to provide a test-bed for evaluating at- - mospheric effects (fading and scintillation, along with amplitude, phase, and polarization distortion) that could compromise the performance of satellite-to-ground communications systems operating at these frequencies; and secondly to verify performance of W band critical technology. The last part of the work investigates the possibility of using, in addition to the traditional approach, Impulse Radio Ultra Wide-Band (IR-UWB) technology for realizing very high bit-rate <b>point-to-point</b> <b>Line</b> Of Sight (LOS) last mile links beyond 60 GHz. This paper will firstly provide a preliminary orographic and propagation analysis of the terrestrial link. Then, a detailed insight into link architecture and transmitter/receiver schemes will be reported taking into account constraints related to the characteristic of the available HardWare (H/W) in Rheinmetall Italy. Finally, an accurate link budget for dimensioning the system in terms of maximum link capability will be reported...|$|E

This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol Standards " for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. 2. Historical Perspective Two basic algorithms are ambient in the industry for Bridging of Local Area Networks. The more common algorithm is called "Transparent Bridging " and has been standardized for Extended LAN configurations by IEEE 802. 1. IEEE 802. 5 has proposed an alternative approach, called "Source Routing", and is in the process of standardizing that approach for IEEE 802. 5 extended networks. Although there is a subcommittee of IEEE 802. 1 addressing remote bridging, neither standard directly defines Remote Bridging per se, as that would technically be beyond the IEEE 802 committee’s charter. Both allow for it, however, modeling the line as an unspecified interface between half-bridges. This document assumes that the devices at either end of a serial link- have agreed to utilize the RFC 1171 line discipline in some form. - may have agreed, by some other means, to exchange other protocols on the line interspersed with each other and with any bridged PDUs. - may be willing to use the link as a vehicle for Remote Bridging. - may have multiple point-to-point links that are configured in parallel to simulate a single line of higher speed o...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: HDLC {{controller}} megacell is a {{high performance}} module for the bit oriented, switched, non-switched packet transmission module. The controller fulfills the specifications according to ITU q. 921, X. 25 level 2 recommendations. It supports half duplex and full duplex communication <b>lines,</b> <b>point-to-point</b> and multipoint channels. Furthermore, the controller is designed to permit synchronous, code transparent data transmission. The control information is always {{in the same position}} and specific bit patterns used for control differ dramatically from those representing data that reduces the chances of errors. The data stream and transmission rate is controlled by the network node. In this paper, we have designed, simulated and implemented HDLC controller. This design is coded in a hardware description language (VHDL). The function of coded design is to simulate on simulation software (e. g. modelsim). After simulation, the design is synthesized and translated into a structural architecture, in terms of the components on the target FPGA device (Spartan 3) and perform the post-translate simulation in order to ensure the proper functioning of the design after translation. After the successful simulation of the post-translate model, the design is mapped to the existing slices of the FPGA and the post-map model simulated.

Brubaker, Jr. 1 'l HE TREND TODAY in computer systems is l- clearly towards distributing the computing power instead of concentrating it in one large central computer. Examples of this trend are the growing number of networks of'small computers and the increasing variety of intelligent computer peripherals and instruments. Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a typical measurement and control system based on the 224 OA Measurement and Control Processor. Analog and digital interfaces plug into the 2240 A to interface to various sensors, switches, controls, and actuators (see Fig, 2). The processor's communication link to the computer is the Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus, or HP-IB, Hewlett-Packard's implementation of IEEE standard 488 - 1975 (ANSI standard MC 1. 1). Careful design of message protocol and data formats makes the 224 OA compatible with virtually any computer, calculator, or intelligent terminal that supports the HP-IB. Using standard HP-IB cables, the 224 OA can be located up to 20 metres (65 feet) from the computer or other controller. For remote applications, the HP-IB can be brought to the 224 oA by any of a variety of multidrop, <b>point-to-point,</b> or telephone <b>line</b> interfaces.
