The letter was apparently a response to a report on the phenomenon of vaginismus reported three weeks previously in the Philadelphia Medical News by Osler’s colleague Theophilus Parvin. Davis, a prolific writer of letters to medical societies, purported to be a retired U.S. Army surgeon living in Caughnawaga, Quebec (now Kahnawake), author of a controversial paper on the obstetrical habits of Native American tribes that was suppressed and unpublished. Osler would enhance Davis's myth by signing Davis's name to hotel registers and medical conference attendance lists; Davis was eventually reported drowned in the Lachine Rapids in 1884.|$|E
50|$|<b>Penis</b> <b>captivus</b> {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} in intercourse when the muscles in the vagina clamp down on the penis much more firmly than usual (a form of vaginismus), {{making it impossible for}} the penis to withdraw from the vagina. According to a 1979 article in the British Medical Journal, this condition was unknown in the twentieth century, but a subsequent letter to the same journal reported an apparent case of <b>penis</b> <b>captivus</b> in 1947. <b>Penis</b> <b>captivus</b> {{should not be confused with}} vaginismus, though a relation between the supposed event of <b>penis</b> <b>captivus</b> and the occurrence of vaginismus is assumed in the existing descriptions.|$|E

5000|$|One {{narrative}} follows Miss Monde 1984/Miss Canada, {{who wins}} a contest of the [...] "most virgin"; her prize is the {{marriage to a}} milk industry tycoon. However, following his degrading puritanical introduction to intercourse, she vents her intention to leave to her mother-in-law who, at that point, nearly has her killed. The family bodyguard takes her away, further humiliates her, and finally packs her in a trunk bound for Paris. She finds herself on the Eiffel Tower, where she absently meets and has intercourse with a Latin singer, El Macho. The sexual act is interrupted by touring nuns who frighten the lovers into <b>penis</b> <b>captivus.</b> In her post-coital shocked state, she is adopted into an artist community led by Otto Muehl, where she finds affectionate care. The commune practices some liberating sessions, where a member, {{with the assistance of}} the others, goes through a (re)birth experience, cries, urinates and defecates like a baby, while the others are cleaning and pampering him. Later she is seen acting for an obscene advertisement, in which she is naked, covered in liquid chocolate.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the British Medical Journal in 1979, Dr F. Kräupl Taylor reviewed the literature on <b>penis</b> <b>captivus</b> and concluded that while [...] "almost all the cases mentioned in medical publications and in textbooks are based on hearsay and rumour", two papers published by nineteenth-century German gynaecologists - Scanzoni (1870) and Hildebrandt (1872) - who had personally dealt with cases of the condition [...] "leave no doubt about the reality of this unusual symptom", which, however, [...] "is so rare that it is often regarded nowadays as no more than a prurient myth". Scanzoni's patient was [...] "a completely healthy young woman, married for six months". She and her husband had to abstain from sexual intercourse because her intense vaginal contractions were [...] "most painful to him and ... did on several occasions end in a spasm ... which sometimes lasted more than ten minutes and made it impossible for the couple to separate". Hildebrandt's patient had been married for about a year. Sexual intercourse with her husband had always been painless until one particular evening. Hildebrandt gives the husband's account of what happened: ...|$|E
