40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the <b>PowerTools</b> data presentation toolset and its application. <b>PowerTools</b> {{is the name}} given {{to a set of}} diverse data presentation systems, integrated under the Common Tool Control (CTC) program. At present, the system is made up of two visualisation tools (Maritxu and The Cave) and a sonification tool (SRT, Sonic Representation Tool). The system was originally developed to aid the understanding and optimisation of parallel computer systems. It is now being applied to problems in which quantity, variation and complexity of data is problematic (e. g Control and Stock Markets). The visualisation tools have been designed to deal with large quantities of complex multivariate dynamic data. They exploit pre-attentive vision's ability to discriminate the data sub-sets that require attentive analysis. Maritxu is highly scalable and has been designed for data set comparison; The Cave portrays data evolution through time. SRT generates a sound track driven by the i [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a report}} for a Master Thesis project in Mobile Informatics carried out at Volvo Cars Costumer Service in Gothenburg, Sweden. This master thesis project explore the use of Internet {{technologies}} within the research areas Mobile Informatics and Telematics. The project was carried out {{as a part of}} an ongoing project, Volvo Aftersales and Diagnostics Information System Next Generation (VADIS NG) at Volvo Cars Costumer Service (VCCS). The project and the research within were defined by Volvo Cars as follows: Develop a vehicle communication system using existing vehicle communication interface. The system shall be based on such architectural principals {{so that it can be}} deployed in various infrastructure scenarios predefined for the new version of VADIS/VADIS 2004. The outline of this master thesis project was set by VADIS NG, which is an ongoing project at Volvo for developing a new version of the existing workshop tool system, VADIS. To meet the requirements defined, a layered, system architecture was presented. The system introduced the use of. NET based web services and rich applications, <b>PowerTools,</b> developed in Macromedia FLASH and new XML-based Scripts, PowerScript for definition and control of the <b>PowerTools</b> applications. This layered architecture allows the system to be configured differently based on user mobility, user preferences and user task. A functional prototype was developed for demonstration of the system. The application was developed in Macromedia FLASH using. NET web services developed in C#. The prototype demonstrated simple diagnostic s sessions using <b>PowerTools</b> for monitoring and controlling various features and functions in the vehicle, for example monitoring the vehicle engine speed and running condition or turning on the headlights. The technical and architectural principals presented within the project would be the same as principals used for a Telematics system. Hence a future implementation of such services for third party service suppliers can be based on the same ideas. The system and the prototype were evaluated at a reference group meeting. The mobile aspects of the system architecture were demonstrated by remotely controlling the vehicle. The results reached by this Master Thesis Project will hopefully help the development of the Vehicle Communication parts of VADIS 2004 and function as a technical reference base for future implementation and deployment of the system in various infrastructure scenario...|$|R

40|$|The {{microgrid}} {{system has}} been identified as a potential field of research that determines the future electrical distribution network due to its capability of increasing the system reliability and maintaining the stability at the distribution network. This purpose of this project is to investigate the microgrid dynamics behavior when subject to small change in the network state due to disturbances during grid-connected and the transition from grid-connected to islanding process. The network activities which discussed and presented in this report based on five (5) case studies, namely base case scenario, motor starting study, load trip study, generator trip study and islanding process. Electrical parameters include frequency, voltage, active power, reactive power are observed by simulating the microgrid system modeling using the SKM <b>Powertools</b> for Windows v 6. 5 software. The result of the study will contribute {{in the development of the}} best control strategies for the mirosources/generators that provide adequate stability margins during the various operating conditions and system dynamics. In future, further study should be carry out to include other microsources such as photovoltaic, microturbine, energy storage with different modes of microgrid operations and to explore and improve the control system response that is related to invertercontrolled sources. The future study should also include the impact of large signal disturbances due to fault and should be able to validate the dynamics behavior on existing installation...|$|R
