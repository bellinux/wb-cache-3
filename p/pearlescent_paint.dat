5000|$|<b>Pearlescent</b> <b>Paints</b> contain special {{iridescent}} pigments {{commonly referred}} to as [...] "pearls". Pearl pigments impart a colored sparkle to the finish which works to create depth of color. <b>Pearlescent</b> <b>paints</b> can be two stage in nature (pearl base color + clear) or 3 stage in nature (basecoat + pearl mid-coat + clear-coat).|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new approach}} to modelling <b>pearlescent</b> <b>paints</b> based on decomposing paint layers into stacks of imaginary thin sublayers. The sublayers are chosen so thin that multiple scattering can be considered across different sublayers, while it can be neglected within each of the sublayers. Based on this assumption, an efficient recursive procedure of assembling the layers is developed, which enables to compute the paint BRDF at interactive speeds. Since the proposed paint model connects fundamental optical properties of multi-layer <b>pearlescent</b> and metallic <b>paints</b> with their microscopic structure, interactive prediction of the paint appearance based on its composition becomes possible...|$|R

40|$|Industry {{standard}} {{methods for}} measuring appearance {{are applied to}} realistic image synthesis. Two appearance attributes, gloss and haze, {{are known to be}} determined by the shape of the specular reflection lobe. Standards which specify the measurement of these two geometric appearance attributes are used to select BRDF model parameters for a number of computer graphics reflection models. The bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of metallic and <b>pearlescent</b> <b>paints</b> can be characterized with only a few industry standard specular measurements. Using these measurements, a new computer graphics BRDF model is developed. The Beard-Maxwell BRDF model, which utilizes a systematic measurement pro-tocol to determine appropriate model parameter values, is presented. An associated database containing parameters for hundreds of measured surfaces, is overviewed. Also, a new method of Monte Carlo importance sampling is described which allows impor-tance sampling of arbitrary BRDFs...|$|R

50|$|Wet-ground mica, which {{retains the}} brilliancy of its {{cleavage}} faces, is used primarily in <b>pearlescent</b> <b>paints</b> by the automotive industry. Many metallic-looking pigments {{are composed of}} a substrate of mica coated with another mineral, usually titanium dioxide (TiO2). The resultant pigment produces a reflective color depending on {{the thickness of the}} coating. These products are used to produce automobile paint, shimmery plastic containers, high quality inks used in advertising and security applications. In the cosmetics industry, its reflective and refractive properties make mica an important ingredient in blushes, eye liner, eye shadow, foundation, hair and body glitter, lipstick, lip gloss, mascara, moisturizing lotions, and nail polish. Some brands of toothpaste include powdered white mica. This acts as a mild abrasive to aid polishing of the tooth surface, and also adds a cosmetically pleasing, glittery shimmer to the paste. Mica is added to latex balloons to provide a colored shiny surface.|$|R

5000|$|Typically, a pimpmobile {{conversion}} {{includes such}} items as round headlight covers (commonly known as [...] "Superfly" [...] headlights), grille caps, a 1941 [...] "goddess"-style hood ornament, [...] "lake pipes", thick padded vinyl tops, wide whitewall tires (nicknamed [...] "Gangsta Walls"), chrome hubcaps with spokes, custom-designed, high-end stereo systems, and shag or velour interiors. The dashboard area might be enhanced with aftermarket steering wheels or tachometers mounted {{on top of the}} dash. Custom paint jobs were common, often in non-traditional or garish colors like purple or orange, with special touches such as using two colors of paint (for the upper and lower parts of the body), metal flake or <b>pearlescent</b> <b>paint,</b> or pinstriping. Some car owners also added custom murals or airbrushed images on the hood. The most status-obsessed customizers even added small crystal chandeliers for interior lighting and small 12 volt-powered colour TVs, VCRs, bar-size refrigerators, and, in a few rare cases, in which former hearses were converted into pimpmobiles, a small bed in the backseat area.Customizing shops included Dunham Coach in Boonton, New Jersey; Wisco, Harper and Universal in Detroit; and E&G in Baltimore. While individuals could add some of the simpler [...] "dress up" [...] options themselves or have them added by a local mechanic, these specialized shops handled more expensive, complicated modifications, such as extending the fenders or hood, converting a four-door sedan into a two-door car, and having bumpers or other parts re-chrome plated. In Southern California, custom hydraulic suspensions (as usual with lowriders) were also popular. While many pimpmobile modifications are done with the goal of [...] "dressing up" [...] the appearance, some people also do engine modifications to increase engine performance, such as overboring cylinders or adding aftermarket intake manifolds, carburetors, or dual exhaust systems with [...] "cherry bomb"-style mufflers.|$|E
40|$|An {{interesting}} {{class of}} materials are metallic and pearlescent paints. They pose serious challenges to computer graphics {{since they have}} high frequencies in both angular and spatial domain, have a complex, pure stochastic spatial structure and angular dependent color shifts. Hybrid approaches that combine model and image-based representations have proven to faithfully reproduce metallic and <b>pearlescent</b> <b>paint</b> by compressing measured data. But until now the compression of the image based part is done with PCA based methods resulting in high amounts of data. One additional problem is the angular sampling of the measured data. Typical angular sampling densities of image based reflectance acquisition devices are very low compared to the solid angle, in which a metallic flake is visible, resulting in severe undersampling of the angular frequencies. We propose a simple method to measure these frequencies generated by the metallic flakes. Furthermore, we present a novel representation for metallic and <b>pearlescent</b> <b>paint</b> that allows resampling in angular domain corresponding to the flake properties and compression of measured image based paint data for high-quality paint rendering. ...|$|E

5000|$|Metallic paints contain {{aluminium}} flakes {{to create}} a sparkling and grainy effect, generally {{referred to as a}} metallic look. This paint is harder to manage than solid paints because of the extra dimensions to consider. Metallic and <b>pearlescent</b> <b>paints</b> must be applied evenly to ensure a consistent looking finish without light and dark spots which are often called [...] "mottling". Metallic basecoats are formulated so that the aluminium flake is parallel to the substrate. This maximises the [...] "flop". This is the difference in the brightness between looking perpendicularly at the paint and that at an acute angle. The [...] "flop" [...] is maximised if the basecoat increases in viscosity shortly after application so that the aluminium flake which is in a random orientation after spraying is locked into this position while there is still much solvent (or water) in the coating. Subsequent evaporation of the solvent (or water), leads to a reduction in the film thickness of the drying coating, causing the aluminium flake to be dragged into an orientation parallel to the substrate. This orientation then needs to be unaffected by the application of the clear coat solvents. The formulation of the clear coat needs to be carefully chosen so that it will not [...] "re-dissolve" [...] the basecoat and thus affect the orientation of the metallic flake but will still exhibit enough adhesion between the coatings so as to avoid delamination of the clear coat. A similar mode of action occurs with pearlescent pigmented basecoats.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1990s, in {{response}} to the changes in communications and media caused by the digital revolution, Halley adapted his visual language to the effects of the digital revolution in the 1990s. [...] The “conduits” that marked his painting began to multiply and increase in complexity, and he began to add <b>pearlescent</b> and metallic <b>paints</b> to his Day-Glo color palette of the 1980s. “My earlier paintings were rational, diagrammatic, and logical,” he said in a 1995 interview with Flash Art, explaining the difference between his ’80s and subsequent outputs. “Then I made a break around 1990, and since then they’ve become really exaggerated, almost parodic; and they aren’t analytical at all. In any case, I don’t see a great formal break in the ’90s, although there is a psychological break.” Around 1990 Halley began producing bas-reliefs, many of them hollow and constructed from fiberglass. Soon after, he began experimenting with digital printing and web-based art.|$|R
