5|$|At first, {{there was}} only one {{political}} party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The <b>party</b> <b>was,</b> however, broken into three divisions that would later split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly over the issue of slavery, but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was dominant in the beginning. The Noble <b>party</b> <b>was</b> in favor of slavery, and the Hendricks <b>party</b> <b>was</b> generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried to impeach Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's. After two months of debate in the House, and Jennings having destroyed the evidence of his role, the House of Representatives dropped the investigation and issued a resolution that confirmed Jennings in his position as governor.|$|E

5|$|It {{was in this}} {{environment}} that the ideology of Ba'athism came into being.

Akram al-Hawrani founded the Arab Socialist Party (ASP) in 1953 – the Ba'ath <b>Party</b> <b>was</b> established through a merger of the ASP and the Arab Ba'ath Party.

Party leaders then opted to overlook democratic norms and procedures.|$|E
