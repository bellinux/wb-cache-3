Our scheme provides scalability because it significantly reduces the number of feedbacks sent by the receiver nodes. In addition, it provides fast recovery of transmission errors since the packets requested from the receiver nodes are almost always available in their buffers. Our scheme also reduces the number of additional retransmissions from the original sender node or upstream repair nodes.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} reliable multicast in computer networks {{relies on the}} retransmission on demand of lost packets. Existing multicast protocols adopt a static <b>packet</b> <b>retransmission</b> scheme (unicast or multicast) to retransmit these packets, often leading to performance loss due to wasting bandwidth resources.

3000|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} energy, {{the number of}} <b>packet</b> <b>retransmissions</b> in the network should be kept as low as possible. High packet-loss probability is undesirable, since it can potentially cause {{a high number of}} <b>packet</b> <b>retransmissions.</b> Another important factor in preserving energy is the duty cycle of individual nodes. For instance, recent work on energy consumption in WSNs has shown that most wireless sensor devices consume almost as much energy when listening to the wireless channel, or even being in idle mode, as they do when actively transmitting a packet [1, Chapter 2]. From this perspective, a synchronized time slotted medium access (MAC) scheme (TDMA) where nodes can sleep for extended periods of time seems preferable both from interference and duty-cycle points of view. However, interference will still be present if two or more networks, or [...] "clusters'' of nodes, are colocated in close vicinity of each other.|$|R

TCP-NCL-SRDT employs a spurious retransmission detection timer, and is designed to reduce congestion control spuriously activated by packet reordering or random packet loss. TCP-NCL-RTT-Update is responsible for maintaining an accurate updated record of RTT throughout a TCP session.
