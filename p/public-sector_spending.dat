40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the association between changes in unemployment, healthcare spending and stomach cancer mortality. METHODS: Multivariate regression {{analysis was used to}} assess how changes in unemployment and public-sector expenditure on healthcare (PSEH) varied with stomach cancer mortality in 25 member states of the European Union from 1981 to 2009. Country-specific differences in healthcare infrastructure and demographics were controlled for 1 - to 5 -year time-lag analyses and robustness checks were carried out. RESULTS: A 1 % increase in unemployment was associated with a significant increase in stomach cancer mortality in both men and women [men: coefficient (R) = 0. 1080, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 0470 - 0. 1690, P= 0. 0006; women: R= 0. 0488, 95 % CI= 0. 0168 - 0. 0809, P= 0. 0029]. A 1 % increase in PSEH was associated with a significant decrease in stomach cancer mortality (men: R=- 0. 0009, 95 % CI=- 0. 0013 to - 0. 005, P< 0. 0001; women: R=- 0. 0004, 95 % CI=- 0. 0007 to - 0. 0001, P= 0. 0054). The associations remained when economic factors, urbanization, nutrition and alcohol intake were controlled for, but not when healthcare resources were controlled for. Time-lag analysis showed that the largest changes in mortality occurred 3 - 4 years after any changes in either unemployment or PSEH. CONCLUSION: Increases in unemployment are associated with a significant increase in stomach cancer mortality. Stomach cancer mortality is also affected by <b>public-sector</b> healthcare <b>spending.</b> Initiatives that bolster employment and maintain public-sector healthcare expenditure may help to minimize increases in stomach cancer mortality during economic downturns...|$|R
40|$|Background: Rheumatic {{heart disease}} (RHD) is a {{neglected}} disease of poverty {{that is the}} most common paediatric cardiovascular condition in developing countries. Most RHD deaths occur in children and working-age adults, in whom the economic impact of premature death is high. Despite RHD being a preventable disease, global research and development funding for RHD was recently estimated at US$ 1 · 7 million, or about 0 · 1 % of all global health funding. Decisions to scale up costly medical and surgical interventions for RHD are hindered, in part, by lack of evidence for the so-called return on investment that could be achieved through prevention of RHD-related mortality. We conducted a modelling study using data from 107 countries to estimate the economic impact of excess mortality from RHD. Methods: We used the full income approach to quantify the economic losses from RHD in 107 countries where the disease is endemic during 2010. Our analysis synthesised data from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study, WHO life tables, UN population estimates, and World Bank macroeconomic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita that are used in full-income calculations. We used the RHD mortality pattern in Costa Rica in 2010 as a baseline from which to define excess mortality. Data from this country were used because of Costa Rica's demonstrated success in controlling RHD in previous decades as well as its health system's resilience under political and economic constraints. We reported costs discounted at 3 % yearly as well as undiscounted. Findings: We noted that the cost of the approximately 222   000 excess deaths from RHD in 2010 was around US$ (2014) 2 · 2 trillion (discounted) or US$ 5 · 4 trillion (undiscounted). Most of the economic burden of RHD was in countries with large populations in south Asia and east Asia. Our estimates were roughly proportional to those reported in a full-income study of HIV/AIDS mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, although our estimates were 10 – 100 times higher than those obtained using other economic methods, such as multiples of GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life-year. Interpretation: RHD continues to exert massive economic effects globally, mainly because of premature death in children and working-age adults. The economic cost of RHD in developing countries is over a million times higher than current donor funding levels. Our estimates suggest that careful increases in <b>public-sector</b> and private-sector <b>spending</b> on effective RHD prevention and control measures could provide impressive returns on investment. Future work will compare the full-income results to other economic evaluation methods such as those recommended by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health.

40|$|Extension {{services}} established {{since independence}} have generally failed {{to live up}} to expectations. Increases in agricultural production in ACP countries have been achieved largely through the expansion of the cultivated land area and increased stock numbers rather than inherent increases in productivity. With a declining resource base, increases of this kind are clearly not sustainable. Alternative approaches to providing meaningful advice to farmers must be explored, if more efficient and productive farming systems are to be developed. One approach is to foster partnerships between NGOs and government services. The public sector must take the initiative. If food production in the developing world is to keep pace with population growth, more efficient farming practices must be introduced. These new practices should not be introduced at the expense of the environment or the resource base, but must be based on persuading conservative, risk-avoiding, resource-poor farmers to become more innovative. This must be achieved within a framework of fluctuating commodity prices, erratic policy making and increasing financial constraints. Functional, efficient and cost-effective advisory and distribution services to farmers are a major prerequisite to achieving longer-term sustainable food production. The post-independence period saw major investments in institutional strengthening, including the establishment of extension services, which were primarily crop orientated, and technical training. Agricultural extension was generally conceived as a 'good thing' that should be provided as a matter of course. Large and complex organizations evolved, often initiated with donor support, whose demands eventually exceeded the resources that the local economy could provide. Sadly, it is now all too common to find government services crippled through lack of resources; most recurrent funding may be committed to staff salaries alone. Yet without allowances, fuel, transport and equipment these staff remain office-bound and unable to fulfill any meaningful function. Various extension models have evolved and it is usual to find more than one model being used within a country. Most common are the multi-functional, broad-based services provided by ministries of agriculture. These are large hierarchical institutions with resident, village-based extension agents who cover all crops, and often livestock as well, and who are supported by subject-matter specialists at district and provincial levels. Field staff often have different and sometimes contradictory roles, including regulatory control and data collection in addition to general extension. In many countries, specific integrated development projects, usually financed through international loans, have developed parallel extension services, the numerous state Integrated Agricultural Development Projects (IAPDs) in Nigeria being an example. More specialized, commodity-based advisory services are commonly found throughout the ACP countries. Traditionally they focus on cash crops, usually for export, such as tea, coffee and tobacco and also on meat products. Such services usually operate outside the civil service regulations as independent, self-supporting legal entities. They can usually afford to offer better terms of service than government departments and are thus able to attract better-qualified staff. A degree of vertical integration is also common, with the provision of a range of specific activities including adaptive research, credit and input supply, advice and marketing. Examples of such organizations include Kenya's Tea Development Authority and the Compagnie Fran 7 aise pour le D 9 veloppement des Fibres Textiles (CFDT) in West Africa. Many of these commodity-based parastatals take an active marketing role and are less involved with extension aspects; for example, the Grain Marketing and Dairy Marketing Boards in Zimbabwe. However, with a few notable exceptions, the achievements of parastatals have not been good. Poor management, political interference and the drop in commodity prices have been partly responsible for their demise. Most African parastatals are now insolvent and largely ineffective. Where the markets exist, both national and multi-national companies compete to supply fertilizers and agro-chemicals, or to buy primary produce. Either to increase their market share or to improve the quality of the product, private sector companies often provide a comprehensive and valuable advisory service to their clients. Some of the more effective cooperatives provide similar advisory services paid for by their members. The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) in Zimbabwe offers a highly effective service to its members including input supply, research, advice and marketing. These commercial cooperatives should not be confused with the numerous producer cooperatives that have largely failed in Africa. There is now increasing interest in privatizing, initially through introducing cost-recovery mechanisms, and a wide range of services to the smallholder sector, notably veterinary services. The United States' model, where universities link not only research and teaching but also provide an advisory service, is not generally found in ACP countries. Instead, most of these countries are well endow' with training institutions at all levels: universities, technical institutes and training centers. In many ways the investment in these institutions, again usually provide through donor support, has outstripped the local capacity to use them. In francophone countries the ministries agriculture have a more strategic role while fewer implementation responsibilities, a devolved to specialized agencies. Agricultural extension is often incorporated into community development programmes which may include credit provision, cooperative development and literacy campaigns, such as the animation rurale programmes in Senegal. Benefits that never materialized Given the investment that has gone into the provision of extension services, why ha the benefits not been more tangible? In attempt to overcome the economic crisis facing many ACP countries, 'structural adjustment' programmes have been introduced. Central to such policies is the perceived wisdom that <b>public-sector</b> <b>spend</b> must be reduced, currency rates reassessed and exports expanded, with cost-recovery or privatization being more appropriate than government subsidized services. The result is the now all-too-familiar picture of government services severely constrained by the lack of resources, extremely low staff morale and a virtual cessation of field activities. Many of the 'technical packages' that were to have transformed agricultural production have performed so poorly that benefits rarely materialized - the African 'Green Revolution' has never occurred. Dependence on irrigation and high levels of inputs, which were the prerequisites of increased production in Asia, combined with the poorer soils of Africa, meant that the transfer of 'Green Revolution' technology has not been appropriate for African conditions. Local crop varieties often perform as well as, or better than, many of the 'improved' varieties under local conditions both in terms of yield and socio-cultural acceptance. The classic example was the introduction of softer yellow maize, which is easier to mill than local white 'flint' varieties. Alas the uptake of the new varieties was poor since, unlike the yellow varieties, the hardness of local varieties enabled them to withstand weevil attack during storage. Furthermore, many of the new lines were hybrid varieties requiring new seed every season and a high level of inputs. The introduction of swamp rice in Sierra Leone using improved varieties had the potential to greatly increase yields. What was not taken into account was that such practices require a high initial labour input, for a product that is less acceptable to the local market and where producers face working in difficult conditions in the swamps, with greater exposure to disease. The introduction of exotic breeds of animals has long been a favorite of agricultural planners, despite the fact that in the majority of cases indigenous breeds, which have evolved and adapted to local conditions, outperform them. A farming systems approach Clearly orthodox extension approaches have largely failed to address the major problems facing resource-poor, risk avoiding peasant farmers. Historically, planners have failed to appreciate the wider context of food production in developing countries. Support services, research and extension have predominantly taken a paternalistic 'top down' approach to development - the last person to be consulted being the farmer! Under the existing constraints (social, economic and financial) facing smallholder production, it is often difficult to improve significantly on existing practices. This would indicate that technology transfer alone will not be the solution. Recognizing these problems has lead to greater interest in the 'farming systems' approach to agricultural development. Farming systems research (FSR) assumes a holistic view of the 'farm' and that to adequately address problems requires a multi-disciplinary approach, in particular the inclusion of the social sciences. An initial descriptive and diagnostic phase, usually undertaken through rapid rural appraisals (RRAs), leads consecutively into the design and field testing of appropriate interventions. The key is that farmers are involved at all stages, and only those interventions that work under village conditions are included in extension packages in similar situations. FSR clearly has merits over the more isolated discipline-based research, notably the commitment to farmer participation. In reality, FSR too has had its problems and, in practice, achieving true farmer participation can be fraught with difficulties. Nor does it do anything to overcome the institutional constraints facing most|$|R

The case for public expenditure on typhoid Vi polysaccharide vaccines for two low-income, high-incidence slums (Narkeldanga and Tiljala) in Kolkata, India, was examined. Three measures of the economic benefits of the vaccines were used: private and public cost-of-illness (COI) avoided; avoided COI plus mortality risk-reduction benefits; and willingness-to-pay (WTP) derived from stated preference (contingent valuation) studies conducted in Tiljala in 2004. Benefits and costs were examined from a social perspective. The study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate typhoid-vaccine programmes using a wealth of new site-specific epidemiological and economic data. Three typhoid-vaccination strategies (targeting only enrolled school children, targeting all children, and targeting adults and children) would most likely pass a social cost-benefit test, unless benefits are restricted to include only avoided COI. All three strategies would be considered ‘very cost-effective ’ using the standard comparisons of cost per disability-adjusted life-year avoided with per-capita gross domestic product. However, at an average total cost per immunized person of ~US $ 1. 1, a typhoid-vaccination programme would absorb a sixth of existing <b>public-sector</b> <b>spending</b> on health (on a per-capita basis) in India.

40|$|Tested {{parties with}} a better {{understanding}} of the impact of policy measures on the financial position of households. A household’s ability to pay is largely determined by other financial factors, such as manifestations of wealth (home ownership or investments, pension position). Non-quantifiable variables, such as type of income and household or family situation, are often even more important. The application of the model based on these premises to the changes in income tax law in 2001 is the preliminary result of a quest to understand as well as possible the impact of policy measures. This brings us full circle. The levying of tax should be based on the moral ideal of the socio-legal community. The ability-to-pay principle is the guiding distribution criterion. The PAP category model is a tool that can be used to illustrate and analyse the impact of fiscal and non-fiscal policy measures on the ability to pay of clustered households. The changes to the treatment of capital and capital income made in the 2001 Tax Review have been described and analysed using an economic model. The changes in the prosperity and ability-to-pay position of the clustered households following this review have been illustrated, testing whether and, in my opinion, demonstrating that the PAP category model is a useful complement to the existing methodologies for recording the impact of policy measures on prosperity and ability to pay.
