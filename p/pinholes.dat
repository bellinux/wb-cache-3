25|$|The {{experiment}} uses a setup {{similar to}} that for the double-slit experiment. In Afshar's variant, light generated by a laser passes through two closely spaced circular <b>pinholes</b> (not slits). After the dual <b>pinholes,</b> a lens refocuses the light so {{that the image of}} each pinhole falls on separate photon-detectors (Fig. 1). A photon that goes through pinhole number one impinges only on detector number one, and similarly, if it goes through pinhole two it impinges only on detector number two, which is why we see the <b>pinholes</b> separately in the image plane close to the mirrors before the photon-detectors.|$|E
50|$|To the left, the <b>pinhole</b> is large, and {{geometric}} optics applies; the resolution limit is about 1.5 times the {{radius of the}} <b>pinhole.</b> (Spurious resolution is also seen in the geometric-optics limit.) To the right, the <b>pinhole</b> is small, and Fraunhofer diffraction applies; the resolution limit is given by the far-field diffraction formula shown in the graph and now increases as the <b>pinhole</b> is made smaller. In the region of near-field diffraction (or Fresnel diffraction), the <b>pinhole</b> focuses the light slightly, and the resolution limit is minimized when the focal length f (the distance between the <b>pinhole</b> and the film plane) is given by f = s2/λ. At this focal length, the <b>pinhole</b> focuses the light slightly, and the resolution limit is about 2/3 of the radius of the <b>pinhole.</b> The <b>pinhole</b> {{in this case is}} equivalent to a Fresnel zone plate with a single zone. The value s2/λ is in a sense the natural focal length of the <b>pinhole.</b>|$|R

The relationship between the thickness of the <b>pinhole</b> array and the viewing angle of the II display is studied, and the maximal value of the thickness is also obtained. When the thickness of the <b>pinhole</b> array is greater than the maximal value, the viewing angle of the II display is decreased with increasing the thickness of the <b>pinhole</b> array. A prototype of the II display using <b>pinhole</b> array is developed, and the experimental results agree well with the theory...|$|R
25|$|When one pinhole is closed, {{the grid}} of wires causes appreciable {{diffraction}} in the light, and blocks {{a certain amount}} of light received by the corresponding photon-detector. However, when both <b>pinholes</b> are open, the effect of the wires is negligible, comparable to the case in which there are no wires placed in front of the lens (Fig.3), because the wires lie in the dark fringes, which the photons avoid. The effect is not dependent on the light intensity (photon flux).|$|E
25|$|When {{the light}} {{acts as a}} wave, because of quantum {{interference}} one can observe that there are regions that the photons avoid, called dark fringes. A grid of thin wires is placed just before the lens (Fig. 2) so that the wires lie in the dark fringes of an interference pattern which is produced by the dual pinhole setup. If one of the <b>pinholes</b> is blocked, the interference pattern {{will no longer be}} formed, and some of the light will be blocked by the wires. Consequently, the image quality is reduced.|$|E
25|$|The use of lead glaze {{has several}} {{advantages}} over alkali glazes {{in addition to}} their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not crawl, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of the glaze. It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the thermal contraction of the glaze and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the glaze contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to crazing. A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of <b>pinholes</b> as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900–1100°C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.|$|E

500|$|The {{level of}} heat input also affects weld quality. [...] Low heat input, caused by low welding current or high welding speed, can limit {{penetration}} and cause the weld bead to lift {{away from the}} surface being welded. If {{there is too much}} heat input, however, the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld. This results in a weld with <b>pinholes,</b> which is weaker than a typical weld.|$|E
500|$|Pinhole camera: The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{observed}} that the spaces between the leaves of trees acted as tiny <b>pinholes</b> which cast {{the image of a}} partial solar eclipse onto the ground. He also used a metal plate with a small pinhole to project an image of a solar eclipse onto the ground. The ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi (c. 470 BC– c. 391 BC)—founder of Mohism during the establishment of the Hundred Schools of Thought—lived just before the time of Aristotle and it was in his Mojing (perhaps compiled by his disciples) that a pinhole camera was described. The Mojing stated that the [...] "collecting place" [...] (pinhole) was an empty hole [...] "like the sun and moon depicted on the imperial flags," [...] where an image could be inverted at an intersecting point which [...] "affects the size of the image." [...] The Mojing seems to be in line with the Epicurean theory of light traveling into the eye (and not vice versa like in Pythagoreanism), since the Mojing states that the reflected light shining forth from an [...] "illuminated person" [...] becomes inverted when passing through the pinhole, i.e. [...] "The bottom part of the man becomes the top part (of the image) and the top part of the man becomes the bottom part (of the image)." [...] In his Book of Optics (1021), Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) wrote of his experimentation with camera obscura, which was followed by Shen Kuo (1031–1095), the latter who alluded that the Tang Dynasty (618–907) author Duan Chengshi (died 863)—in his Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang—described inverted images of Chinese pagodas.|$|E

50|$|Shadowgraphs are images {{produced}} by casting a shadow on a surface, usually {{taken with a}} <b>pinhole</b> camera and are widely used for nondestructive testing. Such cameras provide low illumination levels that require long exposure times. They also provide poor spatial resolution. The resolution of such a lens cannot be smaller than the hole diameter. A good balance between illumination and resolution is obtained when the <b>pinhole</b> diameter is about 100 times smaller than {{the distance between the}} <b>pinhole</b> and the image screen, effectively making the <b>pinhole</b> an f/100 lens.

40|$|<b>Pinhole</b> {{castration}} {{is a novel}} {{minimally invasive}} procedure for calf or kid castration. We evaluated stress, simplicity and costs of the technique in mongrel puppies (N= 15). The puppies were divided into three groups: control i. e. not treated; second surgical castration and third <b>pinhole</b> castration. Stress was monitored by daily recording of rectal temperatures and assay of plasma cortisol concentration. Testicular histopathology {{was used to evaluate}} effectiveness of the method. Material requirements, costs and length of <b>pinhole</b> or surgical castration cases were compared. Surgery provoked higher febrile and cortisol responses than <b>pinhole</b> castration, however, the responses took longer to resolve in the <b>pinhole</b> treated animals. Each <b>pinhole</b> procedure required: xylazine 2 % (0. 2 ml), syringe, needle and suture (10 cm). Surgery meanwhile, required: xylazine 2 % (0. 2 ml), 2 syringes, suture (15 cm), razor, surgical blade, antibiotics, antiseptics, cotton and 1 ml ketamine (50 mg/ml). Material cost for a surgery case was about thrice a <b>pinhole</b> case. Average time for <b>pinhole</b> was 14 minutes while surgery took about 35 minutes. We concluded that, compared to standard surgical castration, the <b>pinhole</b> technique is, less stressful, quicker, simpler and is a cheaper alternative for male dog sterilization.
