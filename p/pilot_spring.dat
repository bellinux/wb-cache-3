30|$|Non-invasive {{neuromodulation}} {{devices are}} alternative treatment options in acute and preventive migraine therapy (Barbanti et al. 2015; Barker et al. 1985; Bhola et al. 2015). Spring TMS™ uses portable, single pulse {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} technology. It is an approved and effective patient use device for both acute and preventive treatment of migraine. TMS technology was invented in the UK by the Royal Hallamshire NHS Hospital and University of Sheffield demonstrating the first stimulator in 1985 (Barker et al. 1985). In results from a UK Post Market <b>Pilot</b> programme <b>Spring</b> TMS demonstrated safety, efficacy and very good tolerability in acute migraine for daily and preventative treatment use (Bhola et al. 2015).

40|$|As part of {{continuous}} {{improvement of the}} program and ABET accreditation requirements, direct assessment methods of student outcomes are necessary and quite illustrative in terms of describing student learning. Direct assessment methods range from evaluating student performance on locally prepared examinations or standardized tests to assessing student portfolios or performing performance appraisals. Choice of the methods depends on a range of factors including number of students in the program, impact on faculty workload and appropriateness of sample size. One of the challenges in implementing a successful direct assessment process is engaging the faculty and achieving a high level of participation and support.
