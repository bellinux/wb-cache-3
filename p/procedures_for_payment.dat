The first major reform instituted was the [...] "what {{you see is what you}} get" [...] or WYSWIG policy that is a simplified system of fund release for the General Appropriations Act (GAA). This allowed agency heads to immediately plan and contract out projects by just looking at the GAA, which is available in print and at the DBM website, without waiting for the issuance of an allotment authority. Diokno initiated the reform of the government procurement system (GPS) through the adoption of rapidly improving information and communications technology. He secured technical assistance from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) to help the GPS develop an electronic procurement system along the lines of the Canadian model. By August 1999, the DBM had two documents necessary to initiate reforms in public procurement. In early 2000, Diokno and USAID successfully concluded a substantial technical assistance program for the DBM's budget reform programs, which now included procurement reform. Other budget reforms instituted by Diokno concerned <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of accounts payable and terminal leave/ retirement gratuity benefits.

Current auction services essentially rely on a central auction server. Given the increasing popularity and usage of electronic auctions, such a centralised approach is fundamentally restrictive with respect to scalability. Further, different national markets have different monetary regulations and may employ different <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> settlements. Catering for local market autonomy means that decentralisation is an essential and practical requirement. With these design goals in mind, the paper develops an approach that permits an auction service to be mapped on to globally distributed auction servers.

When a company earns profits from operations, management can do {{one of two things}} with those profits. It can choose to retain them - essentially reinvesting them into the company with the hope of creating more profits and thus further stock appreciation. The alternative is to distribute a portion of the profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. The present paper highlight different approaches of dividend policy which are residual, hybrid and stability dividend approach. Companies using the residual dividend policy choose to rely on internally generated equity to finance any new projects. As a result, dividend payments can come out of the residual or leftover equity only after all project capital requirements are met. The fluctuation of dividends created by the residual policy significantly contrasts with the certainty of the dividend stability policy. With the stability policy, quarterly dividends are set at a fraction of yearly earnings. This policy reduces uncertainty for investors and provides them with income. Using the hybrid approach; companies tend to view the debt/equity ratio as a long-term rather than a short-term goal.

In order to combat late payment, it is {{necessary}} not only to adjust the substantive but as well the procedural rules. As the Dutch Code civil procedure {{does not have a}} specific procedure to enforce the socalled undisputed money claims, these claims are enforced by the ordinary proceedings.

With the introduction of the European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> <b>procedure</b> the creditor of a money claim gets a new possibility to enforce these claims in cross border cases. As this procedure is only applicable in cross border cases the question has to be raised whether the Dutch legislator is required to introduce such a procedure in the Netherlands. The order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> <b>procedure</b> can, however, fulfill a further aim, as can be seen in the German and Austrian Mahnverfahren, namely the relieving of the judiciary in general and the judges in particular.
