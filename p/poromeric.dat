50|$|The first <b>poromeric</b> {{material}} was DuPont's ill-fated Corfam introduced in 1963 at the Chicago Shoe Show.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>poromeric</b> {{was coined}} by DuPont as a {{derivative}} {{of the terms}} microporous and polymeric.|$|E
50|$|Patent leather is {{sometimes}} confused with <b>poromeric</b> imitation leathers such as DuPont's Corfam and Kuraray's Clarino, which are artificial materials {{with a similar}} glossy appearance.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as poromerics, <b>poromeric</b> imitation leathers are a group of synthetic [...] "breathable" [...] leather substitutes made from a plastic coating (usually a polyurethane) on a fibrous base layer (typically a polyester).|$|E
50|$|Patent {{leather and}} poromerics are cleaned {{in a similar}} way. Dirt {{adhering}} to the coating can be removed with a damp cloth, using a mild soap if needed. Minor scratches and scuff marks in the coating can be removed using one of several special-purpose patent leather and <b>poromeric</b> cleaners on the market. With wear and tear, patent leather will eventually lose its glossy finish, but will still be smoother than most other types of leather, looking almost rubbery.|$|E
40|$|Reinforced <b>poromeric</b> {{material}} (Corfam) in industrial-grade thicknesses {{was evaluated}} as a leather substitute for fabrication of military dog equipment. User evaluations indicate that industrial-grade Corfam substrate, alone or laminated with polyurethane-coated substrate, possesses physical/ comfort qualities of equivalent grade leathers. <b>Poromeric</b> materials {{are not subject}} to biological degradation nor do they absorb water. These properties greatly reduce the required maintenance while increasing the life expectancy of the equipment. The ultimate cost of Corfam equipment is probably at least competitive with that of leather. iii FOREWORD The work herein described was undertaken under the followin...|$|E
40|$|Plasticized PVC {{films are}} cheaper but their {{hydrophilic}} properties {{are still a}} problem. Sustained research in this respect is carried out. This research work refers to either <b>poromeric</b> films containing reactive hydrophilic groups linked to PVC or the utilization of hydrophilic auxiliaries in aqueous media. The present paper has the purpose of obtaining plasticized PVC porous films with an enhanced capacity of moisture sorption, by inducing the porosity {{with the help of}} the high frequency electric field (H. F. E. F.) simultaneously with the utilization of certain hydrophilic auxiliaries such as: collagen hydrolysates (CH), hydroxyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (HTPDMS), and nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE). The collagen hydrolysates were obtained by the recovery of the Chamois leather waste resulted from the buffing operation, using a new method of electrolytic hydrolysis on an own design installation. The resulting product was analyzed in terms of the hydrolysis yield and of the structural changes, highlighted by the IR analysis. The resulting hydrolysis product was used as such or in different mixture varieties as hydrophilic agent for the obtaining of plasticized PVC porous films. The films were analyzed in terms of moisture sorption in correlation with the version of the recipe used. The obtained results highlighted the efficiency of using CH as such or in some binary and ternary mixtures as regards the enhancement of the moisture sorption of the plasticized PVC films, effect which is also amplified by the utilization of H.
