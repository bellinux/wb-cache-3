40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{experimental}} and theoretical investigations of moisture transfer through microporous film <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> are presented. The water vapour absorption and desorption processes of <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> are described. Water vapour absorption in the <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> and its separate layers may {{be classified as}} non-Fickian: sigmoidal – for microporous film and two-stage – for the leather of different structures. Water vapour desorption of leather changes according to the exponential law and for microporous film according to the linear one. Water vapour absorption/desorption mechanism depends on the leather permeability. Microporous film does not worsen moisture transfer properties of the <b>laminated</b> <b>leather.</b> However water vapour permeability decreases and absorption increases due to the nonporous adhesive layer used for microporous film bonding. The decrease of <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> permeability intensifies the formation of capillary moisture or water clusters and increases water accumulation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>leather,</b> {{obtained}} by the bonding of the microporous polyurethane film to split leather surface, was used for investigation. Such hybrid leather is resistant to water penetration, but shows high breathable properties. The effect of different nature layers on mechanical properties and viscoelastic behaviour of <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> was examined. It was shown that leather backing mainly determines the strength of <b>laminated</b> <b>leather,</b> while polyurethane film – deformability. The combinative strengthening is characteristic for hybrid system due to the repairing of leather surface defects by adhesive layers and dissipation of kinetic energy, which releases during the elementary act of the failure. Generalized Maxwell model, possessing a regular spectrum of relaxation times, successfully describes stress relaxation behaviour of the leather in non-linear regions. The polyurethane film increases the stress relaxation rate in the <b>laminated</b> <b>leather,</b> because rearrangement at the interface of two layers arises. It was obtained that the viscoelastic nature of polyurethane film dominates on the long-term properties of <b>laminated</b> <b>leather...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{water vapour}} {{transfer}} through microporous film <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> has been investigated. Water vapour transmission is a multi-stage process, consisting of penetrant absorption, solubility, desorption and diffusion. Adhesively bonded microporous film does not worsen moisture transfer {{properties of the}} <b>laminated</b> <b>leather.</b> Notwithstanding water vapour permeability decreases and absorption increases due to the nonporous adhesive layer. In <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> and its layers water vapour absorption may be classified as non-Fickian: sigmoidal – for microporous film and two-stage – for all leather samples. Water vapour accumulation at the leather/adhesive layer interface causes the adhesion loss of coating polyurethane film {{and changes in the}} failure mode. Water vapour induced film delamination begins at the weakened sites of the interface (i. e. small cavities, voids, and topographical irregularities of leather, etc.). Under driving gradient the local accumulation of interfacial water expands and multi-layers of water molecules build up. The splitting of the interfacial water layers begins the loss of adhesion. At long penetrant activity at both sides the film delamination propagation and blister formation in the <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> may occur...|$|R
5000|$|Huckins won {{its design}} {{contract}} in 1941, {{just when the}} Navy was ready to scrap the PT program, and licensed {{the use of the}} Quadraconic hull in PT boat construction. They also granted permission for Elco, Higgins and the Philadelphia Navy Yard to use their <b>patented</b> <b>laminated</b> keel, which increased hull strength. A total of 18 78-foot (24 m) boats for squadrons 14 and 26 were commissioned in early 1943. [...] They were assigned to specific outposts in the Panama Canal, Miami, Florida, the Hawaiian Sea Frontier at Pearl Harbor, in the Central Pacific, and a training center in Melville, Rhode Island.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 Kinman {{embarked}} on development of technology specifically for Telecaster guitars {{that was not}} introduced until circa 2001. The technology centers around a <b>patented</b> <b>laminated</b> steel H-core bobbin that functions as a noise sensing coil. It is made of 150 separate pieces of steel. The H-core is interesting because it performs far more efficiently than conventional noise sensing bobbins using steel core pins, requiring less turns of copper wire to produce the required hum voltage. There is {{a strong correlation between}} sonic signature of a hum canceling pickup and the number of turns and diameter of copper wire contained in the hum sensor.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, in 1905, John Crewe Wood, a {{solicitor}} in Swindon, Wiltshire, England, <b>patented</b> a <b>laminated</b> {{glass for}} use as windscreens / windshields. The layers of glass were bonded together by Canada balsam. [...] In 1906 he founded the Safety Motor Screen Co. to produce and sell his product.|$|R
50|$|Although {{not used}} in any other PT boat design, Huckins {{licensed}} {{the use of his}} patented Quadraconic hull in his PT boat construction. He also granted permission for Elco, Higgins, and the Philadelphia Navy Yard to use his <b>patented</b> <b>laminated</b> keel, which increased hull strength, although neither Elco nor Higgins ever chose to use it on their boats. Most probably due to the lateness in joining the PT boat program and unlike Elco and Higgins, the Huckins yard was never provided any government support to construct a larger facility prior to the war. The handcrafted Huckins PT was produced at their civilian facility at a speed of one per month. The success and ruggedness of the Huckins' 78-foot seagoing design is demonstrated by Squadron 26's constant ready-boat operations and Fleet torpedo boat training in the oceans around Midway and Hawaii during {{the last two years of}} the war.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the mechanical properties of the adhesive on the stress distribution in the polyurethane film <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> layers was investigated. The finite elements method {{was used for the}} 3 -D model evaluation. Laminate models consisted of three layers: split leather, adhesive film and polyurethane film. The elastic modulus of adhesive layer was varied from 40 MPa up to 110 MPa. The models were loaded in two different ways, i. e. constant strain of 3 % and constant force of 100 N. The relationships of adhesive elastic modulus and principal stress in the layers of the laminate on the loading condition of constant strain or constant force were obtained. The results showed that the increase of adhesive elastic modulus increases stress only in the adhesive layer of laminate. In the case of loading by constant force it was obtained that the increase of adhesive elastic modulus increases stresses in its layer and insignificantly decreases stresses of split leather and microporous polyurethane layers. Layers orientation also influences the deformability and stress distribution of the laminate. The highest deformability was reached as each split leather or PU film were orientated {{in the direction of the}} lowest elastic modulus...|$|R

40|$|Originally {{entitled}} ‘Patronage, Artisan, Media and Audience: A {{model for}} Twenty-first Century Craftsmanship' this project {{set out to}} create of {{a body of work}} that exhibits crafts excellence and enables a clear understanding of the skills and investment that makes the creation of such work possible. Commercial garment patterns were abstracted and reassembled using techniques employed by the tailor, the butcher and the mortician. The composite forms create abstract figurative structures more akin to the carcasses of animals than the fashion identities from which the forms are generated. Volumes and extended surfaces of unprecedented scales were created from <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> hide rather than conventional fabric. Lamination was achieved by exploring the scale to which thickness of hide could be layered using the adhesive methods of the shoe and accessory industries. Tiny margins and tolerances in the thicknesses and structural properties determined the degree of flexibility and complexity of the forms that could be achieved, while techniques developed from research into the medical procedure of closing wounds was complemented with a degree of completion that masked the processes of assembly. Links between historical and contemporary identities are expressed through the development of original techniques for inlay, resulting from two years of research into sixteenth-century marquetry. Judith Clark's exhibition design focused on the pieces' resemblance to meat: large hooks drew attention to the many allusions the work makes to the fashion trade/meat market. In Mexico the exhibition added a butchers table as ‘alterpiece’ adding to the effect of 'Memento Mori'. Importance was placed on the catalogue as a dialogue between Clark as fashion curator, Jennifer Higgie as art critic and George L Legendre as architect, to provide new descriptions for the work: its “exhibitability”, its decorative richness and its mis-constructions. The essays were translated into Spanish for use within Mexican art institutions. The final body of work consists of an installation and performance for the gallery environment using mixed media props, including autopsy tables and commissioned metal structures more akin to a butchers window or abattoir...|$|R

50|$|Thomas Dodd {{came from}} a family of {{instrument}} makers - Dodd violin bows had been famous since the mid-1700. His father Edward died in 1810 at the very respectable age of 95. Dodd was mainly a dealer in instruments from 1809 to 1823, when he moved to Berners Street and then got interested in harps. He was also at Berwick Street in 1827 before returning to Berners Street. Thomas died in about 1830, and the business carried on until 1846 - presumably by means of his 2 sons (see Edward Dodd, 3, Berners Street). There is an 1822 <b>patent</b> for a <b>laminated</b> neck.|$|R
