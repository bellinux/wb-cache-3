5|$|Smyth {{writes that}} as a result of Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of the Soviet army, but <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} he wanted to be a {{professional}} musician and went to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to Würzburg in January 1894. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was shy about performing in public, and partly because of doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E
5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E
5000|$|Awfully Wee Billy Bigchin: He {{came with}} Jeannie from the Long Lake clan {{and is the}} new gonnagle for Chalk clan. He is notably smaller {{than many of the}} other Feegles, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> just young and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> just short. When Miss Level remarks how short he is in A Hat Full of Sky, he replies, [...] "Only fra my height, Mistress." ...|$|R

50|$|With every lesson, Jessica's {{interest}} in both dancing and Jake increases dramatically. At the same time, her fiance's behaviour becomes unpleasant; <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{she is too}} busy to cook at home, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> jealous that she spends too much time dancing with Jake.|$|R
5|$|He was {{assigned}} to a civil flying school at RAF Prestwick which was run by Scottish Aviation Limited. He formally began his training on 29 June 1936. He progressed well in his theory examinations, gaining 99 percent for gunnery and 91 percent for airmanship. He flew a single-engined De Havilland Tiger Moth training biplane and gained his A Licence {{at the end of}} July, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a capable pilot and also because the Air Ministry was anxious to produce trained pilots. He completed his training within two months and was classified as above average after passing his examination with ease.|$|E
5|$|The 1968 Republican National Convention {{was held}} from August 5 to 9 at the Miami Beach Convention Center in Miami Beach, Florida. At the convention, Richard Nixon won the {{nomination}} for President {{on the first}} ballot with 692 delegates. Behind him finished Governor Rockefeller, second with 277 delegates, followed by Governor Ronald Reagan, in third place, having just entered the race, accruing 182 delegates. Nixon's early nomination occurred <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> held on to delegates in the South largely influenced by Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, and delegate Charlton Lyons of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|De Materia Medica is {{the prime}} {{historical}} {{source of information about}} the medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the Dacian names for some plants, which otherwise would have been lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from these sources. Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants easy to identify from his short descriptions, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had naturally described plants and animals from southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results.|$|E

5000|$|In 1984, he {{was named}} to the All-Star team. This was {{explained}} by John Feinstein of the Washington Post as: [...] "Making the All-Star team the hard way: Major league baseball pays the expenses for each player here and for one guest. In most cases, players bring wives or girlfriends. Damaso Garcia, the Toronto Blue Jays' second baseman, brought his shortstop, Alfredo Griffin. When the Tigers' Alan Trammell hurt his arm and could not play tonight, Manager Joe Altobelli named Griffin to the team, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> a fine player, but mostly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was here." ...|$|R
5|$|Harrelson was the season's next {{significant}} casting choice, {{brought on}} to play Hart at McConaughey's request. Harrelson stated that he joined True Detective <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to work with}} certain people involved in the project, with whom he had previously collaborated in the 2012 HBO film Game Change. Michelle Monaghan agreed to play the season's female lead, Maggie, because she felt compelled by the direction of the plot and her character's story arc. Michael Potts and Tory Kittles completed the principal cast, playing detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania, respectively. Major supporting roles in True Detective first season include Kevin Dunn as Major Ken Quesada, Alexandra Daddario as Lisa Tragnetti, and Brad Carter as Charlie Lange.|$|E
5|$|Helena saw {{relatively}} little of her surviving siblings, and continued {{her role as}} a support to the monarchy and a campaigner for the many charities she represented. She and Christian led a quiet life, but did carry out a few royal engagements. On one such occasion, the elderly couple represented the King at the silver wedding anniversary, in 1906, of Kaiser Wilhelm II (Helena's nephew) and his wife Augusta Victoria (Christian's niece). During the Edwardian period, Helena visited the grave of her son, Prince Christian Victor, who died in 1900 following a bout with malaria while serving in the Second Boer War. She was met by South African Prime Minister Louis Botha, but Jan Smuts refused to meet her, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was bitter that South Africa had lost the war and partly because his son had died in a British concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|In 1706, the Elector of Bavaria was {{deprived}} of his offices and titles for siding with Louis against the Empire. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with {{command of the}} imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was not altogether successful, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was deceived by his ally, the Duke of Marlborough, into a diversionary attack, and partly because Emperor Joseph I appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes {{thought that he had}} acquitted himself well. In 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector in recognition of, or because of, his service. George did not hold Marlborough's actions against him which he understood were part of a plan to lure French forces from the main attack.|$|E
6000|$|... "Open the gate, Caleb," [...] {{said his}} master, {{in a more}} {{soothing}} tone, partly from his regard to the ancient and faithful seneschal, <b>partly</b> perhaps <b>because</b> <b>he</b> thought that angry words would be thrown away, so long as Caleb had a stout iron-clenched oaken door betwixt his person and the speakers.|$|R
5000|$|When {{creating}} {{the character of}} Llewyn Davis, Joel Coen summed up the idea as [...] "suppose Dave Van Ronk gets beat up outside of Gerde's Folk City. That's {{the beginning of a}} movie." [...] The Coen Brothers used [...] "Van Ronk’s posthumous memoir, The Mayor of MacDougal Street" [...] as an influence for the screenplay and Llewyn Davis' journey. The album cover and title of Inside Llewyn Davis is also directly inspired by Dave Van Ronk's album Inside Dave Van Ronk. In describing how Isaac was cast, Robert Christgau writes that [...] "The Coens... emphasize that Van Ronk's story was only the seed of a fiction, and were pleased to cast Isaac in the title role <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> so unlike Van Ronk physically." ...|$|R
5000|$|Writing for The New York Times on 3 December 2015, Manohla Dargis complimented Fassbender's {{depiction}} of the lead role stating: [...] Kenneth Tynan once wrote that 'nobody has ever succeeded as Macbeth' because the character shrinks from a complex figure into a cowering thug. The exception, Tynan continued, immediately contradicting his claim, was Laurence Olivier, who in a 1955 production 'shook hands with greatness.' With his Macbeth, Mr. Fassbender, who routinely shakes hands with greatness in films that don't remotely do the same, produces a man whose anguish eventually becomes a powerful counterpoint to his deeds, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> already dead {{by the time he}} utters his first word. Mr. Fassbender gives you a reason to see this Macbeth, although the writing isn't bad, either.|$|R
5|$|In 1998, Lieber was the Pirates' fourth starter. He had a 510 record {{over his}} first 17 starts, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{received}} 15 total runs {{of support in}} the losses over that time. Lieber had an 813 record with a 3.90 ERA before getting placed {{on the disabled list}} (DL) {{for the first time in}} his career on August 21 due to a left oblique muscle strain. He returned from the DL on September 15 but posted a 10.80 ERA over his last two starts. In 29 games (28 starts), Lieber posted an 814 record, a 4.11 ERA, 138 strikeouts, 40 walks, and 182 hits allowed in 171 innings pitched. He was tied with seven other pitchers for fifth in the league in losses. Following the season, Lieber was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Brant Brown.|$|E
5|$|Many of Sorabji's {{works are}} {{written for the}} piano or have an {{important}} piano part. His writing for the instrument was influenced by that of composers such as Liszt, Alkan and Godowsky, {{and he has been}} described as a composer-pianist in their tradition, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was one of the 20th century's most prolific piano composers. It exhibits particularly the influence of Godowsky, specifically in its polyphony and its use of polyrhythms and polydynamics. This necessitated the regular use of systems of more than two staves in Sorabji's keyboard parts, reaching its peak on page 124 of the manuscript of his Third Organ Symphony (1949–53), which uses 11 staves, as well as frequent calls for use of the sostenuto pedal.|$|E
5|$|Despite Arévalo's anti-communism, the U.S. was {{suspicious}} of him, and {{worried that he}} was under Soviet influence. The communist movement did grow stronger during Arévalo's presidency, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> released its imprisoned leaders, and also through {{the strength of its}} teachers' union. Another cause for U.S. worry was Arévalo's support of the Caribbean Legion. The Legion was a group of progressive exiles and revolutionaries, whose members included Fidel Castro, that aimed to overthrow U.S.-backed dictatorships across Central America. The government also faced opposition from within the country; Arévalo survived at least 25 coup attempts during his presidency. A notable example was an attempt in 1949 led by Francisco Arana, which was foiled in an armed shootout between Arana's supporters and a force led by Arévalo's defense minister Jacobo Árbenz. Arana was among those killed, but details of the coup attempt were never made public. Other sources of opposition to Arévalo's government were the right-wing politicians and conservatives within the military who had grown powerful during Ubico's dictatorship, as well as the clergy of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5000|$|Kyle Stanger (born January 7, 1997 in London, England, United Kingdom) is a British teen actor. He {{was one of}} over 900 {{children}} (including {{his sister}} Jade Stanger) who auditioned to star in Pooh's Heffalump Movie {{as the voice of}} Lumpy the Heffalump, or Heffridge Trompler Brompet Heffalump IV (4th), at the age of five. He eventually won the role. His performance drew positive reviews, including Entertainment Weekly describing Lumpy as [...] "irresistibly voiced by 8-year-old Brit Kyle Stanger" [...] and New York Times critic Anita Gates's comment that [...] "adults as well as children may fall in love with Lumpy, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> a sort of roly-poly lavender baby elephant but even more because of the endearing voice and infectious laugh of Kyle Stanger, a very young Briton making his movie and voice-over debut." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gilet {{described}} Lucas {{as having}} [...] "Jekyll and Hyde" [...] aspects to his character, {{and tries to}} hide {{the darker side of}} his personality from Denise. Gilet commented: [...] "Every actor enjoys playing a character who's flawed - but how long can Lucas continue to hide the dark side of himself before the cracks start to show? I {{think a lot of people}} reckon the clock might be ticking. This story has shocked some people! I was getting fan mail where people were saying what a nice guy he was - and, of course, now they know he's not." [...] Gilet has called Lucas [...] "a very good character to play because of his complexity", explaining: [...] "I think that's <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> a guy who always strives to do the right thing but his path for doing that gets warped as time goes on. I think his heart started off in the right place but - <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of his drug-addled years - he has a slightly warped outlook on life." [...] Asked whether he felt Lucas was truly bad, Gilet replied: ...|$|R
5000|$|Although one of {{the first}} to settle in the Newlyn artists' colony Newlyn School, Langley {{initially}} benefited little from its growing fame, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of his working-class origins and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> until 1892 <b>he</b> painted largely in watercolour rather than the more prestigious medium of oils. His early training in lithography gives his paintings a detail and texture that show his technical skills.|$|R
5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and The Shadow of the Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and The Shadow of the Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. The Shadow of the Glen, under the title In the Shadow of the Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|E
5|$|Nigel Kneale {{had been}} unhappy with Hammer's {{adaptation}} of The Quatermass Experiment, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> received no extra remuneration {{from the sale}} of the film rights and partly because of the changes made in the film to his original television script. In the wake of his dissatisfaction, Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to be more involved in the sale of the rights to his work. Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract, Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of Quatermass II. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds. Subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest, as he had done before on The Quatermass Xperiment. Guest recalled of Kneale's script that there was “lots of philosophising and very down-to-earth thinking but it was too long, it would not have held screenwise. So, again, I had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it”. The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1956. BBFC reader Audrey Field commented, “There should be the customary general caution that the sky is not the limit, either in sights or sounds”. The BBFC's main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic. This scene was omitted from the final film, although it is present in the original television presentation.|$|E
25|$|Although his {{own work}} {{influenced}} and anticipated the Impressionist style, he resisted involvement in Impressionist exhibitions, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{did not wish to}} be seen as the representative of a group identity, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> preferred to exhibit at the Salon. Eva Gonzalès, a daughter of the novelist Emmanuel Gonzalès, was his only formal student.|$|E
5000|$|Narumi is {{extremely}} popular with girls, {{but he does}} not appear interested (partly due to a fear of girls and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> so focused on becoming the top beautician in Japan). Since Narumi was young, girls treated him like a toy and suffocated him with too much attention. According to his sister Chisami, Narumi breaks out in hives when he touches women, even Kiri. As his feelings for Kiri grow, he is able to touch Kiri without any detrimental effects. Narumi eventually develops feelings for Kiri; he has romantic dreams about her, and even accidentally kisses her at the end of volume 8. In volume 9, he even stays with Kiri to watch over the house while her dad was in L.A. Narumi usually calls Kiri, [...] "Mussy Head". This started off as an insult but grew into a kind of cute and affectionate nickname.|$|R
60|$|He {{could sleep}} in the air without falling, by merely {{lying on his back}} and floating, but this was, <b>partly</b> at least, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.|$|R
50|$|On December 28, 2007, Monahan {{admitted}} {{in an interview}} with ESPN that he used the anabolic steroids Deca-Durabolin and Winstrol as well as amphetamines during his playing career. Monahan stated that he started using steroids in 1998, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of what <b>he</b> states was widespread use in the Mariners clubhouse.|$|R
25|$|Unlike other generals who {{had failed}} in the Deccan, Jai Singh was punished harshly, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was also held {{responsible}} for his son's actions at Agra (in letting Shivaji escape), and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a Hindu. For the expenses of this campaign, the Rajput general had received only 3 million rupees from Aurangzeb, and had spent 10 million rupees from the accumulated hoards in his ancestral kingdom. Not a paisa of this money was compensated by his ungrateful master; probably the opportunity of ruining a leading Hindu chief was too tempting for Aurangzeb.|$|E
25|$|French {{authors and}} historians often {{compared}} Latouche-Tréville to Nelson, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> fought and defeated {{him in the}} Raids on Boulogne, partly because, {{had it not been}} for his untimely death, he would have opposed Nelson at Trafalgar.|$|E
25|$|He {{also played}} soccer for Natal, but {{gave it up}} in 1954, partly to avoid {{injuries}} that might jeopardise his cricket career, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{did not think it}} fair to ask his employers to give him leave to play two sports.|$|E
6000|$|... 'M. Donat {{called it}} a jest,' I wrote {{at the time in}} my diary. 'It seemed to me more in the nature of a terrified conjuration, as though she would divert the ghost's {{attention}} from herself. A cannibal race may well have cannibal phantoms.' The guesses of the traveller appear foredoomed to be erroneous; yet in these I was precisely right. The woman had stood by in terror at the funeral, being then in a dread spot, the graveyard. She looked on in terror to the coming night, with that ogre, a new spirit, loosed upon the isle. And the words she had cried in Donat's face were indeed a terrified conjuration, basely to shield herself, basely to dedicate another in her stead. One thing is to be said in her excuse. Doubtless she <b>partly</b> chose Donat <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a man of great good-nature, but <b>partly,</b> too, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a man of the half- caste. For I believe all natives regard white blood as a kind of talisman against the powers of hell. In no other way can they explain the unpunished recklessness of Europeans.|$|R
5000|$|McKnight {{has had two}} {{extended}} {{stays in}} Africa, teaching English in Dakar, Senegal, from 1981 to 1982, and another in 1985 {{as part of a}} Thomas J. Watson Fellowship. He says that [...] "he didn't truly consider himself a writer until he went to Africa", <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> that <b>he</b> was writing intensely for several hours a day while he was there, and also <b>because,</b> as <b>he</b> states, [...] "when I left that place I had done something to myself in a really profound way--imprinted myself with the written word in ways that I hadn't prior to that". He also states that after a few weeks there, he became more aware of what he calls his [...] "Africanness" [...] by recognizing the same cadences in the voices of Senegalese women that he knew listening to his mother and his aunts growing up.|$|R
