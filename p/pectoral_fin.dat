5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} usually solitary, though aggregations of 2050 {{individuals}} have been recorded. Off southeast Queensland, aggregations {{of several hundred}} zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water. These aggregations consist entirely of large adults, with females outnumbering males by almost three to one. The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks. There is an observation of an adult male zebra shark biting the <b>pectoral</b> <b>fin</b> of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was turned on his back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors {{between male and female}} sharks, and in both cases the biting and holding of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>fin</b> has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other.|$|E
5|$|The fish's {{upper surface}} is brown to reddish brown with many {{scattered}} darker spots, lighter streaks, and reticulations. The {{center of each}} <b>pectoral</b> <b>fin</b> is marked with an oval spot or blotch. The lower surface is light, white to grey, blotched irregularly with gray spots. The barndoor skate is unique from other species of skate in its having a straight line that begins at the snout and ends at the anterior margin of the outer corner of the disk, but stopping short of the disk.|$|E
5|$|The common {{thresher}} is {{a fairly}} robust shark with a torpedo-shaped trunk and a short, broad head. The dorsal profile of the head curves evenly down to the pointed, conical snout. The eyes are moderately large and lack nictitating membranes. The small mouth is arched and, unlike in other thresher sharks, has furrows at the corners. There are 32-53 upper and 25-50 lower tooth rows; the teeth are small, triangular, and smooth-edged, lacking lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with {{the fourth and fifth}} pairs located over the <b>pectoral</b> <b>fin</b> bases.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pectoral</b> <b>fins</b> on most fish control {{pitching}} (up-and-down {{motion of}} the body), yawing (the side-to-side motion), and rolling. Most hammerhead sharks do not yaw or roll and achieve pitch using their cephalofoils. The smaller cephalofoil of a bonnethead shark is not as successful, {{so they have to}} rely on the combination of cephalofoils and their large <b>pectoral</b> <b>fins</b> for most of their motility. Compared to other hammerheads, bonnethead sharks have larger and more developed <b>pectoral</b> <b>fins</b> and are the only species of hammerhead to actively use <b>pectoral</b> <b>fins</b> for swimming.|$|R
50|$|Raising all dorsal fins precedes {{swimming}} over short distances. Repeated synchronous adduction of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>fins</b> thrusts {{the body}} forward and is aided by backwards- and downwards-movements of the <b>pectoral</b> <b>fins.</b> While swimming the dorsal fins are folded.|$|R
50|$|All {{species have}} been {{confirmed}} to be venomous except for P. fisadoha. The anterior spines of the dorsal and <b>pectoral</b> <b>fins</b> can inflict painful wounds. In P. lineatus, the highly venomous serrate spine of the first dorsal {{and each of the}} <b>pectoral</b> <b>fins</b> may even be fatal.|$|R
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is {{a species of}} longtailed carpet shark, family Hemiscylliidae, found in shallow, tropical waters off Australia and New Guinea (and possibly elsewhere). The common name of this shark comes from the very large, white-margined black spot behind each <b>pectoral</b> <b>fin,</b> which are reminiscent of military epaulettes. A small species usually under 1m (3.3ft) long, the {{epaulette shark}} has a slender body with a short head and broad, paddle-shaped paired fins. The caudal peduncle (to which the tail fin is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults are light brown above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.|$|E
5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip, and is positioned just behind the <b>pectoral</b> <b>fin</b> bases. The second dorsal fin is large and tall without a notably elongated free rear tip, and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped <b>pectoral</b> <b>fin</b> disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E
5000|$|The tub gurnard, Chelidonichthys lucerna (also C. lucernus, Trigla lucerna, T. corax) is {{a species}} of bottom-dwelling coastal fish with a spiny armored head and fingerlike <b>pectoral</b> <b>fins</b> used for {{crawling}} along the sea bottom. The tub gurnard is a reddish fish with blue <b>pectoral</b> <b>fins.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Atlantic torpedo has {{a nearly}} {{circular}} <b>pectoral</b> <b>fin</b> disc 1.2 times {{as wide as}} it is long, with a thick and nearly straight front margin. The eyes are small and are followed by much larger spiracles, which do not have papillae on their inner rims. The nostrils {{are close to the}} mouth; there is a flap of skin between them three times as wide as long, with a sinuous rear margin. The mouth is wide and arched, with prominent furrows at the corners. The teeth are pointed and increase in number with age, ranging from 38 rows in juveniles to 66 rows in adults; the first several series of teeth are functional. The gill slits are small, with the first and fifth pairs shorter than the others.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray has a soft, flabby body devoid of dermal denticles. It has an oval <b>pectoral</b> <b>fin</b> disc about 1.2 times {{as wide as}} long, with a nearly straight front margin {{and a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs visible beneath the skin. The eyes are small and followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles; the space from the spiracles to the snout tip is about 1.8 times the distance between the spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth, which is arched with deep furrows at the corners.
