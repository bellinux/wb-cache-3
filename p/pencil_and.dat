5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} {{enthusiastic}} artist in <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> watercolour, a skill which he used throughout his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends. His enormous correspondence shows that he could also be a witty writer in German and English– sometimes accompanied by humorous sketches and cartoons in the text.|$|E

5|$|Von Neumann {{created the}} field of {{cellular}} automata {{without the aid of}} computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> graph paper. The concept of the Von Neumann universal constructor based on the von Neumann cellular automaton was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata.|$|E

40|$|It {{is cheap}} to process {{epidemiological}} data from optical mark read (OMR) questionnaires. Respondents should use a pencil to complete OMR questionnaires, but many will not unless these are supplied. Sending <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> erasers is expensive. Does sending <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> erasers increase {{the response rate}} as cost-effectively as sending reminders, or does this decrease the error rate and offset data checking costs? We mailed 300 smokers and half were randomised to receive <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> erasers. The relative risk (95 % confidence intervals) for the response rate for the pencil group relative to the non-pencil group was 0. 77 (0. 46 - 1. 29) and for the error rate was 1. 31 (0. 78 - 2. 21). Sending <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> erasers was not cost-effective in sensitivity analysis with any response rate or using the confidence intervals. Including pencils with mailed epidemiological questionnaires probably has no benefit and any plausible benefit does not offset the costs of sending <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> erasers...|$|R
5|$|In 1992, Charles Cecil began {{researching the}} Knights Templar {{for the game}} after he, Noirin Carmody and Sean Brennan {{conceived}} Broken Sword. It was built with Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine. This was also used for the company's previous two games. Cecil co-wrote and directed the game, while Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen drew the backgrounds in <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> digitally colored them in Photoshop. The game has a serious tone, but features humor and graphics {{in the style of}} classic animated films.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Toriyama {{detailed}} the equipment he used for Dragon Ball. He used a G-pen nib by Zebra, usually getting three chapters {{out of one}} because he typically does not press down hard. Toriyama used black drawing ink made by Pilot, but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten-year-old fine point Tenshōdō brush. His whiteout was also made by Luma. He received free Kent paper, similar to Bristol board, from a seller connected to Shueisha, and used a 0.5mm 2B lead mechanical <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> a wide ruler at least 30cm long.|$|E
5|$|The team at Revolution {{had high}} {{expectations}} for Broken Sword, but there was significant competition. Revolution had a team that had created successful adventure games, but believed they needed to utilise the best of other creative industries. Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen of Dublin's Don Bluth studios drew the backgrounds in <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> digitally colored them in Photoshop. The introductory sequence and the main characters were done by animator Mike Burgess, {{who worked for the}} Red Rover animation studio. The game's graphics were animated in a style resembling classic animated films.|$|E

5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … {{there is no question that}} American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Wilde, having {{tired of}} journalism, had been busy setting out his {{aesthetic}} ideas more fully {{in a series}} of longer prose pieces which were published in the major literary-intellectual journals of the day. In January 1889, The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue appeared in The Nineteenth Century, and Pen, <b>Pencil</b> <b>and</b> Poison, a satirical biography of Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, in The Fortnightly Review, edited by Wilde's friend Frank Harris. Two of Wilde's four writings on aesthetics are dialogues: though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, he retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, he often composed by assembling phrases, bons mots and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an {{animated}} film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached {{for a series of}} magazine articles by the editorial staff of Animage. During subsequent conversations, he showed his sketchbooks and discussed basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama, who saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Two projects were proposed: , to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben's Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga, and the rights for the adaptation of Rowlf could not be secured. An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film. The manga—titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind—ran from February 1982 to March 1994. The story, as re-printed in the tankōbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in <b>pencil,</b> <b>and</b> it was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. Miyazaki resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November 1982.|$|E

When he regained consciousness in the dressing room, his first action was to signal for a <b>pencil</b> <b>and</b> paper – when these were supplied he wrote down an amended batting order for his team.|$|E
