25|$|In the {{presence}} of small bubbles, the solubility of the gas {{does not depend on}} the bubble radius in any other way than through the effect of the radius on pressure (i.e., the solubility of gas in the liquid in contact with small bubbles is increased due to <b>pressure</b> <b>increase</b> by Δp=2γ/r; see Young–Laplace equation).|$|E
25|$|One {{simple way}} to reduce the heat of {{decanting}} is to open valves slowly. With sensitive valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the <b>pressure</b> <b>increase</b> is slow on the low-pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize sharp bends and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops are present in the pipe-work to reduce vibration.|$|E

25|$|Low {{pressure}} operation. Because {{the coolant}} salts remain liquid at high temperatures, LFTR cores {{are designed to}} operate at low pressures, like 0.6 MPa (comparable to the pressure in the drinking water system) from the pump and hydrostatic pressure. Even if the core fails, there is little increase in volume. Thus the containment building cannot blow up. LFTR coolant salts are chosen to have very high boiling points. Even a several hundred degree heatup during a transient or accident does not cause a meaningful <b>pressure</b> <b>increase.</b> There is no water or hydrogen in the reactor that can cause a large pressure rise or explosion as happened during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.|$|E
25|$|Opening and {{closure of}} the stomatal pore is {{mediated}} by changes in the turgor pressure of the two guard cells.The turgor pressure of guard cells is controlled by movements of large quantities of ions and sugars {{into and out of}} the guard cells. When guard cells take up these solutes, the water potential (Ψ) inside the cells decreases (creating a hypotonic solution), causing osmotic water flow into the guard cells. This leads to a turgor <b>pressure</b> <b>increase</b> causing swelling of the guard cells and the stomatal pores open. The ions that are taken up by guard cells are mainly potassium (K+) ions and chloride (Cl−) ions. In addition guard cells take up sugars that also contribute to opening of the stomatal pores.|$|E
25|$|The {{automatic}} diluent valve (ADV) {{is used in}} a rebreather to add gas to {{the loop}} to compensate automatically for volume reduction due to <b>pressure</b> <b>increase</b> with greater depth or to make up gas lost from the system by the diver exhaling through the nose while clearing the mask or {{as a method of}} flushing the loop. They are often provided with a purge button to allow manual flushing of the loop. The ADV is virtually identical in construction and function to the open circuit demand valve, but does not have an exhaust valve. Some passive semi-closed circuit rebreathers use the ADV to add gas to the loop to compensate for a portion of the gas discharged automatically during the breathing cycle as a way of maintaining a suitable oxygen concentration.|$|E

25|$|Increases in {{barometric}} <b>pressure</b> <b>increase</b> a pendulum's period slightly due to {{the first}} two effects, by about 0.11 seconds per day per kilopascal (0.37 seconds per day per inch of mercury or 0.015 seconds per day per torr). Researchers using pendulums to measure the acceleration of gravity had to correct the period for the air pressure at the altitude of measurement, computing the equivalent period of a pendulum swinging in vacuum. A pendulum clock was first operated in a constant-pressure tank by Friedrich Tiede in 1865 at the Berlin Observatory, and by 1900 the highest precision clocks were mounted in tanks that were kept at a constant pressure to eliminate changes in atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, in some a small aneroid barometer mechanism attached to the pendulum compensated for this effect.|$|E
25|$|The stapes (stirrup) ossicle bone of {{the middle}} ear transmits {{vibrations}} to the fenestra ovalis (oval window) {{on the outside of the}} cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the vestibular duct (upper chamber of the cochlea). The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air; a <b>pressure</b> <b>increase</b> is achieved by the area ratio of the tympanic membrane to the oval window, resulting in a pressure gain of about 20 from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of impedance matching – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.|$|E
25|$|During storage, bladder {{pressure}} stays low, {{because of}} the bladder's highly compliant nature. A plot of bladder (intravesical) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder (called a cystometrogram), will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled. This phenomenon is {{a manifestation of the}} law of Laplace, which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fills, but so does the radius. Therefore, the <b>pressure</b> <b>increase</b> is slight until the organ is relatively full. The bladder's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity; however, when its nerve supply is intact, stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle.|$|E

25|$|Water vapor is a {{by-product}} of respiration in plants and animals. Its contribution to the <b>pressure,</b> <b>increases</b> as its concentration <b>increases.</b> Its partial <b>pressure</b> contribution to air <b>pressure</b> <b>increases,</b> lowering the partial pressure contribution of the other atmospheric gases (Dalton's Law). The total air pressure must remain constant. The presence of water vapor in the air naturally dilutes or displaces the other air components as its concentration increases.|$|R
25|$|The {{increase}} in pressure produced by a single stage {{is limited by the}} relative velocity between the rotor and the fluid, and the turning and diffusion capabilities of the airfoils. A typical stage in a commercial compressor will produce a <b>pressure</b> <b>increase</b> of between 15% and 60% (pressure ratios of 1.15–1.6) at design conditions with a polytropic efficiency in the region of 90–95%. To achieve different pressure ratios, axial compressors are designed with different numbers of stages and rotational speeds. As a rule of thumb we can assume that each stage in a given compressor has the same temperature rise (Delta T). Therefore, at the entry, temperature (Tstage) to each stage must increase progressively through the compressor and the ratio (Delta T)/(Tstage) entry must decrease, thus implying a progressive reduction in stage pressure ratio through the unit. Hence the rear stage develops a significantly lower pressure ratio than the first stage.|$|E
25|$|A manual {{shutdown}} {{was initiated}} {{during the middle}} of a start-up operation. The cause was a high pressure alarm that was caused by the shutting of a turbine bypass valve. The reactor was at 12% of full power when the alarm occurred at 4:03am (local time) due to a <b>pressure</b> <b>increase</b> to 1,030 psi (7,100 kPa), exceeding the regulatory limit of 1,002 psi (6,910 kPa). The reactor was reduced to 0% power, which exceeded the 5% threshold that requires event reporting, and pressure dropped back under the regulatory limit at 4:25am. Later, at 8:49am the control blades were completely inserted, constituting a manual reactor shutdown. An inspection then confirmed that one of the 8 bypass valves had closed and that the valve had a bad driving fluid connection. The reactor had been starting up following its 25th regular inspection, which had begun on October 18, 2008.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies {{of the effects of}} synephrine in humans, most of them {{focusing}} on its cardio-vascular properties, have been performed since its introduction as a synthetic drug around 1930. The paper by Stockton and co-workers is representative, describing the effects of racemic synephrine in humans with particular attention to differences resulting from different routes of administration. Thus, it was shown by these investigators that intramuscular injections (average effective dose = 200mg) of the drug produced an increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate, without affecting the diastolic pressure. The blood <b>pressure</b> <b>increase</b> reached a maximum (~25mmHg) in 5 minutes following the injection, then gradually returned to normal over the course of 1 hour. Doses of drug greater than 200mg caused side-effects such as heart palpitations, headache, sweating, and feelings of apprehension. When given intravenously, doses of 25–50mg sufficed to produce a mean maximum increase in the blood pressure of 29mmHg in 2 minutes, and a return to baseline within 30 minutes. Respiration was generally not affected during these experiments. Subcutaneous administration of synephrine in doses ≤ 200mg had no effects on blood pressure or pulse rate. Oral doses of 500–1500mg of the drug did not affect blood pressure or respiration, but pulse rate was increased by ~12%, and the highest doses caused nausea and vomiting.|$|E

2500|$|For solids and liquids like bone, {{muscle and}} blood, this added {{pressure}} {{is not much}} of a problem; but it is a problem for any air-filled spaces like the mouth, ears, paranasal sinuses and lungs. This is because the air in those spaces reduces in volume when under pressure and so does not provide those spaces with support against the higher outside pressure. Even at a depth of [...] underwater, an inability to equalize air pressure in the middle ear with outside water pressure can cause pain, and the tympanic membrane (eardrum) can rupture at depths under 10ft (3 m).
