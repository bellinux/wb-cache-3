25|$|In tournaments within {{countries}} like Taiwan where they use house conditions, spinning {{can be an}} advantage over rolling. However, when tournaments use the more conventional oil patterns, where the oil is laid from the foul line to about 40 feet, and is dry up to the <b>pin</b> <b>rack,</b> spinning loses its advantage since friction exists. Carry is also a more reliable and consistent technique of knocking pins down on the first ball, as spinning is less predictable in terms of pin deflection, and at times can result in odd leaves - including the 5-pin and wash-outs when missing the 1-pin.|$|E
2500|$|Spinners use a {{style of}} release known {{variously}} as spinning, helicopter, or UFO. Regardless of what it's known as, a spinner releases a ball such that it is rotating along a horizontal axis (the x-axis) in a counter clockwise motion (right-hander) as it moves down the lane. Spinning is a popular style in Asia, especially Taiwan, where lanes are usually oiled from the foul line to the <b>pin</b> <b>rack,</b> and present little to no opportunity for a ball thrown {{in one of the}} three more orthodox fashions to find friction on any part of the lane. A hook needs friction, in order to allow the ball to [...] "grab" [...] the lane. In spinning, very little of the ball's surface touches the lane, which is what the spinner intends. Spinning does not require friction of any kind.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rack</b> <b>Pins</b> - <b>Rack</b> <b>pins,</b> {{also called}} Open Edition (OE) or core pins, are pins {{introduced}} and sold {{until they are}} discontinued or retired. These pins are re-ordered for up to several consecutive years. The starting retail price for these pins is typically $6.95 (for a flat pin). Depending upon the number of features on the pin (such as pin-on-pin), the retail price will increase to either $8.95 or $10.95. Some OE pins have a high secondary value, such as the Soda Pop Series pins which each go in the $20 range.|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, LaBarba {{attended}} Central Jr. High School, {{and then}} Lincoln High School—both in Los Angeles. He enjoyed playing basketball, baseball, and especially football. He was the {{quarterback for the}} “lightweight" [...] (midget) football team. While in high school, he sometimes worked nights until midnight, <b>racking</b> <b>pins</b> at a bowling alley, then sleeping on a cot {{in back of the}} building. In the morning he would grab a bite to eat at the local restaurant, then head off to school about a mile away.|$|R
2500|$|If {{the first}} ball knocked down {{at least one}} <b>pin,</b> the <b>rack</b> can not be reset because of a {{subsequent}} foul. Those pins felled by a foul ball (a ball rolled into the gutter, a lobbed ball, a ball delivered by a bowler over the foot foul line)—whether standing, playable wood, or pins in the gutter—remain down and reduce {{the maximum number of}} pins to be counted for the box. Therefore, if there are six pins standing after the first ball, a foul on the next ball that manages to knock down the remaining six pins means that the frame is finished, with a score of 4. However, if the foul ball knocked down only some of the six standing pins, a third ball may still be rolled to attempt to knock down the remaining upright pins. In this example, the raw score might appear to be [...] "4 4 2 = X", but after adjusting for the foul second ball, the true score is [...] "4 F 2 = 6". Similar logic holds when rolling two good balls and fouling in the third attempt: the frame is over and only the pins felled in the first two attempts are recorded for the score for that box.|$|R
5000|$|Pallet racking {{is often}} {{bought and sold}} {{multiple}} times. Every time the pallet rack is tore down, installed and moved around, the engineered pallet rack safety clips {{that came with the}} system are lost, damaged or no longer working. Due the difficulty of identifying pallet rack those safety clips can be hard to find when searching for the manufacturer who provides them. The pallet rack safety bolt has a universal design made specifically to work with several styles of pallet rack systems including: SpaceRak, Interlake, Ridg-U-Rak Teardrop, USP, Excel Storage Products, Bulldog, Hannibal, Steel King, Wireway, and many others. The key indicator to see if the universal pallet <b>rack</b> <b>pin</b> will work with used rack systems is finding the 2 [...]30" [...] holes that align in the pallet rack cross beam and upright frame.|$|R
5000|$|Following his {{stint as}} Platoon Leader and the {{subsequent}} XO for H Co, Baker began working with the Armor and Engineering Board to draft blueprints of a revolutionary new prototype rack. The advantages of the rack's unique [...] "quick disconnect" [...] design featured the use of standard quick disconnect pins already in use as fasteners on the tank's armored skirts. These pins enabled the easy removal of the bustle rack should it become damaged during combat or training operations. Removing the handful of lower mounting <b>pins</b> allowed the <b>rack</b> to be [...] "pivoted" [...] onto the blowout panels located on top and {{to the rear of}} the turret. Pivoting the rack eliminated interference between the rack and the back deck panel, providing unobstructed access to the tank's power plant during maintenance operations. The rack became widely known around the Army's Armor community as [...] "The Baker Bustle". The rack quickly gained popularity among M1 tankers and the fielded design, though slightly modified by General Dynamics Land Systems, is still the rack seen on M1A1 tanks in combat today, though as you can see from the inset photo, some units have modified their M1's with an extended framework added to the standard bustle rack for additional stowage capacity.
