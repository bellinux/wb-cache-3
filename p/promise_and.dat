5|$|After Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson {{kept her}} <b>promise</b> <b>and</b> burned {{most of the}} poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no {{instructions}} about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest. Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published. She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance. A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{pervasive}} use of <b>promises</b> <b>and</b> threats in social life, very {{little research has}} been devoted to examining the effectiveness of these interpersonal tactics in promoting cooperation in social dilemmas. Based on the Goal-Prescribes-Rationality principle, we hypothesized that cooperation should be most strongly enhanced when <b>promises</b> <b>and</b> threats are communicated in combination, rather than in isolation. Also, we hypothesized that the combination of <b>promises</b> <b>and</b> threats should be especially effective among individuals with prosocial rather than proself orientations. Two studies provided good evidence for the latter hypothesis, in that the combination of <b>promises</b> <b>and</b> threats was only effective in people with prosocial orientations, people who are concerned with equality and collective interest.

5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their <b>promise</b> <b>and</b> returned to the Queen's side. The Queen {{made it clear that}} she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E

5|$|The Spy Who Loved Me in {{many ways}} was a pivotal film for the Bond franchise, and was plagued since its {{conception}} by many problems. The first was the departure of Bond producer Harry Saltzman, who was forced to sell his half of the Bond film franchise in 1975 for £20million. Saltzman had branched out into several other ventures of dubious <b>promise</b> <b>and</b> consequently was struggling through personal financial reversals unrelated to Bond. This was exacerbated by the twin personal tragedies of his wife's terminal cancer {{and many of the}} symptoms of clinical depression in himself.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini in September 1943, the German Army occupied Athens, where a minority of Greek Jews had sought refuge. The majority (about 60,000 {{out of a total}} population of 75,000) were deported to Nazi concentration camps, where all but 2,000 died. During this period, Princess Andrew hid Jewish widow Rachel Cohen and two of her five children, who sought to evade the Gestapo and deportation to the death camps. Rachel's husband, Haimaki Cohen, had aided King George I of Greece in 1913. In return, King George had offered him any service that he could perform, should Cohen ever need it. Cohen's son remembered this during the Nazi threat, and appealed to Princess Andrew, who with Princess Nicholas was one of only two remaining {{members of the royal family}} left in Greece. She honoured the <b>promise</b> <b>and</b> saved the Cohen family.|$|E

5|$|An Introduction was {{reviewed}} positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed <b>promise,</b> <b>and</b> {{that the book}} would have benefited from devoting more space to it. Robert Garner, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such {{a broad range of}} literature, but argued that the work was too uncritical of the concept of justice as it might apply to animals. Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation, published by Columbia University Press. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory {{was one of the first}} books to explore animals from the perspective of political theory, and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.|$|E
5|$|Apu is {{angered by}} her mother's success in math, as she herself {{continues}} {{to fail to}} understand it.

With Amar's help and constant studying, Apu manages to complete the challenge. Her mother is overjoyed, but is heartbroken when Apu informs her that she performed well in school with the sole purpose of ensuring her mother's absence at school. In her anger, Chanda breaks her <b>promise</b> <b>and</b> returns to school, performing even better than before, much to Apu's chagrin. After allotting more time to school, Chanda loses one of her four jobs and begins to work at a restaurant because Amar recommends the job.|$|E

As he is dragged through the crowd, Ned notices Arya on the statue, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her location. With Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey and the Small Council looking over him, Ned confesses to treason and swears fealty to Joffrey in front of the crowd. Satisfied, Sansa and Cersei ask Joffrey to spare Ned as Joffrey promised, but Joffrey breaks his <b>promise</b> <b>and</b> orders Ned to be executed. As Sansa watches in horror, Cersei, Varys and the Small Council attempt to intervene, and Arya tries to rescue Ned, only to be stopped by Yoren, who prevents her from seeing her father's execution.

5|$|As {{the relief}} army {{approached}} Tyana, it {{was confronted by}} the Arabs, and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were routed. According to Theophanes, the two Byzantine generals quarrelled among themselves, and their attack was disorderly. The Byzantines lost many thousand dead, and the captives also numbered in the thousands. The Arabs captured the Byzantine camp and took all the provisions they had brought along for the beleaguered city, allowing them to continue the siege. The inhabitants of Tyana now despaired of any succour, and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender. The Arabs promised {{to allow them to}} depart unharmed, and the city capitulated after a siege of nine months (in March according to Michael the Syrian, in May–June according to al-Tabari). Theophanes reports that the Arabs broke their <b>promise</b> <b>and</b> enslaved the entire population, which was deported to the Caliphate, but no other source confirms this. After looting the town, the Arabs razed it to the ground.|$|E

As the two of them grow closer through their studies, and after Keitarō accidentally reads a small section of Naru's diary, he becomes increasingly convinced that Naru may be the girl with whom he made the promise. On {{the second day of the}} Tokyo University exam, Keitarō asks Naru about the <b>promise</b> <b>and</b> is stunned when she tells him he is mistaken. Despite their studying, and Naru's mock exam results, they both fail the exams. The pair then have an argument and independently run off to Kyoto to clear their heads. While on their trip they settle their differences and meet Mutsumi Otohime, who lives in Okinawa and is also studying for the Tokyo University exams.|$|E
5|$|Before long, Leo {{broke his}} <b>promise</b> <b>and</b> refused to return Bagras to the Templars. He {{also decided to}} {{terminate}} the union of the Armenian Church with Rome. On the other hand, he granted fortresses to the Teutonic Knights in Cilicia. He also arranged the marriage of Raymond-Roupen with Helvis, sister of Hugh I of Cyprus. Leo ambushed a caravan which had been transporting provisions to the Templars in 1211. In the skirmish, Guillaume de Chartres, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, was badly injured. News of Leo's action shocked Pope Innocent, who forbade all Christian rulers to assist Leo and urged John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem, to intervene on the Templars' behalf. John sent fifty knights to Northern Syria to fight against Leo. Leo expelled the Latin priests from Cilicia and gave shelter to the Orthodox Patriarch, Symenon, who had been driven out of Antioch. He dispatched Raymond-Roupen to plunder the region of Antioch in 1212.|$|E
