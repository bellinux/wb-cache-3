40|$|Abstract – Averaged switch {{approach}} is {{extended to the}} modeling of boundary conduction mode (BCM) dc-to-dc converters that operate at the boundary between continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). BCM dc-to-dc converters have smaller inductor size and reduced switching losses compared to CCM, and lower peak current compared to DCM. The large-signal BCM averaged switch model shows that several BCM converters with input voltage feedforward exhibit resistive or nearly resistive input characteristic, which is well suited for realization of power factor correctors. It is shown that BCM converters exhibit simpler dynamics compared to CCM current <b>programmed</b> <b>control</b> (CPM). Small-signal frequency responses predicted by the averaged switch model are verified by simulation and experiments. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{unsteady}} aerodynamics of {{the delta}} planform, high cross range, shuttle orbiter were investigated. It {{has been found that}} these vehicles are subject to five unsteady flow phenomena that could compromise the flight dynamics. They are: (1) leeside shock induced separation, (2) sudden leading edge stall, (3) vortex burst, (4) bow shock-flap shock interaction, (5) forebody vorticity. Trajectory shaping is seen as the most powerful means of avoiding the detrimental effects of the stall phenomena. However, stall must be fixed or controlled when traversing the stall region. The other phenomena may be controlled by carefully <b>programmed</b> <b>control</b> deflections and some configuration modification. Ways to alter the occurrence of the various flow conditions are explored...|$|E
