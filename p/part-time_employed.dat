50|$|As {{yet some}} female {{employees}} decide to have children, the following {{can be observed}} in the employment rate: while {{at the beginning of the}} working life the employment rate is still the same between men and women, the employment rate of women drops significantly in the family phase between 25-40 years. Many well-qualified mothers can not work, because of inadequate child care, or work only part-time.

50|$|The {{ratio of}} {{full-time}} workers was 86.5% in January 1968 {{and hit a}} historical low of 79.9% in January 2010. There is a long-term trend of gradual reduction in the share of full-time workers since 1970, with recessions resulting in {{a decline in the}} full-time share of the workforce faster than the overall trend, with partial reversal during recovery periods. For example, {{as a result of the}} 2007-2009 recession, the ratio of full-time employed to total employed fell from 83.1% in December 2007 to a trough of 79.9% in January 2010, before steadily rising to 81.6% by April 2016. Stated another way, the share of <b>part-time</b> <b>employed</b> to total employed rose from 16.9% in December 2007 to a peak of 20.1% in January 2010, before steadily falling to 18.4% in April 2016.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{buildings}} are owned and administered by self-governing and economically independent organizations, the State of Denmark is strongly regulating public housing in the country. By law, the municipalities have access to 25% of the rentals, usually reserving them for the poor, the unemployed, the disabled or mentally ill or any other group dependent on social benefits from the municipality. Over the years, these regulations has created many 'especially vulnerable residential areas' - socalled [...] "ghettos" [...] - within the country. The Danish Public Housing has never had any income restrictions, {{but in recent years}} new state regulations has made it mandatory for several of them to favor fully employed renters and disfavor unemployed or <b>part-time</b> <b>employed</b> people. This is a relatively new effort by the state to counter the ghettofication, which is now an officially recognized problem countrywide.|$|E

40|$|The author investigates how {{maternal}} employment affects when {{during the}} day that employed mothers engage in enriching childcare and whether they adjust their work schedules {{to spend time with}} their children at more-desirable times of day. Using data from the American Time Use Survey and focusing on mothers of pre-school-aged children, he finds that both full- and <b>part-time</b> <b>employed</b> mothers shift enriching childcare time from workdays to non-workdays. On workdays, full-time employed mothers shift enriching care time to evenings, whereas <b>part-time</b> <b>employed</b> mothers shift care time very little. The author finds no evidence that mothers working full time adjust their work schedules to spend enriching time with their children at more preferred times of the day. In contrast, <b>part-time</b> <b>employed</b> mothers shift their work hours to later in the day in order to spend time with their children at more-desirable times of day...|$|E

40|$|Rejecting the {{standard}} less-than-thirty-five-hours-per-week categorization of part-time workers, this paper offers an empirically-justified {{definition of the}} <b>part-time</b> <b>employed.</b> The definition {{is based on the}} distinction through wage payments that employers make between a high-hours (full-time) and a low-hours (part-time) group of workers. A switching regression model of wage equations with deterministic, but unknown, sample selection is estimated resulting in a significant split between high-hours and low-hours workers that is higher than {{the standard}} definition. Wage differentials are calculated and decomposed, and estimates from the structural choice model are presented.

30|$|The {{probability}} of being inactive in t is not increased by taking up {{a part-time job}} compared to having a full-time job in t− 1. The probabilities are 0.082 versus 0.113 when being high-paid and 0.138 versus 0.136 when being low-paid. Furthermore, the {{probability of}} being inactive is significantly larger when being unemployed (0.301) or inactive (0.708) in t− 1 instead of <b>part-time</b> <b>employed</b> in t− 1. Hence, working part-time in the past significantly increases the probability {{of being in the}} labor force in present. The same figures reveal that a low-paid part-time job in t− 1 goes along with a significantly higher probability of being inactive than a high-paid part-time job in t− 1 (0.138 versus 0.082).|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{temporary}} employment has gained importance in the European Union. The implications of this development {{for the health of}} the workforce are not yet established. Using a unique individual-level data set for 27 European countries, this paper evaluates whether temporary employment is interrelated with self-assessed health. We find pronounced differences in self-assessed health by employment status across European countries. Furthermore, in the EU full-time permanent employed workers report the best health, followed by temporary and <b>part-time</b> <b>employed</b> workers. These differences largely vanish, when taking into account the potential endogeneity between employment status and self-assessed health. However, repeated temporary contracts have a significant negative impact on health. Temporary employment; fixed-term contracts; self-assessed health...|$|E

Open-end contracts are still in the majority, but the number of non-permanent contracts is constantly growing [29].
