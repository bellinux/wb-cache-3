5000|$|Often, {{the first}} step in the EBSD process after <b>pattern</b> <b>collection</b> is indexing. This allows for {{identification}} of the crystal orientation at the single volume of the sample from where the pattern was collected. With EBSD software, pattern bands are typically detected via a mathematical routine using a modified Hough transform, in which every pixel in Hough space denotes a unique line/band in the EBSP. The Hough transform is used to enable band detection, which are difficult to locate by computer in the original EBSP. Once the band locations have been detected it is possible to relate these locations to the underlying crystal orientation, as angles between bands represent angles between lattice planes. Thus when the position / angles between three bands are known an orientation solution can be determined. In highly symmetric materials, typically more than three bands are utilised to obtain and verify the orientation measurement.|$|E

40|$|Classification {{of protein}} {{sequence}} {{is one of}} the foundations of bioinformatics, as new proteins are sequenced every day. Each protein sequence represents a protein of a certain family and its function can sometimes be predicted through sequence classification. Today several approaches exist for sequence classification, and in this work pattern approaches are considered. A pattern is an expression, representing a certain protein family, which corresponding protein sequences hopefully match. PROSITE is a <b>pattern</b> <b>collection</b> that well known in the area of bioinformatics and therefore plays an important part in this project together with the MAMA <b>pattern</b> <b>collection.</b> Evaluation of patterns today focus on accuracy, i. e. sensitivity and specificity, but in this thesis information content is also considered. The intended experiment which was about discovering any relationship between accuracy and information content showed that no clear connection was found. This fact led to the conclusion that information content might not be suitable as an evaluation measure when evaluating patterns. The second experiment concerned the fact that sometimes the same sequences are used both during training and testing, which probably gives misleadingly high accuracy values. This fact gave birth to the idea that an independent test set other than the training set reduces accuracy values, which was revealed after a number of tests. Finally the last experiment, which was about creating a new system for evaluating whole pattern collections, is presented with results showing that MAMA performs better than PROSITE according to this system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method of user terminal positioning in cellular networks. A pattern matching technology based on received-signal-strength (RSS) {{from the pilot}} channels of cell towers {{has been the most}} popular network-based positioning method. In response to a position request, a terminal measures RSSs of pilot channels from surrounding cell towers and then the terminal’s RSS pattern is compared with a pattern database to find the most correlated one which indicates the position of the terminal. Although the pattern matching method can provide accurate positioning, its database construction and maintenance require a high overhead of periodic labor-intensive <b>pattern</b> <b>collection.</b> In this paper, we propose to exploit the call data records (CDRs) that are uploaded by Assisted Global Positioning System (AGPS) terminals as inputs to the pattern database, which removes or reduces the <b>pattern</b> <b>collection</b> overhead. In AGPS systems, terminals measure satellite signals and cellular network parameters (such as RSS) and relay them to the cellular infrastructure, which in turn calculates the terminal position using both that satellite and cellular network data. The proposed AGPS CDR based pattern matching method takes advantage of the increasing number of AGPS terminals in service: non-AGPS terminals can obtain more precise positioning results in areas where more AGPS calls are generated (e. g. hotspots). To do so, we analyze the characteristics of RSS patterns and AGPS CDRs. Based on the analysis, a pattern-distance metric and an AGPS CDR based pattern matching system are proposed an...|$|E

I wanted to try to mix my personal view of domestic graphic expression with another language that I gained in recent years. This I wanted {{to do in order to}} find the tools that could help me clarify and develop my pattern signature. A few of the questions that I had about this project were if the long scetching phase that I planned would help or damage the project.

I wanted to see how far I dared to go in matter of colours as well as how the patterns would be visually experienced if I for example reduced one colour or replaced it with the opposite colour. I thought it was inspiring to work with traditional techniques with the colours. It was only positive that part of the pattern story telling was developed in an unpredicted direction during the scetching phase. I also realised that a long scetching phase is not suitable as a working process for all types of patterns, it has to be decided on a case-to-case basis.

Among these advantages, discussed in the paper, the main is that no motion is required upon diffraction <b>pattern</b> <b>collection.</b> However, the reliability of EDXD results may be compromised by the presence of an electronic noise that, along with a broadening of the Bragg peaks, may induce a shift of their positions.
