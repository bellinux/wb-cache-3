5|$|Sedna {{will come}} to {{perihelion}} around 2075–2076. This close approach to the Sun <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for study that will not occur again for 12,000 years. Although Sedna is listed on NASA's Solar System exploration website, NASA is not known to be considering any type of mission at this time. It was calculated that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on launch dates of 6 May 2033 and 23 June 2046. Sedna would be 77.27 or 76.43AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives.|$|E

This <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards.
