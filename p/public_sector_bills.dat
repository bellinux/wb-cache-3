40|$|This paper {{develops}} a medium-scale dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium (DSGE) model for fiscal policy simulations. Relative to existing models of this type, our model incorporates two important features. First, we consider a two-country monetary union structure, {{which makes it}} well suited to simulate fiscal measures by relatively large countries in a currency area. Second, we provide a notable degree of disaggregation on the government expenditures side, by explicitly distinguishing between (productivity-enhancing) public investment, public purchases and the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wage <b>bill.</b> In addition, we consider a labor market characterized by search and matching frictions, which allows to analyze the response of equilibrium unemployment to fiscal measures. In order to illustrate some of its applications, and motivated by recent policy debate in the Euro Area, we calibrate the model to Spain {{and the rest of}} the area and simulate a number of fiscal consolidation scenarios. We find that, in terms of output and employment losses, fiscal consolidation is the least damaging when achieved by reducing the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wage <b>bill,</b> whereas it is most damaging when carried out by cutting public investment.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of the impact of the}} economic crisis is how pay in the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> responds - in the face not only of the evolution of pay in the private sector, but also extreme pressure on public spending (of which pay is a very large proportion) as fiscal deficits soar. What are the effects on the income distribution of cutting <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> pay rates or alternative strategies to reduce the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> pay <b>bill,</b> and how do these vary depending on the evolution of pay in the private sector? This paper investigates these issues using data and a tax-benefit simulation for Ireland, a country which faces a particularly severe fiscal crisis and where innovative measures have already been implemented to claw back pay from <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> workers in the guise of a "pensions levy", followed most recently by a significant cut in nominal pay rates. The SWITCH tax-benefit model first allows the distributional effects of these measures, which achieved a substantial reduction in the net <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> pay <b>bill,</b> to be teased out. The overall impact on the income distribution, set against alternative scenarios for pay in the private sector, is assessed. This provides empirical evidence relevant to policy choices in relation to a key aspect of household income over which governments have direct influence, while at the same time illustrating methodologically how a tax-benefit model can serve as the base for such investigation. ...|$|R

The issue is topical again given the current negotiations between the trade unions and the government on a possible extension of the Croke Park agreement. In negotiating this extended agreement, the government is seeking to reduce its public service pay and pensions bill by a further € 1 billion between 2013 and 2015.

40|$|Structurally, the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> {{has a more}} {{important}} economic {{role to play in}} developing countries than in industrial countries, particularly in how it affects labor markets. Evidence from many developing countries shows that <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> pay, employment, and performance are hurting the labor markets'ability to allocate workers among sectors and skill requirements. In many countries, the civil service and the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wage <b>bill</b> have grown to unsustainably high levels. The <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> is so big that interventions in the sector - with or without spillover effects into the nonpublic sector - {{make it more difficult for}} wages and employment to respond to shifts in demand and supply. Nonwage benefits are seldom related to productivity, so they can be particularly distorting. At the same time, a long-term drop in real civil service wages and the compression of wage ranges have caused critical shortages of managerial and technical workers in the civil service. The resulting skill imbalances in the rest of the domestic economy reduce international competitiveness in some countries. Policy reform has focused on the reform of large, inefficient <b>public</b> <b>sectors</b> because of their cumulative negative effects on economic growth and competitiveness. Policies to adjust relative prices from nontradables toward tradables have led to some movement of employment out of the <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> but significant rigidities remain. Workers are attracted to the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> because of complex economic and social incentives that are difficult to change - and the relationship between <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> interventions and the underlying political and economic forces is an important area for research.

The <b>public</b> <b>sector's</b> domestic debt was substantial, however, {{and the high}} interest rates drove the <b>public</b> <b>sector's</b> interest <b>bill</b> considerably above its non-interest surplus. The <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> could therefore cover its interest bill only by taking on additional debt. Because the interest bill was so large, domestic debt grew rapidly. Hyperinflation resulted when the outstanding debt became larger than domestic financial markets could be persuaded to hold. The Central Bank played a focal role in these processes. It issued interest-bearing debt in the forms of remunerated bank reserves,"inaccesible deposits,"and Central Bank bills, to absorb money. The interest bill on these liabilities generated mounting"quasi-fiscal"borrowing requirements, which the Central Bank financed through additional debt issues. This debt was held mainly by commercial banks who financed themselves through high-yielding short-term deposits. Hyperinflationary pressure developed when depositors, perceiving that the Central Bank's debt accumulation was becoming excessive, withdrew and moved rapidly into foreign exchange, engendering heavy devaluation pressure.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the combined impact of the employment guarantee for graduates and <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> compensation policies on the Egyptian labor market. Besides contributing to an unsustainable rate {{of growth in the}} government labor force, these policies have encouraged queuing for government jobs, contributed to high graduate unemployment rates, and reduced the employment of graduates in the private sector. Despite substantial wage erosion in the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> in recent years, government wages, when appropriately corrected for observed heterogeneity and sample selection, are on a par with, or higher than, private sector wages, especially for graduates. When combined with the more desirable nonwage aspects of government jobs, these compensation levels explain the attractiveness of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> employment to graduates. Government pay scales are especially advantageous to female secondary school graduates, who appear to face considerable discrimination in the private <b>sector.</b> The <b>public</b> <b>sector’s</b> role in shaping labor market outcomes through its hiring and compensation policies takes on special importance in Egypt because of the country’s long-standing policy of guaranteeing employment in the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> for all graduates of secondary and postsecondary institutions. When the policy was first instituted in the early 1960 s, its impact was relatively limited because of the small number of eligible graduates, but, over time, it has had major consequences for the Egyptian labor market and economy. The employment guarantee fueled the growth in demand for secondary and university education, which has, in turn, led to rapid growth in <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> employment and in the number of aspirants to such employment. When the growth of the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wage <b>bill</b> became unsustainable in the early 1980 s, the government responded by eroding real <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wages and extending the waiting period for government jobs.

While government spending and employment can be considered as complements to private sector as they provide the infrastructure for private sector activity, they can also induce adverse effects. As such, the goal of this project was to provide an analysis of private sector given the raise of the public wage bill in Kosovo. Additionally, this project was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the wage increases in <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> with a special focus on the education sector. Based on the outcomes of such analysis, I provide recommendations as to how to provide assistance to private sector as the sector that has the capacity to trigger growth and development. The recommendations were made as to suggest that policy makers in Kosovo need to employ mechanisms that will create a favorable environment for an effective <b>public</b> and private <b>sector,</b> and as such avoid wage increases as instruments to win elections and silent the labor unions. The project followed a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis approach. The focus of this project was the analysis of existing data regarding the size and wages of <b>public</b> and private <b>sector.</b> One <b>public</b> high school, two private companies and the Union of Independent Trade Unions of Kosovo were subject to analysis. One limitation to this project was the lack of data especially for private sector, as many companies hesitate to provide data regarding the compensation they offer. Therefore, 5 interviews and a survey were conducted to collect data that could not be obtained otherwise, and in so doing get a better understanding of the outcomes of the public wage increases for private sector. The outcomes of analysis show that the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> has increased its size in the economy with no significant improvements in performance or service delivery. The evaluation of the interactions between the growing <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wage <b>bill</b> and private <b>sector</b> appears to suggest that the latter suffers from insufficient skilled labor supply, pressure to increase wages, higher employee turnover and direct difficulties to compete with <b>public</b> <b>sector...</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{decrease}} in workers’ outside option through a {{decrease in}} unemployment benefits or public-sector wages and {{a decrease in}} union’s bargaining power unambiguously decreases private-sector wage claims and makes it more attractive for firms to create jobs. Because of lower labor costs, firms decide to dismiss fewer people, which decreases unemployment. Furthermore, they lower prices. The latter makes Spanish goods cheaper, which fosters exports and improves the terms of trade. Higher production and less unemployment improve fiscal balances. Additionally, they are directly affected by the fact that a cut in the policy-induced expenditure item (unemployment benefits and the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wage <b>bill)</b> immediately decreases expenditures. According to our model simulations, these measures have the highest impact on output, employment, international competitiveness and fiscal balances compared to the other measures. In principle, the argumentation also holds for a cut in public employment. However, given that higher private labor demand cannot compensate for the decrease in public employment, unemployment will increase. This, first, diminishes the magnitude of the positive effects resulting from the other two measures just described and, second, may induce firms to dismiss relatively unproductive workers more frequently and to search for more productive ones in the pool of unemployed workers, even though this is costly. As unemployment has increased, search costs may fall to a sufficient extent for such behavior to pay off from the firms’ perspective.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} Botswana's medium-term {{fiscal sustainability}} {{in view of}} the expected depletion of diamonds in the future. The analysis shows that in the absence of policy adjustments, Botswana's current fiscal policy strategy is unsustainable over the longer term, which could endanger macroeconomic stability and Botswana's reputation as Africa's success story. Ensuring medium-term sustainability of Botswana's public finances requires stronger revenue collection, through improved revenue administration, greater tax enforcement, and the rationalization of tax exemptions in order to realize the full revenue potential. Opportunities also exist to generate more revenue from the non-mining sector through changes in the tax regime. At the same time, the government needs to maximize the effectiveness of public expenditure and bring down public spending to levels that are more in line with long-term revenue prospects. A greater control over the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wage <b>bill</b> is critically important. In-house capacity for macroeconomic monitoring and fiscal analysis also needs to be enhanced further. Looking ahead, growth of a dynamic non-mining sector is crucial for Botswana not only from the fiscal sustainability point of view, but {{from the point of view}} of achieving balanced development that will create jobs and deliver durable reduction in poverty and inequality. Fiscal policy will have to play a central role in this process. Debt Markets,Economic Theory&Research,Public Sector Expenditure Policy,Access to Finance,Public Sector Economics...|$|R
40|$|This 2005 Article IV Consultation {{highlights}} {{that economic}} performance in Ghana has improved since 2000, {{with the economy}} growing at its fastest pace {{in more than a}} decade. In 2004, real GDP growth reached 5. 8 percent, driven by agriculture and a strong pickup in the services and construction sectorsâ€”helped by increased bank credit and private inward remittances. Ghana’s medium-term prospects appear promising, with growth projected to continue at the current relatively high rate, provided that macroeconomic stability becomes further entrenched with fiscal sustainability, inflation declines further, and the government perseveres with structural reform.

The interim relief provided under the enhanced HIPC Initiative has allowed the government to increase social spending. Controlling the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wage <b>bill</b> and maintaining strong revenue collection is critical for sustaining a stable macroeconomic framework and adequate poverty reduction efforts.

The Cambodian {{economy grew}} by 5. 2 percent in 2003 compared with 5. 5 percent in 2002, led by continued growth in garments exports, a rebound in overall investments and an upward surge in agricultural production. The drop in {{foreign direct investment}} {{has been more than}} compensated by domestic private investment and higher consumption induced by higher public spending. Moreover, the weakness in the service sector receipts has been offset by continued strong growth in garments exports.
