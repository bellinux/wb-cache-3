5|$|The 400-series {{highways}} are {{a network}} of controlled-access highways throughout the southern portion of the Canadian province of Ontario, forming a special subset of the provincial highway system. They are analogous to the Interstate Highway System in the United States or the Autoroute system of neighbouring Quebec, but under <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and regulated by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). Although Ontario had been constructing divided highways for two decades prior, 400-series designations were introduced in 1952. Initially only Highways400, 401 and 402 were numbered; other designations followed in the subsequent decades.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution Act, 1982, did {{not change}} the {{divisions}} of responsibilities between the provincial and the federal legislatures, except for the <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over natural resources and energy, which was clarified and slightly expanded.|$|E
25|$|Each {{province}} and territory {{is considered a}} separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters. As such, only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law. Each has its own procedural law, statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province. This is the highest court in <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions. All {{but one of the}} provinces of Canada use a common law system (the exception being Quebec, which uses a civil law system for issues arising within <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> such as property ownership and contracts).|$|E
2500|$|The BNA Act {{defined the}} areas of {{jurisdiction}} for the provinces and the federal government. There are 29 exclusive federal <b>jurisdictions</b> and 16 <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> The <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> are listed under sections 92, 93 and 95 of the constitution.|$|R

25|$|Canada's {{thirteen}} {{provinces and}} territories have adopted widely diverging policies {{with regard to}} minority-language services for their respective linguistic minorities. Given {{the wide range of}} services, such as policing, health care and education, that fall under <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> these divergences have considerable importance.|$|E
25|$|The federal {{government}} is partially limited by powers assigned to the provincial legislatures; for example, the Canadian constitution created broad <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over direct taxation and property and civil rights. Many disputes between the two levels of government revolve around conflicting interpretations {{of the meaning of}} these powers.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} is constituted {{by the majority}} party and it is responsible to the National Assembly.

25|$|Civil {{status is}} of <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in Canada. However, the {{definition}} of marriage is a federal law.

25|$|The Brussels Region is {{the only}} one in Belgium that is not {{subdivided}} into provinces, nor is it a province itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions. Remaining is only the governor of Brussels-Capital and some aides. Its status is roughly akin to that of a federal district.|$|E
25|$|Parliament may invoke {{emergency}} powers under the emergency branch of POGG. This began in 1882, when the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (then the supreme authority over Canadian law) ruled in Russell v. The Queen {{that the federal}} government could legislate with regard to alcohol, because even though this would probably have been considered <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in ordinary circumstances, the federal government was acting to ensure order in Canada. This concept further evolved during the 1920s, when in the 1922 Board of Commerce case, it was stated that POGG could be invoked in times of war and famine, to allow Parliament to intervene in matters of <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> POGG was later used this way in the Anti-Inflation Reference of 1976, when the Supreme Court of Canada allowed Parliament to regulate inflation {{on the grounds that it}} posed a considerable economic problem for Canada. In that case, a great degree of deference was exercised in accepting what the federal government deemed to be an emergency.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1930s, {{as noted}} succinctly in the Fish Canneries Reference and then {{subsequently}} in the Aeronautics Reference, {{the division of}} responsibilities between federal and <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> was summarized as follows by Lord Sankey: ...|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} {{discussion}} {{as to whether}} Canadian jurisprudence ought to adopt an approach similar to the dormant commerce clause doctrine in the United States, {{in order to better}} address conflicts between the federal and <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b>|$|R
25|$|The federal-provincial {{distribution}} of legislative powers (also {{known as the}} division of powers) defines {{the scope of the}} federal and provincial legislatures. These have been identified as exclusive to the federal or <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> or shared by all.|$|R
25|$|Education in Canada is for {{the most}} part {{provided}} publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments. Education is within <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and the curriculum is overseen by the province. Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary education and post-secondary. Within the provinces under the ministry of education, there are district school boards administering the educational programs.|$|E
25|$|County councils were {{abolished}} {{with the}} rural areas outside cities, towns and villages coming under direct <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> The 1969 Official Languages Act made French an official language, on par with English. Linguistic tensions rose on both sides, with the militant Parti Acadien enjoying brief popularity in the 1970s and Anglophone groups pushing to repeal language reforms in the 1980s, led by the Confederation of Regions Party. By the 1990s however linguistic tensions had mostly evaporated.|$|E
25|$|Canadian Federal Courts {{operate under}} a {{separate}} system throughout Canada {{and deal with}} narrower subject matter than superior courts in <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution, such as immigration, intellectual property, judicial review of federal government decisions, and admiralty. The Federal Court of Appeal is the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities, and unlike the United States, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal is not divided into appellate circuits.|$|E

25|$|The monarchy of Canada is at {{the core}} of both Canada's federal {{structure}} and Westminster-style of parliamentary and constitutional democracy. The monarchy is the foundation of the executive (Queen-in-Council), legislative (Queen-in-Parliament), and judicial (Queen-on-the-Bench) within both the federal and each <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> The sovereign is the personification of the Canadian state and is Canada as a matter of constitutional law. The current Canadian monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, who has reigned since 6 February 1952. Elizabeth's eldest son, Prince Charles, is heir apparent.|$|E
25|$|What tribunals {{all have}} in common is that they are created by statute, their adjudicators are usually {{appointed}} by government, and they focus on very particular and specialized areas of law. Because some subject matters (e.g., immigration) fall within federal jurisdiction while others (e.g., liquor licensing and workers' compensation) in <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> some tribunals are created by federal law while others are created by provincial law. There are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subject matters such as unionized labour and human rights.|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} {{mention is}} made in the procedure for amendments affecting what falls within the federal/provincial distribution of powers. Therefore, they can be dealt with generally under s. 38, or with respect to specific provinces under s. 43. However, a s. 38 amendment in that regard will not apply to a province that has passed a resolution of dissent from it, and s. 40 states that a s. 38 amendment that transfers <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over an education or cultural matter to Parliament must be accompanied by reasonable compensation by Canada to the provinces.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) {{regulates the}} {{collection}} and use of personal data and electronic documents by public and private organizations.

50|$|The {{foremost}} {{responsibilities of}} the Parlement of Brittany were the processing of appeals against judgements in civil matters rather than criminal matters.

25|$|Canadian royal {{symbols are}} {{the visual and}} {{auditory}} identifiers of the Canadian monarchy, including the viceroys, in the country's federal and <b>provincial</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> These may specifically distinguish organizations that derive their authority from the Crown (such as parliament or police forces), establishments with royal associations, or merely be ways of expressing loyal or patriotic sentiment.|$|R
