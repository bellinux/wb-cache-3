This Lewis gun was later replaced by two 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Bredas in the waist mounts, which were more reliable and faster firing (900 rounds/min instead of 500), even though there was sufficient room in the fuselage for only one man to operate them.

40|$|Multiple factors act conjointly to {{influence}} the risk of injury of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee. An understanding of neuromuscular factors remains necessary, although this does not guarantee a complete analysis of the risks of injury to the anterior cruciate ligament. Women have {{a greater risk of}} injury to the anterior cruciate ligament in comparison to men. This can be explained by an increase in the internal rotation of the hip, coupled with an increase in the external rotation of the tibia and increased muscular activation of the quadriceps (with a concomitant decrease in hamstring activity) during landing or <b>pivotal</b> <b>movements.</b> In addition, muscular fatigue of the hamstrings and a weak hamstring/quadriceps ratio could contribute to the risk of injury to the anterior cruciate ligament. Finally, a lack of relative joint laxity can also constitute a risk factor of injury to the anterior cruciate ligament in women. Other potential neuromuscular risk factors could also be highlighted. Screening for these risk factors, for example, by means of a functional jump-landing test, together with an isokinetic test, could help to recommend new prevention protocols. The aim of this review was to discuss the risk factors for the rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee. In conclusion, thanks to an overall knowledge of all the possible risk factors (intrinsic and extrinsic, modifiable or not), sports people who are predisposed to a recurrence of rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament could be identified.

40|$|My senior thesis {{examines}} individual leaders, organizations, and newspapers, in {{an attempt}} to explore exactly who supported or critiqued China, how these perceptions changed over time, and why some of these figures came to recognize China as an ally during the early twentieth century. Different strands of black internationalism emerged between 1917 and 1919. Using a wide disposal of ideological weapons, black American leaders in cities like Chicago and New York formulated their opinions of China based on the combinations of various ideologies, their own experiences with colonialism and U. S. racism, and the economic inequalities rampant in metropolitan areas. I explore the writings of W. E. B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, Hubert Harrison, A. Phillip Randolph, among others, to determine why these leaders supported and/or dismissed China's struggle. Newspapers served as political agents and were responsible for making international events accessible to local populations. I have primarily relied on two black newspapers, the Chicago Defender and New York Amsterdam News. I also examine the NAACP's Crisis Magazine, the United Negro Improve Association's Negro World, The Messenger, and the Student Association Newsletter. I explore African American responses to <b>pivotal</b> <b>movements</b> in Chinese history. Indeed, black Americans looked with great interest at the 1911 Revolution, the anti-Christianity and anti-imperialist movement during the 1920 s, as well as {{the early stages of the}} Second Sino-Japanese war. From their analyses of China, many black Americans found models for development. During China's protest against Christianity and imperialism, the Defender looked at China's use of the boycott as a strategy against job discrimination. In 1937, the Defender reaffirmed a common struggle by concluding that both the Chinese and millions of black American's "have no national program, no leadership, and no unity. " According to the weekly, unity among both groups was essential to bright about the "miracle of racial cohesion. " In this thesis, I argue that by examining the African American encounter with China between 1900 and 1939, we can better understand the long civil rights movement of the north. As recent scholars have shown, African Americans living in northern cities saw the connections between 1960 s black America and the third world. Through an analyses of African American perceptions of China, we discover that the roots of the 1960 s critique of the black community as a colony can be traced to 1920 s Chicago and Harlem. Indeed, throughout the twentieth century, African Americans have always had an international perspective, which helped clarify and develop methods of protest against racism and economic exploitation at home. By analyzing the affairs of colonized, non-white peoples, black Americans recognized that imperialist nations exploited others both because of a racialist perspective and because of a demand for resources. In short, the African American encounter with China allowed many to see the linkage between the assorted elements of exploitation...|$|R

Here, we {{establish a}} mechanism for Src activation by integrins. c-Src is shown to bind constitutively and selectively to β 3 integrins through an interaction involving the c-Src SH 3 domain and the carboxyl-terminal region of the β 3 cytoplasmic tail. Clustering of β 3 integrins in vivo activates c-Src and induces phosphorylation of Tyr- 418 in the c-Src activation loop, a reaction essential for adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of Syk, a c-Src substrate. Unlike c-Src, Hck, Lyn, and c-Yes bind more generally to β 1 A, β 2, and β 3 cytoplasmic tails. These results invoke a model whereby Src is primed for activation by direct interaction with an integrin β tail, and integrin clustering stabilizes activated Src by inducing intermolecular autophosphorylation. The data provide a paradigm for integrin regulation of Src and a molecular basis for the similar functional defects of osteoclasts or platelets from mice lacking β 3 integrins or c-Src...|$|R

40|$|Attention {{to the use}} of {{new media}} by social {{movements}} rose rapidly following groundbreaking global protests: The Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and the "Indignados" Movement in Spain. However, determinism and rhetoric of newness have led to phrases like "Twitter Revolution," while tools and gadgets often overshadow human agency and grassroots efforts. In fact, media and grassroots strategies have worked hand-in-hand and have been <b>pivotal</b> to social <b>movements</b> throughout history. Through a comparative analysis of the Farm Workers Movement of the 1960 s and the contemporary Immigrant Youth Movement, this work examines media strategies by emphasizing concrete media practices of movement actors. With a grounded approach that incorporates participant observation, semi-structured interviews, archival research, and literature reviews, this study provides cross-historical insight into media strategies in social movements. Particularly, this work covers external and internal media strategies, media practice, framing, community media practice, and capacity building. It concludes with a comparative analysis of how movement media strategies are related to movement goals, aims, and outcomes. by Rogelio Alejandro Lopez. Thesis (S. M.)
