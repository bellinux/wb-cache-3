Methods: Legislation, codes of ethics, standards of practice and guidance documents that apply {{to the practice of}} pharmacy in each Canadian jurisdiction were systematically collected and examined to identify if, and how, these instruments establish professional duties in regard to natural health products. Results: The majority of Canadian jurisdictions now include some explicit reference to natural health products in standards of practice policy or guideline documents. Often natural health products are simply assumed {{to be included in the}} over-the-counter (OTC) product category and thus professional responsibilities for OTCs are relevant for natural health products.

40|$|Motivations {{to gamble}} {{are known to}} vary by gender and by type of {{gambling}} form, with stronger motivations associated with problem gambling. However, {{little is known about}} cultural differences in gambling motivations, with most previous research based on mainstream western populations and providing little insight into gambling motivations amongst minority groups. This chapter helps to address this gap in knowledge by examining gambling motivations amongst 1, 259 Indigenous Australian respondents to a gambling survey conducted at several Indigenous cultural and sporting events, in Aboriginal communities and online. This survey represents the largest quantitative study of Australian Indigenous gambling to date. Differences in gambling motivations were examined between male and female Indigenous Australians, by main gambling form and by problem gambling severity. While motive orientations were similar to those found in general population surveys, the strength of these motives was proportionately higher amongst the Indigenous Australians, particularly amongst problem gamblers. In particular, the general tendency for women with gambling problems to gamble on electronic gaming machines (EGMs) as an avoidance-based coping mechanism was mirrored in this study, but of additional concern is the higher proportion of Indigenous women who gamble to escape compared to general population figures. Substantial proportions of indigenous men also reported escape-motivated gambling. While substantial efforts are needed to reduce life problems amongst Indigenous Australians and the social and structural inequities they face, providing alternative stress-reduction diversionary activities, promoting better coping strategies and targeted <b>public</b> <b>messaging</b> would also be beneficial to limit gambling-associated harm for this population. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{fundamental}} limits to secret key generation from an excited distributed source (EDS). In an EDS {{a pair of}} terminals observe dependent sources of randomness excited by a pre-arranged signal. We first determine the secret key capacity for such systems with one-way <b>public</b> <b>messaging.</b> We then characterize a tradeoff between the secret key rate and exponential bounds on the probability of key agreement failure and on the secrecy of the key generated. We find {{that there is a}} fundamental tradeoff between reliability and secrecy. We then explore this framework within the context of reciprocal wireless channels. In this setting, the users transmit pre-arranged excitation signals to each other. When the fading is Rayleigh, the observations of the users are jointly Gaussian sources. We show that an on-off excitation signal with an SNR-dependent duty cycle achieves the secret key capacity of this system. Furthermore, we characterize a fundamental metric [...] minimum energy per key bit for reliable key generation [...] and show that in contrast to conventional AWGN channels, there is a non-zero threshold SNR that achieves the minimum energy per key bit. The capacity achieving on-off excitation signal achieves the minimum energy per key bit at any SNR below the threshold. Finally, we build off our error exponent results to investigate the energy required to generate a key using a finite block length. Again we find that on-off excitation signals yield an improvement when compared to constant excitation signals. In addition to Rayleigh fading, we analyze the performance of a system based on binary channel phase quantization. Comment: accepted for publication, IEEE Transactions on Information Theor...|$|E

40|$|Background In {{contrast}} to the gradual pace of conventional vaccine trials, evaluation of influenza vaccines often must be accelerated {{for use in a}} pandemic or for annual re-licensure. Descriptions of how best to design studies for rapid completion are few. Purpose In August, 2010, we conducted a rapid trial with a seasonal influenza vaccine for 2010 – 2011 given to persons vaccinated with an adjuvanted H 1 N 1 vaccine in 2009, to determine whether re-exposure to the H 1 N 12009 component of the seasonal vaccine would cause increased reactions. We describe the strategies that we believe were responsible for success in meeting the desired timeline. Methods The key means for expediting the study were: use of a few experienced, well-staffed centers; efficient completion of administrative approvals; advance recruitment of volunteers; synchronized start among centers with rapid completion (1 week) of first visits; rapid data assembly via the Internet; and awell-prepared data analysis plan. We chose to use a randomized, blinded, cross-over design to allow estimation of vaccine-attributable adverse event rates, with sufficient power (320 participants) to detect events occurring at true rates 1 % with 90 % probability. Results Planned enrollment numbers, center synchronization, and timelines, including review by a safety board prior to the cross-over step (second doses), were achieved. A detailed safety report was delivered to federal health officials just 32 days after study initiation and was used to fine-tune <b>public</b> <b>messaging</b> prior to the mass vaccination programs across Canada. Limitations This aggressive timeline could not have been met without opportu-nities for careful planning and the prior existence of a network of experienced, collaborating trial centers. Conclusions The means used to accelerate this study timeline were successful and could be used in other urgent situations but the mechanics of collaborative trials must be well rehearsed as a precondition.

40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. People {{exposed to}} {{alcohol in the}} womb can {{experience}} lifelong physical and developmental problems known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs). The resulting short- and long-term health outcomes of individuals with FASD-related problems, including FAS, create a significant fiscal burden on families, communities, and American taxpayers, who pay for medical treatment, long-term care, and loss of productivity resulting from healthcare institutionalization or criminal detention. It is possible to prevent prenatal exposure and FASDs, including FAS, by ensuring that pregnant women, {{as well as those}} who are trying to get pregnant or likely to get pregnant, abstain from alcohol, but many women continue to drink in spite of the serious health risks to their fetuses. 	Using publicly available data about pregnant women living in the United States between the ages of 18 - 44 from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System annual health survey, I endeavored to determine which characteristics of American pregnant women best predict whether they report alcohol consumption. In examining this topic, I used binomial logit regression analysis to determine how several broad causal factors predict the dependent variable of whether or not pregnant women report alcohol consumption. Additionally, I compared the results of the analysis to the federal Center for Disease Control???s Project CHOICES intervention program, a program designed to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancies by identifying women at high risk of drinking alcohol while pregnant, helping them reduce or cease alcohol consumption, and providing contraceptive counseling. I found that several demographic and personal characteristics help predict whether a woman reports alcohol consumption during pregnancy, including age, race, marital status, health insurance access, level of education completed, employment status, and state of residence. I found that the Project CHOICES program included several useful intervention techniques for reaching at-risk women, but that the program and others like it may need to adjust the criteria for identifying at-risk women in order to reach and treat more women. With the combined results of this regression analysis and case study, policy makers can adjust their current programs, or better target their outreach efforts, to help change the behavior of those groups of women who are at greatest risk for consuming alcohol during pregnancy. In this thesis, I recommend that policy makers who wish to reduce drinking among pregnant women should focus on targeting certain populations of women for <b>public</b> <b>messaging</b> and enrollment in public health programs, as well as addressing certain external factors that could lead to lower drinking rates among pregnant women.

40|$|Executive Summary and Recommendations: Prevention and {{preparedness}} are crucially {{important considerations}} in determining natural disaster funding priorities and {{are capable of}} having much greater magnitude of influence and cost effectiveness compared to emergency response and recovery. Natural disaster funding also needs to include psychosocial recovery, which is {{an essential component of}} restoring individuals’ and communities’ mental health and wellbeing. Natural disasters will almost always overwhelm existing psychosocial services, and Federal funding is needed to augment services to meet increased demand. The APS makes the following recommendations in relation to the Inquiry: Recommendation: Preventive and preparedness initiatives are crucial Preventive and preparedness initiatives are a crucial funding priority. These initiatives equip a community to protect itself from a future disaster, reduce the impact of an event on individuals and communities, hasten the recovery, and have a much greater magnitude of influence and effectiveness than initiatives that come after the disaster. From a psychological perspective, these initiatives would include a host of risk reduction initiatives, including behavioural risk reduction strategies, improved warning systems and <b>public</b> <b>messaging,</b> community disaster preparedness education programs, psychological and household preparedness, psychological first aid, as well as thorough evaluation of program effectiveness so that evidence-based best practices are prioritised. Recommendation: Psychosocial recovery models need to be 3 -tiered, flexible, integrated and local Funding a 3 -tiered model of psychosocial care is critical to cost-effective funding options as it directs the majority of an affected population to the least expensive, population-based assistance which is likely to meet their needs, and reduces the demands on primary and specialist mental health care resources. Funding mechanisms for identifying mental health risk and need in a timely way throughout the population impacted by disaster are essential. This enables rapid mental health triage so that people at high risk can be rapidly matched to brief, evidence-based care. The use of these triage systems for mental health enables rational allocation of limited resources. Psychosocial recovery funding needs to be provided to local leaders in disaster-affected regions so that they can develop an integrated system of psychosocial and mental health care for disaster recovery tailored to their particular area. This funding {{can also be used to}} provide additional training in levels 1, 2 and 3 psychosocial care to saturate the workforce and bolster the existing pathways of care. Funding of a centralised, non-governmental agency designed to promote excellence in psychosocial recovery would improve the quality, consistency, and coordination of psychosocial responses to disasters in Australia. Local leaders in a disaster-affected area could consult with this agency for support in planning, designing, administering and implementing large-scale psychosocial recovery programs, without having to reinvent the wheel each time a disaster affects a different area...|$|E
