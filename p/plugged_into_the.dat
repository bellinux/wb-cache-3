5|$|In the New York media market, BVT {{sold the}} {{syndicated}} Millionaire to CBS's flagship station, WCBS-TV. In the season that had passed, WCBS' mid-afternoon schedule included the syndicated edition of NBC's Weakest Link, which aired at 4 pm from its January 2002 premiere. Joining Millionaire {{as a new}} syndicated series was a spinoff of The Oprah Winfrey Show hosted by Dr. Phil McGraw. WCBS picked up both series for 2002–03, with Dr. Phil serving as lead-in for the syndicated Millionaire, which was <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> time slot that Weakest Link had been occupying.|$|E

5|$|Elgato {{introduced}} a Thunderbolt docking station in June 2014. A computer is <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dock using a Thunderbolt port {{in order to}} gain access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E

5|$|Named Project Code: Metroid Pinball {{while in}} development, the first {{gameplay}} footage {{from the game}} was released on May 17, 2005 at the E3 convention. Nintendo of America revealed on August 22, 2005 that the game, by then titled Metroid Prime Pinball, would be sold with the Rumble Pak accessory, which can be <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Game Boy Advance slot of the Nintendo DS. When the Rumble Pak is installed, the Nintendo DS shakes whenever the pinball in the game hits an object. This {{was the first time}} that the Nintendo DS version of the Rumble Pak was introduced. It was first sold exclusively with Metroid Prime Pinball before becoming available as a standalone product from Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E

To prevent the user from making this fatal mistake, Commodore changed the plug design on 250407 motherboards to a 3-pin connector. Commodore later changed the design, omitting the gel. The follow-on model, the Commodore 128, used a larger, improved power supply {{that included a}} fuse. The power supply {{that came with the}} Commodore REU was {{similar to that of the}} Commodore 128's unit, providing an upgrade for customers who purchased that accessory.|$|E

Brian May, of the band Queen, has {{admitted}} in interviews that as a young man, he was inspired to use a Vox AC30 and treble booster setup after meeting Gallagher and asking him how he got his sound.

25|$|In 1922, {{two former}} Tufts {{engineering}} college roommates Laurence K. Marshall and Vannevar Bush, along with scientist Charles G. Smith, founded the American Appliance Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its focus, which was originally on new refrigeration technology, soon shifted to electronics. The company's first product was a gaseous (helium) rectifier {{that was based}} on Charles Smith's earlier astronomical research of the star Zeta Puppis. The electron tube was christened with the name Raytheon ("light of/from the gods") and was used in a battery eliminator, a type of radio-receiver power supply that <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> power grid in place of large batteries. This made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive, short-lived batteries.|$|E
25|$|The system {{required}} {{a subscription to}} the St.GIGA satellite radio station. During a limited time (between 11:00AM and 2:00AM), users could download games and save them on a memory card that <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> BS-X cartridge. Players could also peruse news announcements and advertisements that were updated in real time. With marketers emphasizing communal and real-time aspects of Satellaview programming, {{efforts were made to}} provide players with an approximation of a multiplayer experience. To accomplish this, Nintendo sponsored numerous events and competitions in which players would compete in quizzes and challenges to achieve high scores, and also {{at the end of each}} game users would receive a score readout. By submitting their game or quiz high scores, their score would be recorded, and if they scored high enough they might get a free gift, such as a telephone card or flash-cart.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic model}} assumes the {{observed}} HDR is the predicted HDR scaled by the weights for each event and then added, with noise mixed in. This generates {{a set of}} linear equations with more equations than unknowns. A linear equation has an exact solution, under most conditions, when equations and unknowns match. Hence one could choose any subset of the equations, with the number equal {{to the number of}} variables, and solve them. But, when these solutions are <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> left-out equations, there will be a mismatch between the right and left sides, the error. The GLM model attempts to find the scaling weights that minimize the sum of the squares of the error. This method is provably optimal if the error were distributed as a bell curve, and if the scaling-and-summing model were accurate. For a more mathematical description of the GLM model, see generalized linear models.|$|E

In this scenario, the remote applications will use the Aero theme if the user connects to the server from a Windows Vista machine running Aero. Later versions of the protocol also support rendering the UI in full 32-bit color, as well as resource redirection for printers, COM ports, disk drives, mice and keyboards. With resource redirection, remote applications can use {{the resources of the}} local computer. Audio is also redirected, so that any sounds generated by a remote application are played back at the client system. Moreover, a remote session can also span multiple monitors at the client system, independent of the multi-monitor settings at the server. RDC {{can also be used to}} connect to Windows Media Center (WMC) remote sessions; however, since WMC does not stream video using RDP, only the applications can be viewed this way, not any media.|$|E

The 2101 is [...] high and has a rotating horn as found on the 122 and 147, along {{with a pair of}} [...] compression drivers and two [...] woofers. The unit provides two separate inputs so different instruments can be <b>plugged</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rotary and stationary components respectively.
