40|$|Quality Thermistor Incorporated (QTI) is an {{industry}} leader {{in the design and}} fabrication of high quality surface mount thermistors. Thermistors are solidstate electronic devices that detect changes in temperature. These devices have a broad field of use ranging from aerospace applications to consumer electronics. Current thermistor manufacturing involves a labor-intensive <b>glass</b> <b>passivation</b> <b>coating</b> process, which is a bottleneck to the thermistor throughput. In an effort to increase manufacturing efficiency, a coupled process involving a fluidized bed and co-fire termination process is being developed by a Senior Project Team. Optimization of the fluidized bed and co-fire processes were investigated using a design of experiments (DOE) approach. The DOE was used to evaluate the main factor effects of the binder, glass frit, and temperatures associated with the process. Through the use of various characterization techniques including optical and scanning electron microscopy, as well as melting point studies, the effectiveness of the newly implemented passivation coating was evaluated...|$|R

The properties of <b>glass</b> <b>coating,</b> such as transmittance, as well as thermal and mechanical properties, and the optimization of the ATO level were discussed. The results showed that this <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> had good transmittance of visible light and good heat-insulation performance. The transmittance of visible light was above 75 % and the highest temperature difference between the heat insulating and ordinary glass is 17 ℃.

40|$|A <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> was {{prepared}} onto AISI {{304 stainless steel}} by a slurry-spraying technique {{and its effects on}} oxidation behavior of this steel was investigated at 1250 degrees C in air. Results were compared with those for bare specimens. The <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> decreased the weight gain by 98 % after oxidation for 9 h, and oxidation kinetics of 304 stainless steel was changed to linear behavior due to the coating. Steel loss of the coated specimens was reduced by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. Hot stage microscopic, optical, XRD and SEM-EDX analyses revealed that the as-received coating melted at high temperature, to form self-healing, homogeneous <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> which acted as a perfect oxygen diffusion barrier and prevented the breakaway oxidation of 304 stainless steel. During cooling, the <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> spalled because of CTE mismatch between coating and the steel. This <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> by low-cost and easy handling method is potentially applicable during slab reheating of stainless steel. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Forging of {{components}} for gas turbine application from nickel-based superalloys remains a challenge, {{due to the}} exceptional high temperature properties of these alloys. In order to enhance formability and prevent oxidation at high temperature forging, a <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> is applied to protect the alloy. However, the contribution and significance of <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> to the material flow during forging is not fully understood. In addition, increased competitive pressure requires {{a better understanding of}} the root cause for geometrical part variability in the forging of aerospace components. Particularly, reduction of manual rework is highly desirable, as it increases the manufacturing costs of these components significantly. The aim of this work was to identify the Key Process Variables (KPVs) of the forging of aerofoils. Therefore, numerical modelling of a full factorial design of experiment was conducted to study the significance of various process parameters. The contribution of <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> as a process variable has been studied experimentally. The double cup extrusion test has been employed to study the influence of <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> thickness and chemistry in hot forging condition. Ring compression tests have been conducted to investigate the contribution of graphite lubricant. It was found, that in the presence of graphite lubricant friction reduces markedly. However, in order to establish a stable lubrication system the fusion behaviour of <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> becomes crucial. In the absence of graphite lubricant, friction increases with increased <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> thickness. Numerical modelling revealed that the interfacial heat transfer coefficient increases with a reduction of <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> thickness. A good agreement between experimentally and numerically derived interfacial heat transfer coefficient has been found. In contrast, in a rapid deformation process such as blade forging, the effect of heat loss becomes less important compared to the contribution of friction. The initial variability of <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> thickness has been characterised in the industrial forging of Inconel 718 aerofoils. <b>Glass</b> <b>coating</b> thickness varies considerably across the workpiece and the batch. This variability, alongside the variability of manual process parameters such as transfer and resting time, have a notable effect on the forming temperature and thus on the resulting aerofoil geometry...|$|R

The coated and uncoated sam-ples were exposed in air at 10001 C for 50 h, and then char-acterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and microhardness depth pro-file. Mass gains {{of the samples}} with and without coatings were measured during the oxidation. For the samples of Ti 811 with-out the <b>glass</b> <b>coating,</b> thick rutile-TiO 2 scales were observed, within which several thin alumina layers presented.

The mass gains of the samples with the <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> were measured to be only about 1 / 10 of those of the samples without coatings, and the oxygen permeation phenomenon was prevented.
