5|$|Benn met Caroline Middleton DeCamp (born 13 October 1926, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States) over tea at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1949 {{and just}} nine days after meeting her; he {{proposed}} to her on a <b>park</b> <b>bench</b> in the city. Later, he bought the bench from Oxford City Council and installed it {{in the garden of}} their home in Holland Park. Tony and Caroline had four children – Stephen, Hilary, Melissa, a feminist writer, and Joshua – and ten grandchildren. Caroline Benn died of cancer on 22 November 2000, aged 74, after a career as an educationalist.|$|E
5|$|The iLoo (short for Internet loo) was a {{cancelled}} Microsoft {{project to}} develop a Wi-Fi Internet-enabled portable toilet. The iLoo, which was to debut at British summer festivals, was described as being a portable toilet with wireless broadband Internet, an adjustable plasma screen, a membrane wireless keyboard, a six-channel speaker system, and toilet paper embossed with popular web site addresses. The iLoo was also to have an extra screen and keyboard on the outside, and was to be guarded. It was intended as the next {{in a series of}} successful initiatives by MSN UK which sought to introduce the internet in unusual locations, including MSN Street, MSN <b>Park</b> <b>Bench</b> and MSN Deckchair.|$|E
5|$|Late one night, Ashley (Ashley Ryder)– a {{young man}} with a childlike mentality– arrives at the caravan home of his Uncle David (David Hoyle) on the Isle of Sheppey. Ashley confides in his uncle that his mother has been {{physically}} abusing him by stubbing cigarettes out on his hand. David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss before going to bed together. The next morning, they awake and have breakfast in bed before David bathes Ashley in the bathtub, telling him a story about an unhappy nuclear family. Going to a local café and then a <b>park</b> <b>bench,</b> David continues to explain his anti-establishment opinions about society. Ashley reveals that he wants to die, and the two express their love for one another.|$|E

Whenever miwa travels through one of the doorways, she comes into the same room set up differently. The first time, it is set up for a frivolous banquet, with many different people dressed formally. The second time she enters it, the room is set up {{as if it were a}} busy park sidewalk, with many people dressed in work clothes ignoring her. She decides to sit down at a <b>park</b> <b>bench.</b> miwa later finds a birdcage, and the scene switches to depicting her trapped inside the birdcage, with the floor littered with sheet music.|$|E
25|$|The squad {{moves to}} London {{to track down}} Ali Hassan Salameh, who orchestrated the Munich Massacre, but the {{assassination}} attempt is interrupted by several drunken Americans. It is implied that these are agents of the CIA, which, according to Louis, protects and funds Salameh {{in exchange for his}} promise not to attack U.S. diplomats. Meanwhile, attempts are made on the assassins themselves. Carl is killed by an independent Dutch contract killer. In revenge, the team tracks her down and executes her at a houseboat in Hoorn, Netherlands. Hans is found stabbed to death on a <b>park</b> <b>bench,</b> while Robert is killed by an explosion in his workshop. Avner and Steve finally locate Salameh in Spain, but again their assassination attempt is thwarted, this time by Salameh's armed guards. It is implied that Louis has sold information on the team to the PLO.|$|E
25|$|Grassroots {{efforts have}} led to {{wireless}} community networks. Commercial Wi-Fi services covering large city areas are in place in New York, London, Vienna, Toronto, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago and Pittsburgh. The Internet can then be accessed from such places as a <b>park</b> <b>bench.</b> Apart from Wi-Fi, there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like Ricochet, various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed wireless services. High-end mobile phones such as smartphones in general come with Internet access through the phone network. Web browsers such as Opera are available on these advanced handsets, which can also run {{a wide variety of}} other Internet software. More mobile phones have Internet access than PCs, though this is not as widely used. An Internet access provider and protocol matrix differentiates the methods used to get online.|$|E

25|$|Most of The Honeymooners {{took place}} in Ralph and Alice Kramden's small sparsely {{furnished}} two-room apartment. Other settings used in the show included the Gotham Bus Company depot, the Raccoon Lodge, a neighborhood pool parlor, a <b>park</b> <b>bench</b> where Ralph and Ed occasionally meet for lunch,and on occasion the Nortons' apartment (always noticeably better-furnished than the Kramdens'). Many episodes began with a shot of Alice in the apartment awaiting Ralph's arrival from work. Most episodes focused on Ralph' and Ed's characters, although Alice played a substantial role. Ed's wife, Trixie, played a smaller role in the series, and did not appear in every episode as did the other three. Each episode presented a self-contained story, which rarely carried over into a subsequent one. The show employed a number of standard sitcom clichés and plots, particularly those of jealousy, get-rich-quick schemes, and comic misunderstanding.|$|E

500|$|From 1956 to 1958, Ochs was {{a student}} at the Staunton Military Academy in rural Virginia, and when he {{graduated}} he returned to Columbus and enrolled in the Ohio State University. Unhappy after his first quarter, he took a leave of absence and went to Florida. While in Miami, the 18-year-old Ochs was jailed for two weeks for sleeping on a <b>park</b> <b>bench,</b> an incident he would later recall: [...] "Somewhere during the course of those fifteen days I decided to become a writer.

Later, in The Daily Dot, he cast doubt on Krahblicher's account, saying [...] "Anyone can fake a DVD".|$|E
500|$|... "Baby Don't Cry" [...] {{was used}} as the theme song for the Japanese {{television}} drama series, Himitsu no Hanazono (2007). Alongside this, it was included in three Japanese commercials: the Avex Trax [...] "Myu-Umo" [...] music commercial, the Pokemero Joysound commercial, and for the Fuji TV television series, Secret Garden. An accompanying music video was shot in Japan by Masashi Muto. It opens with Amuro running on outdoor steps, and walking along a pavement bridge. As the chorus starts, intercut scenes of trees are shown, as she walks through the city. The second verse has her walking through a park, with yellow-ish leaves on the ground. She witnessed two small children on a <b>park</b> <b>bench,</b> holding the chain to a dog. The third chorus then has her walking through a city square, and ends with her standing on a beach front at sunset. A short version of the video was uploaded on Amuro's YouTube page on November 16, 2011, whilst a full version was uploaded one month later.|$|E

500|$|On May 13, 2003, Microsoft {{retracted}} the denial, {{stating that}} the iLoo had been a legitimate demonstration project {{that was to be}} released in Britain for summer music festivals, but had been terminated by Microsoft executives in Redmond, Washington who believed the iLoo was inappropriate with the final decision made by MSN senior vice president David Cole. MSN product manager Lisa Gurry stated that the project [...] "didn't really map to our global branding objectives". Microsoft again apologized for the miscommunication stating [...] "the confusion over the legitimacy of this effort was caused by people moving too quickly and who misspoke before gathering all of the relevant information". Prior to the cancellation, an iLoo prototype was in the [...] "early stages of construction". MSN allows regional units to design their own marketing campaigns, and the UK division had developed a reputation for innovative campaigns, in this case involving British toilet humour. The iLoo which was designed for the UK as part of a [...] "tongue-in-cheek marketing initiative" [...] was [...] "intended to be the next in line of a number of clever initiatives in the UK involving introducing the internet in interesting locations, including MSN Street, MSN <b>Park</b> <b>Bench</b> and MSN Deckchair". The previous initiatives were well received. Microsoft stated that no employees were disciplined {{as a result of the}} debacle, although the company stated that it would conduct [...] "internal discussions".|$|E
500|$|Bookends {{contains}} many of Paul Simon's major themes, including [...] "youth, alienation, life, love, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality". Simon's work on Bookends is loosely autobiographical, designed {{to function as}} both a personal and artistic statement. Simon, [...] "feeling especially auteurist in the Dylan style of the day", had planned out the album's concept before he began writing, telling Garfunkel [...] "I'm going to start writing a whole side of an album—a cycle of songs. I want the early ones to be about youth and the last song to be about old age, and I want the feel of each song to fit." [...] Bookends, originally released primarily as a vinyl LP, opens and closes side one of the disc with the [...] "Bookends Theme", a brief acoustic piece (once compared to English rock band the Moody Blues) that evokes [...] "a time of innocence". [...] "Save the Life of My Child" [...] is a dramatic story involving drugs, violence and a mother and child relationship. According to James Bennighof, the song [...] "deals with individual crises in crowded urban settings, along with references to larger societal forces {{and at least a}} hint of some transcendent perspective". The song crossfades into [...] "America", which follows two young lovers—"an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance"—as they board a Greyhound bus [...] "to look for America". It is a protest song that [...] "creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer's search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country's beauty and ideals". [...] "Overs" [...] includes themes regarding the disintegration of love and marriage. [...] "Old Friends" [...] paints a portrait of two old men reminiscing on the years of their youth. The two men [...] "sit on a <b>park</b> <b>bench</b> like bookends", and ponder how strange it feels to be nearing their lifetime. The song is joined with the [...] "Bookends Theme", this time with vocal accompaniment from the duo. The piece closes the entire suite with the [...] "resigned admonition" [...] to [...] "Preserve your memories / They're all that's left you".|$|E
