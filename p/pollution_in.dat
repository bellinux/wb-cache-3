5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air pollution as a serious health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air pollution control. Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B. Johnson and members of Congress worked to pass federal legislation regulating air <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> the United States, culminating in the 1967 Air Quality Act and the 1970 Clean Air Act. The 1966 smog is a milestone that has been compared with other pollution events, including {{the health effects of}} pollution from the September 11 attacks and <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> China.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, Chinese {{government}} has taken great efforts in initiating large-scale ecological restoration programs (ERPs) {{to reduce the}} dust <b>pollutions</b> <b>in</b> China. Using a satellite measurement product of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the changes in land cover are quantitatively evaluated in this study. We find that grass and forest are increased in berried lands and deserts in northwestern China, which locate in the upwind regions of the populated areas of the North China Plain (NCP) in eastern China. As a result, the changes in land cover could produce important impacts on the dust <b>pollutions</b> <b>in</b> eastern of China. To assess the effect of ERPs on dust pollutions, a regional transport/dust model (WRF-DUST, Weather Research and Forecast model with dust) is applied to investigate the evolution of dust pollutions during a strong dust episode (from 2 to 8 March 2016). The calculations are intensively evaluated by comparing with the measured data. Despite some model biases, the WRF-DUST model reasonably reproduced the temporal variations and spatial distributions during the dust storm event. The correlation coefficient (R) between the calculated and measured dust concentrations is 0. 77. The indices of agreement (IOAs) are 0. 96 and 0. 83, and the normalized mean bias (NMBs) are 2  % and − 15  % in the dust source region (DSR) and the downwind populated area of NCP, respectively, suggesting that the WRF-DUST model well captures the spatial variations and temporal evolutions of the dust storm event. The impacts of EPRs induced land cover changes on the dust <b>pollutions</b> <b>in</b> NCP are quantitatively assessed using the WRF-DUST model. We find that the ERPs significantly reduce the dust <b>pollutions</b> <b>in</b> NCP, especially in the heart area of NCP (BTH, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei). During the episode when the dust storm was transported from the DSR to NCP, the reduction of dust pollutions induced by ERPs ranges from − 5  % to − 15  % in NCP, with the maximum reduction of − 15. 3  % (− 21. 0  μg m − 3) in BTH, and − 6. 2  % (− 9. 3  μg m − 3) in NCP. Because the air <b>pollution</b> is severe <b>in</b> eastern China, especially in NCP, the reduction of dust pollutions has important effects on the severe air pollutions. This study shows that ERPs help to reduce air <b>pollutions</b> <b>in</b> the region, especially in springtime, suggesting the important contributions of ERPs to the air <b>pollution</b> control <b>in</b> China...|$|R
