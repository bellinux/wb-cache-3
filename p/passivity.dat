5|$|Angered {{with the}} <b>passivity</b> of Buenos Aires during the Luso-Brazilian {{invasion}} of the Banda Oriental, Francisco Ramírez from Entre Ríos and Estanislao López from Santa Fe joined forces against the city. Saavedra fled to Montevideo, fearing that Buenos Aires would be obliterated if defeated. Ramírez and López won the battle of Cepeda, but the city was not destroyed, so Saavedra returned. He retired in 1822, and lived {{with his family in}} the countryside. He offered his services {{at the beginning of the}} War of Brazil, despite being 65 years old, but Balcarce declined the offer. He wrote his memoirs, Memoria autógrafa, in 1828.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1973, {{there was}} serious debate among the Hanoi {{leadership}} over future military policy as the Central Committee of the Lao Động Party convened to assess the progress of its efforts in the south. General Văn Tiến Dũng, PAVN chief of staff, and Defence Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp strongly urged the resumption of conventional military operations, warning that increasing <b>passivity</b> would affect {{the morale of the}} army. Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, however, feared resuming operations would drain vital resources needed for reconstruction in the north.|$|E
5|$|Atwood's use of myths follows archetypal {{literary}} criticism and specifically {{the work of}} Northrop Frye and his Anatomy of Criticism. According to this literary theory, contemporary works are not independent but {{are part of an}} underlying pattern that re-invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures of meaning. In The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes of female <b>passivity</b> and victimization while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.|$|E
5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This <b>passivity</b> is given comic {{treatment}} when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is {{comparable to that of}} Hamlet who may have been based on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E
5|$|Fairman {{discusses}} {{the efforts of}} conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance in the country, and says these acts {{are opposed to the}} First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. He argues that this <b>passivity</b> has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E
5|$|The {{austerity}} and the <b>passivity</b> of {{the first}} character is, however, contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character. Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress, which shows off her décolletage, with a middle parting in the skirt, while wearing red carnations in her hair. Complementing this passionate look, the second setting features a bright red room with red candles and candelabra. While the spiritual and pious Madonna shyly watches the Latinos and prays silently in her room, the passionate Madonna dances and leaves the room to join the dancers in the streets.|$|E
5|$|They {{may also}} serve as {{religious}} symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: יוֹנָה, dove) embodied the fright, <b>passivity,</b> mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves. Birds have themselves been deified, {{as in the case}} of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India. In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms. Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 Mickiewicz severed {{his ties}} with Towiański, {{following}} {{the rise of}} revolutionary sentiment in Europe, manifested in {{events such as the}} Kraków Uprising of February 1846. Mickiewicz criticized Towiański's <b>passivity</b> and returned to the traditional Catholic Church. In 1847 Mickiewicz befriended American journalist, critic and women's-rights advocate Margaret Fuller. In March 1848 he was part of a Polish delegation received in audience by Pope Pius IX, whom he asked to support the enslaved nations and the French Revolution of 1848. Soon after, in April 1848, he organized a military unit, the Mickiewicz Legion, to support the insurgents, hoping to liberate the Polish and other Slavic lands. The unit never became large enough to be more than symbolic, and in the fall of 1848 Mickiewicz returned to Paris and became more active again on the political scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{precipitate}} {{action of}} the Hospitallers could have caused Richard's whole strategy to unravel. However, he recognised that the counterattack, once started, had to be supported by all his army and ordered the signal for a general charge to be sounded. Unsupported, the Hospitallers and the other rear units involved in the initial breakout would have been overwhelmed by the superior numbers of the enemy. The Frankish infantry opened gaps in their ranks for the knights to pass through and the attack naturally developed in echelon from the rear to the van. To the soldiers of Saladin's army, as Baha al-Din noted, the sudden change from <b>passivity</b> to ferocious activity {{on the part of}} the Crusaders was disconcerting, and appeared to be the result of a preconceived plan.|$|E
5|$|When Sleeping Beauty was {{released}} in 1959, the film was both a critical and commercial failure, discouraging the studio from adapting fairy tales into animated films for decades. Aurora herself received negative reviews for her <b>passivity</b> and overall similarity to Snow White. Aurora would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaids Ariel debuted 30 years later in 1989. However, Costa's vocal performance was praised, which inspired her to pursue a full-time career as an opera singer to great success. Chronologically, Aurora is the third Disney Princess. Despite having since established herself as a popular character for her beauty and fashion, Aurora's personality continues to receive negative press, particularly from feminist critics, thus earning her {{a reputation as one}} of Disney's most passive princess characters. Actress Elle Fanning portrays a live-action version of Aurora in the film Maleficent (2014), a retelling of Sleeping Beauty from the perspective of its villain.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{attacked}} {{not only}} hereditary privilege, {{but also the}} rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for Marie Antoinette, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she kept his rhetoric {{as well as his}} argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the <b>passivity</b> of women.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. In the postwar period, veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the <b>passivity</b> traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|Tronstad {{spent the}} first year of a {{research}} period as an assistant to Herbert Freundlich in Dahlem, Berlin. He studied the <b>passivity</b> of metal surfaces, and made a breakthrough when he managed to measure extremely thin oxide surface coatings, thus solving a problem dating from the time of Michael Faraday. He continued to Stockholm to study metallography under Carl Benedicks, and to elaborate further on his results from Berlin. The work was completed in 1931 and his thesis, spanning 250 pages, was published in German as Optische Untersuchungen zur Frage der Passivität des Eisens und Stahls. For it, he received the doctorate degree. He was hired at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a lecturer in the summer of 1931, although he {{spent the first}} year at the University of Cambridge, conducting further research with a scholarship from a memorial fund of Christian Michelsen. The research at Cambridge was a continuation of his thesis work, but this time he tested his method on mercury.|$|E
5|$|Victorian {{painting}} {{had gone}} through radical changes, and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites {{had given way to}} the ideas of the Aesthetic Movement, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict <b>passivity,</b> rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.|$|E
25|$|Victims of the {{massacre}} protested several times in Kathmandu, because of the <b>passivity</b> {{of the government in}} providing the compensations recommended by the probe committee.|$|E
25|$|Feminine (Earth and Water signs): The {{feminine}} {{signs are}} Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. A native with these signs predominating will tend towards introversion, shyness and <b>passivity,</b> {{and have the}} ability to nurture, conserve and solve problems by intuitive means.|$|E
25|$|Penalties may {{be given}} for: <b>passivity</b> or {{preventing}} progress in the match; for safety infringements for example by using prohibited techniques, or for behavior that is deemed to be against the spirit of judo. Fighting must be stopped if a participant is outside the designated area on the mat.|$|E
25|$|Toru Okada: The {{narrator and}} protagonist, Toru is a passive and often apathetic young man living in {{suburban}} Japan. He is Kumiko's husband and continually follows the orders or wishes of others. He {{had a job}} in a law firm, but currently unemployed, and he is the embodiment of <b>passivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anodic {{protection}} impresses {{anodic current}} {{on the structure}} to be protected (opposite to the cathodic protection). It is appropriate for metals that exhibit <b>passivity</b> (e.g. stainless steel) and suitably small passive current {{over a wide range}} of potentials. It is used in aggressive environments, such as solutions of sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 1941, {{despite having}} officially joined the Axis Powers, the Bulgarian {{government}} maintained {{a course of}} military <b>passivity</b> during {{the initial stages of}} the invasion of Yugoslavia and the Battle of Greece. As German, Italian, and Hungarian troops crushed Yugoslavia and Greece, the Bulgarians remained on the sidelines. The Yugoslav government surrendered on 17 April. The Greek government was to hold out until 30 April. On 20 April, the period of Bulgarian <b>passivity</b> ended. The Bulgarian Army entered the Aegean region. The goal was to gain an Aegean Sea outlet in Thrace and Eastern Macedonia and much of eastern Serbia. The so-called Vardar Banovina was divided between Bulgaria and Italians which occupied West Macedonia. The Bulgarian occupation of Macedonia was viewed as oppressive by the inhabitants of the region, further distancing any previous affiliations between Macedonian and Bulgarians.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevailing}} public arguments, time of onset, {{and pace}} of reforms varied by country. Class action lawsuits in the United States, and {{the scrutiny of}} institutions through disability activism and antipsychiatry, helped expose the poor conditions and treatment. Sociologists and others argued that such institutions maintained or created dependency, <b>passivity,</b> exclusion and disability, causing people to be institutionalised.|$|E
25|$|The {{weakness}} and <b>passivity</b> of the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III towards Napoleon's constant expansion of his power, {{was a great}} problem for many of his subjects and contemporaries. In {{the face of the}} threat presented by the French to the country's very existence a wave of Prussian patriotism arose, to which Kleist himself was not immune.|$|E
25|$|We {{must not}} wait passively. A free Poland is our aim, {{but no one}} will give us that freedom. Our <b>passivity</b> will result in their murdering {{more and more of}} us, in more and more people suffering. We must educate, because even when a free Poland is achieved, the nation will be so {{exhausted}} {{that there will be no}} one to lead it.|$|E
25|$|The {{report was}} {{critical}} of the crew's actions, particularly for failing to reduce speed before investigating the noises emanating from the bow, and for being unaware that the list was being caused by water entering the vehicle deck. There were also general criticisms of the delays in sounding the alarm, the <b>passivity</b> of the crew, {{and the lack of}} guidance from the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the book {{explains}} the origin and evolution of the universe itself, in terms derived from the Hindu concept of cyclical development. The world and everything in it is said to alternate between periods of activity (manvantaras) and periods of <b>passivity</b> (pralayas). Each manvantara lasts many millions of years and consists of a number of Yugas, in accordance with Hindu cosmology.|$|E
25|$|The other {{characters}} of the story include the sailors in chapter 1 {{and the people of}} Nineveh in chapter 3. These characters are also contrasted to Jonah's <b>passivity.</b> While Jonah sleeps in the hull, the sailors pray and try to save the ship from the storm (1:4–6). While Jonah passively finds himself forced to act under the Divine Will, the people of Nineveh actively petition God to change his mind.|$|E
25|$|At An's first {{invitation}} to the World Masters in Guadalajara, he was seeded number one. He faced Algeria's Houd Zourdani in his first fight, and won by ippon as Zourdani was disqualified for earning four shidos for <b>passivity.</b> He again fought Pollack in the quarter-final, but showed his superiority when he landed the latter on his back for ippon with his strong seoi nage in less than 20 seconds.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} stages of defilements. During {{the stage of}} <b>passivity</b> the defilements lie dormant {{at the base of}} the mental {{continuum}} as latent tendencies (anusaya), but through the impact of sensory stimulus, they will manifest (pariyutthana) themselves at the surface of consciousness in the form of unwholesome thoughts, emotions, and volitions. If they gather additional strength, the defilements will reach the dangerous stage of transgression (vitikkama), which will then involve physical or vocal actions.|$|E
25|$|Bondage fantasies often involve {{dressing}} in a role outfit. Typical outfits for the submissive person invoke common icons of <b>passivity</b> or sexual innocence (e.g. a shepherdess, nun or schoolgirl outfit for women, or a leather slave harness and cuffs, thong, or ancient slave outfit for men). In a similar respect, the dominant person's attire often reflect images of power, control, and extreme discipline (a Nazi officer, military officer, police or prison warden uniform).|$|E
25|$|It {{remains a}} paradox of the mystics that the <b>passivity</b> {{at which they}} appear to aim is really {{a state of the}} most intense activity: more, that where it is wholly absent no great {{creative}} action can take place. In it, the superficial self compels itself to be still, in order that it may liberate another more deep-seated power which is, in the ecstasy of the contemplative genius, raised to the highest pitch of efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Tralfamadorian {{philosophy}} did {{not appear}} ex nihilo, but draws on many strands of thought. The idea of all time existing at once (as the Tralfamadorians experience it) {{can be found in}} sources ranging from Pre-Socratic Greek philosophy (e.g. Parmenides' monism) to Neo-Classical Christian theology (e.g. Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici) to twentieth century popular science (e.g. repeated statements by Albert Einstein). Likewise, the idea of determinism was prevalent in twentieth century philosophy and Tralfamadorian <b>passivity</b> {{can be traced back to}} the Stoics.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese forces, led by Carlos Frederico Lecor, {{thanks to}} his {{numerical}} and material superiority, conquered the Eastern Province and took Montevideo on January 20, 1817, but the struggle continued for three long years in the countryside. Infuriated by Buenos Aires's <b>passivity,</b> Artigas declared war on the Supreme Directorship {{at the same time}} that he faced the Portuguese with armies that were being decimated by successive defeats. Without resources and without suitable men for the struggle, Artigas finally retreated to Entre Ríos Province, across the Uruguay River.|$|E
25|$|Richard Rorty {{argues in}} Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature that {{contemporary}} analytic philosophy mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of representationalism and correspondence theory that rely upon {{the independence of}} knowers and observers from phenomena and the <b>passivity</b> of natural phenomena in relation to consciousness. As a proponent of anti-foundationalism and anti-essentialism within a pragmatist framework, he echoes the postmodern strain of conventionalism and relativism, but opposes much of postmodern thinking with his commitment to social liberalism.|$|E
25|$|The plot had young Humpty and his playmates {{turn into}} harlequinade {{characters}} and romp through a candy store, an enchanted garden and Manhattan's costly new City Hall. Fox's mute <b>passivity</b> set {{him apart from}} the raucous clamor surrounding him, and audiences took the little man to their hearts. Humpty Dumpty was revived several times. Fox eventually gave 1,128 performances in the title role, becoming the most highly paid actor of his time. He initiated the tradition of Wednesday matinee's {{to take advantage of}} the show's appeal to children.|$|E
25|$|While many Jews {{reacted to}} their fate with disbelief and <b>passivity,</b> revolts did take place, {{including}} at the Treblinka and Sobibór camps {{and at a}} number of ghettos. The leftist ŻOB was established in the Warsaw Ghetto in July 1942 and was soon commanded by Mordechai Anielewicz. As the final liquidation of the remaining ghetto population was commenced by the Nazis on 19 April 1943, hundreds of Jewish fighters revolted. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising lasted until May 16 and resulted in thousands of Jews killed and tens of thousands transported to Treblinka. The Polish underground and some Warsaw residents assisted the ghetto fighters.|$|E
25|$|By 1982, the {{perceived}} <b>passivity</b> of the FARC, {{together with the}} relative success of the government's efforts against the M-19 and ELN, enabled {{the administration of the}} Liberal Party's Julio César Turbay Ayala (1978–82) to lift a state-of-siege decree that had been in effect, on and off, for most of the previous 30 years. Under the latest such decree, president Turbay had implemented security policies that, though of some military value against the M-19 in particular, were considered highly questionable both inside and outside Colombian circles due to numerous accusations of military human rights abuses against suspects and captured guerrillas.|$|E
