The wing structure includes {{extensive use of}} carbon fiber, both in the sandwich skins and in the tapered I-beam wing spar which uses <b>pultruded</b> carbon rods for the spar caps. The wing geometry is notable in that it varies non-linearly from the root to the tip, both in overall planform shape and in wing section profile. The flaperons stretch for 11.0 meters of the full wingspan and their range of motion varies from positive landing L +8°, to +4° for thermalling, to 0°, -4°, and S -8° reflex positions for cruising. Schempp-Hirth-type spoilers extend on the upper wing surface only. Opening the single-element spoilers with stick held results in a noticeable nose-down pitch movement. This, however, can easily be avoided by maintaining the nose attitude relative to the horizon; doing this will cause little airspeed change. Closing the spoilers has a similar pitch-up effect, again easily controlled with stick movement. On approach, the spoilers are moderately effective. Descent rate can be quickly increased by slipping. At approach speed with spoilers out, {{there is a clear}} view ahead over the nose.|$|E

Some studies have shown that <b>pultruded</b> glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) exhibits a slight reduction in mechanical properties during outdoor exposure. Since <b>pultruded</b> GFRP consists of multi-layers, the change of mechanical properties in each layer is important to understand.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceKimberly W. KramerPultruded fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) shapes {{are gaining}} {{popularity in the}} construction industry. <b>Pultruded</b> FRP profiles introduce a new world of construction that {{could prove to be}} a viable option to traditional structural materials. The use of <b>pultruded</b> FRP profiles in structures is discussed in this report. First a brief history of FRPs and their applications are addressed before explaining in detail the two main components of FRP; fibers and resin. The manufacturing process known as pultrusion and how two separate materials become one structural member is examined. As a result of pultrusion, engineers and designers can create structural profiles in customizable shapes, sizes, and strengths to suit any project and price. Theoretically, a <b>pultruded</b> FRP profile can be customized to different strengths within the geometrical and material bounds of the profile; however, many manufacturers publish data regarding mechanical and thermal properties along with allowable loads for their nominal profiles. Currently, there are no governing codes or guidelines for <b>pultruded</b> FRPs but there are design manuals and handbooks published by various committees and manufacturers so the design of <b>pultruded</b> FRP profiles is discussed. Ultimate and serviceability limit states are design concerns that engineers always deal with but concerns of heat or fire, chemical or corrosion, and moisture affect <b>pultruded</b> FRPs differently than steel or wood. <b>Pultruded</b> FRPs pose interesting design concerns because increased customizability and workability means the member can be tailored to meet the needs for that project but that would counter the benefit of mass-produced nominal sizes. A lack of uniform codes and standards inhibits the growth of the pultrusion industry in the United States but codes developed in Europe along with the development of specialized agencies and organizations could help gain a foothold. Lastly, a set of beams varying in length and load exhibit a side-by-side comparison to examine how <b>pultruded</b> FRPs match up next to traditional building materials. Although wood, steel, and reinforced concrete have been the preferred materials of construction, <b>pultruded</b> FRP structural shapes are gaining popularity for its economical and physical advantages, and advances in manufacturing and technology stand to usher in the widespread use of <b>pultruded</b> FRP profiles...|$|E
40|$|By using {{pultrusion}} technique, {{three types}} of <b>pultruded</b> composites at 70 V/V% fibre loading have been produced which are <b>pultruded</b> kenaf fibre reinforced unsaturated polyester composites (PKRC), <b>pultruded</b> glass fibre reinforced unsaturated polyester composites (PGRC) and <b>pultruded</b> glass/kenaf fibre hybrid reinforced unsaturated polyester composites (PGKRC). The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the behavior of PGKRC as compared to PKRC and PGRC after being subjected to natural weathering exposure of 200 days and six weeks of hygrothermal aging in distilled water at 65 ºC. In natural weathering exposure study, PGRC specimens recorded the least absorbed moisture while PKRC specimens showed the highest.

Moisture invasion is the major factor that weakened the fibre-matrix interfaces which led to mechanical properties reduction and it acts differently for different types of <b>pultruded</b> composites due to the nature of the constituent fibres and the arrangement of the <b>pultruded</b> hybrid composites.

40|$|A new 3 D micromechanics-based {{framework}} is {{proposed for the}} nonlinear analysis of <b>pultruded</b> fiber-reinforced polymeric composites. The proposed 3 D modeling {{framework is}} a nested multiscale approach that explicitly recognizes {{the response of the}} composite systems (layers) within the cross section of the <b>pultruded</b> member.

A 400 kW turbine was selected for the design study and a scaled 80 kW rotor was fabricated and field tested as {{a demonstration of the}} concept. The design studies continued to support the premise that <b>pultruded</b> blades offer the potential for significant reductions in rotor weight and cost. The field test provided experimental performance and loads data that compared well with predictions using the FLEXDYNE aeroelastic analysis. The field test also demonstrated stable yaw behavior and the absence of stall flutter over the wind conditions tested. During the final year of the contract, several studies were conducted by a number of independent consultants to address specific technical issues related to <b>pultruded</b> blades that could impact the commercial viability of turbines using this technology. The issues included performance, tower strikes, yaw stability, stall flutter, fatigue, and costs. While the performance of straight <b>pultruded</b> blades was projected to suffer a penalty of about 13 % over fully twisted and tapered blades, the study showed that an aerodynamic fairing over the inner 40 % could recover 85 % of that loss while still keeping the blade cost well below that of conventional blades.
