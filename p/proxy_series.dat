50|$|The first truly {{quantitative}} {{reconstruction of}} Northern Hemisphere temperatures {{had been published}} in 1993 by Bradley and Phil Jones, but it and subsequent reconstructions compiled averages for decades, covering the whole hemisphere. Mann wanted temperatures of individual years showing differences between regions, to find spatial patterns showing natural oscillations {{and the effect of}} events such as volcanic eruptions. Sophisticated statistical methods had already been applied to dendroclimatology, but to get wider geographical coverage these tree ring records had to be related to sparser proxies such as ice cores, corals and lake sediments. To avoid giving too much weight to the more numerous tree data, Mann, Bradley and Hughes used the statistical procedure of principal component analysis to represent these larger datasets in terms of a small number of representative series and compare them to the sparser proxy records. The same procedure was also used to represent key information in the instrumental temperature record for comparison with the <b>proxy</b> <b>series,</b> enabling validation of the reconstruction. They chose the period 1902-1980 for calibration, leaving the previous 50 years of instrumental data for validation. This showed that the statistical reconstructions were only skillful (statistically meaningful) back to 1400.|$|E

For each method, concise background information about the fundamental principles and methodological approaches is provided. We concentrate on the time interval of focus for the INTIMATE (Integrating Ice core, MArine and TErrestrial records) community (60 – 8 ka). This dating guide addresses palaeoclimatologists who aim at interpretation of their often regional and local <b>proxy</b> time <b>series</b> in a wider spatial context and, therefore, have to rely on correlation with proxy records obtained from different archives from various regions. For this reason, we especially emphasise scientific approaches for harmonising chronologies for sophisticated and robust proxy data integration. In this respect, up-to-date age modelling techniques are presented as well as tools for linking records by age equivalence including tephrochronology, cosmogenic 10 Be and palaeomagnetic variations.

This has {{lead to an}} increasing number of analysed speleothem <b>proxy</b> time <b>series</b> from caves that are distributed on a global scale. In particular speleothem δ 18 O and δ 13 C time series are investigated. A hotspot of analysed speleothem <b>proxy</b> time <b>series</b> is Europe, which makes it possible to perform spatio-temporal coherency analysis of speleothem <b>proxy</b> time <b>series.</b> For this aim a method is developed that is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The method is based on a Monte Carlo approach and accounts for the speleothem age uncertainty and the different temporal resolution of speleothem <b>proxy</b> time <b>series.</b> This method is applied to compilations of European speleothem δ 18 O and δ 13 C time series. It is demonstrated that the results of the PCA for the compiled δ 18 O time series can be interpreted as a temperature proxy and as a precipitation/hydrology proxy for the compilation of δ 13 C time series. Furthermore, it is showed that the spatio-temporal coherence between the analysed speleothem δ 18 O and δ 13 C time series varied with time. Moreover, a change of the predominant pattern is observed at 4. 0 ka. The second aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the change the observed speleothem δ 18 O gradient for European speleothems. A multi-box Rayleigh approach model is developed (Stable Isotope in Precipitation (SIP) model) that computes the stable isotope composition of precipitation, infiltrated water and calcite. The model is validated with measured precipitation δ 18 O and δD values from the GNIP dataset. It is demonstrated that the SIP model agrees with the observed δ 18 O and δD values for the analysed Central European and Northern European transect. Moreover, it is showed that the precipitation δ 18 O (δD) gradient depends on the North Atlantic Oscillation. This is interpreted as a change of the amount of moisture in the atmosphere for Central Europe. The application of the SIP model of palaeo climate speloethem δ 18 O gradients suggests that the climate was drier in the early- and mid-Holocene compared to present-day. In addition, the past δ 18 O gradients suggest a transition of the atmospheric circulation from a very negative NAO like pattern in the early-Holocene (11 ka) to a very positive NAO like pattern in mid-Holocene (4 ka) and that a reorganisation of the atmospheric circulation occurred at approximately 4 ka when present-day atmospheric circulation established...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} either {{exclusively}} used annual tree-ring data or have combined tree-ring series with other, lower temporal resolution <b>proxy</b> <b>series.</b> Both approaches {{can lead to}} significant uncertainties, as tree-rings may underestimate the amplitude of past temperature variations, and the validity of non-annual records cannot be clearly assessed. In this study, we assembled 45 published Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperature proxy records covering the past millennium, each of which satisfied 3 essential criteria: the series must be of annual resolution, span at least a thousand years, and represent an explicit temperature signal. Suitable climate archives included ice cores, varved lake sediments, tree-rings and speleothems. We reconstructed the average annual land temperature series for the NH over the last millennium by applying 3 different reconstruction techniques: (1) principal components (PC) plus second-order autoregressive model (AR 2), (2) composite plus scale (CPS) and (3) regularized errors-in-variables approach (EIV). Our reconstruction is in excellent agreement with 6 climate model simulations (including the first 5 models derived from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5) and an earth system model of intermediate complexity (LOVECLIM), showing similar temperatures at multidecadal timescales; however, all simulations appear to underestimate the temperature during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). A comparison with other NH reconstructions shows that our {{results are consistent with}} earlier studies.

40|$|Modern {{atmospheric}} and geodetic {{data sets}} {{have demonstrated that}} changes in the axial component of the atmosphere's angular momentum and in the rotation rate of the solid earth are closely coupled on time scales of up to several years. The feasibility of using a historical record of the earth's rotation {{as a proxy for}} year-to-year changes in the zonal wind field over the globe is examined. The bulk of the earth rotation series acquired for this purpose is based on telescopic observations of the occultation of stars by the moon; semiannual values of changes in the length of day derived from these observations have acceptably small errors from about 1860 onwards. These values are filtered to remove decade-scale fluctuations, which are driven primarily by nonatmospheric processes, and the resulting <b>proxy</b> <b>series</b> is examined to see if it contains a signal associated with one of the major modes of interannual variability in the atmosphere, namely that due to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). According to tests of statistical significance, such a signal is present in the historical earth rotation series, in that the day is typically longer during the year following an ENSO oceanic warm event than otherwise. Therefore other signals of interannual variability in the <b>proxy</b> <b>series</b> are considered. In particular, it is inferred that noteworthy trends in atmospheric interannual variability have occurred over the last century; for example, the decade of the 1920 s was marked by much larger year-to-year changes in the zonal circulation over the globe than that of the 1940 s. Based on modern atmospheric data, it is suggested that most of these circulation changes have resulted from anomalies in the region between 30 deg N and 30 deg S...|$|E

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{existence of}} diverse ownership structures within the life insurance industry naturally {{leads to the}} question of whether the relative performance of mutual and stock life insurance companies is equivalent. Following a review of previous comparisons of the efficiency of mutual and stock financial institutions and an examination of potential agency and managerial incentive problems at mutual and stock life insurance companies, the relative efficiency of a sample of 60 mutual and 61 stock companies was examined for the period 1960 to 1986. ^ As market-based returns are unavailable for mutual companies, an accounting-based version of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) was utilized. Accounting rates of return for mutual and stock life insurance companies were calculated under several income specifications, and accounting betas were estimated utilizing several market <b>proxy</b> <b>series.</b> Returns were examined on a risk-adjusted basis by comparing the actual and expected returns. T-tests were used to detect significant differences in the residual returns. ^ The empirical results, in general, support the hypothesis that mutual and stock life insurance companies are equally efficient for the 1960 to 1986 time period, with efficiency defined as earning a rate of return commensurate with the degree of risk with which the firm operates. Further analysis showed that small stock companies were operating at a significantly higher level of risk under the gain from operations income measure. Small mutual companies were operating at a significantly higher rate of return under the gain from operations less dividends income measure. The analysis also revealed that there had been a significant increase in the rate of return and the degree of risk for mutual companies between the 1960 to 1973 time period and the 1974 to 1986 time period. Residual returns for all companies in period two were significantly greater than period one residual returns.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} by examples that long hydrometeorological time series exhibit scaling in time, a behaviour equivalent to the Hurst phenomenon. The example time series investigated range from high temporal resolution (10 seconds) rainfall measurements for rainfall events lasting {{a few hours to}} proxy time series of temperature for a period over 400 thousand years. The scaling behaviour may reflect a multi-timescale variability of several factors and, thus, can support a more complete physical understanding and uncertainty characterization of hydroclimatic processes. The implications of this behaviour in statistical analyses of hydrometeorological time series is substantial, particularly at large (climatic) time scales, but appear to be not fully understood or recognized as they have been neglected in most climatological studies. To offer insights on these implications, we demonstrate using analytical methods that the characteristics of several temperature <b>proxy</b> <b>series,</b> which appear to exhibit scaling behaviour, imply a dramatic increase of uncertainty in statistical estimation and reduction of significance in statistical testing, in comparison with classical statistics. Therefore, we maintain that statistical analysis in hydroclimatic research should be revisited, in order not to derive misleading results...|$|E
40|$|Reconstructing {{a climate}} process in both {{space and time}} from {{incomplete}} instrumental and climate <b>proxy</b> time <b>series</b> {{is a problem with}} clear societal relevance that poses both scientific and statistical challenges. These challenges, along with the interdisciplinary nature of the reconstruction problem, point to the need for greater cooperation between the earth science and statistics communities – a sentiment echoed in recent parliamentary reports. As a step in this direction, it is prudent to formalize what is meant by the paleoclimate reconstruction problem using the language and tools of modern statistics. This article considers the challenge of inferring, with uncertainties, a climate process through space and time from overlapping instrumental and climate sensitive <b>proxy</b> time <b>series</b> that are assumed to be well dated – an assumption that is likely only reasonable for certain proxies over at most the last few millennia. Within a unifying, hierarchical space–time modeling framework for this problem, the modeling assumptions made by a number of published methods can be understood as special cases, and the distinction between modeling assumptions and analysis or inference choices becomes more transparent. The key aims of this article are to 1) establish a unifying modeling and notational framework for the paleoclimate reconstruction problem that is transparent to both the climate science and statistics communities; 2) describe how currently favored methods fit within this framework; 3) outline and distinguish between scientific and statistical challenges; 4) indicate how recent advances in the statistical modeling of large space–time data sets, as well as advances in statistical computation, can be brought to bear upon the problem; 5) offer, in broad strokes, some suggestions for model construction and how to perform the required statistical inference; and 6) identify issues that are important to both the climate science and applied statistics communities, and encourage greater collaboration between the two...|$|R

However, quantitative analyses of the long-term relationships between climate change and human society have been limited {{by a lack of}} long-term high-resolution data that indicate socioeconomic processes. Here, based on 1, 091 records extracted from 25 books on Chinese history and economic history written by leading contemporary scholars, an economic <b>proxy</b> <b>series</b> for China with decadal resolution is presented that encompasses the period from BC 220 to AD 1910.

The statistical results show that warm and wet periods were associated with above-average economic performance, while cold and dry climatic scenarios greatly increased the possibility of economic crisis. Temperature was more influential than precipitation in explaining the long-term economic fluctuations, whereas precipitation displayed more significant effects on the short-term macro-economic cycle. It is proposed that the climatic effects on agrarian economic development were highly dependent on the social vulnerability, which is determined by particular social, economic and political backgrounds.

Since data on both the price and quantity of alcohol are unavailable during the Prohibition period, {{it is not possible}} to estimate Prohibition's impact on either the supply or demand for alcohol. Assuming the existence of a reasonable proxy for alcohol consumption, however, it is possible to estimate the net impact of Prohibition on the equilibrium quantity of alcohol consumed. I estimate this effect under a range of assumptions about the nature of preferences, taking into account other possible determinants of alcohol consumption and the <b>proxy</b> <b>series.</b> The overall conclusion of the paper is that Prohibition exerted a modest and possibly even a positive effect on alcohol consumption. One possible interpretation of the results is that the demand for alcohol is relatively inelastic, although many earlier studies find substantial elasticity in the demand for alcohol. Another possible interpretation is that Prohibition created a forbidden fruit effect that increased preferences for alcohol, tending to offset the depressing effects of increased prices on demand. Still a third possibility is that Prohibition failed to raise alcohol prices substantially, perhaps because black markets suppliers face low marginal costs of evading government regulations and taxes. Existing data provide some support for this last possibility. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{large-scale}} palaeoclimate reconstructions of past temperature {{have been}} essentially biased to the extratropics owing to {{a paucity of}} proxy data in tropical regions. Herein we describe the first coral-based reconstruction of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) {{for the whole of}} the tropics (30 °N– 30 °S). It was developed from 14 disparate coral records located in the Indian and Pacific oceans. Over the most replicated period, the reconstruction explains 57 % of the tropical SST variance. However, the strength of this signal weakens markedly as the number of coral records decreases. The reconstruction is robust between 1850 and 1993, but some fidelity is indicated back as far as the mid 18 th century. These results suggest that ambiguities in the low frequency domain of δ 18 O measurements can be partially overcome by pooling together multiple time series from different locations around the tropics. Agreement with simulations from two general circulation models indicates that the late 20 th century is likely the warmest period in the tropics for the last 250 years, and that this recent warming can only be explained by anthropogenic forcing. The high frequency variability is dominated by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. The reconstruction, owing to the small number of coral records, is unfortunately restricted both in time and space. Therefore we hope that this study will spur the palaeoclimate community to develop new and longer <b>proxy</b> <b>series</b> to improve the current meager data-base of temperature sensitive series in the tropics...|$|E

A wet condition prevailed over most of China during 1741 - 1770, a 30 -yr warm peak that occurred during the Little Ice Age (about 1650 - 1850). The spatial pattern of the precipitation anomaly in 1981 - 2000 over East China (25 degrees- 40 degrees N, east of 105 degrees E) is roughly consistent with that in 1231 - 1260, but a difference in the precipitation anomaly appeared over the Tibetan Plateau. The spatial {{patterns of}} the precipitation anomalies over China varied between all five 30 -yr warm periods, which implies that the matching pattern between temperature and precipitation change is multiform, and the precipitation anomaly could be positive or negative when a decadal warm climate occurs in different climate epochs.

The observed amount of warming is greater than the observed change in regional temperature over the same time period by roughly a factor of two.

Global average air temperatures have recently warmed beyond their natural limits in historic atmospheric records (IPCC 2007). However, the expected response of temperature of oceans and other water bodies is less clear. Water temperatures of large natural systems may respond to the atmospheric warming trend in unexpected ways, due t...|$|R
40|$|A {{statistical}} {{framework for}} evaluation of climate model simulations by comparison with climate observations from instrumental and proxy data (part 1 in this series) is improved by the relaxation of two assumptions. This allows autocorrelation in the statistical model for simulated internal climate variability and enables direct comparison of two alternative forced simulations to test whether one fits the observations significantly better than the other. The extended framework is applied {{to a set of}} simulations driven with forcings for the pre-industrial period 1000 – 1849 CE and 15 tree-ring-based temperature <b>proxy</b> <b>series.</b> Simulations run with only one external forcing (land use, volcanic, small-amplitude solar, or large-amplitude solar) do not significantly capture the variability in the tree-ring data – although the simulation with volcanic forcing does so for some experiment settings. When all forcings are combined (using either the small- or large-amplitude solar forcing), including also orbital, greenhouse-gas and non-volcanic aerosol forcing, and additionally used to produce small simulation ensembles starting from slightly different initial ocean conditions, the resulting simulations are highly capable of capturing some observed variability. Nevertheless, for some choices in the experiment design, they are not significantly closer to the observations than when unforced simulations are used, due to highly variable results between regions. It is also not possible to tell whether the small-amplitude or large-amplitude solar forcing causes the multiple-forcing simulations to be closer to the reconstructed temperature variability. Proxy data from more regions and of more types, or representing larger regions and complementary seasons, are apparently needed for more conclusive results from model–data comparisons in the last millennium...|$|E
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the climatic history {{during the past several}} hundred years requires a sufficient geographical coverage of combined climate <b>proxy</b> <b>series.</b> Especially in order to identify causal connections between the atmosphere and the ocean, inclusion of marine records into composite climate time series is of fundamental importance. We present two skeletal delta 18 O chronologies of coral skeletons of Diploria labyrinthiformis from Bermuda fore-reef sites covering periods in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and compare them with instrumental temperature data. Both time series are demonstrated to display sea-surface temperature (SST) variability on inter-annual to decadal time scales. On the basis of a specific modern delta 18 O vs instrumental SST calibration we reconstruct a time series of SST anomalies between AD 1350 and 1630 covering periods during the Little Ice Age. The application of the coral delta 18 O vs temperature relationship leads to estimates of past SST variability which are comparable to the magnitude of modern variations. Parallel to delta 18 O chronologies we present time series of skeletal bulk density. Coral delta 18 O and skeletal density reveal a strong similarity during Little Ice Age, confirming the reliability of both proxy climate indicators. The past coral records, presented in this study, share features with a previously published climate proxy record from Bermuda and a composite time series of reconstructed Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures. The coral proxy data presented here represent a valuable contribution to elucidate northern Atlantic subtropical climate variation during the past several centuries...|$|E
40|$|Trend {{describes}} time-dependence in {{the first}} moment of a stochastic process, and correlation measures the linear relation between two random variables. Accurately estimating the trend and correlation, including uncertainties, from climate time series data in the uni- and bivariate domain, respectively, allows first-order insights into the geophysical process that generated the data. Timescale errors, ubiquitious in paleoclimatology, where archives are sampled for proxy measurements and dated, poses a problem to the estimation. Statistical science and the various applied research fields, including geophysics, have almost completely ignored this problem due to its theoretical almost-intractability. However, computational adaptations or replacements of traditional error formulas have become technically feasible. This contribution gives a short overview of such an adaptation package, bootstrap resampling combined with parametric timescale simulation. We study linear regression, parametric change-point models and nonparametric smoothing for trend estimation. We introduce pairwise-moving block bootstrap resampling for correlation estimation. Both methods share robustness against autocorrelation and non-Gaussian distributional shape. We shortly touch computing-intensive calibration of bootstrap confidence intervals and consider options to parallelize the related computer code. Following examples serve not only to illustrate the methods but tell own climate stories: (1) the search for climate drivers of the Agulhas Current on recent timescales, (2) the comparison of three stalagmite-based <b>proxy</b> <b>series</b> of regional, western German climate over the later part of the Holocene, and (3) trends and transitions in benthic oxygen isotope time series from the Cenozoic.

40|$|International audienceReproducible climate reconstructions of the Common Era (1 CE to present) {{are key to}} placing industrial-era warming {{into the}} context of natural climatic variability. Here we present a community-sourced {{database}} of temperature-sensitive proxy records from the PAGES 2 k initiative. The database gathers 692 records from 648 locations, including all continental regions and major ocean basins. The records are from trees, ice, sediment, corals, speleothems, documentary evidence, and other archives. They range in length from 50 to 2000 years, with a median of 547 years, while temporal resolution ranges from biweekly to centennial. Nearly half of the <b>proxy</b> time <b>series</b> are significantly correlated with HadCRUT 4. 2 surface temperature over the period 1850 – 2014. Global temperature composites show a remarkable degree of coherence between high- and low-resolution archives, with broadly similar patterns across archive types, terrestrial versus marine locations, and screening criteria. The database is suited to investigations of global and regional temperature variability over the Common Era, and is shared in the Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format, including serializations in Matlab, R and Python...|$|R
40|$|Using six {{long-term}} temperature <b>proxy</b> data <b>series</b> {{derived from}} different natural evidences, including pollens and lake-sediments, we reconstructed a temperature series with a 100 -year time resolution {{for the past}} 5000 yr in the Hetao region and its surrounding areas. The resulting series suggests that, on a millennial timescale, temperatures in the region were higher than the mean value of the whole series during the 5000 ~ 2600 yr before present (yr BP) period, and became relatively low comparing with the average temperature of the whole series after 2600 yr BP. Within these two periods, temperature fluctuations comprising numerous short, multi-centennial intervals also existed. A comparison between our reconstructed series and other series in China and across the Northern Hemisphere indicate that, on a long-term scale, cold–warm variations had been in phase across the whole hemisphere during the past 5000 yr; on the century to multi-century scale, {{the beginning and the}} ending times varied from region to region, thus implying that climate changes did not occur simultaneously in different regions...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-three {{published}} <b>proxy</b> temperature <b>series</b> over China {{spanning the}} last 2000 years {{were selected for}} an uncertainty analysis in five climate regions. Results indicated that, although large uncertainties are found for the period prior to the 16 th century, high level of consistency were identified in all regions during the recent 500 -years, highlighted by the two cold periods 1620 s- 1710 s and 1800 s- 1860 s, and the warming during the 20 th century. The latter started in Tibet, Northwest and Northeast, and migrated to Central East and Southeast. The analysis also indicates that the warming during the 10 - 14 th centuries in some regions might be comparable in magnitude to the warming {{of the last few}} decades of the 20 th century which was unprecedented within the past 500 years.
