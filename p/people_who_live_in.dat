5|$|<b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> {{large cities}} {{have a higher}} rate of COPD {{compared}} to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> rural areas. While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in exacerbations, its overall role as a cause of COPD is unclear. Areas with poor outdoor air quality, including that from exhaust gas, generally have higher rates of COPD. The overall effect in relation to smoking, however, is believed to be small.|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> urban areas have access to parks and gardens in their areas, which are probably the only connections they have with nature.

5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> oppressive regimes {{are forced to}} make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: {{to have a life}} of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E

5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore. Encantados {{are said to be}} fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E
