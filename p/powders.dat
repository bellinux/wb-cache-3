40|$|The {{demand on}} <b>powder</b> {{metallurgical}} steel is increasing {{due to their}} excellent mechanical properties, to obtain these properties the metal <b>powder</b> fractions need to be evenly distributed through out the body. This report presents Uddeholms AB:s high alloyed and nitrided tool steel <b>powder</b> STEEL-X’s <b>powder</b> fraction distribution through out the process and recommendations how to improve the <b>powder</b> fraction distribution in the future. From the manufacturing of <b>powder</b> to the point when the <b>powder</b> is to be HIPed, the <b>powder</b> undergoes several handling steps (including, inter alia, <b>powder</b> vessel change, nitriding process and transportation), which promotes {{a change in the}} <b>powder</b> fraction distribution. This change in <b>powder</b> fraction distribution is called segregation. There are different types of segregation, for example the most common type; sieving segregation. Sieving segregation can occur when the bulk is subjected to for example vibrations (e. g. transportation). To investigate how the <b>powder</b> fraction distribution changes, <b>powder</b> samples have been taken, with two different sampling probes, from the bulk in its container. The samples have been analyzed by sieving, and the results have been plotted in histograms. To investigate how the <b>powder</b> acts during filling and discharge, experiments on small replicas of the <b>powder</b> vessels have been performed and a novel filling technique have been performed. Experiments with small scale mixers have been performed to investigate if a <b>powder</b> mixer can improve the <b>powder</b> fraction distribution, varying the parameters speed and time in order. The results show that there is a variation in the <b>powder</b> fraction distribution, mainly in the smaller fractions, in the <b>powder</b> vessels. The variation in the vessels also differentiate depending on which sampling probe that have been used. Furthermore, the <b>powder</b> fraction distribution is good in the <b>powder</b> vessels. The <b>powder</b> filling experiments showed that the current filling technique is destructive for the <b>powder</b> fraction distribution, whilst the novel filling technique shows promising results with regard to minimizing segregation during filling. If the right mixing parameters are used, mixing showed to {{have a positive effect on}} the <b>powder</b> fraction distribution. However, gas bubbling may be sufficient to obtain a good <b>powder</b> fraction distribution, but more research needs to be performed. To acquire an ideal <b>powder</b> fraction distribution in a HIP-capsule more research needs to be made, especially about the filling process. To really obtain a statistical foundation how the <b>powder</b> fraction distributes in the bulk, samples from several different places needs to be taken.
