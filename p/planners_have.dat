5|$|After Desert Storm, {{the army}} {{struggled}} with military operations other than war, such as peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. The school and its graduates examined the situations in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. Graduates {{also participated in}} Defense Support of Civil authorities missions. The course continued {{to change in the}} 1990s. Under Colonel Gregory Fontenot, the school moved from Fort Leavenworth's Flint Hall to Eisenhower Hall in October 1994. In later years, the school's leadership expanded the number of seminars and the civilian faculty. The military continues to draw heavily on SAMS in the twenty-first century. SAMS <b>planners</b> <b>have</b> {{played a significant role in}} the Global War on Terror. Beginning in 2002, the United States Central Command requested planners from SAMS and its sister schools, the United States Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), which was designed to be similar to SAMS, and the United States Marine Corps's School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW). SAMS students from the 2002 and 2003 classes participated as planners in the preparations for the invasion of Iraq and the plan for the post-combat occupation.|$|E

25|$|The recent {{renovation}} of the Renaissance Center, and related construction of a state-of-the-art cruise ship dock, new stadiums, and a new RiverWalk, have stimulated related private economic development. Nearby Windsor has a 19-year-old drinking age with a myriad of entertainment to complement Detroit's Greektown district.

25|$|Lexical {{modernization}} {{has also}} been critical {{to the development of}} Quechua. Language <b>planners</b> <b>have</b> attempted to create new Quechua words primarily through Quechua morphemes, which are combined in new ways to give new meanings. In general, loanwords from other languages are considered only when there are no possibilities to develop the word through existing Quechua structures. If loanwords are adopted into the language, linguists attempt to phonologically adapt the word to match typical Quechua pronunciation norms.|$|E

25|$|The parkway {{continues}} {{to provide access}} to several state parks, including one named for Roosevelt. It has also become an important regional artery, one of the primary routes to northern New England and upstate New York from New York City and Long Island. The southern sections, particularly in Westchester County, have become a commuter route into the city for residents who moved into towns that became suburbanized {{as a result of the}} parkway. The state and regional transportation <b>planners</b> <b>have</b> worked to adapt to this change since the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|In {{establishing}} a writing {{system for a}} language, corpus <b>planners</b> <b>have</b> the option of using an existing system or creating a new one. The Ainu of Japan chose to adopt the Japanese languageâ€™s katakana syllabary as the writing system for the Ainu language. Katakana is designed for a language with a basic CV syllable structure, but Ainu contains many CVC syllables that cannot easily be adapted to this syllabary. As a result, Ainu uses a modified katakana system, in which syllable-final codas are consonants by a subscript version of a katakana symbol that begins with the desired consonant.|$|E
25|$|The grid's {{inherent}} {{high street}} and intersection frequencies produce {{large areas of}} impermeable surfaces in the street pavement and the sidewalks. In comparison to recent networks with discontinuous street types, grids can be up to 30% higher in impermeable surfaces attributable to roads. The emerging environmental priority of retaining as much as 90% of rain water on site becomes problematic with high percentages of impermeable surfaces. And since roads constitute the largest share of the total impermeable surfaces of a development, the difficulty {{is compounded by the}} grid type of layout. For these reasons modern <b>planners</b> <b>have</b> attempted to modify the rigid, uniform, classic grid.|$|E

500|$|Prior to European settlement, the {{watershed}} was heavily forested {{and was used}} by Native Americans of the Chinook band for fishing and hunting. In the 19thcentury, white settlers cleared much of the land for farming, and the stream is named {{for one of these}} newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 built a water-powered sawmill along the creek. By the early 20thcentury, a rail line parallel to the stream encouraged further residential and commercial development. As urban density increased in the floodplain, seasonal floods grew more damaging. In the 1930s the Works Progress Administration of the federal government lined the lower [...] of Johnson Creek with rock to control the floods. Despite this, the creek flooded 37times between 1941 and 2006. Since the 1990s, regional <b>planners</b> <b>have</b> tried to reduce flooding by controlling stormwater runoff, creating stream meanders, reducing erosion, replacing impervious surfaces, and protecting riparian buffers.|$|E

2500|$|Historically the [...] United States of America {{has been}} defined by racially {{segregated}} neighborhoods. [...] Urban Planning up to the 1960s has been documented {{as one of the}} causes of this phenomenon. Urban <b>planners</b> <b>have</b> been seen to have practiced early forms of racial steering. [...] Through the use of the restrictive covenant, and the establishment of zoning laws between World War I and World War II, and the use of urban renewal between the 1940s and 1960s, urban <b>planners</b> <b>have</b> aided in the development of racially segregated neighborhoods. [...] After the 1960s, through in part by the Civil Rights Movement, planning efforts were focused more towards advocacy, and community development, rather than maintaining segregation.

2500|$|On 4 April 2012, Reuters {{reported}} that a senior Israeli official, during a briefing to {{a small group of}} journalists on condition of anonymity, predicted an increased interception range of up to 250km, as well as more flexible aiming of Iron Dome units, thus lowering the number of batteries needed for full deployment in Israel.

2500|$|Increased {{recognition}} of urban stream syndrome in the 1960s resulted in some movement towards holistic stormwater management in Australia. Awareness increased greatly during the 1990s with the Federal government and scientists cooperating through the Cooperative Research Centre program. Increasingly city <b>planners</b> <b>have</b> recognised {{the need for}} an integrated management approach to potable, waste and stormwater management, to enable cities to adapt and become resilient to the pressure which [...] population growth, urban densification and climate change places on ageing and increasingly expensive water infrastructure. Additionally, Australia's arid conditions means it is [...] particularly vulnerable to climate change, which together with its reliance on surface water sources, combined {{with one of the most}} severe droughts (from 2000â€“2010) since European settlement, [...] highlight the fact that major urban centres face increasing water shortages. This has begun shifting the perception of stormwater runoff from strictly a liability and nuisance to that of having value as a water resource resulting in changing stormwater management practices.|$|E
