40|$|The {{recurrent}} nova T Pyx {{was observed}} with the X-ray gratings of Chandra and XMM-Newton, 210 and 235 days, respectively, after {{the discovery of}} the 2011 April 14 outburst. The X-ray spectra show prominent emission lines of C, N, and O, with broadening corresponding to a full width at half maximum of ~ 2000 - 3000 km/s, and line ratios consistent with high-density plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium. On day 210 we also measured soft X-ray continuum emission that appears to be consistent with a white dwarf (WD) atmosphere at a temperature ~ 420, 000 K, partially obscured by anisotropic, optically thick ejecta. The X-ray continuum emission is modulated with the photometric and spectroscopic period observed in quiescence. The continuum at day 235 indicated a WD atmosphere at a consistent effective temperature of 25 days earlier, but with a lower flux. The effective temperature indicates a mass of ~ 1 solar mass. The conclusion of <b>partial</b> WD <b>obscuration</b> is supported by the complex geometry of non-spherically-symmetric ejecta confirmed in recent optical spectra obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in November and December of 2012.

40|$|Helicopter {{brownout}} is {{a phenomenon}} that occurs when making landing approaches in dusty environments, whereby sand or dust particles become {{swept up in the}} rotor outwash. Brownout is characterized by <b>partial</b> or total <b>obscuration</b> of the terrain, which degrades visual cues necessary for hovering and safe landing. Furthermore, the motion of the dust cloud produced during brownout can lead to the pilot experiencing motion cue anomalies such as vection illusions. In this context, the stability and guidance control functions can be intermittently or continuously degraded, potentially leading to undetected surface hazards and obstacles as well as unnoticed drift. Safe and controlled landing in brownout can be achieved using an integrated presentation of LADAR and RADAR imagery and aircraft state symbology. However, though detected by the LADAR and displayed on the sensor image, small obstacles can be difficult to discern from the background so that changes in obstacle elevation may go unnoticed. Moreover, pilot workload associated with tracking the displayed symbology is often so high that the pilot cannot give sufficient attention to the LADAR/RADAR image.

50|$|The {{detection}} of intruders using video surveillance has limitations based on economics {{and the nature}} of video cameras. Typically, cameras outdoors are set to a wide angle view and yet look out over a long distance. Frame rate per second and dynamic range to handle brightly lit areas and dimly lit ones further challenge the camera to actually be adequate to see a moving human intruder. At night, even in illuminated outdoor areas, a moving subject does not gather enough light per frame per second and so, unless quite close to the camera, will appear as a thin wisp or barely discernible ghost or completely invisible. Conditions of glare, <b>partial</b> <b>obscuration,</b> rain, snow, fog, and darkness all compound the problem. Even when a human is directed to look at the actual location on a monitor of a subject in these conditions, the subject will usually not be detected. The A.I. is able to impartially look at the entire image and all cameras' images simultaneously. Using statistical models of degrees of deviation from its learned pattern of what constitutes the human form it will detect an intruder with high reliability and a low false alert rate even in adverse conditions. Its learning is based on approximately a quarter million images of humans in various positions, angles, postures, and so forth.|$|E

Here we show that <b>partial</b> <b>obscuration</b> of the BLR by outflowing, compact, dusty clumps produces asymmetries and velocity-dependent lags similar to those observed. Our model explains previously inexplicable changes in the ratios of the hydrogen lines with time and velocity, the lack of correlation of changes in line profiles with variability of the central engine, the velocity dependence of lags, and the change of lags with time. We propose that changes on timescales longer than the light-crossing time do not come from dynamical changes in the BLR, but are a natural result of the effect of outflowing dusty clumps driven by radiation pressure acting on the dust. The effects of this dust complicate the study of the structure and kinematics of the BLR and the search for sub-parsec SMBH binaries. <b>Partial</b> <b>obscuration</b> of the accretion disc can also explain the puzzling flux gradients implied by microlensing.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of a system to accurately determine {{the speed of a}} projectile (bullet) by measuring the time of flight between two parallel laser screens is described. Each screen is formed by a laser source and a set of prisms. At the detection end of each of the screens, a collector lens focuses the incident laser light beam onto a photodetector. The collector lens and detector are kept in a recess so that no stray or ambient light falls on the photodetector. Whenever a projectile crosses either of the screens, the corresponding photodetector senses the event, due to <b>partial</b> or full <b>obscuration</b> of the incident energy. An electronic circuit is used to accurately record the time when the projectile crosses each screen, and the time interval gives the time of flight. The distance between the screens being known, the velocity is displayed on a computer screen. Because a single collimated beam of light generates the entire optical curtain, the reduction in incident energy at the photodetector plane is independent of the entry point of the projectile into the screen.

40|$|Abstract. The {{interaction}} of Na atoms with a surface was probed by inserting a nanofabricated material grating into one arm of an atom interferometer (IFM). This technique permits a direct {{measurement of the}} change in phase and coherence of matter waves as they pass within 25 nm of the grating bar surface. The practical concerns and challenges of making such a measurement are discussed here. Interference of spurious diffraction orders, IFM path overlap, and the <b>partial</b> <b>obscuration</b> of IFM beams are all important aspects of this experiment. The systematic effects that contribute to the measured phase shift and contrast are discussed. Atomic diffraction from material grating structures [1] {{has been used as a}} tool to measure atom-surface interactions for noble gases [2] and alkali atoms [3, 4]. In these experiments the van der Waals (vdW) interaction [5] changed the relative intensities of the diffraction orders. More recently the atom wave phase shift Φ 0 induced by these grating structures 1 was measured directly using a sodium atom beam interferometer (IFM) [6]. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. An interaction grating (IG), comprised of an array of 50 nm wide channels, is inserted into one arm of the IFM. The vdW interaction between the sodium atoms and IG causes a phase shift of about Φ 0 ∼ 0. 3 radians. A number of systematic effects need to be understood before reporting this phase shift induced by the vdW interaction. This paper describes how the measured phase shift and contrast in [6] are influenced by these systematic effects and suggests some physical mechanisms for them. In general there is a non-trivial relationship between the measured phase shift Φmeas and induced phase shift Φ 0, when the IFM paths are partially obscured by a phase shifting element. Therefore, care should be taken when interpreting the phase shift data. This notion of <b>partial</b> <b>obscuration</b> is shown in Fig. 2, which illustrates how the interference pattern can have different phases in different regions of space.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the X-ray {{spectral}} properties of the highly variable X-ray emitting black hole in a globular cluster in the elliptical galaxy NGC 4472. The XMM-Newton spectrum of the source in its bright epoch is well described by a multiple blackbody model with a characteristic temperature kT_in≈ 0. 2 keV. The spectrum of an archival Chandra observation of the source obtained 3. 5 years before the XMM data gives similar estimates for the blackbody parameters. We confirm that the fainter interval of the XMM-Newton observation has a spectrum that is consistent with the brighter epoch, except for an additional level of foreground absorption. We also consider other possible mechanisms for the variability. Based on the timescale of the X-ray flux decline and the estimated size of the X-ray emission region we argue that an eclipsing companion is highly unlikely.

Many intensity dips were detected in the X-ray light curves. We found that the dips fell into two distinct categories based on their spectral properties. One type exhibits strong energy-dependent attenuation of X-ray emission at low energies during a dip, which is characteristic of photoelectric absorption, but the other type shows nearly energy-independent attenuation. While the first type of dips are likely caused by density enhancement in an inhomogeneous wind of the companion star, as previous studies have indicated, the second type might be due to <b>partial</b> <b>obscuration</b> of an extended X-ray emitting region by optically thick "clumps" in the accretion flow. It is also possible that the latter are caused by a momentary decrease in the X-ray luminosity of the source, due, for instance, to a decrease in the mass accretion rate, or by Thomson scattering in highly ionized "clumps".

The X-ray spectra obtained by XMM-Newton and Swift show moderate absorption with a column density around 3 x 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2, consistent with a dust-reddening interpretation of the steep Balmer decrement seen in recent optical spectra. The X-ray flux in the 0. 5 to 2 keV band during the XMM-Newton observation in 2005 and Swift observation in 2006 was a factor 6 brighter {{than that of the}} ROSAT All Sky Survey in 1991. In the past 4 years, the broad Hα line brightened by a factor of 4 accompanied by a decrease in the Balmer decrement. A comparison with literature spectra reveals variations in the dust extinction on time scales of several years, suggesting that the obscuring material is very close to the active nucleus.

We detect polarization modulations across strong lines in all four objects, demonstrating that all are intrinsically polarized. However, the nature and degree of the polarization varies considerably.

We focus on two main subjects of large-scale structure: precisioncosmology with baryon acoustic oscillations from large galaxy surveys {{and the evolution}} of galaxy clustering for passively flowing galaxies. The baryon acoustic oscillations in galaxy redshift surveys can serve as an efficient standard ruler to measure the cosmological distance scale, i. e., theangular diameter distances and Hubble parameters, as a function of redshift, and therefore dark energy parameters. We use a Fisher matrix formalism to show that such a standard ruler tests can constrain the angular diameter distances and Hubble parameters to a precision of a few percent, thereby providing robust measurements of present-day dark energy density and its time-dependence. We use N-body simulations to investigate possible systematic errors in the recovery of the cosmological distance scale from galaxy redshift surveys. We show that the baryon signature on linear and quasi-linear scales is robust against nonlinear growth, redshift distortions, and halo (or galaxy) bias, albeit <b>partial</b> <b>obscuration</b> of the signature occurs due to nonlinear growth and redshift distortions. We present the improved Fisher matrix formalism which incorporates the Lagrangian displacement field to describe the nonlinear effects on baryon signature as a function of time and scale.

We show that distance precision from the revised formalism is in excellent agreement with distance precision from N-body simulations. Finally, we present a numerical study of the evolution of galaxy clustering when galaxies flow passively from high redshift to low redshift, that is, without merging or new formations. We show that passive flow evolution induces interesting characteristics in the galaxy distribution at low redshift: we find an asymptotic convergence in galaxy clustering and halo occupation distribution regardless of the initial distribution of galaxies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The ACS MAMA detector, {{also known}} as the Solar Blind Channel (SBC) is {{currently}} HST’s principal detector in the far UV. Since the loss of STIS, more attention is now being paid to SBC calibration. New dark images have been supplied and the flat fields formerly measured on the ground have been refined. The prism modes have also been recently calibrated and an improved distortion correction is being prepared. 1. Description The ACS Solar Blind Channel (SBC) is a spare STIS MAMA operating in the far-UV from 1150 to 1700 ˚A. It contains a CsI photocathode deposited directly on a curved microchannel plate. Electrons generated by photons striking the photocathode enter the microchannel plate which sends an amplified electron cloud onto a multi-anode plate configured so that the incident position can be decoded. The SBC has high resolution (pixel size of 0. 03 arcsec) and sensitivity plus extremely low dark current (∼ < 10 − 5 counts per pixel). The performance and principal calibrations were reported at the HST Calibration Workshop in 2002 (Tran et al.). Here we describe what changes have been made or are planned. 2. Flat Field The flat-field image illustrates various features of the SBC. The general ribbed pattern of the anodes and the hexagonal bunching of the micro-channels can be seen. Although disconcerting in this strongly stretched image, the effects of these features are eliminated by the pipeline flat-field processing. Slightly more troublesome are the non-functioning rows due to a broken anode and the <b>partial</b> <b>obscuration</b> of several columns by the repeller wire. Because of the missing rows, we have recently (November 2004) moved the target reference point from the central row 512 to row 400 so as to reduce the likelihood of a target landing on the unresponsive region. The SBC flats, originally developed from ground-based measurements, have been recently revisited and refined incorporating in-flight data. ...|$|E

A higher signal-to-noise ratio XMM-Newton observation reported here reveals a more complex spectrum, being extremely hard above ~ 2 keV, Γ ~ − 0. 6, with a well-defined soft excess similar to the bright, nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 3. Such extremely hard quasar spectra cannot be a dominant contributor to the cosmic X-ray background (CXRB; Γ ~ 1. 4). Modeling of 2 M 1049 + 5837 shows the observed 2 - 10 keV spectrum to be the sum of a strongly absorbed "normal" Γ ~ 1. 8 underlying quasar X-ray continuum, and a cold reflection component (R ~ 2). The strong attenuation of the intrinsic X-ray continuum by a sub-Compton-thick line-of-sight column, NH ~ 3. 4 × 10 [Superscript: 23] cm[Superscript: − 2], reveals a soft X-ray emission component whose spectrum indicates reprocessing/emission from, possibly extended, photoionized gas. The luminosity of the soft X-ray component is similar to Seyfert 2 galaxies, {{an order of magnitude}} less than comparable type 1 AGNs, suggesting <b>partial</b> <b>obscuration</b> of core-bright emission. The optical emission is complex, with distinct red and blue scattered light components believed to originate in two extended regions visible in HST imaging data. The unusual combination of properties: optical and X-ray obscuration of the nuclear emission, partially obscured broad but unobscured narrow emission lines, and partially obscured soft X-ray excess, implies an intermediate viewing angle, over or through the edge of an obscuring disk + wind or torus. 2 M 1049 + 5837 again demonstrates both the ambiguity of low signal-to-noise X-ray spectra/hardness ratios and the potential of 2 MASS-selected red sources for exploring the complex obscuration and geometry of the nuclear regions in AGNs.

The UV(IUE) spectrum of IRAS 12584 - 4837 (Hen 3 - 847) shows several emission lines including that of HeII.

Here we present the first high angular resolution images of phi Persei {{made possible by}} new capabilities in longbaseline interferometry at near-IR and visible wavelengths. We observed phi Persei with the MIRC and VEGA instruments of the CHARA Array. Additional MIRC-only observations were performed to track the orbital motion of the companion, and these were fit together with new and existing radial velocity measurements of both stars to derive the complete orbital elements and distance. The hot subdwarf companion is clearly detected in the near-IR data at each epoch of observation with a flux contribution of 1. 5 % in the H band, and restricted fits indicate that its flux contribution rises to 3. 3 % in the visible. A new binary orbital solution is determined by combining the astrometric and radial velocity measurements. The derived stellar masses are 9. 6 +- 0. 3 Msol and 1. 2 +- 0. 2 Msol for the Be primary and subdwarf secondary, respectively. The inferred distance (186 +- 3 pc), kinematical properties, and evolutionary state are consistent with membership of phi Persei in the alpha Per cluster. From the cluster age we deduce significant constraints on the initial masses and evolutionary mass transfer processes that transformed the phi Persei binary system. The interferometric data place strong constraints on the Be disk elongation, orientation, and kinematics, and the disk angular momentum vector is coaligned with and has {{the same sense of}} rotation as the orbital angular momentum vector.

The sample contains 33 high ionization galaxies (HIGs) and 18 broad line objects (BLOs). According to the UM, HIGs, the narrow line sources, are the nuclearly obscured counterparts of BLOs. The fraction of HIGs indicates a covering factor of the circumnuclear matter of 65 % that corresponds, adopting a torus geometry, to an opening angle of 50 ° ± 5. No dependence on redshift and luminosity on the torus opening angle emerges. We also consider the implications for a "clumpy" torus. The distributions of total radio luminosity of HIGs and BLOs are not statistically distinguishable, as expected from the UM. Conversely, BLOs have a radio core dominance, R, more than ten times larger with respect to HIGs, as expected in case of Doppler boosting when the jets in BLOs are preferentially oriented closer {{to the line of}} sight than in HIGs. Modeling the R distributions leads to an estimate of the jet bulk Lorentz factor of Γ ~ 3 - 5. The test of the UM based on the radio source size is not conclusive due to the limited number of objects and because the size distribution is dominated by the intrinsic scatter rather than by projection effects. The [O II] line luminosities in HIGs and BLOs are similar but the [O III] and [O I] lines are higher in BLOs by a factor of ~ 2. We ascribe this effect to the presence of a line emitting region located within the walls of the obscuring torus, visible in BLOs but obscured in HIGs, with a density higher than the [O II] critical density. We find evidence that BLOs have broader [O I] and [O III] lines than HIGs of similar [O II] width, as expected in the presence of high density gas in the proximity of the central black hole. In conclusion, the radio and narrow line region (NLR) properties of HIGs and BLOs are consistent with the UM predictions when the <b>partial</b> <b>obscuration</b> of the NLR is taken into account. We also explored the radio properties of 21 3 CR low ionization galaxies with a FR II radio morphology at z < 0. 3. We find evidence that they cannot be part of the model that unifies HIGs and BLOs, but they are instead intrinsically different source, still reproduced by a randomly oriented population...|$|E
40|$|A {{thermal model}} {{that can be}} easily adapted to craters of {{arbitrary}} shape is developed and applied to high-latitude impact craters on Mercury and the Moon, Chao Meng Fu crater at - 87. 5 deg L on Mercury, an unnamed bowl-shaped crater at 86. 7 deg L on Mercury, and Peary crater at 88. 6 deg L on the Moon. For an assumed input topography and grid of surface elements, the model computes for each element the irradiation from direct insolation and reflected and emitted radiation from other elements, taking into account shadowing by walls of the crater, <b>partial</b> <b>obscuration</b> of the solar disk near the poles and the diurnal, orbital, and seasonal cycles. Temperatures are computed over the surface grid as functions of depth and time from the surface to a specified depth and over the pertinent astronomical cycles, including the effects of direct and indirect surface irradiation, infrared radiation, heat conduction, and interior heating. Vapor fluxes and ice recession times are computed as functions of ice depth over the surface grid. Temperatures profiles, vapor fluxes, and ice recession times were computed for flat surfaces not associated with craters near the poles of Mercury and the Moon. It was found that water ice could have existed throughout geologic time within the maximum radar detection depth of recent observation of Mercury (J. K. Harmon and M. A. Slade, 1992, Science 258, 640 - 643) poleward of approximately 87 - 88 deg L on Mercury and poleward of approximately 73 deg L on the Moon. For Chao Meng Fu crater it was found that approximately 40 % of the crater floor is permanently shadowed from direct solar insolation, while the remainder of the crater floor is periodically illuminated by a partially obscured Sun. Temperatures at the upper levels of the south wall can slightly exceed 550 K. Surface temperatures in the permanently shadowed region of the crater floor are under approximately 130 K, which could have allowed water ice to exist throughout geologic time within the radar detection depth of recent observation of Mercury. For small bowl-shaped crater on Mercury, it was found that most of the crater is permanently shadowed from direct solar radiation, except for a narrow semicircular band bordering the north rim. However, temperatures in the permanently shadowed region periodically reach a maximum near approximately 315 K due to efficient heating of the small crater by thermal emission and reflection from the small sunlit region, which periodically reaches temperatures exceeding 630 K. Water ice could not have existed throughout geologic time anywhere in this crater within the radar detection depth. For Peary crater on the Moon, the entire crater floor is permanently shadowed from direct solar insolation with maximum temperature under 120 K. The upper level of the north wall periodically reaches a maximum temperature near 310 K. The low temperatures on the crater floor would have allowed water ice to exist near the surface throughout geologic time, provided that the Moon's obliquity was always as low as it is at present...|$|E
