5|$|Bach {{used the}} tune as a cantus firmus, <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> trumpet, in an aria of his cantata Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 (1714).

5|$|John Rice, a boy actor {{with the}} King's Men, {{may have played}} Lady Macbeth in a {{performance}} of what was likely Shakespeare's tragedy at the Globe Theatre on 20 April 1611. The performance was witnessed and described by Simon Forman in his manuscript The Book of Plays and Notes thereof per Formans for Common Policy. His account, however, does not establish whether the play was Shakespeare's Macbeth or a work on the same subject by another dramatist. The role may have been beyond the talents of a boy actor {{and may have been}} <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> man in early performances.|$|E
5|$|Lux Radio Theatre (CBS, June 1940). Introduced and {{produced}} by Cecil B. DeMille, it featured Irene Dunne, Allan Jones, and Charles Winninger, {{all of whom}} were in the 1936 film version. In this condensed version some songs from the show were sung, but Julie was <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> non-singing Gloria Holden. This version made the biracial Julie a single woman. Only a few lines of Ol' Man River were heard, sung by a chorus. While supposedly based on the 1936 film, this production used the ending of the original show, which the film did not use.|$|E
5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive more information about the setting and more direction from the GMs than players do. In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E

5|$|The {{analogy of}} a game was first {{proposed}} by Hans-Georg Gadamer {{in an attempt to}} demonstrate the epistemic unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> greater being. Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; Christianity teaches this to be the divine word which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} game <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> San Marino team was a 4–0 defeat in a European Championships qualifier by Switzerland in 1990.

Since making their competitive bow, San Marino have competed in qualifying for every European Championships and World Cup, but have never won a match in either competition. They have only ever won one game, beating Liechtenstein 1–0 in a friendly match on 28 April 2004.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} cast comprised former West End standby Nikki Davis-Jones as Elphaba, {{with former}} ensemble {{member of the}} West End production, Emily Tierney, as Glinda. Alongside them were Liam Doyle as Fiyero, Marilyn Cutts as Madame Morrible, Carina Gillespie as Nessarose and George Ure, who was reprising his role as Boq from the West End production. For the first time, the roles of The Wizard and Doctor Dillamond were <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single actor, Dale Rapley. At the time, the only other actor to play both roles in a single performance was London's David Stoller in November 2008, but this was only due {{to the absence of}} several actors.|$|E
5|$|After Archer {{recklessly}} foils an Irish terrorist's {{attempt to}} assassinate a British nobleman, Malory begins {{to suspect that}} Lana's feelings for her son are resurfacing. Hoping to readjust Lana's desires so they are steered towards her current boyfriend, Cyril, she asks Archer to train {{him to be a}} field agent. Archer is wise to their scheme though, and tries to set Cyril up to fail to sabotage his relationship with Lana, Archer's ex. At one point, Cyril inquiries about Archer’s lack of ethics, and ease of deception. To which Archer’s replies “lying is, like, 95% of what I do.” One of his sessions involves trying to kill an assassin (portrayed by Archer's butler, Woodhouse) and using a dance partner (<b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> prostitute Archer has befriended) as a human shield. During the session, however, Cyril accidentally poisons the prostitute and both he and Archer pronounce her deceased.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year of}} success, the Devils were in {{the middle}} of the pack for most of the 1995–96 season and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team's 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> goalie, while having the 2nd-most shutouts (6) in the league. He was named the starter in the All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference and stopped all 12 shots he faced. He {{finished}} fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy, which is awarded to the league's top goaltender. Brodeur also played on Team Canada during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal finals.|$|E

5|$|Another {{knee injury}} ended his 2008–09 season after 75 games {{and left him}} {{unavailable}} for the playoffs. He expressed his frustrations with coach Mike Keenan, who was fired by the team after failing to advance past {{the first round of}} the playoffs, criticizing Keenan's lack of structure and expressing optimism for the team's chances under a new coach. After failing to score a goal in 2008–09 and the first half of the 2009–10 season, Regehr scored his first goal in 141 games on January 18, 2010, against the San Jose Sharks. He finished with 2 goals and 17 points that season and matched those totals in 2010–11. Upon playing his 804th game late in the season, Regehr surpassed Al MacInnis as the team's all-time leader in games <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> defenceman.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} Comic Book Guy {{to publish}} a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic book he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. After a month, Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{tried to}} {{convince}} Sean Connery to return as James Bond, but he declined. At the same time United Artists approached both Batman actor Adam West and Burt Reynolds. Reynolds told the studios that Bond should be played by an Englishman and turned the offer down. Among the actors to test for the part of Bond were Julian Glover, John Gavin, Jeremy Brett, Simon Oates, John Ronane, and William Gaunt. The main frontrunner for the role was Michael Billington. United Artists was still pushing to cast an American to play Bond but producer Albert R. Broccoli insisted that the part should be <b>played</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> British actor and put forward Roger Moore. After Moore was chosen, Billington remained {{on the top of}} the list in the event that Moore would decline to come back for the next film. Billington ultimately played a brief role in the pre-credit sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Moore, who had been considered by the producers before both Dr. No and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was ultimately cast. He tried not to imitate either Connery's or his own prior performance as Simon Templar in The Saint, and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted approach to Bond.|$|E
