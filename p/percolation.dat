5|$|Arnold's Marsh and {{the other}} lagoons nearest the beach are salty due to the <b>percolation</b> of {{seawater}} through the shingle bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, the mysid shrimps Paramysis nouveli and Neomysis integer, lagoon cockle, the bug Orthotylus rubidus and spire snail. Little whirlpool ramshorn snail {{has been found in}} a freshwater channel. Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow pogonus, Bembidion ephippium and Tachys scutellaris.

5|$|Rocks {{and land}} {{at the foot of}} these {{mountains}} is calcarenite, a coral sand, blown inland during the Pleistocene between 130,000 and 20,000 years ago and cemented into stratified layers by water <b>percolation.</b> In this rock are fossils of bird bones and eggs, land and marine snails and the extinct endemic horned turtle (Meiolania platyceps) now thought to be an ancient relictual non-swimming tortoise with relatives in South America. The crescent of the island protects a coral reef and lagoon, the barrier reef, at 31° S, is the most southerly in the world. Beach sands, rather than consisting of quartz grains derived from granite, as on the mainland, are made of fragments of shell, coral and coralline algae, together with basalt grains, and basaltic minerals like black diopside, and green olivine. The lowland consists of alluvial soils.|$|E
25|$|The random {{nature of}} {{unstructured}} sensors networks has motivated {{the use of}} stochastic geometry methods. For example, the tools of continuous <b>percolation</b> theory and coverage processes {{have been used to}} study the coverage and connectivity. One model that is used to study to these networks and wireless networks in general is the Poisson-Boolean model, which is a type of coverage process from continuum <b>percolation</b> theory.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this semi-classical idea, many {{numerical}} computations were done based on the <b>percolation</b> picture. On top of the classical <b>percolation</b> phase transition, quantum tunneling was included in computer simulations to calculate the critical exponent of the `semi-classical <b>percolation</b> phase transition'. To compare this result with the measured critical exponent, the Fermi-liquid approximation was used, where the Coulomb interactions between electrons are assumed to be finite. Under this assumption, the ground state of the free electron gas can be adiabatically transformed into the ground state of the interacting system and this gives rise to an inelastic scattering length so that the canonical correlation length exponent can be compared to the measured critical exponent.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that the Lower Colima extends for approximately 230km2 and that the Upper Colima spreads over approximately 170km2. The Upper Colima aquifer is recharged from the Barva and La Libertad aquifers by vertical <b>percolation.</b> The Upper Colima also receives a large part of its recharge from rain infiltration in those areas where there are no overlying smaller aquifers. The Lower Colima is recharged from the Upper Colima by vertical <b>percolation</b> and from surface water where the Upper Colima is absent.|$|E

25|$|Random fractals – use {{stochastic}} rules; e.g., Lévy flight, <b>percolation</b> clusters, self avoiding walks, fractal landscapes, {{trajectories of}} Brownian motion and the Brownian tree (i.e., dendritic fractals generated by modeling diffusion-limited aggregation or reaction-limited aggregation clusters).|$|E
25|$|Mulholland ordered {{exploratory}} {{tunnels and}} shafts excavated {{into the red}} conglomerate hillside to determine its characteristics. He also had water <b>percolation</b> tests performed. The results convinced him that the hill would make a satisfactory abutment for a dam should the need ever arise.|$|E
25|$|A slew of {{centrality}} measures {{exist to}} determine the ‘importance’ of a single node in a complex network. However, these measures quantify {{the importance of a}} node in purely topological terms, and the value of the node does not depend on the ‘state’ of the node in any way. It remains constant regardless of network dynamics. This is true even for the weighted betweenness measures. However, a node may very well be centrally located in terms of betweenness centrality or another centrality measure, but may not be ‘centrally’ located {{in the context of a}} network in which there is <b>percolation.</b> <b>Percolation</b> of a ‘contagion’ occurs in complex networks in a number of scenarios. For example, viral or bacterial infection can spread over social networks of people, known as contact networks. The spread of disease can also be considered at a higher level of abstraction, by contemplating a network of towns or population centres, connected by road, rail or air links. Computer viruses can spread over computer networks. Rumours or news about business offers and deals can also spread via social networks of people. In all of these scenarios, a ‘contagion’ spreads over the links of a complex network, altering the ‘states’ of the nodes as it spreads, either recoverably or otherwise. For example, in an epidemiological scenario, individuals go from ‘susceptible’ to ‘infected’ state as the infection spreads. The states the individual nodes can take in the above examples could be binary (such as received/not received a piece of news), discrete (susceptible/infected/recovered), or even continuous (such as the proportion of infected people in a town), as the contagion spreads. The common feature in all these scenarios is that the spread of contagion results in the change of node states in networks. <b>Percolation</b> centrality (PC) was proposed with this in mind, which specifically measures the importance of nodes in terms of aiding the <b>percolation</b> through the network. This measure was proposed by Piraveenan et al.|$|E
25|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the 21st century a number of new network technologies have arisen including mobile ad hoc networks and sensor networks. Stochastic geometry and <b>percolation</b> techniques have been used to develop models for these networks. The increases in user traffic has resulted in stochastic geometry being applied to cellular networks.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Percolation</b> Centrality {{is defined}} {{for a given}} node, at a given time, as the {{proportion}} of ‘percolated paths’ that go through that node. A ‘percolated path’ is a shortest path between a pair of nodes, where the source node is percolated (e.g., infected). The target node can be percolated or non-percolated, or in a partially percolated state.|$|E
25|$|The method uses {{seasonal}} {{water balance}} components as input data. These {{are related to}} the surface hydrology (like rainfall, evaporation, irrigation, use of drain and well water for irrigation, runoff), and the aquifer hydrology (like upward seepage, natural drainage, pumping from wells). The other water balance components (like downward <b>percolation,</b> upward capillary rise, subsurface drainage) are given as output.|$|E
25|$|Later in {{the early}} 2000s {{researchers}} started examining {{the properties of the}} regions under SINR coverage in the framework of stochastic geometry and, in particular, coverage processes. Connectivity in terms of the SINR was studied using techniques from continuum <b>percolation</b> theory. More specifically, the early results of Gilbert were generalized to the setting of the SINR case.|$|E
25|$|Under certain conditions, {{the height}} of the water table {{influences}} the water balance components. For example a rise of the water table towards the soil surface may lead to an increase of evaporation, surface runoff, and subsurface drainage, or a decrease of <b>percolation</b> losses from canals. This, in turn, leads to a change of the water balance, which again influences {{the height of}} the water table, etc.|$|E

25|$|But, at {{the quantum}} phase transition, the {{localization}} lengths of the electrons becomes infinite (i.e. they delocalize) and this compromises the Fermi-liquid assumption of an inherently free electron gas (where individual electrons must be well-distinguished). The quantum Hall transition will therefore {{not be in}} the Fermi-liquid universality class, but in the F-invariant' universality class that has a different value for the critical exponent. The semi-classical <b>percolation</b> picture of the quantum Hall transition is therefore outdated (although still widely used) and we need to understand the delocalization mechanism as an instanton effect.|$|E
25|$|The virgin forests cooled {{the land}} and streams, and centuries of {{accumulated}} organic matter in the forest soil caused slow <b>percolation</b> of rainfall into the creeks and runs so that they flowed more evenly year-round.

25|$|Surface mining may impair {{groundwater}} {{in numerous}} ways: by drainage of usable water from shallow aquifers; lowering of water levels in adjacent areas {{and changes in}} flow direction within aquifers; contamination of usable aquifers below mining operations due to infiltration (<b>percolation)</b> of poor-quality mine water; and increased infiltration of precipitation on spoil piles. Where coal or carbonaceous shale is present, increased infiltration may result in: increased runoff of poor-quality water and erosion from spoil piles, recharge of poor-quality water to shallow groundwater aquifers and poor-quality water flow to nearby streams.|$|E
25|$|This <b>percolation</b> of {{architectural}} style was {{not confined to}} private houses, but to civic architecture too: an illustrious architect added to civic pride; and when an architect was too expensive for the civic coffers, {{for a fraction of}} the price he would judge a competition between local architects, for the privilege of designing a town hall or church. This is exactly what happened in Aylesbury. John Vanbrugh judged two sets of plans for the County Hall (now Aylesbury Crown Court). Thus for ever Vanbrugh's name was remembered in association with the building, the local architect almost forgotten, and civic pride maintained.|$|E
25|$|Milpitas {{occasionally}} experiences odorous air traveling downwind from bay salt marshes, {{from the}} Newby Island landfill, from the anaerobic digestion facility at Zero Waste Energy Development Company, {{and from the}} San Jose sewage treatment plant's <b>percolation</b> ponds. Most malodorous during the autumn, it is especially pungent west of Interstate 880 because of its close location to the San Francisco Bay and {{the direction of the}} prevailing winds out of the north-northwest. The City of Milpitas would like to remedy this air quality problem to the extent it can and encourages its residents to file odor complaints.|$|E
25|$|The Orange County Sanitation and Orange County Water Districts are {{planning}} for treated wastewater, currently discharged into the ocean, to undergo microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultraviolet disinfection. The purified water will be equivalent in quality to distilled water and exceed all {{state and federal}} drinking water standards. The purified water will be pumped to spreading ponds near the Santa Ana River for <b>percolation</b> into the groundwater basin, with some injected through injection wells along the coast {{as a barrier to}} seawater intrusion. Like the WRD projects in Southern California, the Orange County Water District has amassed a long record of successfully recycling water with its Water Factory 21.|$|E
25|$|Simple {{programs}} {{are capable of}} a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be universal computers. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as thermodynamic behavior, continuum behavior, conserved quantities, <b>percolation,</b> sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and others. They {{have been used as}} models of traffic, material fracture, crystal growth, biological growth, and various sociological, geological, and ecological phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall complexity. A New Kind of Science argues that this is evidence that simple {{programs are}} enough to capture the essence of almost any complex system.|$|E
25|$|One major {{drawback}} of the Levins {{model is}} that it is deterministic, whereas the fundamental metapopulation processes are stochastic. Metapopulations are particularly useful when discussing species in disturbed habitats, and the viability of their populations, i.e., how likely they are to become extinct in a given time interval. The Levins model cannot address this issue. A simple way to extend the Levins' model to incorporate space and stochastic considerations is by using the contact process. Simple modifications to this model can also incorporate for patch dynamics. At a given <b>percolation</b> threshold, habitat fragmentation effects take place in these configurations predicting more drastic extinction thresholds.|$|E

25|$|Not all of {{the water}} removed from the river by the swallow holes is {{returned}} to the channel at Leatherhead. The chalk aquifer also feeds the springs {{at the southern end}} of Fetcham Mill Pond, which have never been known to run dry. A survey in March 1883 estimated that the Fetcham springs were producing about 3.6 million gallons of water (16,000 m3) every day. A second survey in 1948 estimated that the same springs were yielding about 5 million gallons of water (22,000 m3) a day. The water table in the chalk of the Wey Gap is significantly higher than might be expected from natural rainwater <b>percolation</b> alone. It has been suggested that a proportion of the excess water originates from the Mole Gap.|$|E
25|$|The {{consensus}} {{of most of}} the investigating commissions was that the initial break took place at or near the fault line, which had been a problem area since water first covered the area, on the western abutment. The prevailing thought was that increasing water <b>percolation</b> through the fault line had either undermined or weakened the foundation to a point that a portion of the structure blew out or the dam collapsed from its own immense weight. This agreement among them was also due, in conjunction, with a chart which was made by the automatic water level recorder located on the dam’s center section. This chart clearly showed that there had been no significant change in the reservoir level until forty minutes before the dam’s failure when, during that forty minutes, a small though gradually increasing amount of loss was recorded.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{ecosystems}} need groundwater, of course. Some terrestrial ecosystems – for example, {{those of}} the open deserts and similar arid environments – exist on irregular rainfall and the moisture it delivers to the soil, supplemented by moisture in the air. While there are other terrestrial ecosystems in more hospitable environments where groundwater plays no central role, groundwater is in fact fundamental {{to many of the}} world’s major ecosystems. Water flows between groundwaters and surface waters. Most rivers, lakes, and wetlands are fed by, and (at other places or times) feed groundwater, to varying degrees. Groundwater feeds soil moisture through <b>percolation,</b> and many terrestrial vegetation communities depend directly on either groundwater or the percolated soil moisture above the aquifer for at least part of each year. Hyporheic zones (the mixing zone of streamwater and groundwater) and riparian zones are examples of ecotones largely or totally dependent on groundwater.|$|E

Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground includes are: snow height, snow water equivalent, snow strength, and extent of snow cover.

500|$|In {{addition}} to being a primary factor {{in the development of the}} largest valleys, the dike complex plays another important role that of creating and maintaining the water table. Hawaiian lava is extremely permeable and porous. Rainwater easily seeps into the lava, creating a large lens of fresh water below the island surface. In most places, the top of the water table is just a few feet from sea level, as the fresh water lens is floating on salt water. Unlike porous lava flows, however, dikes cool underground into dense rock with few cracks and vesicles. The dikes act as impermeable vertical walls through which groundwater cannot flow. Deep layers of ash compact into impermeable layers between lava flows, preventing <b>percolation</b> of the rainwater. Rainwater that would ordinarily seep right through the ground gets trapped in the dike [...] "reservoirs," [...] located well above sea level. The groundwater is confined to a flow along the dike until it finds a means to escape.|$|E
