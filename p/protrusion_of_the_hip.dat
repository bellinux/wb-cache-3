40|$|The {{proximal}} femoral nail (PFN) is {{a recently}} introduced intramedullary system, {{designed to improve}} treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures of the hip. In a multicentre prospective clinical study, the intra-operative use, complications and outcome of treatment using the PFN (n = 211) were compared with those using the gamma nail (GN) (n = 213). The intra-operative blood loss was lower with the PFN (220 ml v 287 ml, p = 0. 001). Post-operatively, more lateral <b>protrusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> screws of the PFN (7. 6 %) was documented, compared with the gamma nail (1. 6 %, p = 0. 02). Most local complications were related to suboptimal reduction of the fracture and/or positioning of the implant. Functional outcome and consolidation were equal for both implants. Generally, the results of treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures were comparable for the PFN and GN. The pitfalls and complications were similar, and mainly surgeon- or fracture-related, rather than implant-related...|$|E
50|$|There {{is great}} {{difficulty}} in preventing <b>the</b> flexion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trunk heel strike so the person may use trunk extension before heel strike to maintain balance causing a backwards lurch. The trunk lurches {{back on the}} stance phase side hyperextending.The backwards trunk lurch persists throughout the stance to maintain the gravitational force line behind <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> axis locking <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> into extension. There is an apparent forward <b>protrusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected <b>hip</b> due to exaggerated <b>hip</b> motion and <b>the</b> person may also hold the shoulders backward to keep <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> gravity behind <b>the</b> joint.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{outcome of}} {{revision}} {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) for intra-pelvic cup protrusion is unclear. Hence, we conducted a large retrospective study to clarify <b>the</b> surgical strategy (<b>hip</b> lever arm and cup mechanical fixation) and <b>the</b> outcomes <b>of</b> reconstruction for severe intra-pelvic cup protrusion. HypothesisWe hypothesized that restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anatomic <b>hip</b> centre in such acetabular revisions decreased <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> recurrent loosening. Material and methodsThe study included 246 THA procedures (in 220 patients), with a follow-up of 5. 2 ± 4. 9 years (1 – 24. 2) after the index surgery. Bone loss was estimated using the SOFCOT classification (grade III or IV in 80 % <b>of</b> cases) and <b>the</b> Paprosky classification (IIIA or IIIB in 58 % of cases). Quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reconstruction was assessed on X-rays according to <b>the</b> correction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protrusion</b> and position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> centre <b>of</b> rotation. ResultsAfter a clinical follow-up of at least 5 years, {{with a mean of}} 9. 9 ± 4. 1 years (5 – 24 years), the mean Postel-Merle d’Aubigné score was 14. 2 ± 3. 1 and <b>the</b> mean Harris <b>Hip</b> Score was 78. 0 ± 18. 7. Cup protrusion was partially or completely corrected in every case and cup position was normal in 27 (11 %) cases. <b>The</b> centre <b>of</b> rotation was within 10 mm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physiological position in 158 (64. 2 %) cases, acceptable in 77 (31. 3 %) cases, ascended in 9 (3. 7 %) cases, and worsened in 1 (0. 4 %) case. Revision for cup or cup and femoral failures was required in 24 (9. 8 %) cases. Cumulative survival rates with cup loosening as the endpoint were 88. 5 % after 5 years, 79. 9 % after 10 years, and 63. 9 % at last follow-up at 13. 6 years. DiscussionOur hypothesis that restoration of anatomic <b>hip</b> centre decreased <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> recurrent loosening was not verified: success or failure in restoring <b>the</b> normal centre <b>of</b> rotation did not correlate significantly with final cup status. Recurrent aseptic loosening was <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> failure in 9. 8 % of cases. Ensuring long-term effective mechanical stability had a greater impact on global outcomes than restoring an ideal centre of rotation. Level of evidenceIV, retrospective study...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Among extraosseous {{abnormalities}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{vertebral artery}} (VA) at the craniovertebral junction (CVJ), available evidence regarding "posterolateral protrusion," the VA running {{distant from the}} groove over <b>the</b> superior surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atlas, is limited. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} determine the optimal measurement to indicate posterolateral <b>protrusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VA. Materials and Methods: Computed tomography angiography (CTA) images of 40 consecutive patients with cervical disease were reviewed. Ultimately, 66 arteries were included in this study. Five parameters predicted to indicate posterolateral <b>protrusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VA were defined (A-E) and measured by two surgeons twice over a 2 -week interval. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to examine intra-observer reproducibility and inter-observer reliability. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the most optimal parameter to predict posterolateral <b>protrusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VA. Results: Excellent inter-observer reliability and intra-observer reproducibility were obtained for all parameters (ICC = 0. 87 - 0. 99). Among them, parameter A, defined as the maximal length from <b>the</b> outer surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VA to <b>the</b> outer surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atlas, was most accurately described posterolateral <b>protrusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VA. The optimal cut-off value of parameter A obtained with ROC curves was 8. 3 mm (sensitivity 97. 5 %, specificity 100 %). Conclusions: The measurement in this study can quantitatively evaluate <b>the</b> posterolateral <b>protrusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VA. Before posterior surgery at the CVJ, pre-operative CTA can help surgeons detect anomalous VA and reduce <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> intra-operative VA injury...|$|R
