5000|$|Mair {{suggests}} that {{perhaps there is}} something inherent in Buddhism that is conducive to its being written {{in what he calls}} “vernacular Sinitic” as opposed to the “literary Sinitic” used for native Chinese texts. One aspect of Buddhism that Mair cites is the notion of upaya, known as fang-pien in Chinese; followers of the Buddha should do whatever is in their <b>power</b> <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> the salvation of all living things.(713) This would certainly help explain why Buddhist texts would be printed and circulated in a written language that is more accessible to a wider audience. Another point Mair makes is that lecture notes for sermons by laymen and monks were written in the vernacular language. [...] This makes sense considering that these notes were to be spoken from; one would not make notes for a sermon in a stilted and highly literary language. Other Buddhist texts such as parables were popular with the masses and so when written, the vernacular is the clear choice.|$|R

Whitfield was Co-Founder of the United States Turkish Caucus in the United States Congress. Recognizing the important role Turkey plays as the only Muslim Nation in NATO and having had many conversations with commanding generals of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Whitfield thought it was important to form a Congressional entity to provide support for Turkey in its role as a NATO Member.|$|E
5000|$|After {{finishing}} his {{tour of duty}} with the Air Force in the Netherlands, Heilman returned to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. To support his family, he took part-time jobs working as an emergency room physician. Medrad Inc was incorporated in February, 1964. The name Medrad is an acronym for medical research and development. Medrad rented space in the Saint John's Health and Emergency Center, located in Pittsburgh's North Hills. Heilman, Rudy Kranys, and a few consultants began developing Medrad's first product, a flow controlled angiographic injector. The [...] "better mousetrap' injector had two important innovations. The first was to measure the flow rate of the injected contrast media, and adjust, in real time, the injector's <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> that the actual injection flow rate was as desired. Image quality was optimized when the proper concentration of contrast medium was reached in the blood stream. The other innovation was to use special transparent syringe reinforcing jackets to enable disposable syringes to withstand injection pressures as high as 1,000 PSI. The ability to use disposable syringes prevented blood borne infection transmission from patient to patient. In Medrad's first six years, there were financial losses but expenses were kept to a minimum. In addition to part-time emergency room employment, Heilman worked {{as a consultant to}} the Westinghouse Electric Corporation on a National Institutes of Health funded effort to develop an intra-aortic balloon heart assist device.|$|E

Compared with conventional power generations, wind power is fluctuating, intermittent, and of low energy density. For the grid integrating with large-scale wind farms, wind power fluctuations will lead to upset the equilibrium of power supply and demand, and even endanger {{the safety of the}} grid. The curtailment of wind <b>power</b> is implemented <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> <b>power</b> system safety, which decreases the utilization rate of wind power [3]. If wind power can be forecasted accurately, the adverse impacts of wind power fluctuations can be reduced by prearranging a scheduling plan.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{adaptive}} modulation technique for simultaneous voice and data transmission over fading channels, and study its performance. The proposed scheme {{takes advantage of}} the time-varying nature of fading to dynamically allocate the transmitted power between the inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) channels. It uses fixed-rate binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation on the Q channel for voice, and variable rate M-ary amplitude modulation (M-AM) on the I channel for data. For favorable channel conditions most of the power is allocated to high rate data transmission on the I channel. The remaining power is used to support the variablepower voice transmission on the Q channel. As the channel degrades the modulation gradually reduces its data throughput and reallocates most of its available <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> a continuous and satisfactory voice transmission. The scheme is intended to provide a high average spectral efficiency for data communications while meeting the stringent delay re [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} focuses upon transatlantic sailors, particularly merchant seamen and pirates, between 1700 and 1750. Early modern seamen {{were among}} the earliest free wage laborers in the international economy, {{and one of the}} first occupations to engage in steady industrial work. Their labor was assembled and enclosed on the ship, a precursor of the factory, where cooperation was organized among workers who owned neither the tools nor the materials of production. Seamen toiled under a shipboard regime armed with violent disciplinary <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> their cooperation. They sold their muscle on a sprawling international market for monetary wage. Much of the world 2 ̆ 7 s population would undergo similar experiences with the Industrial Revolution. ^ Based on some 2, 200 cases heard in Admiralty Courts around the Atlantic as well as many other sources, this study argues that there was a chronic conflict between the needs and imperatives of the international market economy organized by merchant capitalists and those of an international moral economy constructed by common seamen. Since sailoring in the eighteenth century was an inherently life-threatening occupation due to both natural and unnatural hazards, whether accidents, disease, or abusive mistreatment, seamen collectively relied on an ethic of mutuality and a process of negotiation to defend and expand their privileges and rights. In the course of this struggle a specifically maritime occupational consciousness veered in the direction of class consciousness, and seamen began to develop wider patterns of association, sympathy, and identification. The seaman 2 ̆ 7 s world in many ways represented an autonomous, alternative society, a counterculture of sorts, with values distinct and often radically different from those normally associated with the rise of capitalism. This alternative world was instrumental in the formation of a larger working-class culture: seamen not only experienced first the changes occurring in society at large, but were crucial to the growth of plebeian traditions. They used their mobile, pivotal position in the social division of labor to create linkages with an extraordinary assortment of other working people. Seamen were thus central to both the structural and cultural dimensions of capital-labor relations in early modern America and England. ...|$|R
40|$|Cooperation among mobile users (MUs) in a {{wireless}} network {{can be very}} useful to reduce the total radiated <b>power</b> necessary <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> the delivery of the information with the desired quality of service. A systematic framework for achieving such a gain consists in making the cooperating nodes act as the antennas of a virtual transmit array, operating according to a distributed space-time coding (DSTC) strategy. However, cooperation implies the allocation of dedicated resources, typically power and time slots, for the exchange of data between source and intermediate nodes (relays). It is then necessary to design the system properly to make possible a final net gain, taking into account all resources involved in the communication. In this paper, we consider regenerative relays and we analyze the effect of intermediate decision errors at the relay nodes. We derive the optimal maximum-likelihood (NIL) detector, at the final destination, in case of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) transmission, and a suboptimal scalar detector, whose bit-error rate (BER) is expressed in (approximate) closed form. Since with DSTC the transmit antennas are not colocated, we show how <b>to</b> allocate the <b>power</b> among source and relay terminals {{in order to minimize}} the average BER at the final destination. Finally, we compare alternative cooperation and decoding strategies...|$|R
40|$|Hot-electron {{currents}} and degradation in deep submi-crometer MOSFET's at 3. 3 V and below are studied. Using a device with L,,, = 0. 15 pm and T,,, = 7. 5 nm, substrate current is measured at a drain bias {{as low as}} 0. 7 V; gate current is measured at a drain bia 5 as low as 1. 75 V. Using the charge-pumping technique, hot-electron degradation is also observed as drain biases as low as 1. 8 V. These voltages {{are believed to be}} the lowest repnrted values for which hot-electron {{currents and}} degradation have been directly observed. These low-voltage hot-electron phenomena exhibit similar behavior to hot-electron effects present at higher biases and longer channel lengths. No critical voltage for hot-electron effects (such as the Si-Si 02 barrier height) is apparent.
