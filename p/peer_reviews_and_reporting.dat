40|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{existing}} literature on the U.

The traditional self-regulatory system of the accounting profession came to an end, in 2002, when the PCAOB was established to oversee the audit firms of publicly traded companies. This paper contributes to the controversial debate about self-regulation versus independent regulation by analyzing, categorizing, and comparing the research findings on the <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> system <b>and</b> the PCAOB system along three dimensions: the validity of <b>peer</b> <b>reviews</b> <b>and</b> PCAOB inspections, the recognition of <b>reviews</b> <b>and</b> inspections by decision-makers (e. g., investors, bankers, committees), {{and the effect of}} <b>reviews</b> <b>and</b> inspections on audit quality. Synthesizing the research on the regulatory regimes suggests that the notion of external quality control, both through <b>peer</b> <b>reviews</b> <b>and</b> government inspections, is positively linked with an improvement of audit quality. At the same time, the analysis indicates that external users do not seem to recognise <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>and</b> PCAOB <b>reports</b> as very useful instruments for decision-making, which is in line with an identified rather skeptical perception of the audit profession on <b>reviews</b> <b>and</b> inspections. Overall, this study reveals that although the academic literature on <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>and</b> PCAOB inspection is extensive it has not produced definitive conclusions concerning various aspects of audit regulation.

The causative agent, Neisseria meningitidis, is spread through aerosol respiratory droplets. 13 different serogroups have been identified, each with varying epidemiological features including prevalence, virulence, immunogenicity, geographical and temporal distribution. Although preventative measures are available for several of the serogroups, meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B {{is of particular interest}} due to the challenge it presents concerning vaccine development. Methods A systematic <b>review</b> of <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> studies <b>and</b> <b>reports,</b> the collection of data from national and international health resources, along with the analysis of the Multi Locus Sequence Typing database was carried out aimed at collecting information concerning serogroup B IMD and the epidemiology attached to it.

Yet, relatively little is known about the extent of As exposure from drinking water and its related health consequences in these countries. It has been estimated that at least 4. 5 million people in Latin America are chronically exposed to high levels of As (> 50 μg/L), some to as high as 2000 μg/L - 200 times higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) provisional standard for drinking water. We conducted a systematic <b>review</b> of 82 <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> papers <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> to fully explore the current understanding of As exposure and its health effects, as well as the influence of genetic factors that modulate those effects in the populations of Latin America. Despite some methodological limitations, these studies suggested important links between the high levels of chronic As exposure and elevated risks of numerous adverse health outcomes in Latin America - including internal and external cancers, reproductive outcomes, and childhood cognitive function. Several studies demonstrated genetic polymorphisms that influence susceptibility to these and other disease states through their modulation of As metabolism, with As methyltransferase (AS 3 MT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and genes of one-carbon metabolism being specifically implicated. While the full extent and nature of the health burden are yet to be known in Latin America, these studies have significantly enriched knowledge of As toxicity and led to subsequent research. Targeted future studies will not only yield a better understanding of the public health impact of As in Latin America populations, but also allow for effective and timely mitigation efforts. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. After hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT), many patients present genital graft-vs. -host disease (GVHD) that can culminate with sexual problems, which are poorly dimensioned. Aim. We hope {{to draw attention to}} the need to perform genital biopsy to diagnose genital GVHD, and thus to call attention to the need to incorporate careful attention to sexual health in the treatment of these patients. Methods. Five allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients complaining of coital pain after HSCT were clinically diagnosed for genital GVHD. Genital biopsies were given for histological analysis, and microphotographs of the corresponding marked field in the slide were taken. Specimens were evaluated by the site pathologist and then sent to a reference pathologist, each blinded to the histological findings. A literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 - 2009) for cross-sectional and cohort studies or trials related to genital GVHD. Expert opinions <b>peer</b> <b>reviews</b> <b>and</b> case <b>reports</b> were also considered. Main Outcome Measures. HSCT, genital GVHD, genital biopsy. Results. The biopsy showed evidence of dilated apoptotic cells in the basal layer and detachment of the epithelial lining of the mucosa, hyalinization and thickening of collagen fibers, capillary ectasia, and mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate of the submucosa. Three patients presented vulval lesion such as leucoplasia and ulcer on the large lip. Histological analyses showed evidence of epithelial hyperplasia and influx of inflammatory cells to the epithelial surface, intercellular edema and spongiosis, apoptotic bodies on the basal layer of the epithelium, spongiosis, and nuclear vacuolization. A common treatment based on corticotherapy resulted in complete remission of coetaneous or mucous genital lesions in all five patients. Conclusion. Genital biopsy is important to differentially diagnose GVHD and secondary symptoms due to hypoestrogenism.

In addition, clinically reported errors, missed diagnoses discovered outside the routine peer-review process, were identified. Cases were scored from 1 to 5. The department quality office evaluated cases with scores of 3 and 4 from both sources for further processing with FPR, a multistep continuation of the peer-review process using a tracking document. Once initiated, FPR was processed by seeking comments from the division director and the interpreting radiologist. In some cases, FPR was discontinued before completion.

It is clear that chronic cadmium exposure is related with some kinds of liver diseases, both in animals and humans. Although cadmium is classified as a carcinogenic agent, there is insufficient evidence to support that liver cancer is associated with cadmium exposure. Further studies are required to investigate whether chronic low-doses of cadmium exposure could induce liver cancer and other liver diseases. If environmental exposure to cadmium is ultimately found to cause liver diseases, further efforts should be made to reduce it. For example, the government could consider developing regulations for cadmium in agriculture products and tobacco products.

These bodies are part of the scrutiny and accountability framework of the Union. The chapter examines their origins, how their internal structures have evolved, their powers, and their place in the institutional landscape of the Union. Their growing importance arises from the expansion of the EU budget, evidence of mismanagement and fraud against the financial resources of the Union, the emergence of an accountability culture in the EU, and enlargement. Notwithstanding institution-building and a tightening of the regulatory environment, there remains a lack of clarity in roles under shared management practices between the Commission and the member states—especially since the costs of controls principally burden the latter, while effective implementation of reforms is still in question.

40|$|This {{second volume}} {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the direct measurement techniques of evapotranspiration with related applications to the water use optimization in the agricultural practice and to the ecosystems study. The measurements are necessary to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of ET and to refine the modeling tools. Besides the basic concepts, examples of applications of the different measuring techniques at leaf level (porometry), at plant-level (sap-flow, lysimetry) and agro-ecosystem level (Surface Renewal, Eddy Covariance, Multi layer BREB) are illustrated in detail. The agricultural practice requires a careful management of water resources, especially in the areas where water is naturally scarce. The detailed knowledge of the transpiration demands of crops and different cultivars, as well as the testing of new irrigation techniques and schemes, allows the optimization of the water consumptions. Besides some basic concepts, the results of different experimental irrigation techniques in semi-arid areas (e. g. subsurface drip) and optimization of irrigation schemes for different crops in open-field, greenhouse and potted grown plants are presented. Aspects on ET from crops in saline environments are also presented. Finally, effects of ET on groundwater quality in xeric environments as well as the application of ET to climatic classification are presented.

The aim of the present systematic review was to (i) critically review all available evidence on Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as a form of intervention for BD; (ii) discuss clinical implications of MBCT in treating patients with BD; and (iii) provide a direction for future research. The review presents findings from 13 studies (N = 429) that fulfilled the following selection criteria: (i) included BD patients; (ii) presented results separately for BD patients and control groups (where a control group was available); (iii) implemented MBCT intervention; (iv) were published in English; (v) were published in a <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> journal; <b>and</b> (vi) <b>reported</b> results for adult participants. Although derived from {{a relatively small number of}} studies, results from the present review suggest that MBCT is a promising treatment in BD in conjunction with pharmacotherapy. MBCT in BD is associated with improvements in cognitive functioning and emotional regulation, reduction in symptoms of anxiety depression and mania symptoms (when participants had residual manic symptoms prior to MBCT). These, treatment gains were maintained at 12 month follow up when mindfulness was practiced for at least 3 days per week or booster sessions were included. Additionally, the present review outlined some limitations of the current literature on MBCT interventions in BD, including small study sample sizes, lack of active control groups and idiosyncratic modifications to the MBCT intervention across studies.

Pakistan is reported the highest usage of drugs in the world, with atleast 1. 5 million drug addicts in the country. And by 2011, it has reached to 9. 6 million (Qasim, 2012). Drug abuse which used to considered the bane in Pakistan, but now taking toll among Pakistani youth resulting in serious social and mental health problems. Magnitude of the problem Nearly 5 million regular drug users are living in Pakistan. 40 % live in urban areas and 60 % live in rural areas (Mubeen and Sharif, 2007). More than 20 % of the youth ages between 15 to 25 years is the total population and are the most startling consumers of substance abuse in Pakistan (Niaz, 2005). Drug abuse not only increase individual health problems but it also burdens on the entire public health problem such as the spread of Hepatitis B and C, HIV/ADS, tuberculosis and so forth.

Methods Medline, Informit, Infotrac, Blackwells Publishing, Proquest, Taylor and Francis, JStor, and the Indigenous HealthInfoNet were searched using terms: Aborigin* OR Indigen* OR Torres AND health AND service OR program* OR intervention AND Australia to locate publications from 1992 – 2011. The reference lists of 19 reviews were also checked. Data from <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> journals, <b>reports,</b> <b>and</b> websites were included. The 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for proportions that referred to and focussed on transfer were calculated as exact binomial confidence intervals. Test comparisons between proportions were calculated using Fisher's exact test with an alpha level of 5 %. Results Of 1311 publications identified, 119 (9. 1 %; 95 % CI: 7. 6 % - 10. 8 %) referred to the transfer and implementation of Indigenous Australian health services or programs, but only 21 studies (1. 6 %; 95 % CI: 1. 0 % - 2. 4 %) actually focused on transfer and implementation. Of the 119 transfer studies, 37 (31. 1 %; 95 % CI: 22. 9 - 40. 2 %) evaluated the impact of a service or program, 28 (23. 5 %; 95 % CI: 16. 2 % - 32. 2 %) reported only process measures and 54 were descriptive. Of the 37 impact evaluation studies, 28 (75. 7 %; 95 % CI: 58. 8 % - 88. 2 %) appeared in <b>peer</b> <b>reviewed</b> journals but none included experimental designs. Conclusion While services and programs are being transferred and implemented, few studies focus on the process by which this occurred or the effectiveness of the service or program in the new setting. Findings highlight a need for partnerships between researchers and health services to evaluate the transfer and implementation of Indigenous health services and programs using rigorous designs, and publish such efforts in peer-reviewed journals as a quality assurance mechanism. </p...|$|R
