40|$|Currents and {{temperatures}} were measured using Pegasus current profilers across Northwest Providence and Santaren Channels {{and across the}} Florida Current off Cay Sal Bank during four cruises from November 1990 to September 1991. On average, Northwest Providence (1. 2 Sv) and Santaren (1. 8 Sv) contribute about 3 Sv to the total Florida Current transport farther north (e. g., 27 °N). Partitioning of transport into temperature layers shows that about one-half of this transport is of “ 18 °C” water (17 °C– 19. 5 °C); this can account {{for all of the}} “excess” 18 °C water observed in previous experiments. This excess is thought to be injected into the 18 °C layer in its region of formation in the northwestern North Atlantic Ocean. Due to its large thickness, <b>potential</b> <b>vorticities</b> in this layer in its area of formation are very low. In our data, lowest <b>potential</b> <b>vorticities</b> in this layer are found on the northern end of Northwest Providence Channel and are comparable to those observed on {{the eastern side of the}} Florida Current at 27 °N. On average a low-potential-vorticity 18 °C layer was not found in the Florida Current off Cay Sal Bank...|$|R

5000|$|Carl-Gustaf Rossby first {{introduced}} <b>potential</b> <b>vorticity</b> in his 1936 paper [...] "Dynamics of steady ocean currents {{in the light}} of experimental fluid mechanics". This work was based on an analysis of a shallow water model of the Gulf Stream. The concept was developed further, within a few years of Rossby's seminal paper, by Hans Ertel. Mathematically, Ertel's form of <b>potential</b> <b>vorticity</b> is given by the equation:where [...] is the fluid density, [...] is the absolute vorticity and [...] is the gradient of the potential temperature. It can be shown through a combination of the first law of thermodynamics and momentum conservation that <b>potential</b> <b>vorticity</b> can only be changed by diabatic heating (such as latent heat released from condensation) or frictional processes. This conservation is the atmospheric equivalent to angular momentum. A spinning ice skater with her arms spread out laterally can accelerate her rate of spin by contracting her arms. Similarly, when a vortex of air is broad, it is in turn, slow. When the air converges, to maintain <b>potential</b> <b>vorticity,</b> the air speed increases, resulting in a stretched ring vortex. Divergence causes the vortex to spread, slowing down the rate of spin.|$|E
5000|$|Atmospheric Rossby waves {{result from}} the {{conservation}} of <b>potential</b> <b>vorticity</b> and {{are influenced by the}} Coriolis force and pressure gradient. A fluid, on the Earth, that moves toward the pole will deviate toward the east; a fluid moving toward the equator will deviate toward the west (true in either hemisphere). The deviations are caused by the Coriolis force and conservation of <b>potential</b> <b>vorticity</b> which leads to changes of relative vorticity. This is analogous to conservation of angular momentum in mechanics. In planetary atmospheres, including Earth, Rossby waves are due to the variation in the Coriolis effect with latitude. Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby first identified such waves in the Earth's atmosphere in 1939 and went on to explain their motion.|$|E

Comparison of isobaric representations of ABS and POV fields relative to an explosively developing cyclone shows that {{in a number of}} ways the two vorticity fields exhibited similar relationships to the cyclone.

40|$|The {{development}} and motion of fronts associated with lee-side troughs on large mountain barriers has been investigated. These fronts differ from ordinary cold fronts in their horizontal temperature field, which {{is characterized by}} a sinusoidal thermal ridge. The thermal ridge intensifies, while remaining stationary with respect to the mountains, and moves eastward upon the approach of a Pacific cold front. An equation is derived, showing that changes in the thermal pattern can be described by changes in a <b>potential</b> thermal <b>vorticity</b> equation, which consists of three terms: (1) one representing an advection of the <b>potential</b> thermal <b>vorticity</b> by the 500 -mb. wind; (2) one representing the advection of 500 -mb. absolute vorticity by the thermal wind; and (3) a purely orographic term. An idealized sinusoidal model of the thickness pattern is used in conjunction with the prognostic equation to explain the {{development and}} motion of lee-side thermal ridges. Actual examples from synoptic maps are chosen to corroborate the theory. The conclusions are: (1) the thermal ridge will develop when the surface flow is such as to produce large-scale descent on the lee slopes of the mountains; (2) no thermal ridging will appear u-hen the 500 -mb. ridge lies east of the lee slopes; (3) thermal ridging will appear with the approach of a 500 -mb. ridge from the west; and (4) the thermal ridge will move eastward upon the passage of the 500 -mb. ridge. 1...|$|R

We analyze a new {{formulation}} of the Stokes equations in three-dimensional axisymmetric geometries, relying on Fourier expansion {{with respect to the}} angular variable: the problem for each Fourier coefficient is two-dimensional and has six scalar unknowns, corresponding to the vector <b>potential</b> and the <b>vorticity.</b> A spectral discretization is built on this formulation, which leads to an exactly divergence-free discrete velocity.

50|$|Davis and Bosart (2002) considered, {{among other}} things, {{the effects of}} cumulus {{parameterization}} on tropical storm track. They found that changes in <b>potential</b> <b>vorticity</b> at the tropopause can cause changes in the wind field. Specifically, different schemes have different methods of parametrizing the <b>potential</b> <b>vorticity</b> which results in different tracks. They found that the Betts-Miller-Janjic and Grill schemes produced a more westward track than Kain-Fritsch. The Kain-Fritsch scheme tended to intensify the storm too rapidly but produced the best track compared with observations. The simulated tracks of more intense storms tends to be farther to the east compared with weaker storms. Davis and Bosart {{also point out that}} their results differ from previous sensitivity studies on cumulus parameterizations which found that the Betts-Miller-Janjic scheme tended to have better results. They attribute this difference to the differences in grid spacing between the studies.|$|E

The latter transformation is equivalent to interpreting trace species observations within the modified Lagrangian mean (MLM) coordinate system. The {{results show that the}} MLM transformed ozone concentration decreases at about 0. 06 ppmv per day between 20 - and 16 -km altitude inside the polar vortex during the mid-August to mid-September period. These ozone changes are collocated with the region of high ClO concentration. Outside the chemically perturbed region, at the highest aircraft altitudes, ozone concentration systematically increases, suggesting a diabatic cooling of the order 0. 3 - 0. 6 K/day...|$|R

The effects of motion direction of the inserted driven baffle and CNT concentration on {{heat transfer}} and entropy generation are studied. It was observed that for low Rayleigh numbers, the motion of the driven baffle enhances heat transfer regardless of its direction and the CNT concentration effect is negligible. However, with an increasing Rayleigh number, adding driven baffle increases the heat transfer only when it moves {{in the direction of the}} decreasing temperature gradient; elsewhere, convective heat transfer cannot be enhanced due to flow blockage at the corners of the baffle...|$|R

The dual <b>potential</b> equations permit <b>vorticity</b> convection, but not production, and are efficiently solved as an iteratively decoupled set of scalar equations. Zonal results presented for a nonlifting biconvex airfoil on a stretched Cartesian grid show substantial savings in CPU time compared to solving the semi-flux split Euler equations alone.

40|$|A {{theory of}} flame {{propagation}} in curved channels is developed {{within the framework}} of the on-shell description of premixed flames. Employing the Green function appropriate to the given channel geometry, an implicit integral representation for the burnt gas velocity is constructed. It is then used to derive an explicit expression for rotational component of the gas velocity near the flame front by successive separation of irrotational contributions. We prove that this separation can be performed in a way consistent with boundary conditions at the channel walls. As a result, the unknown irrotational component can be projected out by applying a dispersion relation, thus leading to a closed system of equations for the on-shell fresh gas velocity and the flame front position. These equations show that in addition to the usual nonlocality associated with <b>potential</b> flows, <b>vorticity</b> produced by a curved flame leads to specific nonlocal spatial and temporal influence of the channel geometry on the flame evolution. To elucidate this influence, three special cases are considered in more detail [...] steady flame stabilized by incoming flow in a bottle-shaped channel, quasi-steady flame, and unsteady flame with small gas expansion propagating in a channel with slowly varying width. In the latter case, analytical solutions of the derived equations are obtained in the first post-Sivashinsky approximation using the method of pole decomposition. Comment: 22 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|A finite-difference {{method is}} {{presented}} that simulates steady transonic rotational flow of an inviscid fluid by representing the velocity field as {{the sum of}} scalar and vector potentials. This dual potential velocity decomposition extends {{the validity of the}} scalar (full) velocity <b>potential</b> to include <b>vorticity.</b> The inclusion of a vector potential also permits an alternate treatment of lift that does not require a circulation wake cut. This is accomplished by specifying the vector potential as a constant on the airfoil surface in order to satisfy a Kutta condition. The governing equations are solved as iteratively decoupled scalar equations using approximate factorization techniques, and the overall efficiency approaches that of the full potential equation. The governing equations are able to convect entropy and vorticity throughout the flow field and are equivalent to the Euler equations in continuous flow domains, however at shocks the Rankine-Hugoniot entropy jump must be supplied. An entropy correction method is presented and verified with transonic airfoil solutions of the Euler equations...|$|R
