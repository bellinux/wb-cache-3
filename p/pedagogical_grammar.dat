The practical part focuses on the presentations of the Simple past and the Present perfect in textbooks of English for middle schools. It focuses mainly on the types of context they are presented in and also types of exercises intended for practising both tenses.

5000|$|All {{remaining}} contexts can {{be assumed}} to allow liaison optionally, although exhaustive empirical studies are not yet available. Preferences vary widely for individual examples, for individual speakers, and for different speech styles. The realization of optional liaisons is a signal of formal register, and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammars</b> sometimes turn this into a recommendation to produce as many optional liaisons as possible in [...] "careful" [...] speech. The conscious or semi-conscious application of prescriptive rules leads to errors of hypercorrection in formal speech situations (see discussion below).|$|R

40|$|What do {{we mean by}} "grammar"? How do {{we teach}} English grammar today, and why? In this thesis, I deal with diachronic as well as {{synchronic}} aspects, and theoretical as well as practical aspects of {{the teaching and learning}} of English grammar. In the theoretical part of the thesis, I write about various types of grammar: theoretical, functional, and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammars.</b> <b>Pedagogical</b> <b>grammars</b> are grammars adopted for the purpose of teaching (didactics); I try to shed light on the relations between what we traditionally think is <b>grammar</b> and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammars</b> (Chapter 2). From when can we speak of a "method" or "approach" in grammar teaching? The Grammar-Translation Method is my point of departure (implemented from circa 1840). I investigate how and why grammar has been taught the way it has up to the present, and refer to Norwegian syllabuses where appropriate. This diachronic study makes us understand the legacy of current grammar teaching (Chapter 3). My claim is that grammar teaching is to some extent neglected today. To what extent does grammar {{play a role in the}} teaching of English as a foreign language in the General studies' foundation course ("grunnkurs allmennfag") ? I have attempted to answer this question by analyzing the books that are currently most used in the foundation course (Chapter 4), and by interviewing teachers in the foundation course (Chapter 5), with the aim of finding out how grammar is treated and teachers' attitudes to it. As for my main findings, the type of exercises and their quantity vary greatly in the textbooks, most significantly between Passage and Imagine versus Targets and Flying Colours. Furthermore, the treatment of grammar in the textbooks is unsystematic. Workbooks and grammar books are rarely used in current teaching, linguistic competence (in the syllabus from 1994; R 94) is too little emphasized and interpreted differently by the teachers, and the practice of teaching grammar varies, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to a great extent from class to class. Moreover, the most striking finding was the disparities in attitudes and teaching practices between teachers with "hovedfag" and those without. Finally, this thesis is probably the first, if not the first, to bring forth teachers' views on the forthcoming syllabus (in force from January 2006) ...|$|R
50|$|This {{method of}} {{teaching}} {{is divided into}} the descriptive: grammatical analysis, and the prescriptive: the articulation {{of a set of}} rules.

As the rules themselves accumulate, an axiomatic system is formed between the two languages that should then enable a native speaker of the first to learn the second.|$|R
25|$|A {{widely used}} Roman character-based writing {{system is the}} Double Vowel system devised by Charles Fiero. Although there is no {{standard}} orthography, the Double Vowel system is used by many Ojibwe language teachers because of its ease of use. A wide range of materials {{have been published in}} this system, including a grammar, dictionaries, collections of texts, and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammars.</b> In northern Ontario and Manitoba, Ojibwe is most commonly written using the Cree syllabary, a syllabary originally developed by Methodist missionary James Evans around 1840 in order to write Cree. The syllabic system is based in part on Evans' knowledge of Pitman's shorthand and his prior experience developing a distinctive alphabetic writing system for Ojibwe in southern Ontario.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} {{work on the}} Wanano {{language}} was a grammatical outline recorded by a Salesian missionary named Antônio Giacone in 1967 (Stenzel 2004, 14). Since {{then a lot of}} work has been conducted by Nathan and Carolyn Waltz who have worked with the SIL organization in Colombia from 1963 to 1996 (Stenzel 2004, 14). They have published a <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammar</b> (Waltz 1976), papers on the aspects of Wanano phonology (Waltz and Waltz 1967, Waltz 1982, Waltz 2002), a volume containing a study of Wanano kinship terms, a grammatical sketch of the language and a long interlinearized text (Waltz and Waltz 1997) and the grammatical overview of Wanano found in the Caro y Cuervo collection (Waltz and Waltz 2000) (Stenzel 2004, 15).

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} to provide a framework or viewpoint for future studies to be conducted by the same author concerning grammar teaching for Japanese EFL learners at secondary school. Its specific aim is to discuss the requirements to be met by <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammar</b> intended {{for use in the}} EFL classroom at Japanese secondary school. Unlike theoretical grammar, which is intended for researchers on linguistics and whose main purpose is to systematize the regularities observed in the use of a language by its native speakers, <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammar</b> is intended for teachers and learners and is therefore required to take into account factors concerning language acquisition, language use and language contact. Three requirements, each corresponding to the three factors to be covered by <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammar</b> respectively, are presented and discussed in this article. Firstly, <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammar</b> for Japanese EFL learners should be learner-friendly in a sense that it can help the learners to learn English in a more efficient and comfortable way. Secondly, it should be communication-oriented in a sense that it can easily lead the learners to use English effectively in their communication. Thirdly, it should be Japanese-minded in a sense that it is to be based upon the interlingual comparison of conceptual frameworks between English and Japanese. The three requirements are elaborated and illustrated by examples from English and also from Japanese when necessary. The three requirements presented in this article are not intended to compose the different chapters of a thesis on <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammar.</b> Rather, they are expected to function as the guidelines to be followed by Japanese teachers of English in their daily practice of grammar teaching. More detailed discussion is to follow in the future studies conducted under the same title, focusing each time on specific grammatical problems causing special difficulties to Japanese learners...|$|E
5000|$|Grammatical {{descriptions}} of French identify {{three kinds of}} liaison contexts: Those where liaison is mandatory, those where it is impossible, and those where it is optional. <b>Pedagogical</b> <b>grammars</b> naturally emphasize what is mandatory or forbidden, and these two categories tend to be artificially inflated by traditional prescriptive rules. Speakers' natural behavior in spontaneous speech shows that in fact relatively few contexts {{can be said to}} systematically give rise to, or fail to give rise to, liaison. Any discussion of liaison must take both descriptive and prescriptive perspectives into account, because this is an area of French grammar where speakers can consciously control their linguistic behavior out of an awareness of how their speech diverges from what is considered [...] "correct".|$|R

40|$|Despite ‘pendulum swings’ and ‘revolutions’ {{throughout}} the history of language teaching, the association of errors and grammar (of one’s native language or of a second/foreign language) has been a constant concern of language professionals as well as the subject of academic interest in linguistics, second language acquisition and grammaticology. Grammar books are ideally suited to the investigation of how perceptions about errors, along with associated notions such as those of grammaticality, acceptability and correctness, have changed {{throughout the}} centuries. While much academic interest has been devoted to the analysis of English <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammar</b> books (and usage manuals) aimed at native speakers (‘prescriptive’ grammar books and usage manuals, cf. Peters 2006), very little is known about English <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammar</b> books for non-native speakers, particularly those published in the 20 th and 21 st centuries.

5000|$|In {{all of this}} research, he {{illuminated}} the fundamental importance of semantics, {{and its role in}} motivating syntactic and morphological phenomena. His collaboration with Paul Kay and George Lakoff was generalized into the theory of Construction Grammar. This work aimed at developing a complete theory of grammar that would fully acknowledge the role of semantics right from the start, while simultaneously adopting constraint-based formalisms as popular in computer science and natural language processing. This theory built on the notion of construction from traditional and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammars</b> rather than the rule-based formalisms that dominate most of generative grammar. One of Fillmore's most widely noticed works of the time (with Paul Kay and Cathy O'Connor) appeared in 'Language' in 1988 as [...] "Regularity and Idiomaticity in Grammatical Constructions: The Case of Let Alone".

40|$|Form-focused {{instruction}} is usually based on traditional practical/pedagogical grammar descriptions of grammatical features. The comparison of such traditional accounts with cognitive grammar (CG) descriptions seems to favor CG {{as a basis}} of pedagogical rules.

The differences between traditional and CG rules/descriptions are exemplified by juxtaposing the two kinds of principles concerning the use of the present simple and present progressive to refer to situations happening or existing at speech time. The descriptions provided the bases for the instructional treatment in a quasi-experimental study exploring the effectiveness of using CG descriptions of the two tenses, and of their interplay with stative (imperfective) and dynamic (perfective) verbs, and comparing this effectiveness with the value of grammar teaching relying on traditional accounts found in standard <b>pedagogical</b> <b>grammars.</b> The study involved 50 participants divided into three groups, with one of them constituting the control group and the other two being experimental ones.

40|$|Questions {{and answers}} Questions and answers form a {{naturally}} paired class of sentence-types {{in terms of}} their functions in discourse, but from a descriptive (and purely structural) standpoint they show differences that make them hard to integrate into a single presentation. Most significantly, questions can often be readily identified as such by various markers, certainly so in Latin, but more generally in many languages; whereas answers for the most part, again certainly for Latin, but also cross-linguistically, are not a formally distinct sentence-type. 1 That is, for questions one typically finds special morphemes, whether affixes or independent words, 2 which mark different question-types; and many languages, perhaps including Latin, have a special question prosody. However, it is rarely the case that there are overt markers or special intonational contours signaling an answer. 3 To illustrate these points, we give in (1) a typical question and answer pair. (1) Plaut. Aul. 256 : 4 sponden ergo?:: spondeo ‘so do you promise?:: yes, I promise’ 1 This raises the problem of the relation between formal and functional types, which we address below.

The study further covers the extensions of the prototypical concept of spatial motion into reduced motion of instrumental body parts, fictive motion and metaphorical motion.
