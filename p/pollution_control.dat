5|$|In 2001, Ahmedabad {{was ranked}} {{as the most}} {{polluted}} city in India, out of 85 cities, by the Central <b>Pollution</b> <b>Control</b> Board. The Gujarat <b>Pollution</b> <b>Control</b> Board gave auto rickshaw drivers an incentive of 10,000 to convert all 37,733 auto rickshaws in Ahmedabad to cleaner burning compressed natural gas to reduce pollution. As a result, in 2008, Ahmedabad was ranked as 50th most polluted city in India.|$|E
5|$|Air quality {{advisories}} {{were put}} into effect on June 17 as haze and falling ash were visible in Los Angeles County.

5|$|Starting in June 2006, {{petroleum}} refiners {{were required}} by the EPA to begin producing ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel, which has 97% less sulfur than the previous low sulfur diesel fuel. When fuel containing sulfur is burned, sulfur dioxide is produced, a main component of acid rain. ULSD, together with new air <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> technologies required in trucks (starting with model year 2007), will reduce harmful emissions by 90%.|$|E

40|$|Coal-fired {{power plants}} {{influence}} climate via both the emissions of long-lived carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and short-lived ozone and aerosol precursors. For steadily increasing emissions without substantial <b>pollution</b> <b>controls,</b> {{we find that}} the net global mean climate forcing ranges from near zero to a substantial negative value, depending on the magnitude of aerosol indirect effects, due to aerosol masking of the effects of CO 2 . Imposition of <b>pollution</b> <b>controls</b> on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides leads to a rapid realization of the full positive forcing from CO 2 , however. The long-term forcing from stable (constant) emissions is positive regardless of <b>pollution</b> <b>controls,</b> with larger values in the case of pollutant controls. The results imply that historical emissions from coal-fired power plants until ~ 1970, including roughly 1 / 3 of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, likely contributed little net global mean climate forcing during that period. Those emissions likely led to weak cooling at Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and warming in the Southern Hemisphere, however. Subsequent imposition of <b>pollution</b> <b>controls</b> and the switch to low-sulfur coal in some areas kept global SO 2 emissions roughly level from 1970 to 2000. Hence during that period, RF due to emissions during those decades and CO 2 emitted previously was strongly positive and likely contributed to rapid global and regional warming. Most recently, construction of coal-fired power plants in China and India has been increasing rapidly with minimal application of <b>pollution</b> <b>controls.</b> Continuation of high-growth rates for another 30 years would lead to near zero to negative global mean climate forcing in the absence of expanded <b>pollution</b> <b>controls,</b> but severely degraded air quality. However, following the Western pattern of high coal usage followed by imposition of <b>pollution</b> <b>controls</b> could lead to accelerated global warming in the future...|$|R

5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
5|$|Between 1965 and 1967, the Federal Water <b>Pollution</b> <b>Control</b> Administration, the United States Bureau of Mines, the United States Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the United States Geological Survey, and the Pennsylvania Department of Mines and Mineral Industries {{conducted}} a joint {{study on the}} watershed of Black Creek. The {{purpose of the study}} was to deal with water pollution due to acid mine drainage. Geological field work was carried out in the area between October 1965 and December 1965. Core and rock cuttings were done between October 1966 and June 1967. However, this study was ended before all of the necessary scientific investigations were completed.|$|E

40|$|Coal-fired {{power plants}} {{influence}} climate via both the emission of long-lived carbon dioxide (CO 2) and short-lived ozone and aerosol precursors. Using a climate model, we perform {{the first study}} of the spatial and temporal pattern of radiative forcing specifically for coal plant emissions. Without substantial <b>pollution</b> <b>controls,</b> we find that near-term net global mean climate forcing is negative due to the well-known aerosol masking {{of the effects of}} CO 2. Imposition of <b>pollution</b> <b>controls</b> on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides leads to a rapid realization of the full positive forcing from CO 2, however. Long-term global mean forcing from stable (constant) emissions is positive regardless of <b>pollution</b> <b>controls.</b> Emissions from coal-fired power plants until ~ 1970, including roughly 1 / 3 of total anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, likely contributed little net global mean climate forcing during that period though they may have induce weak Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude (NHml) cooling. After that time many areas imposed <b>pollution</b> <b>controls</b> or switched to low-sulfur coal. Hence forcing due to emissions from 1970 to 2000 and CO 2 emitted previously was strongly positive and contributed to rapid global and especially NHml warming. Most recently, new construction in China and India has increased rapidly with minimal application of <b>pollution</b> <b>controls.</b> Continuation of this trend would add negative near-term global mean climate forcing but severely degrade air quality. Conversely, following the Western and Japanese pattern of imposing air quality <b>pollution</b> <b>controls</b> at a later time could accelerate future warming rates, especially at NHmls. More broadly, our results indicate that due to spatial and temporal inhomogenaities in forcing, climate impacts of multi-pollutant emissions can vary strongly from region to region and can include substantial effects on maximum rate-of-change, neither of which are captured by commonly used global metrics. The method we introduce here to estimate regional temperature responses may provide additional insight...|$|R

5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air pollution as a serious health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air <b>pollution</b> <b>control.</b> Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B. Johnson and members of Congress worked to pass federal legislation regulating air pollution in the United States, culminating in the 1967 Air Quality Act and the 1970 Clean Air Act. The 1966 smog is a milestone that has been compared with other pollution events, including {{the health effects of}} pollution from the September 11 attacks and pollution in China.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} meeting, the {{governors}} also discussed {{the possibility of}} new tax incentives to motivate industry to reduce pollution {{and the creation of}} a new interstate compact to set industry standards, which would require adoption by all member states and approval by Congress. Those four states were already members of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls water pollution in the Delaware River. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling enforcement actions against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air <b>Pollution</b> <b>Control</b> Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania to join in the future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.|$|E
